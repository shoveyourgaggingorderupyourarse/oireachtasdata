There is a real sense of fear among residents in the City Quay area in particular.  They are worried about the ongoing street violence that is occurring almost every day.  They are virtually being held hostage.  Last Saturday week, a young 13-year-old was hospitalised after being stabbed.  Thankfully, he will make a full recovery, although I understand it will take a while.  It is amazing that someone has not been killed because when you see the knives and weapons seized by the Garda it seems to only be a matter of time before some child or young person will be killed.  Then there will be a big outcry and we will say that we should have done this or that.  The reality is we need something done now.</p>  <p>  I completely understand that there is no simple or overnight solution and people recognise that.  Gangs of young people are rampaging and cycling through streets like Townsend Street and smashing cars for the sake of it, and because they can.  It is unrelenting and it is unacceptable that residents have to put up with it.  Action is needed.  If these groups of youths were outside the Minister of State's house, my house or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's house, it would not be allowed and it should not be allowed outside the homes of residents in City Quay.  No one should have to put up with this issue.  I accept that the Garda is in a difficult position in that the young people carrying out this street violence are almost all children, which brings challenges.  The Garda needs to be resourced better right across the inner city.  It needs more resources to work with young people and the community section of the Garda needs to be more involved.</p>  <p>  More resources also need to be allocated to community development and youth work groups.  It is hard to imagine, given what is happening in the south and north inner city, that the local Talk about Youth group has no dedicated space to work from.  Talk about Youth does fantastic work with young people in the community yet it has no place to call home and no dedicated space.  It needs a dedicated space in which it can develop its projects and work with young people who are particularly hard to engage with.  There needs to be funding for assertive outreach teams to do work with young people who are resistant to engaging with traditional youth groups.  There are some local children involved in this but the majority come from quite a distance from the city centre.  This 13-year-old came from Dublin 15 to the inner city on a Saturday night.  We are failing as a society and we are failing to work with young people to address the issues.  The Mulvey report allocated funding and resources for the north inner city and that has to be replicated in the south inner city because the north and south inner city are one community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900003#A00600"><p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter on Dublin&rsquo;s inner city and concerns around public safety.  The Minister joins all of the House in condemning all acts of violence, in particular any forms of knife crime, and in wishing the victim of the incident referred to by the Deputy a healthy and speedy recovery.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that an investigation is ongoing at this time and the Deputy will appreciate that neither I nor the Minister for Justice can comment on that case as it is an ongoing and live Garda investigation.  The Minister and I urge anyone who may have witnessed this attack, or who may have any information of potential interest to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to contact the Garda.  Reports can also be made through the Garda confidential line on 1800 666 111.</p>  <p>  The Government is determined to tackle antisocial and violent behaviour and is conscious of the effect it can have on the quality of life for local communities, including in Dublin's inner city.  Both the programme for Government and the justice plan contain a number of commitments in this regard, including the establishment of the expert forum on antisocial behaviour to consider the effectiveness of existing legislation and look at proposals for the way forward.  I have established a subgroup of the antisocial behaviour forum to specifically examine the issue of knife crime in detail.  This subgroup is assessing available evidence to inform legislation and community safety policies, programmes and practices with regard to knife crime.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 was also launched last year with the immediate priority to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening services available through the existing network of 105 youth diversion projects, a number of which are located in Dublin's inner city and a number of which I have visited in recent months.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that policing and crime prevention are not the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice alone.  To achieve better outcomes, supported by a strong inter-agency collaboration and community engagement, three pilot local community safety partnerships have been established, one of which is located in north inner city Dublin.</p> <p>These partnerships will provide a dedicated communication channel for input and the development of local community safety plans to reflect and respond to the self-identified needs of individual communities.  The lessons which are learnt in the north inner city pilot will, of course, be of particular relevance to the future roll-out in the south inner city.  In addition, the Minister will launch the community safety innovation fund in the coming weeks, which will enable local communities to seek funding for innovative projects that will improve community safety in their areas.</p> <p> I am advised by the Garda authorities that Operation Citizen commenced in Dublin city centre on 22 October 2021, focusing on antisocial behaviour, public order and quality-of-life issues, assaults and high-volume crimes, and involves increased visible policing, particularly at key locations.  In addition to Garda resources from the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, north central and south central divisions, Operation Citizen is supported by resources from the wider Dublin region, Garda roads policing units, the Garda national public order unit and Garda operational support units.</p> <p> In January 2022, the Garda authorities launched Operation Saul to further support, enhance and strengthen the strategic and operational objectives of Operation Citizen.  The aim of Operation Saul is to provide a safe environment for commuters utilising public transport services in the DMR.  Garda Operation Soteria is also in place to ensure a reduction of assaults in public, reduce the fear of violence within communities, prioritise assault investigations and focus on problem areas and assault hotspots.  The Minister wants to assure the Deputy that this combination of targeted Garda operations and Government policy measures are having, and will continue to have, a positive impact on community safety.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1555" speakername="Chris Andrews" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900004#B00200"><p>Talk about Youth, which is a fantastic youth project in Pearse Street, has no dedicated space.  The Minister of State said that he visited different youth clubs.  I ask that he also visit the Talk about Youth project and see for himself the great work they do, their lack of resources and their needs, and perhaps work with them to ensure they can have a dedicated space to work with the local community and young people.</p>  <p>  The north and south inner cities are one community.  They need to be treated as one community, they need to be looked at as one community, and they need to be resourced as one community.  I appreciate the measures the Minister of State outlined in his response, but the reality is that there are not enough garda&iacute; on the streets in the inner city to avert the ongoing daily assaults of residences in City Quay.  We can have all these projects and programmes in theory, but in practice, the residents are being held hostage on City Quay, Creighton Street, Townsend Street, Dowling's Court, and Lombard Street.  It is not acceptable.  They need action and more garda&iacute;, and they need it now.  I completely accept that it is not a simple solution.  I proposed a while ago that the bridge should be opened so that it would divert them.  People felt that they had moved to another bridge further down.  That may be the case, but then it may not be the case if the garda&iacute; are proactive and have the resources they badly need.  The Mulvey report outlined that the north inner city should have extra resources.  Equally, the south inner city should have the same resources because they are one community.  The docklands authority, before it became a developers' charter, worked with north and south inner city communities and saw them as one, and that is what the Government needs to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900004#B00300"><p>I again thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter, about which I know he is deeply concerned.  The Minister wants to be clear that the incidences of assault or intimidation are completely unacceptable.  We want people to feel and be safe, whether they live or work in Dublin city centre or want to visit and enjoy our capital city.</p>  <p>  Obviously, the distribution and management of garda&iacute; is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, but as of 31 January 2022, the latest date for which figures are available, 712 Garda members were assigned to the DMR south central division.  This represents an increase of more than 13.5% since December 2015, when 627 Garda members were assigned to the division.</p>  <p>  The unprecedented &euro;2 billion funding allocated for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in budget 2022 reflects the commitment the Government has to increasing the number of garda&iacute; throughout the country, including increasing the resources available to those garda&iacute; to help them do their jobs.  This will facilitate and fund the recruitment of 800 additional garda&iacute; in the coming period, and 400 additional Garda staff.  There is a policy within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of hiring staff to release Garda members from administrative and desk duties and putting them back on to the front line, which has proven to be very effective.  As the Deputy will be aware, a new recruitment campaign for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has opened and I encourage people to apply.</p>  <p>  The Minister is confident that the continued concerted focus on further increasing the number of Garda members and staff, together with the ongoing redeployment of garda&iacute; from administrative to front-line roles, will help strengthen the garda&iacute; and strengthen the focus on community policing.  This will deliver significant growth in the operational policing hours nationwide and improve visibility and services to local communities across the country, including Dublin city centre.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900004#B00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for taking this question on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who I know cannot be here.  This is a very important and pressing issue in my constituency of Dun Laoghaire.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's ongoing efforts and engagements with the families, the staff and service users of Dunmore House and Carmona Services, particularly throughout the pandemic.  She has been very generous with her time, engaging on Zoom and attending on-site meetings with those involved.</p>  <p>  However, parents, guardians and friends of Carmona Services have been in contact with me in recent days and they are very concerned.  Not only were they concerned prior to this latest twist in respite care locally, but they were concerned about the waiting list for respite care generally in community healthcare organisation, CHO 6.  They were advised through written correspondence from the HSE and St. John of God that a respite house in Wyattville Park has been allocated solely to one individual, which is as a result of a court case.  While we acknowledge and understand the need to allocate that property to one individual, it is obviously needed, there is now a situation in which 88 people are waiting for respite, as well as an additional 33 people on a waiting list.  Many of their respite hours are in jeopardy because this property was a key tool in respite within the area and for those families.  It is the only respite house available to those 88 people with intellectual disabilities.</p>  <p>  This is causing extreme distress and hardship to families.  Some have been offered alternative respite 130 km away in County Wexford, which is obviously not suitable.  I know the Minister of State recently committed to &euro;9 million for the provision of respite care, which is very welcome, but we have a situation in CHO 6, Dun Laoghaire, Dublin south-east and north Wicklow, whereby we have lost key respite services.  It is causing significant distress to parents and families.  Just as we are beginning to return to some level of normality, they have no clarity on respite services.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State engage with officials in her Department, the HSE and St. John of God to expedite the purchase of a new respite property?  I know this cannot be done overnight, but the letter is quite vague in that regard.  It alludes to the purchase and provision of more respite services, which was needed anyway, but this problem has exacerbated the issue facing these families and the individuals with intellectual disabilities.  Can we fast-track the purchase of a property and all that entails with planning and retrofitting?  It is an issue of real urgency and that is why I raise it today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900004#B00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue for discussion and, as he rightly said, I am taking this on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Rabbitte.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that throughout the pandemic, staff and resources associated with closed or curtailed services were redeployed, where possible, to support residential provision and to provide for targeted in-home, community and tele-online supports for service users and families based on prioritised needs.  For those with a disability and their families, the impact of the pandemic on those services presented challenges that are still felt today.</p> <p>The HSE is very much aware of the importance of respite service provision for the families of both children and adults with disabilities and the impact the absence of respite service provision can have on other services being delivered.</p> <p> Regarding the specific issue of respite provision in CHO 6, the HSE is aware of the recent escalations by services users and their families regarding access to St. John of God respite houses at Wyattville and Ravenswell.  Occasionally, respite services must be temporarily curtailed to accommodate urgent emergency residential situations.  Unfortunately, this is currently the case with the respite service in Wyattville, which has been impacted since the week commencing 21 February 2022.  To manage the emergency, the only available and appropriate option was to use Wyattville and its staff team until an alternative location and an additional staff team are recruited.  As the Deputy knows, that can take some time.</p> <p> The HSE advises that families were contacted by St. John of God Services in early February to outline the situation, and that Community Healthcare East further contacted families on 24 February, apologising unreservedly for the additional stress the situation had caused.  St. John of God Services have confirmed to the HSE that there are 69 individuals affected by the repurposing of Wyattville and there are nine individuals on the waiting list.  The HSE advises that it is committed as far as possible to support Wyattville respite service users with supported holidays while Wyattville remains inaccessible, although I take on board the point made by the Deputy that somebody was offered a holiday in Wexford, which was 130 km away, which can be very difficult for the family.  I will bring that to the attention of the Minister of State.</p> <p> I can confirm that the HSE has requested information from St. John of God Services regarding the list of service users and their preferences for respite breaks to identify and prioritise individuals to offer interim respite supports.  HSE Community Healthcare East is committed to considering these priorities as a matter of urgency, within the available funding.  Once this information is received, the HSE and St. John of God Services will liaise with the alternative service provider to ensure there is limited reduction to the individuals' scheduled respite provision over the next six months.  Communication will issue to all individuals outlining the details of the proposed supported holidays, including any transition plans that are required.</p> <p> Regarding reduced access to respite in Ravenswell, the HSE advises that this is specifically related to ongoing recruitment challenges in the sector.  St. John of God Services have assured the HSE that they are actively campaigning for additional staffing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900005#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply and for a copy of her statement.  I specifically did not mention Ravenswell initially because it is part of the problem but that was before the latest news about Wyattville Park.  The challenges that have faced Ravenswell have been there for quite some time, and recruitment was an issue long before it became an issue generally in every sector in society.  I will come back to that again directly with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is aware of it.</p>  <p>  In her statement, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, said that, occasionally, respite services must be temporarily curtailed, which is understood and, unfortunately, families have witnessed that over the years.  She said that the HSE has requested information from St. John of God Services about creating a list for priority.  That is welcome but her statement goes on to say that, over the next six months, communication will issue to all individuals outlining the detail proposed for supported holidays, including any transition plans that are required.  I ask, through the Minister of State, that the Department of Health make urgent contact with the HSE specifically around speeding up that process.  There is no lack of resources within the Department of Health or the HSE to try to assist St. John of God's.</p>  <p>  This is having an enormous impact on families in south-east Dublin and north Wicklow.  This news came as a bolt from the blue to them but, as I said, they have been impacted for so long by the impact of changes in respite care that many of the families cannot even plan six days in advance, let alone six weeks in advance, because they do not know when respite is coming.  They do know one thing for sure, which is that respite is not coming for the foreseeable future for any of the individuals who were allocated to Wyattville Park.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, through the Department of Health, to try to speed up the process as much as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900005#C00300"><p>Both the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the HSE acknowledge the need for more services to provide much-needed respite to service users and their families.  I take on board the points the Deputy has made.  Parents are very concerned and this is very difficult for them after two very difficult years.  I will certainly speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to see if it can be expedited in any way.</p>  <p>  While I acknowledge the immediate issue in CHO 6 is causing distress to those families affected, I reiterate that this is a temporary measure to accommodate an emergency residential situation.  I acknowledge and welcome the fact the HSE is committed to supporting the service users affected by this temporary closure as a matter of priority.</p>  <p>  One of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s key priorities is building capacity in disability services, particularly in respite, in a safe and equitable manner into the future so those who care for their loved ones are provided with appropriate support to continue doing so, no matter where they live in the country.  Last year saw a &euro;5 million commitment to build capacity for an extra 10,400 bed nights for people with disabilities.  In 2022, &euro;9 million has been committed to establish three additional specialist centre-based services to provide 4,032 nights to 90 children, one to be Prader-Willi appropriate and the other two to provide high-support respite for children and young adults with complex support needs.  In addition, seven further respite services will provide 9,408 nights to 245 children and adults in a full year.</p>  <p>  I take on board the Deputy&rsquo;s point that it is about the short-term issue for the families who used to receive respite in Wyattville, notwithstanding the difficult situation they were in.  I will certainly bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900005#C00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, for attending to take this matter.  I am back again, as this is my third or fourth time dealing with the issue.  The pressure on schools in east Cork again this year is very high.  There are long waiting lists in all of the schools and this has been the case for many years, for many reasons.  It has led to a situation where parents are compelled to apply to more than one school.  In east Cork, Carrigtwohill and Midleton are 3 km or 4 km apart and there are four second-level schools in Midleton and two in Carrigtwohill.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is an accomplished legal person and I understand the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is an accomplished barrister, so they might be able to help me with this issue.  When an application is made on behalf of a child to attend a school and that child is put on a waiting list, that is tantamount to a refusal.  The next step is to appeal that to the board of management.  If that is refused, under section 29 of the Education Act it goes to the Minister and the Department.  If that is refused, the child is entitled to school transport to the next nearest school.  This is challenging and because parents do not know this information, they apply to many different schools.  Eventually, they are accepted in one, which may not be the nearest school.  When they look for school transport, they are asked for the paperwork to show they have been refused in the nearest school, that they appealed it to the board and were refused, and that they appealed it to the Minister and were refused, so that, now, they can be given school transport.  Parents do not know this.  The child is then on the concessionary list for spare seats on a bus, which may appear or not.</p>  <p>  This is madness.  The stress and strain on children and parents trying to access places is the same every year.  What I am suggesting to the Minister for the third or fourth time is that, in this particular case, where there are six schools in very close proximity, we designate that area as one education centre, and the problem is sorted regarding school transport.  I understand the Minister can do it with one stroke of a pen.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that a review is ongoing.  The review of school transport started in October 2019 but I understand it still has not been completed and that it was only in January of this year that it went for public consultation.  We are waiting for this review.  In the interim, I and my colleagues are facing this problem every year where children have to wait and wait, and the waiting lists are long again this year.</p>  <p>  I hope the people in the Department are listening to me, and maybe they are not - I do not know.  I ask the Minister to look at this solution.  It is a simple solution and it would take a lot of pressure off principals, Bus &Eacute;ireann, parents and children, and it will not cost a whole lot at the end of the day.  If there are four schools in one town and the child applies to the nearest school, technically, we can get out a tape measure to find that the nearest school is a couple of hundred yards away from the next nearest school.</p> <p>If we wanted to be really pedantic about it, we could say a person should go to that school and not the other school even though they are in the same town.  I suggest moving that on a little further by taking two adjacent towns a couple of kilometres apart, with four secondary schools in one and two in the other, and making that one education centre.  That solves many problems for many people and makes it very simple.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response to this.<br/><br/>We are facing long waiting lists in east Cork again this year.  The Minister, Taoiseach, school principals, Deputy O'Connor and I met last year to discuss this issue.  That will tell the Minister of State how serious this is.  It was unprecedented.  It was sorted last year by the provision of extra places but we are back this year with the same scenario.  What is going on as well, of course, is that parents apply to more than one school and therefore there are long waiting lists.  There is a model<b></b>in County Limerick where they have a kind of central applications office for secondary schools and that helps.  Perhaps that is something the Minister of State might also consider in cases such as this.</p></speech>

He will appreciate that I am taking this today on behalf of the Minister for Education.  Transport is not directly under my remit.  The Deputy is quite correct, however.  A review is ongoing at the moment.  I understand that recommendations will be coming shortly from the steering group, which will examine issues such as the effectiveness of the scheme, sustainability, climate action, rural development and all other important pertinent issues.</p>  <p>  Approximately 121,400 children avail of the school transport scheme on an annual basis, of whom 15,500 are children with additional needs, which obviously falls under my remit, at a cost of &euro;289 million in total.  I understand that in the areas the Deputy mentioned, approximately 292 children avail of the particular services he outlined.  I acknowledge what he said about Carrigtwohill and Midleton being separate and distinct post-primary centres.  I understand they are 9 km from each other.  The Deputy knows County Cork better than me</p></speech>

I also understand from the Department's response that there are no plans at present to recognise both as one education centre.  The Deputy is correct that there are two post-primary schools in Carrigtwohill, that is, Carrigtwohill Post-Primary School and St Aloysius' College, and four in Midleton, namely, Midleton C.B.S. Secondary School, St. Mary's High School, St. Colman's Community College and Midleton College.</p>  <p>  I also understand that 168 pupils who live in Carrigtwohill avail of transport to Midleton and that 141 pupils who attend Midleton avail of transport alleviation measures.  I appreciate what the Deputy said about concessionary services as well.  I know there are additional services and increased-size buses were provided in terms of an interim measure before the review kicks in.  My understanding is that the review is ongoing.  The fact that the Deputy brought it up in the D&aacute;il may be no harm.  The Department will be aware of it and can take that into account when it is undertaking its review.</p>  <p>  They are two distinct post-primary centres and my understanding is that the Department has no plans to change that at present.  It is important that children have transport, however.  My understanding is there is no child without transport to and from school at the moment.</p>  <p>  From what the Deputy said, even though it is a separate issue, the waiting list issue is interlinked.  Again, I will bring his contribution to the Minister for Education.  The Deputy mentioned that he had a meeting with her because of the issues around this.  I am aware of it on a regular basis in that I must ensure children with additional needs all receive placements and an appropriate education, preferably in their locality.  It is not always possible but that is what we endeavour to do.  Obviously, that applies for mainstream schools as well.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to micromanage if parents put their names down for different schools at the same time.  Nevertheless, I understand the rationale for doing so when the Deputy tells me they are concerned that their child may not get into a particular school and, therefore, cover all bases by putting the children's names down.  The Department has a geographical information system in order that it can forecast and anticipate demand and capacity in different areas through the building and planning unit.  That is obviously something else that needs to be looked at in this regard.</p></speech>

This review started in October 2019.  I know we had a pandemic but it is still ongoing.  I understand it is only this year that public representations are being sought.  I am disappointed that the Department has no plans to make the change.  I would like to know why not.  Would it cause some major rupture to policy all over the place?  Why is this not happening?  Does the Minister not have the authority to do this?</p>  <p>  The distance between the two centres is just over 7 km.  I checked that and it is quite short.  At the moment, however, parents have no choice but to apply to more than one school.  Sometimes, they are applying to four different schools in the hope the child might get into one of them.  That is leading to all these long waiting lists.  If the parents and their child eventually get admission to a particular school, which is not the nearest, they will grab it with both hands because they are afraid they will have no place.  The stress this is causing for children is shocking.  Children aged 11 or 12 say all their friends have a school place but they do not, and they ask if something is wrong with them.</p>  <p>  I am putting forward a very simple solution.  If the Department has just decided it is not doing it then tell the Department to do it.  I ask that the Minister actually gives an instruction to do this - make it one centre and get on with it.  Let us take away the stress and pressure that is on people.  It will not cost any more but it will relieve much pressure on Bus &Eacute;ireann, parents, school principals and the pupils themselves.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State mentioned special education, I will also bring up the fact that many young children from my area with additional educational needs must travel very long distances to get to school.  I have been saying repeatedly that we need a special school in east Cork in order that the school transport issue is solved there as well.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that issue and come back to me at some future date.  I again ask that the issue of education centres be looked at.  We met the Minister last year on the same topic.  This is a perennial issue.  The solution is simple; let us get on with it.</p></speech>

That is not to say it will not, however.  I think it will consider this following the Deputy's contribution.  There is certainly an argument for a more streamlined approach, bearing in mind the criteria, difficulties and challenges parents are facing and the stress delineated by him.</p>  <p>  I would surmise that because this review is ongoing, this is something that will be looked at.  As I said earlier, my understanding is that recommendations will be coming shortly from the steering group, which will be looking at school transport in general terms around eligibility criteria, trends, cost drivers and all that kind of thing to assess the overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.</p>  <p>  I also hear what the Deputy said around children with additional needs.  We are looking at special schools.  We opened three special schools in the past two years - one in Carrigaline, County Cork and two in Dublin.  We will always endeavour to provide special schools where they are needed if there is not capacity.</p></speech>

That is the lens I am bringing to the Ukrainian crisis that is unfolding at the moment, the scale of which is shocking.  The total number of refugees fleeing Ukraine reached 2 million people this week.  More than 1 million people arrived into Poland, almost 500,000 into Romania and more than 100,000 into both Hungary and Slovakia, the four EU neighbours bordering Ukraine to the west.</p> <p>We have seen some arrive in Ireland but not yet in the numbers we expect.  The words of the EU Home Affairs Commissioner, Ylva Johansson, at the European Parliament were very stark: "More is to come.  Worse is to come.  Millions more will flee and we must welcome them."</p> <p> This is a scale of movement we have not see on the Continent of Europe in some 75 years.  It is hard to fathom.  The United Nations has described the movement from Ukraine as one of the fastest exoduses of modern times.  Putin's attack on a peaceful democratic country has set in train a historic wave of migration that will scar the individual family histories of millions of individuals and families in coming years.</p> <p> Of the 2 million who have already left and sought safety in the EU, an estimated 800,000 are children.  They have crossed the border bundled onto trains, buses, into cars and on foot, some with mobile phone numbers scrawled on the back of their hands and clutching plastic bags.  Yesterday, the Irish Red Cross had received more than 6,000 pledges of accommodation for Ukrainians in people's own homes.  We have a generosity of spirit in this nation.  We must bring it to bear to provide sanctuary and solace to those leaving their homes behind for now.</p> <p> The Government response to date has been swift and significant.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has announced a specialised unit will be put in place to meet refugees from Ukraine as they arrive in at airports and ports in Ireland.  I also welcome the Minister for Social Protection's commitment that her officials are working to give PPS numbers swiftly to Ukrainian refugees when they arrive to allow them to access services, supports and enable access to the labour market here.</p> <p> However, as I said, it is the lens of the primary school teacher that I bring to this debate.  Based on a back of an envelope calculation, if we are estimating that 100,000 people are going to arrive here, some 50,000 are likely to be children.  That translates to 2,000 classrooms.  That is just the physical built infrastructure.  It also has to translate into 2,000 additional teachers, at a minimum, as well as all the supports that need to go into place.  These will be deeply traumatised children.  They will need the psychological supports.  That is not the Minister of State's brief.  They will need considerable language inputs.  They will arrive here, presumably, with very little English.  And then there are all the extra supports that we would just expect for schoolgoing children of that age.  We also need to have a sense of where the demand will be geographically.</p> <p> We also need to have a broader conversation about the best way to deliver a curriculum to these children.  Do we anticipate they will be here in five and ten years?  In that case we should absolutely integrate them and fold them into the Irish curriculum.  Or do we think they will be here for a shorter period?  Should we be looking at ways to deliver something that is closer to the Ukrainian curriculum?  Should we be looking at trying to get resources to deliver it, or at least some of it, in Ukrainian to minimise the disruption to these children's education or should we be trying to create a stepping stone between those two things whereby we say we will deal with their specific needs now but try to scaffold them into an Irish system in the longer term?  These are questions and that is how I pose them.  There is a huge job of work to be done and it needs to be done extremely quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900007#E00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  This is a real topical issue at the moment.  I want to reiterate the Government's position that the continuing Russian military action against Ukraine is illegal and immoral.  As the Government has stated, the priority is a full and comprehensive cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of the Russian military from Ukrainian territory.  The Deputy is quite right that the war in Ukraine has caused a humanitarian crisis on a scale we have not seen for many decades in Europe.  That will require a whole-of-government approach to supporting the people who arrive here.</p>  <p>  There is no logic to Irish people offering this wonderful c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to Ukrainian nationals and their families if we cannot provide the additional supports they require.  It is an evolving situation and we do not know how long they will be here.  It is commendable that the Irish people have made in excess of 6,000 offers of accommodation.  Our schools have a strong tradition of welcoming children of all nationalities and backgrounds and have experience of doing this throughout the school year.  Many schools, primary and post primary, have contacted the Department already to express how keen they are to ensure any children arriving in their areas are welcomed into their schools.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has published a range of resources to support learners with English as an additional language.  Further guidance for teachers about these resources will issue to schools shortly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned psychological supports.  I think that will be pertinent, particularly around trauma.  These children may have seen things as well as the stress of their having to leave their home of origin.  Schools are provided with support from psychologists from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  NEPS has developed materials for schools to assist them in supporting children of Ukrainian heritage and others who may be experiencing distress in relation to current events.  Temporary crisis measures will be put in place where needed.</p>  <p>  It will take a Trojan effort from the education sector which is on the back of coming out Covid.  I commend all the teachers - the Deputy is a teacher himself - and all the school staff for the incredible work they have done to date.  They will require even more fortitude to look after these children.  In my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, I heard only yesterday of twins who have already come from Ukraine and are in school.  Schools with capacity to welcome children can do so in the usual way.  There will be a helpline for schools and we are putting information online and on social media for parents in relevant languages to support them in accessing schooling for children.  My officials have already spoken to the staff unions and management bodies, and work is under way on engaging with other Departments, agencies and stakeholders.  We need to see where there are children being accommodated so that we can cater for them in schools in the locality.</p>  <p>  There are obviously children in Ireland who are looking for schools but we must also cater for Ukrainians.  It is also important to mention there will also be teachers coming from Ukraine.  The Teaching Council will work with the Department on expediting registration for those teachers so that they can teach in their mother tongue, as the Deputy mentioned.  There will be procedures for those who do not have proof of qualifications so that they can teach here.</p></speech>

If that is the considered position we arrive at with the best expert evidence, that is fine.  I would be happy to support that.  However, we have to acknowledge the huge additional pressures that would place on schoolteachers, staff and principals in particular.  It is something we need to consider.  The Minister of State did reference that it is presumed we will have educational professionals who will arrive from Ukraine.  It is important to identify those and use them as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I have concerns.  I have taught children with very little English.  These children will be deeply traumatised by their circumstances.  It is very difficult to reach them when you do not have a shared language, particularly if you are in a class of 25 or 30, as so many of our teachers often are.  If that is where we are landing, then let us plan around that and support it.  I am concerned the scale and numbers of children arriving will make that difficult and will place huge pressure, even on the built environment.</p>  <p>  We should be engaging the NCCA.  We have experts on curricular reform and planning.  We should engage that expertise.  I have written to the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and asked it to suspend its work programme to dedicate some time to this to hear from best international evidence and to hear how best we can support these children.  It would be a really good use of our time.  There is a lot of expertise on that committee and we should use it to support the Government action as much as possible.  We should think deeply about whether our response of folding them into the general school environment is best for the children themselves and also the staff who have to deliver.</p></speech>

As a country, we need to look at novel, innovative approaches for how we will educate Ukrainian nationals.</p> <p>Teachers who come from Ukraine will be able to teach in their mother tongue, which will be of assistance to these children.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will publish resources to support learners with English as an additional language.  It may well be that some sort of compromise will be found between folding children into the existing educational system as well as providing a hybrid and novel approach.  As the Deputy suggested, perhaps having the Oireachtas committee look at it is a good idea.</p> <p> We should dedicate some time to this because we do not want a situation where our schools, and we have 4,000 in this country, are under acute pressure when they are just coming out of Covid.  It will be a mammoth task for them to take in children, especially if we are talking about approximately 100,000 Ukrainian nationals coming here, but we have to do it.  It is imperative we do not just take families as refugees into this country.  We waived the visa requirement.  There is no arbitrary limit to the number that can come into this country, but we also have to educate their children.  They could be here for six months, a year or five years.  We do not want them suffering from a lack of education.  Since Ireland's schools have a strong tradition of welcoming children from different nationalities and backgrounds, we will have the capacity to do it.  The helpline will assist and cohesion between Departments will be crucial to ensure we all speak the same language when we deal with this issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="10:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900008#F01300"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:  	recognises that legislation to promote a flexible working environment is in the public interest, in order to achieve: <blockquote> 	&mdash; an appropriate combination of paid work with caring responsibilities, and the enjoyment of a better work-life balance;<br /><br />&mdash; the promotion of access to work, particularly for persons who face particular obstacles in taking up employment;<br /><br />&mdash; a reduction in traffic congestion and carbon emissions caused by the commute to work;<br /><br />&mdash; a rebalancing of the population and of amenities and resources between more densely and less densely populated regions; and<br /><br />&mdash; the economic and social development of the State as a whole, in accordance with policies on proper planning and sustainable development; </blockquote>rejects as inadequate the Government proposals in the general scheme of the Right to Request Remote Work Bill, on the grounds that they:  <blockquote> 	&mdash; fail to provide that access to flexible work should be the default entitlement and not the exception;<br /><br />&mdash; fail to include a presumption that if work has been done remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic it is reasonably practicable for it to continue to be done remotely; and<br /><br />&mdash; confer a right on employers to refuse the entitlement to work remotely on grounds that are both manifestly unreasonable and unchallengeable; and </blockquote>calls on the Government, as an immediate priority, to produce or to support radical alternative legislative arrangements which ensure that: <blockquote> 	&mdash; all workers have a right to request flexible work;<br /><br />&mdash; there is a presumption in favour of flexible work; and<br /><br />&mdash; a reason for refusal relied upon by an employer must be objectively justifiable, appropriate and proportionate. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>Nowhere is the innate conservatism of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il more evident than in this Government's approach to the question of flexible work.  We were told the pandemic had changed everything, that nothing would ever be the same again, that a new Ireland would emerge from the ashes of the epoch-shaping disrupter that is Covid-19, and that a new deal for working people, taking into account the lessons and experiences of the pandemic and the innovative ways that workers, the State and businesses responded, would be forged.  Based on the evidence so far, in the Labour Party's judgment, the Government has failed its very first test.  It is a case of back to the future, based on the toothless legislation presented in recent weeks.  I genuinely wish we did not have to bring this motion to the floor of the D&aacute;il today and we do so more in sorrow than anger.</p><p>For some years now, and well before the pandemic hit, my Labour Party colleagues and I have been debating in this Chamber and writing in the media about the next frontier of workers' rights.  Before the 2020 general election, the Labour Party produced a document - Getting Ireland Moving: A Smarter Way to Work.  It envisaged new opportunities for remote working, properly regulated within a statutory framework, which would help to cut the commute, bring about a better work-life balance, help our environment, sustain our communities and allow workers and businesses, at the same time, to be more productive and flexible.  We also argued for evidence-based ideas around a shorter working week and a right to switch off, making the point that, far from liberating us from work, the devices we constantly have in our hands mean we are always on.  Technology should work for us.  Instead, it can and does enslave us.</p><p>The gains that workers, unions and the Labour Party have extracted over the past century and more are in danger of being lost as new ways of working take hold.  The notion of the traditional employment model is fraying at the edges.  We are not Luddites; we are progressives.  Ireland and Irish-based firms are at the cutting edge of innovation and the 9 to 5 job does not suit everyone.  The idea of a job for life spooks some.  Society has changed, as have the expectations of workers and citizens, which is often no bad thing.</p><p>The ideas we have posited for years now were previously dismissed as the musings of lunatics and it was said we were seeking some kind of utopia, but then, two years ago this month came the lockdown.  Overnight, hundreds of thousands of commuters set up shop at the kitchen table or the box room.  There was an overnight revolution.  Employees in companies, the Civil Service and public service who could work from home adapted and, by and large, did so very well.  Flexible and remote work issues became the issue <i>du jour</i>and a mainstream real-world issue.  Workers showed themselves to be as productive, if not more so, when working from home or working remotely from a hub.  Citizens reported better balance in their lives, the Environmental Protection Agency reported fewer carbon emissions, workers were less stressed and those with caring responsibilities liked what they saw.</p><p>Remote working works and it works for everyone.  What is more, the demand is there.  In Ireland, the demand for remote working is among the highest in the OECD.  Of those in employment who can work remotely, 88% of those who answered a recent Indeed survey said they would like to do so when all the pandemic restrictions are removed.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that searches for jobs in Ireland permitting remote work were six times higher in December 2021 than they were before the pandemic.  That speaks for itself.  Employers I speak to daily, including those in large multinational corporations in my constituency and elsewhere, now tell me it is employers who provide structured, remote working opportunities who will win the war for talent in what is, as we know, a very tight labour market.</p><p>Yesterday, we celebrated International Women's Day.  Too often, women in Ireland have been forced to choose between a family and career, which is simply not on.  The under-representation of women in the labour force is a social travesty and a massive economic and fiscal problem.  Greater access to the labour market for all citizens is crucial to our productivity and our overall economic and social success.  Without the right to flexible work and the provision of affordable, universal public childcare, we are shamefully writing too many talented hard-working women out of our labour force.  These figures do not lie.  Over the two years that spanned the first phase of the pandemic, 2020 and 2021, full-time female employment increased by 7% or 56,000, while part-time female employment rose by 10% or 34,000.  Almost 90,000 women were able to enter the workforce at a time when many citizens were losing their jobs.  Many of these women were attracted into the labour force by the working from home arrangements forced on companies by the pandemic, which allowed women to balance their work with other responsibilities.  If the Government's so-called right to request legislation goes unamended, once again, many of these women will in effect be forced out of the workforce.  In a poll conducted recently by Ireland Thinks on behalf of the Labour Party, 81% of women surveyed believe workers should have a right to flexible work.  Let us be in no doubt that the issue of remote work is a gender issue and it needs to be accepted as such by the Government.</p><p>I simply could not believe what I read when I saw the draft heads of the Bill from the T&aacute;naiste that were published recently.  It was, frankly, bizarre and quite extraordinary.  No lessons whatsoever had been learned from the pandemic.  The Government tries to sell this legislation as a right to request remote working framework.  It is nothing of the sort.  In fact, it is a charter for refusal.  It is toothless and anaemic and it should be scrapped.</p><p>What made it worse was that this legislation came at around the same time as thousands of my constituents were dragged back into city centre offices.  They were instructed to go back to the office at a time when the cost of filling the car went stratospheric.</p> <p>Almost in the same week, the National Transport Authority responded to me saying it had decided now was not the time and it could not proceed with the promised flexible taxsaver ticket that would respond to the needs of workers in the situation in which we are at present.</p> <p> Commuters who have successfully worked from home for two years told me that they felt absolutely cheated on so many fronts.  The gains and the progress made over the past two years counted for nothing.  The draft legislation the Government produced says, in effect, that you could ask to work remotely but you boss could tell you to go and whistle.  You would have no right to challenge the grounds for refusal.  That is, frankly, bizarre.</p> <p> This proposed legislation was even more favourable to the unenlightened employer than the laws proposed by the Tory Party.  That is an objective fact and legal academics have made that very point.  Central to the success of a balanced legislative solution should be the idea that the recorded experience over the past two years should be considered when a request to work remotely is to be made.</p> <p> With my own experience in this field, I know the concept of a defined reference period in employment rights legislation is well established.  I want refer in particular to legislation that was recently passed in these Houses, the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018.  It is a prime example.  This was the culmination of a process the Labour Party initiated in 2014 to better regulate low- and uncertain-hours contracts.  A key feature of this legislation is the averaging out of hours worked over a period of 12 months to establish which band of hours in which a person ought to be placed when his or her contract is being considered.  This works very well.  I say this for the reason that this approach also needs to be adopted in the context of the legislative and regulatory approach to flexible work, where a proven ability to work successfully from home over the past two years must inform this process.  Without the consideration of those kinds of elements in a Bill, it will simply be toothless and will not work.</p> <p> The gains from the past two years cannot be squandered.  The Government would be better off giving this, frankly useless, Bill a decent burial, accepting this motion and the principles that inform it and adopting the draft legislation from my colleague, Senator Sherlock, if the Government is serious about making remote working work for everyone.  As much as the Government seems to want it, the clock simply cannot be wound back to 2019.  The people and many good employers have moved on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="10:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900009#G00200"><p>Like Deputy Nash, I represent a constituency where we watch and are among tens of thousands of people who get up in the morning, get onto overcrowded trains or packed buses that go onto overcrowded and packed roads, or get into personal cars to get to work, school or college.  Since the lifting of restrictions, workers throughout the country have been told to return to the office in their droves.  Many people who had worked from home during the pandemic and had swapped their bus or car commute for a morning walk, some time with the family or indeed an extra, much-needed hour in bed, now find themselves taking to personal and public transport again at ungodly hours.</p><p>In practical terms, this means that the start and the end of thousands of peoples' days will be spent stuck in traffic or on overcrowded public transport, which erodes morale and, of course, damages our planet.  Commuting was not working for workers before Covid-19.  It was absolute chaos.  For the thousands of commuters who leave Dublin Fingal everyday, counties Louth, Wexford or Kildare or any area around our major cities, this is a case of back to the future.  The promise that everything would change and nothing would be the same has been absolutely obliterated by the past few weeks.  One in ten workers spend more than an hour travelling to work daily, with commuters losing on average five hours every week stuck in traffic.  Dublin was the third worst city in the world for congestion - the third worst.  In my constituency of Fingal, alone, 30,000 workers commute from home to Dublin city.</p><p>We know that more investment is needed.  However, this alone will not solve the underlying causes of this unsustainable commuter flow.  A right to flexible and remote work is key to ending this commuter chaos once and for all.  The development over the past two years in both information technology and the increased knowledge of how to use it has been a game changer, enabling many of us to work throughout the pandemic from our homes or local workplace hubs.  These gains cannot be lost.  They need to be built upon.  That is why the Labour Party is demanding the right to flexible, secure and decent work.</p><p>Demand for remote and flexible work in Ireland is amongst the strongest in the OECD.  Of those in employment who can work remotely, many would like to do so when all pandemic restrictions are removed.  However, due to the Government's failure to enact a real right to flexible work, many have been hauled back to the office in recent weeks.  These are the facts and the stories I get on the doors, from my office and, indeed, from my colleagues.</p><p>If we are serious about lowering our emissions and meeting our climate targets, the Government needs to give more workers the power and choice to work from home or in their local community.  Among the key gains from a rights-based approach to flexible work will be the cutting of climate emissions, maintaining a better work-life balance, reducing the cost of living and transport congestion, and rejuvenating local communities.</p><p>The local coffee shops and convenience stores in my home town of Swords and constituency of Fingal spoke of how they no longer had to get by on just a couple of hours of peak time in the morning.  They had a thriving lunchtime trade as workers who were working from home were able to nip down for their local coffee or sandwich and meet their friends in their own communities, as opposed to in an industrial estate or the city centre.</p><p>The Labour Party believes what is needed is a workers-first agenda, underpinned by job security and promoted by Government, because the gains from a right to flexible work can only be measured on a society-wide and global level.  Our motion and legislation, which has been published by Senator Sherlock, will embed the right to this flexibility from day one of employment; not as a reward for good behaviour once probation is passed or as a perk.  It would provide workers with the certainty of flexibility that is needed in order that we can build a workplace that works for people and reflects the demands of modern living.</p><p>The pandemic has shown us that a different work life is possible.  Rather than a stressful commute, people can have flexibility to improve their productivity, work-life balance, air quality and everything else on the list of far-reaching benefits such an approach would bring.  We have seen 15 years of change pushed into the past two years, but this Government's wrong-headed approach to essentially give employers the right to refuse requests to flexible work will be shown to be on the wrong side of progress.  It represents a step back in time and a return and a rigid fixation on the previous <i>status quo</i>.  This is after it has been proved over the past two years that there has been no decrease in productivity, that we have not lost tax revenues and have been able to keep the economy going and keep money flowing into the public purse to keep services going, all while remote work was forced upon us by a pandemic.  This wrong-headed approach by Government to row this back and go back to the way it was is one of the most regressive moves by a Government in recent times.</p><p>That is why the Labour Party wants to create this right to flexible work, which is in the best interest of workers, families, local communities and our environment.  The heart of our motion and our Bill is people's physical and mental health, workplace safety and job security.  If workers are working from home, the provisions of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 still apply to breaks and rest periods.  This cannot change.  Remote and flexible working will be a reality for the long term.  It is the future.  The future is here now.  We cannot go back.</p><p>We need to look at the options for working within communities, which is a useful option for people who must commute long distances, whether from the suburbs and hinterlands of our major cities or from even further afield.  People travel halfway across the country every day to work.  This way of life burns people out long before their time.  We need to consider how we can provide workspaces in local communities, towns and villages.  While I acknowledge some efforts have been made by Government in this regard, it still seems piecemeal and led by the private sector rather than a proper State-led approach.</p><p>Such workspaces, work hubs and facilities would enable people to leave the house on foot using active travel measures and engage in their job in the centre of their local towns and villages.  This might be done through hot-desking or short-term lets of industrial and retail units in towns.</p> <p>The repurposing of buildings such as old Garda stations or credit unions are also options because much of the necessary infrastructure for modern work is already in place.  This would help to regenerate towns and villages as money would circulate in local economies and continue to be spent on main streets, as has happened over recent years.  It would be good for the environment and good for people's mental health because they would not be working from the end of their bed or in otherwise cramped conditions in their homes.  Throughout the pandemic we have been raising the fact that working from home in and of itself is not the answer and that proper facilities have to be in place.  We cannot have people working in cramped bedrooms.  Some people are able to have a home office or to repurpose a shed or outbuilding, but many are unable to do so.  People who are in house-sharing situations, for example, or who live with people who do shift work have to keep their voice down when they are on the phone, but such practical difficulties can be resolved if people have the option of community work.</p> <p> A debate on flexible working arrangements is taking place all around the world and we cannot miss this opportunity to introduce strong flexible work legislation because there are enormous cost-of-living benefits in areas such as transport and climate.  People being pushed back onto overcrowded buses and trains, with very expensive fares, or into their cars, with the increased fuel costs we have been discussing in recent weeks in the D&aacute;il, is an example of regression.  The Government has an opportunity here to make progress and I urge it to take it.</p> <p> If flexible work arrangements are to be introduced in any fashion, a flexible work ticket for public transport will be required.  I and Deputy Nash have been raising this since long before the pandemic reached its current point.  That the Government has not stood up to the mark and produced a flexible taxsaver ticket is yet another example of not putting the worker or the people first.  Half-price fares for those under 24 have been promised but have been held up by some nebulous technical difficulties.</p> <p> Since the 2019 Fingal by-election, the Labour Party has been talking about flexible work and the need to put it on a statutory footing.  The Government must develop a proper plan for commuters, workers and those working from home, for regenerating rural towns and villages and enabling people to work there.  Flexible and secure work is the lifeblood of any such plan in terms of its success.  I ask the Government to acknowledge the Bill produced by Senator Sherlock on this and to support the motion before the House today.  I call on the Government to take a real lead in providing a real right to flexible and remote work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="10:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900010#H00200"><p>The Government will not oppose this motion today.  I welcome this opportunity to discuss the important matters of flexible and remote work and thank the Deputies for bringing forward this Private Member's Motion on same.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on it myself and, more importantly, to hear the views of Members of this House.</p>  <p>  The Government wants remote and flexible models of working to be a much broader part of life post Covid.  It is a key consideration in Government policies such as the national economic plan, the climate action plan, the town centre living initiative and the smarter travel policy.  The State is committed to increasing remote work adoption in Ireland through removing barriers and developing infrastructure.  Last Friday I joined the mayor of Galway, Councillor Colette Connolly, in opening the PorterShed, a facility for 180 hot desks, with the opportunity to increase by another 250 if required.  Such facilities are being supported by this Government with grant aid through Enterprise Ireland.  The Government is also providing guidance, raising awareness and leading by example in this area.</p>  <p>  Last year we published a remote work strategy, a core pillar or which centres on creating a conducive environment.  A commitment was made to legislate to provide employees with the right to request remote work.  This is one of the key actions of the strategy.  Draft right to request remote work legislation proposals were brought forward by the Government in response to its commitment to make remote working a permanent feature of Ireland's workforce in a way that can benefit all, economically, socially and environmentally.  These draft proposals are currently going through pre-legislative scrutiny and I would encourage all members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment to participate in that scrutiny process because the Government is open to making constructive amendments to its original proposals.</p>  <p>  While the adoption of remote work was already increasing in Ireland, Covid-19 has greatly accelerated this trend, making remote work a central part of the workplace today and into the future.  It is one of the few positive legacies of recent years.  In terms of today's discussion, it is important to address the distinctions between remote and flexible work.  Remote work refers to an arrangement whereby work is fully or partially carried out at a work site other than the default place of work.  However, the definition of flexible work is much broader than remote work and may include the possibility of starting or finishing work at different times, doing compressed hours, access to flexitime and shared working options.</p>  <p>  Directive 2019/1158 of the European Parliament and the Council on working life balance for parents and carers contains provisions relating to flexible working arrangements.  As the right to request flexible working arrangements under this directive extends only to parents and those with caring responsibilities, the required legislative amendments will relate to the Parental Leave Act 1998 and the Carer's Leave Act 2001.  Responsibility for transposition of the directive rests with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  This work is currently in train.</p>  <p>  The motion proposes a presumption that if work has been done remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic, it is reasonably practicable for it to continue to be done remotely.  However, it is important not to conflate the experience of home working during the Covid-19 pandemic with remote working under a regular scenario.   Employers facilitated workers to work from home because of a Government instruction in light of a global health crisis and a highly contagious and dangerous virus.  It must be acknowledged that the sudden introduction of mass emergency home working often resulted in less than ideal working conditions for both employees and employers alike.  Using this scenario as the basis for legally requiring employers to continue to allow all workers to work remotely would not be fair, balanced or proportionate.  Again, we should not conflate the experience of home working during the pandemic with remote working under a regular scenario.</p>  <p>  As I said at the outset, the Government wants remote working to play a greater part of life in Ireland.  It can play a central role in enabling increased flexibility to support a better work-life balance.  The Government is acutely conscious of this and of the significant long-term shift in attitudes to remote working among employers and workers throughout the country.  Acceptance of remote work is high, and remote and hybrid working is very much here to stay.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, on 25 January, the Government approved the priority drafting of a right to request remote working Bill 2022, and pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of Bill by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment began on 9 February.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Government have said on several occasions that we are open to changes, especially on the provisions relating to the number of reasons to reject a request for remote working and the mechanisms for appeal.  It should be noted that the current proposals include provisions requiring, for the first time, that all employers have a policy on remote and hybrid working as well as a legal right for workers to request it.  Currently, that is not the case.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently examining the legal issues relating to strengthening the redress provisions and the right of appeal and is taking legal advice on the matter.  The Government's Bill will enhance the rights and entitlements of workers but it also needs to ensure a balanced approach that is fair and affordable for employers.  Similarly, it must be acknowledged that not all occupations, industries or particular roles within enterprises will be appropriate or suitable for remote working, including construction workers, nurses and so on.  Therefore, calls for an automatic legal right for all workers to be granted remote work are not realistic.</p>  <p>  The legislation provides for the development of codes of practice to provide guidance to employers, employees and their representatives on the general principles that will apply in the operation of remote working and to aid with the implementation of new legislation.  Information will also be provided in the form of templates for remote work policies to assist employers to develop their own policies and to help them to identify the types of information and procedures that should be outlined in them.</p> <p>The intention remains that the Government Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  Following the publication of the Oireachtas joint committee's report on pre-legislative scrutiny, any recommendations will be reviewed and considered by the T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p> It should be noted that remote working is a broader concept than home working and that there are a significant number of Government and industry-led initiatives and funding aimed at facilitating and promoting remote work in all regions, including the development of hubs and the provision of high-speed broadband.</p> <p> New regional enterprise plans to 2024 are currently being launched by me, the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the T&aacute;naiste, and there is a focus on remote working opportunities and infrastructures in each region.  Funding of &euro;9.3 million, under the regional enterprise transition scheme, RETS, was awarded to 24 projects in July 2021, including remote working hubs.  In addition, &euro;8.9 million in funding was announced by Minister for Rural and Community Development under the connected hubs scheme, a key deliverable of Our Rural Future.  The Minister for Finance also announced an enhanced income tax deduction for remote workers as part of budget 2022.  This amounts to 30% of electricity, heating and broadband expenses.</p> <p> The positive impacts of increased remote work can be substantial and remote working has the potential to fundamentally change the nature of where, how, when and why people work.  This, in turn, will bring about economic, spatial, environmental, cultural and societal change.  While remote working should never be used as a substitute for any form of childcare, it provides families with more flexibility, around which they can base their early learning and childcare choices.</p> <p> Multiple benefits can be derived from remote work.  They have been highlighted by speakers already, and no doubt will be highlighted by many more speakers as the debate progresses.  These benefits will help to achieve numerous public policy objectives.  The benefits include increasing participation in the labour market, attracting and retaining talent, enabling balanced regional development, alleviating accommodation pressures, improving work-life balance, improving child and family well-being, reducing the amount of time spent commuting, and reducing carbon emissions and air pollution.</p> <p> Before I finish, I again thank the Deputies for bringing forward the motion today.  This is an important opportunity to discuss further the benefits of remote working and the consideration required to ensure it is a viable option for both employers and employees in the long term.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of various Members during the course of the debate.  I encourage all Members to participate in the pre-legislative scrutiny with the other key stakeholders to ensure the legislation that is proposed can be enhanced to the benefit of workers and employers alike.</p></speech>

One would not think that from the Minister of State's remarks.  What was impossible for all the reasons that we have heard for years became possible overnight: working from home, flexible working, working online, a new work-life balance.  Things that were unachievable and undoable because of necessity not only were doable but worked.  The discourse in recent months was that all has changed permanently because of what we have learned in the past two years about how we can do things differently and better.</p>  <p>  There is no going back to what existed before, but listening to the Minister of State's comments today, that is clearly not the case.  Options are to be provided but only where they suit the employer, otherwise not.  That is at the core of the issue.  We know only too well how easy it is to revert to the way things were always done.  That is the convenient, simple way.  Many of the changes that came about in banking after the economic crash, when we swore we would learn from our mistakes and never revert to them, are now being put back on the agenda.  I refer to the structure of bank bonuses, performance pay and the oversight of banking activities.  It is very easy for lessons to be unlearned and for important changes to be undone if it suits those who can influence policy in the State.</p>  <p>  In my view and that of the Labour Party, it is timely now, before the important work lessons of Covid are unlearned, to establish those learnings in concrete terms in law.  That is the objective of the motion before the House.  It is set out in meaningful terms in the legislation published by our colleague Senator Sherlock.  If work could be done remotely during the pandemic, surely it is reasonable to conclude that it can continue to be done in that fashion forever if that suits the workers concerned.</p>  <p>  I accept that the fundamental change in work practices instantly brought about by the pandemic had to be instituted in many cases without proper preparation.  I hear what the Minister of State says in that regard.  We all know that.  We needed preparation and to have supports.  We needed equipment to be provided to do the job.  How much better the outcomes would be - better than the successes of the past two years - if we now make proper and thorough preparations to ensure efficient broadband is available, for example, and access is offered across the nation to easily accessible work hubs in every county.  Likewise, we should make proper preparation for those willing and able to work from home by providing basic equipment such as desks, chairs and suitable PCs.  The Minister of State is correct when he says that people worked on an emergency basis using sideboards or even ironing boards in some instances, but doing it properly and preparing it properly would be transformational.</p>  <p>  Our work patterns in recent decades have seen tens of thousands of commuters leaving counties such as my own to commute to Dublin.  From as early as 5.30 a.m., the M11 and many other roadways see the daily commute with the obvious impact for hundreds of thousands of families.  Men and women are getting up and leaving their children into cr&egrave;ches or childminders at the crack of dawn and do not see them again for most of the day.  The human and family impact is readily understandable, and the environmental impact and carbon emissions are equally so.  Why can we not change that?  We have people needlessly spending hours daily in their cars, burning fuel and causing congestion, which adds to the cost not only for themselves but also for other road users and for the economy.  We now face a new reality that has been instanced.  Many of the people I am talking about simply cannot afford that commute.  They cannot afford to put the fuel in their cars.  The price of fuel is making work unaffordable.  Few would predict that matters will improve any time soon.  I will give way to my colleague.  This motion is timely and important and I hope it will be accepted.</p></speech>

I am proud to speak in support of it.  I also pay tribute to our colleague Senator Sherlock, who has done so much to enshrine a right to flexible working in law.  I acknowledge how fortunate we all are to be able to stand here in a peaceful parliament debating this issue while bombs are raining down on the people of Ukraine.  We stand in solidarity with them at their darkest hour.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Howlin says, Covid has changed the nature of work for all of us in Ireland and we have seen a new way of working emerge.  Pre-pandemic, many of us took for granted a form of work that emphasised presenteeism: the jacket on the back of the chair and the fact that people were expected to be in the office at all hours.  That was accompanied by the awful daily ritual of the lengthy early-morning commute for so many, which was unpaid and was time taken out of people's lives and family time.  The pandemic has offered us a great opportunity to reset priorities, to enshrine in law the right to flexible working that will benefit all of us: men and women, individuals, families and local communities.</p>  <p>  I wish to emphasise the importance that a genuine right to flexible work would have for women.</p> <p>Speaking on the morning after International Women's Day, we can all acknowledge that women in particular will stand to gain from a genuine right to flexible work.  The Central Bank has noted that women's participation in the Irish labour force has increased by 3.5 percentage points since the pandemic began.  While it is true to say that during the pandemic many women continued to bear the lion's share of caring responsibilities and unpaid domestic responsibilities in the home, it is also the case that the opportunity to engage in hybrid working or remote working enabled more women to participate in the workforce.  Indeed, enabling men to work from home also enabled men to take up more responsibilities as fathers and as carers.  This could have great feminist benefits too, not just for women but also for men.</p> <p> We are all conscious of the benefit for the environment that a genuine right to flexible work can afford us.  We saw a reduction in carbon emissions during the lockdowns.  Many of us in Dublin city constituencies heard for the first time the clarity of birdsong on the street.  While climate action of course requires a deal more than a right to remote working, genuinely more people being enabled to work from home will mean less traffic, fewer polluting cars on our roads and better air quality for all of us.  At a time of serious concerns about energy security, it will also reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  </p> <p> As Deputy Duncan Smith has outlined, the growth of local communities was greatly strengthened and enabled during Covid-19.  Quality of life improved for many people who were able to move out of city centre locations and work from home in areas where perhaps they were closer to family and to their original local communities.  All of these benefits are clear from a genuine right to remote work, as we are proposing in this motion and in our legislation that Senator Sherlock has drafted.  Unfortunately, the Government's Bill, rather than providing for a right to request remote work, is more effectively a right to refuse for employers.  As Deputy Nash has said, it is a toothless and anaemic Bill.  The right to refuse effectively undermines and countermands that right to request which it is apparently supposed to provide.</p> <p> The Government has failed to include within the draft Bill a presumption that if work that has been done remotely during the pandemic, it is reasonably practical to expect it to continue to be done remotely or at least to give employees and workers the option to work remotely and to work in a hybrid fashion.  We know that the majority of people in Ireland wish to see this right to remote work and a more hybrid model of work enshrined into law and embedded in our policy going into the future.  It should not just be seen as something that was unique to the pandemic.  It should be seen as something that we can provide for permanently.</p> <p> The Labour Party has a long record in working for workers' rights.  Our working from home Bill in 2020 would have given workers a statutory right to switch off.  That again must be taken along with the right to remote working.  We have also pushed for a Donogh O'Malley moment in childcare to ensure a universal public scheme of childcare.  That too must accompany a genuine package of measures to enable more women to take part in the workforce and in public life, and to enable all workers to have a better quality of life.  This will benefit all of us: workers, families and communities.  I urge the Minister of State to accept the motion.</p></speech>

They are not prepared to accept that.  They have had the experience of not just working remotely, but working well remotely.  They want that experience to inform the legislation, which it clearly does not.  Nobody is going to stand in here and say the legislation is perfect or indeed adequate.  Deputy Troy was very quick to emphasise that it is a draft at the moment, and of course it is.  The word "draft" was used over and over again following the reaction of not only workers but also their representatives and politicians to the proposals which in effect amount to a charter for refusal to grant the right to work from home.  The Minister of State can nod his head all he likes but I know what it is.  I have read it.  I have seen the reaction from workers and their representatives.  They have read it too.  They also have the experience of the past two years which the Minister of State and his Department are at pains to point out will not inform the legislation.  It should of course inform the legislation because that has been their experience.</p>  <p>  It is more than 20 years since I, as a shop steward, lodged the first claim for what we called "teleworking" at the time.  We did not call it e-working, remote working or anything like that.  We called it "teleworking".  That was refused by the employer on the grounds that it did not suit the business, etc.  That same workplace, some 20 years later, has now transferred in its entirety to remote working.  Not only did it improve productivity, which it did, but it also improved the lives of the people who were working there, which has a consequent improvement in terms of productivity and how they are getting their business done.  It was a really positive experience.  Like many workers, they were not just surprised when they saw the legislation as published - they were angry because it falls far short of what they had expected.</p>  <p>  I should have said at the start I want to thank the Deputies who have introduced this motion.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is not opposing it.  We all know that is not the same thing as supporting it.  Saying you do not have an objection to something is not the same thing as saying you are actually going to do it.  The report produced by the T&aacute;naiste showed very clearly that workers want a hybrid model and that is their preferred mode for future working.  Patricia King of ICTU said at the committee that the legislation will be judged on whether workers have confidence that it compels employers to be fair, reasonable and consistent in their considerations, and it does not.  Therefore it requires substantial changes.</p>  <p>  The reasons that the T&aacute;naiste published in the draft Bill do not strike the necessary balance.  It is not just that it is not in favour of workers - the balance is all in favour of employers.  As someone with a considerable amount of experience in the trade union movement and a small amount of experience in politics I am not a bit surprised, coming from this Government, that this Bill is what we got.  However, to dress this legislation up as a right that a worker can have and then to make sure to stitch in all the clauses to ensure that a worker can never access that right is actually quite cynical.  To be honest with the Minister of State, workers see through that.  They see what is going on here.  They also see that they have successfully worked for two years remotely and they want to be able to do that again.</p>  <p>  I will refer briefly to the right to disconnect and legislation that I introduced.  I thank Gareth Murphy and the Financial Services Union for all of their work on this.  They have been leading the charge.  We know that in recent times the lines between work and personal time have been eroded.  Some of that is due to technology but that is not an excuse.  It may be a reason but it is not an excuse for it to happen.  We know that the State is playing catch-up in terms of workers' rights and it is an extremely important workers' right to have the right to disconnect.  People cannot be always on.  For their own well-being and work-life balance, it is absolutely essential that the right to disconnect is given and granted to workers so that they have a legal right to switch off and a legal right to their personal time.</p></speech>

If there is one thing that came out clearly from Covid-19, it is that workers are able to work from home and indeed that for many it gives a far better work-life balance.  No sooner had the T&aacute;naiste's right to request remote working Bill been introduced than the T&aacute;naiste said it needed changes to be fit for purpose.  I think describing it as not fit for purpose is actually too charitable.  It should have been described as dead on arrival.  This raises a simple question: why bother even introducing it in the first place?  It kind of fooled us.  It made us think that the Government was actually a supporter of remote working.  Last summer, the T&aacute;naiste wrote an op-ed in <i>The Irish Times</i>in which he said &quot;The benefits are obvious - less commuting, fewer transport emissions, better quality of life for workers, more time with family and friends.&quot;  I do not think any workers would dispute those benefits.  As has already been pointed, this Bill was not written with workers in mind - it was a Bill written for employers.  It was about a right to refuse.  It would have been better not to have been written at all because it was so evidently a smokescreen that it was really an insult to many workers' intelligence.  It would have been better and more honest if it had just been said that they were fine with people having long commutes and that congestion on our roads is not of concern.  Sure what can we do about more pollution?  Sure who needs better work-life balance?  Did the T&aacute;naiste not say that he is for people who get up early in the morning?</p> <p>Due to the weaknesses of this Bill, there will be many more people having to get up a hell of a lot earlier in the morning to catch the bus, train or DART or to beat the traffic on the M50, N40 or M6.  It has to be said that people will get home much later in the evening as well.  With the evenings getting longer, people will be spending more time commuting and there will be more traffic, more pollution and much more stress.  It was astonishing to see so much anger in people when the Bill came out because people thought that one thing that came out of Covid was that they could see that things could be done differently.  We could see that people can actually work from home and there can be a better work-life balance.  However, all of that and all of those lessons that we learned from Covid were completely and utterly ignored.  Rather than seeing this as an opportunity to do things differently, that, again, was completely ignored.  The Government had an opportunity and it completely missed it.  As my colleague Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly said, there is a difference between not opposing and supporting.</p></speech>

God forbid that a worker, couple or family might want to rent or buy a house of their own.  I know the Government cannot solve all these issues overnight, but there are things it can do.  I welcome that the Taoiseach appears to finally be listening to Sinn F&eacute;in and our proposals and is going to reduce the cost of petrol and diesel.  Sinn F&eacute;in has solutions and has been putting forward housing solutions.  We are willing to act quickly because our priority is ordinary people.  Giving workers the right to flexibility is something that we and the Government can do.  It can be done by this Government quickly to relieve some of the burden on workers.</p>  <p>  For people with young families in particular, being able to work around their children improves their quality of life and makes them happier and more productive workers.  That is what we should be looking to do, not keeping people in cars all day long, commuting for hours on end and coping with the cost of travel.  People who are working all week and putting in hard hours to put food on the table are finding that their money stretches less and less each week.  We are looking for ways to give those workers a break.  I want to thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion, because that is what this looks to do.</p>  <p>  For many people, working from home during the pandemic was the one silver lining in an otherwise dark two years.  Therefore, it is very disappointing that the Government&rsquo;s right to remote working legislation seems to be more focused on the Government&rsquo;s right to refuse remote working.  Workers and families are struggling.  Everywhere we look, there are rising costs in food, fuel, heating, housing and clothing.  We should now cut workers some slack and give people a right, where possible, to fit work around life instead of trying to fit life around work.  All people are looking for is a chance and this Government should help to give them that.</p></speech>

However, in recent times, because of Covid, it has become one of the main things that people are doing.  Many people find that it works well for them but many find that it does not work well for them.  I am slightly out of breath because I was racing to get here.  Perhaps I should have done the speech from home as well.  I know about this because my son has been working from home for the past number of months and it has worked very well, but today he is in Dublin.  He comes to Dublin one day a week.  That is the kind of thing that people need to be able to do.  They need to have flexibility.  I think everyone wants to have flexibility and to be able to do this in a way that will work for them and their families.  However, there has to be a way that we protect workers&rsquo; rights.  It is important that people can have a system that ensures their rights as employees can be maintained.  They have the right to be part of a union and they have the right to bargain.  The employer cannot put pressure on them to do the things that have been so much of a problem in the past in the conventional way that we have worked.  We do not want to see the rights that have been so hard fought for and won in the conventional workspace being lost because people are now choosing to work from home and using that particular model of work.</p>  <p>  Another issue that I have come across and is an important part of it, as Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly mentioned, is in regard to the salaries that people are offering.  I have recently come across a situation where a young man looking for work and he applied for a job in a particular line of work and was offered it.  However, when he got the contract, the salary scale on it, because he would be working from home or a hub, was dropped by almost &euro;9,000 per year from what others were getting for doing the exact same work because he was not going to have to go to Dublin for the job, in this capital city, where most people have to go to work, particularly in the type of employment he is in.  There needs to be some way of ensuring that we introduce legislation to prevent this from happening.  Rates of pay have to be maintained and the rights that people have must be maintained.  We must ensure the workplace, wherever it is, is a place where people are protected.  People must know that they can have a proper means of delivering not just for themselves and their families, but also for the future of the whole community.  Many communities depend on working from home and working in hubs to-----</p></speech>

I cannot stress enough the importance of remote working to our rural towns and villages.  While it is hard to see anything positive in relation to Covid, it has been life-changing for rural Ireland in allowing people to work from home, to reduce commute times and to remain in their communities, which is of huge benefit to the local economy and also to their work-life balance.</p>  <p>  Of course there have been challenges, particularly in relation to broadband.  The initial target last year was that 115,000 homes were to be connected.  However, that target was reduced to 60,000.  As of the end of January this year, only 37,000 premises were passed.  That is of concern to those of us in homes and business in rural areas that do not have broadband access in this day and age.  Given that targets are being missed, it is concerning in regard to how long the roll-out will now take.</p>  <p>  That brings me to the importance of remote working hubs, in which the Government has invested significantly.  They are very important to rural communities, especially in areas where people do not have broadband at home.  They have worked out very well.  In areas of my constituency where we have not seen job creation, such as Ballinlough, Tulsk and Ballinasloe, the option to go to a remote working hub to work remotely has been of huge benefit, particularly for those of us living in rural areas.  It has, as I said, been life-changing.  For the first time in my lifetime, we have seen people choosing to move into rural areas.  That is something we must protect, sustain, develop and grow.  We will not do that with the proposed legislation that the T&aacute;naiste is bringing forward.  The legislation is very concerning, especially for those who have actually picked up and moved their lives into rural areas and those who want to work remotely, be it in local remote working hubs or from home.  The Government needs to look at this legislation through a rural lens, in particular.  I have asked the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to engage with the T&aacute;naiste and I know she will do so.  It is very important that we get this legislation right and it is very important that we look at it through a rural lens as well.</p></speech>

The impact of the pandemic on the nation&rsquo;s mental health is significant.  We will be dealing with the fallout from the trauma and tragedy for many years to come.  We need to recognise this as we formalise our policies and in how we organise society from here on in.  A good start to this is recognising the opportunity the pandemic gave us to fully explore flexible and remote work.  It has revolutionised and advanced the way we imagine work and there are many benefits to be harvested for all our well-being if we are bold enough to take that step for the better.</p>  <p>  As this motion outlines, a more flexible working arrangement can be better for employers and employees.  Empirical evidence has shown that companies and organisations that introduced employees to this method of work saw their trade increase by 25% to 30% and staff well-being increased twofold.  Flexible working arrangements are also better for the climate, for work-life balance, for family-friendliness and for inclusion and diversity in the workplace, to name but a few.  As the saying goes, anything worth doing is worth doing well.  The Government&rsquo;s remote working Bill has failed to do this.  More robust protective legislation for employees is required.  For instance, subjective reasons to allow an employer to deny a remote working request are not proportionate or transparent.  </p> <p>This is exacerbated by the fact that the appeals mechanism outlined in the draft heads of the Bill is far too ineffective and weak.  For example, the right to disconnect, the right to set working hours, protection against the reduction of pay and access to overtime or premium pay must be built into the system.  Furthermore, we need to rural-proof any legislation and policy that deals with flexible and remote working.  For many years, rural transport has been the bane of ordinary workers' lives.  Flexible working arrangements offer them a real opportunity not to have to spend most of the day in a car or in the rain and cold at bus stops.  To accomplish this and to allow them do their jobs properly, the infrastructure must be provided.</p> <p> If I had &euro;1 for every time a constituent complained to me about the lack of sufficient broadband in County Wexford, I could fund many more remote working hubs in the county.  This must be taken into consideration when we are discussing the real need to respond in this House to our new ways of working.  We must embrace and plan for our future.  Without doubt, flexible and remote working will play a major part in the modern workforce.</p> <p> I support this motion and I thank the Labour Party for bringing it forward.</p></speech>

Senator Sherlock has put a great deal of work into it.  It is a very timely motion.  Prior to Covid, I would have been a sceptic about flexible working.  I always believed it would not work.  Following on from Covid, I am a strong advocate for it.  It can make a significant difference to employers and employees.  I understand why employers would be reluctant.  It is a big change, but the reality is there is no going back.  Everything has changed.  From an employer's perspective, the improvement in the employee's work-life balance means the employee will be happier and as a result will work more efficiently and effectively.  It is a win-win for everybody.  The environmental benefits are huge as well.  As mentioned by Deputy Mythen, people will not be stuck in cars or at bus stops.  It is a win-win for everybody.  The Government needs to embrace flexible working.  I do not get any sense that it is looking to do that.  There are significant opportunities for employers if they are open-minded about it and if they embrace and engage with the process.</p>  <p>  The conversation on remote working has been gradually growing over the years.  In the eyes of many, the conversation on remote working was not moving fast enough.  We have seen huge technological developments which can enable remote working.  We all know now that there are times when in-person meetings are not necessary.  It seems pointless sometimes when the work could be done in half the time over a Zoom call.  There have been huge improvements in technology.  With the onset of Covid-19, when thousands of workers were suddenly required to work remotely, the technological developments made it clear how smooth a transition it can be.  If the employers embrace this, it will be a win-win for everybody.</p></speech>

I am aware it had intended to bring a particular Bill through to Committee Stage during its Private Members' time.  I have worked on similar legislation.  Bill Browder came over and met parliamentarians to try to get a Magnitsky Act concluded here.  I share the Labour Party's frustration.  I have equally found the process a very frustrating experience.  There is no doubt that there is a requirement for a money message, but there is goodwill across the House to get a Magnitsky Act in place in this country similar to what has been done in other jurisdictions.  I would hope the goodwill that is there to do that would be taken up on the Government side.</p>  <p>  On the motion, I do not believe there can be any going back to old work practices.  The pandemic has been hugely difficult for people right across society, but there are things that happened during the pandemic that we should embrace.  There were changes that have proved to be positive.  One of those was the more flexible working arrangements, which we should be trying to retain.  Some 80% of workers were engaged in remote working at some point during the pandemic.  For employers, remote working has resulted in increased productivity and better retention of workers.  It has opened up the workforce to people who could not access certain forms of employment, particularly in the regions.  For workers, remote working provided a greater work-life balance and more flexible hours and reduced stress.  Some 93% of those in employment in the mid-east region of Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow who could work remotely said that they would like to continue to do so after the pandemic restrictions are removed.  Those who listen to the morning traffic reports will know that every morning it is the same roads that are congested.  Some of those roads in my constituency, which is described as "the commuter belt".  According to the CSO study, that was the area that most favoured remote working.</p>  <p>  The Government plan for the right to request remote working is saying something in theory but not delivering it in practice.  There are massive loopholes built in to allow employers to turn down requests.  It includes grounds such as potential negative impact on quality.  It is impossible to evaluate that.  The idea that a person could appeal to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is only proposed on procedural grounds, in the same way as, for example, a judicial review of a decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not relate to the actual decision but how the decision was arrived at.</p>  <p>  The public service needs to play a lead role in the move towards remote and blended work and to show an example in that regard.  If it is done right, it has the potential to transform the labour market, particularly for women, disabled persons and carers, many of whom have been forced to give up work or have been locked out of the jobs market.  Remote working was put in place in a hurry because of Covid.  It is not the way we would have liked it to happen but it has been a positive development for so many.  However, there are negatives as well.  There is evidence of workers struggling to switch off, working longer hours and working while ill.  Women are taking on childcare responsibilities on top of a full working day.  Remote working is not and cannot be a substitute for childcare.  There is a real problem at the moment with accessing childcare.  We are starting to see evidence of that.  I am being contacted daily on the issue.  There is a real struggle to access childcare.  When more women than men take advantage of remote working, in some cases it impacts on their careers.  We need to keep an eye on that.  We need to overcome the cultural beliefs about committed workers, who are people who work beyond the hours they are supposed to work.  Remote working also makes people invisible in the workplace and it lessens the opportunities for promotions and mentorship.  We have to make sure to avoid the negative impacts.  We can do that by making sure men equally take up remote working.</p>  <p>  As we know, workers' rights are better protected where there is free collective bargaining.  There should be an embracing of that where these issues can be worked through.  Remote working can mean that workers are more isolated.  It is important to strike a balance between the right to remote working and the right to work in the workplace.  Remote working is also important in that it helps us to meet our climate targets.  We are committed to reducing car travel by 2030, with a reduction of 500,000 car journeys per day by 2030.  Remote working will have a positive impact in terms of achieving those targets.  It is very difficult to see how we would achieve that in the absence of such a big initiative.  </p>  <p>  The CSO survey shows that up to 73% of remote workers take fewer car trips, that there has been a reduction in the gender commuting gap and that where women have childcare and domestic work responsibilities, they opt for shorter commutes and the limited pool of lower paid jobs.</p>  <p>There is a degree of this being reversed by virtue of the fact that we are starting to see people in the regions taking up positions that would not have been available previously.  Remote working has had a positive impact from that point of view.</p> <p> The right to remote working is crucial for easing housing pressures in urban areas and will facilitate rural regeneration.  If remote working were available, nearly 50% of first-time buyers would rent outside of Dublin, 38% of workers would consider moving house and 7% have already done so.  In the UK, there is a legal right to request working from home, but employees must be employed for 26 weeks before they can make that request.  The availability of remote working is often the difference between someone taking up a job and not taking it up.  We must consider all aspects of remote working to ensure that there is no negative.</p> <p> The legislation as presented contains too many loopholes and is an example of doing something in theory without doing it in practice.  This has to work in practice.  We must embrace remote working as a positive change and take it up to the furthest possible extent.  It would benefit us all.</p></speech>

The Government's response, whereby it will allow the motion to pass, reeks of cynicism again.  Last night, the Government allowed to pass a motion that lacerated its approach to waiting lists for children with special needs but has no intention of doing anything about the issue.  Today, it will allow to pass a motion that correctly rejects as inadequate the Government's proposals on the right to request remote working and calls on the Government to introduce:</p> <blockquote> 	radical alternative legislative arrangements which ensure that:  	&mdash; all workers have a right to request flexible work;<br /><br />&mdash; there is a presumption in favour of flexible work; and<br /><br />&mdash; a reason for refusal relied upon by an employer must be objectively justifiable, appropriate and proportionate.  </blockquote>  <p>Is the Government actually going to do these things?  No, it is not.  This is utterly cynical, as the Government refuses to come out with its real position because it would face public criticism over it.</p><p>We know that the Government will not do these things because the Minister responsible, the T&aacute;naiste, gave an interview two days ago where he spelled out his view.  He presented himself as being very reasonable.  He stated: &quot;One side almost wants the right to demand remote working, and that's not practical ... And then another side thinks there should be no law at all, and no right to it at all.&quot;  He placed himself conveniently in the middle by saying:</p> <blockquote> 	I do think there should be a legal right to request remote working.  But I also accept that it can't be an absolute right because some business just can't be done remotely. </blockquote>  <p>This is ludicrous.  The Government's proposal is gesture politics at its very worst.  Is it the Government's position that it is currently illegal for workers to say to their employers that they would like to have remote working?  All the Government is proposing is that it would be legal to request and then the employer would have the right to refuse on any ground at all.  Workers are already able to request remote working.  What they need is a right to remote working where they are able to do so.  What the Government is doing is as ludicrous as saying that, instead of introducing a sick pay Bill, it will introduce a Bill allowing workers to request sick pay, or a right to request to be paid the minimum wage.</p><p>This is about the T&aacute;naiste and the other members of the Government getting themselves in the media, talking about remote working and embracing this new way of doing things post Covid while actually refusing to do anything that might inconvenience big business and its corporate lobbyists in the form of IBEC.  The result is a Bill that the trade unions have rightly described as utterly pointless.  We need a genuine right to remote working where bosses are only able to refuse working from home in exceptional circumstances where it is not possible for that work to be done remotely.</p><p>The idea of the Government setting itself up as a neutral arbiter between two sides is not evidenced.  The evidence shows that the Government wrote the legislation in cahoots with big business.  Let us compare the lobbying and interactions between ICTU and the Government on this, which are extremely minimal, with the number of meetings that took place between IBEC and the Government in advance of the drafting of the Bill's heads.  The lobbying register shows more than 100 sessions of business lobbying the Government on remote working and five cases of IBEC lobbying.  At one meeting,-----</p></speech>

An employer can say "No" on the grounds that it believes the employee lives too far away or too near.  What does that mean?  There are not just 13 reasons, but any ground at all, given that "the proposal requested is not suitable on business grounds."  The heads explicitly state that the 13 reasons are not an exhaustive list, so any reason whatsoever can be used.  As such, what the Government has introduced is a right to refuse remote working.  It needs to be changed radically.  If the Government does not do that, then it is failing all of those workers who want access to remote working.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste likes to present it as part of a package showing that Fine Gael is fighting for workers' rights, is introducing remote working and sick pay rights, has increased the national minimum wage, is tackling low pay and so on.  Let us look at a real situation, though.  A new order for contract cleaners is coming into effect on 1 April and will increase their wages from &euro;11 an hour to &euro;11.55.  In April of next year, they will increase to &euro;11.90.  In April 2024, which is more than two years away, they will increase to &euro;12.40.  I heard the Minister of State on 96FM radio in Cork the other morning.  He was jubilant about this increase for contract cleaners.  To be clear, any increase in workers' wages is welcome on this side of the House, but let us take a look at this situation.  These were key workers in a pandemic.  They got down on their hands and knees to scrub walls and floors, including in Leinster House.  In the middle of an inflation crisis and during the week of International Women's Day, though, the Government is promising them pay increases that, in two years, will bring them up to less than the living wage that was calculated last year.  That says a great deal about Fine Gael and its workers' rights.</p>  <p>  The Bill sets out 13 grounds on which an employer can refuse a request.  The point has been made that similar legislation is in place in the UK.  It was introduced by a Tory Government in 2014, but that legislation only gives eight reasons on which an employer can refuse.  The percentage of workers in the UK who have no form of flexible working has decreased from 74% in 2014 to 70%, representing just a 4% improvement.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party in government are introducing an even more restrictive Bill.</p>  <p>  Although we will vote in favour of the Labour motion, I have some issues with it.  I do not have time to outline them.</p> <p>It is important not to let the State off the hook on its responsibilities for childcare provision.  The thrust of the proposal is positive.  We will support the motion.</p></speech>

I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward the Private Members' motion so that we can discuss it today.</p><p>I acknowledge and commend a group called Grow Remote, a community-led enterprise that was working in this field long before Covid came into being.  Grow Remote provides access to employers and employees to match up to work remotely, whereby firms and companies want people to work remotely and people who want to work remotely can be matched up.  This has been, and continues to be, a phenomenal success, and has been done in a very simple way.</p><p>I also wish to commend the Department of Rural and Community Development on their efforts, along with the Western Development Commission and the Atlantic Economic Corridor task force, in setting up many digital hubs along the Atlantic economic corridor.  Even in my constituency of Galway East a number of hubs are in place where people can go to work when they do not have broadband connection to their homes.It is important that if people are working remotely they have access to broadband.  The national broadband plan will do that in time but the digital hubs are a very good interim measure to ensure people have access to the Internet so they can conduct their business.  If people are working in different parts of the country, they have access to these digital hubs to call in to do their business online, and then they can go on to wherever they want again.  The fact that there is a platform set-up that gives access, sets out where these places are, and who to contact, is a great tool.</p><p>I also commend the Western Development Commission and the Whitaker Institute of Innovation and Societal Change in National University of Ireland Galway, which produced a report, Remote Working: Opportunities, Challenges and Policy Implications.  This is a very timely report and it issues a number of recommendations, some of which I will address shortly.  The report's executive summary considers the issues that Government must deal with, as well as those that organisations and employers must deal with.  On remote working, the report states:</p> <blockquote> 	  	Wider financial supports are needed to provide appropriate equipment for those who are obliged to work from home ...  An awareness raising campaign is needed to promote health and safety guidance and user-friendly templates for supporting those who are working from home. <br /><br />Government should consider extending the right to request flexible working to all workers and not just those with caring duties.  In the context of the Government&rsquo;s Remote Work strategy, the right to request remote work should be explored.  [I believe it should not alone be explored; it should be there as a right]<br /><br />As part of a national strategy for remote working a review of current tax reliefs around e-Working and expenses should be undertaken, to ensure that tax reliefs defray the costs involved in remote working.  A review of the e-Working allowance rate should be undertaken, considering both costs and savings for both employers and employees realised through the practice of remote working.<br /><br />The take-up of available tax allowances to enable employees to remote work should be promoted especially in the context of the wider social and economic benefits [that accrue].  </blockquote>  <p>In a constituency such as Galway East when listening to the AA Roadwatch radio bulletins on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;, or on &quot;Drivetime&quot; in the evening, there is constant mention of the traffic jams in Claregalway, B&oacute;thar na dTreabh, and so on, all trying to get around Galway city.  If some of these commuters were to work from home, even in a blended way of perhaps two or three days per week, the volume of carbon emissions saved would be a huge benefit.  We talk about bringing electric cars and doing all of these different things to try to reduce our carbon emissions, and we have an opportunity here staring us in the face.  We need to make sure that we afford the opportunity to anybody who can work remotely, and for whom it suits, as well as suiting their type of work.</p><p>In fairness, there are issues relating remote working and working from home that have to be addressed.  People who enter the workforce initially need to have peer training, and they need to work with their colleagues to gain the necessary experience for them to develop their careers.  One cannot have trainees working remotely.  That is an issue.</p><p>From the employers' point of view, this is a win-win situation.  The amount spent on providing facilities such as real estate, maintenance of huge office spaces, running costs, insurance costs and all that goes with this can be reduced to a degree that will afford more profit for these employers and will reduce the overall cost of emissions.  We must consider this for the public service so that people can work from home, and should work from home as much as they can, to allow us to not spend so much money in providing offices and spaces, which following the pandemic are required to be much bigger than before the pandemic.  There is a lot of things that can happen here.</p><p>Digital hubs are a key factor right now and they need to continue to be expanded.  By expanding those digital hubs we are creating remote working in localities that are very important for regional development.  I always cite the example of one particular hub that was set up almost ten years ago in Headford, County Galway.  The cost of setting it up was &euro;4,000.  It was done in Moyne Villa soccer club.  Today there are ten desks in that place with three people working there permanently for perhaps three or four days per week.  They bring their children to school and bring them home in the evening and in between they can do their work without having to travel to Galway, or in some cases Dublin, on a daily basis and be away from their families.  It is a very good example of what can be done with small money.  We need the Government to make sure that these hubs are set up in small towns and the villages to allow people to work  locally, raise their families locally, and provide economic advantages.</p><p>I believe that we have an opportunity to change the way we work.  We need to have blended working as opposed to full-time remote working.  It does not work for everybody and it does not work for every organisation.  It is important that we put legislation in place that is effective and gives people the opportunity, both employers and employees, to make sure they can work remotely and still enjoy the same opportunities for promotion and development of their careers, and not just be based in offices all of their lives.  The fundamental thing about remote working is that it offers us potential for people, for families and for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

The opportunity to highlight the positives of working from home is really presented here.  Remote and flexible working can offer a renewed vigour to the Government plans, if the Government has the plans.  The post offices have been floundering for decades and the Government has been promising everything and giving them nothing.</p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister of State that there are issues here for smaller employers.  We must think of those at any time.  It is fine to pass legislation, and I hear people in here with stronger and stronger demands, and complaining about lobbying, but we must think of the smaller employers as well.  I salute the workers and I am self-employed myself.  I employ quite a number of people and we have excellent staff relations, but in my business people could not work from home.  Many businesses just could not do it because physically it would not be possible, as we work with machinery and everything else.  We must be reasonable here.  It is grand in theory but we must understand that it does not always work.</p>  <p>  We have a community house at An Caisle&aacute;n Nua for which I thank South Tipperary County Council.  At the time I was chair of that voluntary housing board and we set up a community house with excellent facilities.  We have given this space to different people for remote working during Covid.  The Covid pandemic has changed everything as we know it, but we must be sensible.  We just cannot keep ushering in legislation through here with no analysis on the impact it might have on employers.  I am sure the Minister of State is listening and has written to them, and especially now when they are on their knees trying to deal with the cost of living, the cost of oil, the cost of insurance, the cost of electricity and the cost of everything.</p> <p>Legislation is fine and dandy but we need a balance here.  While we need to remember mol an &oacute;ige agus tiochfaidh s&iacute;, we must also praise and support employers because we do not do that much of the time.  We must also nurture and look after the workers.  A fair day's pay for a fair day's work is important.  We must be sensible and understanding about this issue.  We must deal with people face to face, sit down around a table and discuss what is possible.</p> <p> I will raise the issue of traffic jams on the N24 and many other roads.  Our carbon footprint has been mentioned.  The roads are clogged up.  I travelled on the N11 this morning and it was crazy with traffic.  We must think about the impact on our carbon footprint and the costs for people who are going to work.  We must look at all those issues in the round.  As I said, this is sensitive legislation and must be dealt with sensitively.  It must cover everybody.</p></speech>

It is crucial to attract workers to rural Ireland after the pandemic with new job opportunities, remote working hubs and supports for those working from home.  Without remote working, rural decline will continue beyond its current trajectory.</p>  <p>  The Government's five-year strategy, Our Rural Future, promises to invest in rural regions after the pandemic, with a particular focus on enabling remote working in rural communities, revitalising town centres and rolling out broadband.  However, the biggest flaw of this plan remains the complete lack of satisfactory broadband services in many rural communities across the country.  Gaggin, near Bandon, is fighting for its right to get a mast put up by Three Ireland in an area that cannot be seen from the road.  The local authority decided to object to the mast.  People are trying to work from home and the erection of a mast would sort that out.  Work was going on last year, as was mentioned by RT&Eacute;, in the church car park.  People were able to work at home.  The local authority decided the mast is too high and must be taken down.  The issue is now before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That kind of negativity gives people no chance to work at home.</p>  <p>  During the pandemic, we all discovered new ways of working.  That can, and should, help our rural communities.  In order for rural order to play a central role in our recovery from the impact of Covid-19, we need a radical step change to improve and upgrade the infrastructure, including the broadband infrastructure.  I know from my constituents that the lack of broadband in parts of Cork South-West means there is no way people can live there because they cannot work from home.  The Government needs to work with private wireless broadband operators while we wait for the roll-out of this dream national plan that never comes to the aid of local communities.</p>  <p>  We all know the cost of diesel and petrol now.  It has been leaked that the paltry sum of 15 cent or 20 cent will be reduced from the price of a litre of petrol or diesel by the Government.  That is shocking and disgraceful.  It is a measure that opposes families, work and everything else.</p>  <p>  There are other areas we need to consider.  We should examine whether the larger companies should pay the energy costs of their employees who are working from home.  That is another issue that must come into play.  People are paying high prices to travel to work.  They are paying the high price of energy costs if they are working from home.  The least that the larger companies with employees working from home can do is to pay for their energy costs.  That is something that needs to be looked at further.</p></speech>

People in rural areas without broadband are excluded from those jobs.  They are being discriminated against.</p>  <p>  In 2019, did we think it was possible to achieve the situation we are in?  We have been told in the past that many things could not happen yet when the pandemic happened, things changed, and many of them for the better.  The option to work from home has been an extraordinary success in many jobs.  However, a person from a rural area without broadband is discriminated against.</p>  <p>  Flexible working has been proven to boost morale and improve physical and mental well-being.  It has the rewarding benefits of flexible working hours for the employer.  Flexible working has reduced costs, increased productivity and creativity, and allowed for ease of management.  It has improved well-being, staff retention and the ability to attract talent.  Some 60% of human resource directors have seen an increase in work productivity, further identifying that businesses benefit from flexible working hours.</p>  <p>  A hybrid model will develop whereby staff can have access to the workplace as required.  For this to work successfully, we need the national broadband roll-out that is still being promised to people in our areas and might take until 2025.  Black spots are still common in County Limerick.  Broadband is important for everyone but it has been provided to those in built-up and city areas before people in rural areas.  People in rural Ireland are being discriminated against because of the lack of infrastructure.  How do we correct this?  We must get more infrastructure and fast-track broadband for rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Working from home has benefited many families.  Employees can go to the office two days a week and be at home three days a week.  That has improved family life, morale and mental health.  If we can find a balance, this can work for all.  However, we must look at the roll-out of broadband in rural areas and not just cherry-pick the areas where companies think they can fast-track the roll-out because there are 1,000 houses while 100 houses in a rural area are left without broadband.  That is discrimination against the people of rural Ireland.  We need investment.  We need a plan to be rolled out far more quickly than by 2025.  We need it now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="11:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900017#P00400"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the motion.  As we all know, yesterday was International Women&rsquo;s Day, a very important day to recognise the social, political and economic achievements of the women in our lives and societies, and across the globe.  It is also an opportunity for us to focus greater attention on women&rsquo;s rights, gender equality and equal treatment and representation.  With that in mind, I was shocked and saddened to see the results of the Indeed's International Women&rsquo;s Day employment survey this week.  The survey revealed that up to 40% of women in Ireland have considered quitting their job in the past 12 months due to burnout and the pressures of family life.</p>  <p>  Let us reflect on that for a moment.  Well over one third of our female workforce have contemplated quitting their jobs due to the fact that they are feeling overstretched or that they can no longer manage balancing their working life with their family life.  That demonstrates that this is not an issue for individual employers or organisations but a systemic issue that requires a widespread policy approach.  It demonstrates the specific challenges women still face in the workplace and is a stark reminder that we still have a very long way to go in advancing gender equality in this country.  Efforts should be made to better understand how to properly support our female workers to ensure they are not feeling overwhelmed and overstretched.  Employers must create supportive working environments and address the challenges women face in the workplace.  Women have much to contribute to our workforce but their career paths are hampered by burnout and by their decision to have children.  This is a burden felt mostly by women and not men. </p>  <p>  Women should not feel this way.  It is completely unacceptable and it is an absolute shame on our society.  Mothers should not have to put their careers on hold but should instead be given flexibility to work around childcare.  A part of allowing this flexibility would be to introduce flexible and remote working.</p>  <p>  The right to request remote work Bill does not go far enough in ensuring that people are entitled to work remotely.  Covid-19 has shown us that many jobs can be done remotely and employers' excuses that this cannot be done do not hold up anymore.  Employers should be required to allow the option of remote working in cases where it is possible.</p>  <p>  As well as providing support for our struggling female workforce, the introduction of flexible and remote work would reduce carbon emissions caused by the commute to work and would also allow and improve access to work to those who face obstacles in taking up employment, such as people with disabilities, those with long-term health conditions and those from rural communities.</p>  <p>  There are, however, also risks as well as benefits and they must be highlighted.  There is no doubt but that unscrupulous employers would use the fact that people are working from home to abuse their workforces and squeeze more out of them, as they would see it.  I have heard stories of people working from home whose work supervisors have arranged work meetings for 10 o'clock on a Friday night.  That is absolutely crazy.  People need to be aware that while they work from home, they have a right to switch off.  That is vitally important, and not all employers will recognise that right.  Workers must stand up for themselves and ensure they avail of that right.  Workers must ensure that when work is finished, it is finished.  Employers cannot be abusing people in such a way.</p> <p>People also have to be responsible.  There might be a temptation to work late or take a few hours off in the middle of the day and work on but that could lead to more problems.  We should be working to live, not living to work.  That is vitally important and must be recognised by everybody, including the Government.</p> <p> By allowing better access to employment for all, we would have a much better and more inclusive workforce, which is what we should aspire to.  Remote working has allowed many of my constituents in Donegal to take up employment in companies that are based in Dublin or even further afield, which they previously would not have been able to do.  It has also given many of my constituents the freedom to return to Donegal, to their families and friends and the place they call home.  Remote working has been a relief to my constituency, and for many constituencies in the west, in which there has been a decline at an incredible rate over the last few decades of population, activity, services and businesses.  Remote working has breathed life into our towns again.  We all saw the proof of this during the pandemic.  My town of Killybegs, which has for so long been a picture of dereliction and abandonment, has a new lease of life, with many new entrepreneurial ventures throughout the town.  Businesses and companies had been doing well but the town itself had been declining.  It just shows the great things people can do when given the opportunity and the flexibility to do it.</p> <p> This is why it is so important to introduce flexible and remote working, to revitalise our rural areas and to give equal opportunity to all.  There is no doubt that women mostly bear the brunt of having to balance work and family life, between pregnancy, maternity leave and childcare, as well as menopause and caring responsibilities.  The 2016 census showed that women make up over six in ten carers.  These are all women&rsquo;s issues that should be looked into further and addressed.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth of the introduction of gender pay gap reporting this week.  However, much more needs to be done to address the issues I have outlined today.  A start to this would be the introduction of flexible and remote work.  I again voice my support for this motion and thank the Labour Party for bringing this issue to the forefront on this very important week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="11:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900018#Q00200"><p>I thank the Labour Party for submitting this motion and facilitating this discussion.  I listened carefully to the Deputies who have spoken today, both online in the earlier part of the debate and in person in the second half.  There is a common and shared objective among them to make remote and flexible working a permanent feature of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce.</p>  <p>  I am sorry if I got a bit argumentative earlier but it is hard to accept when somebody comes in here and gives out that others have made submissions and had a chance to discuss this over the last year when that same person did not bother making the effort to make a submission during the public consultation on this matter.  I am not talking about all Members of this House because plenty have contributed to this debate over the last year but others have come in here as if this was the first time they have been asked to discuss remote working with the Government.  There was very strong public consultation around this matter and very interesting research submissions on it.  I personally thought there would have been a lot more submissions; not from politicians but in general.  However, the consultation helped us flesh out a conversation around the remote working legislation and bring it forward.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste is very clear on the legislation.  It is before a committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  He is very open to making changes if we can and we will take that opportunity.  We will work through that and we are trying to get the balance right.  I agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath on this.  We have to be sensible in our approach and try to achieve a balance that works for everybody, as best we possibly can.  The proposed legislation will put a process in place for a new approach, by setting out the procedures to request remote working.  That request will then be judged and independently assessed through a code of conduct and a plan that is put in place for each company.  We are working to improve the legislation.  We will see what comes back from the pre-legislative scrutiny process and see if we can enhance it.</p>  <p>  Much has been made of the list of reasons why an employer can refuse a request for remote working, but that refusal has to be backed up by a business case.  It is not just a case of saying the employee lives too close or something.  The employer has to go beyond that and explain why they are refusing the request.  It is not good enough just to pick a reason.  That is not the intention.  We have set out some areas where the conversation could be framed around those reasons.</p>  <p>  To be very clear, this is still an open conversation.  I hope the committee doing the pre-legislative scrutiny comes back very soon.  We will then work through its recommendations and report to this House.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet are very clear that we are not opposing any proposals because of any gimmick.  It is because the Bill is still a work in progress.  This is a very timely motion and a timely conversation.  The Labour Party and many others have strong views on this and want to go forward with the Bill.  That is fine.  Let us tease those out.</p>  <p>  The draft right to request remote working legislative proposals are being brought forward by the Government in response to the commitment to make remote working a permanent feature of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce in a way that can benefit all, economically, socially and environmentally.  The T&aacute;naiste published the remote working strategy over a year ago and it included a list of issues to be dealt with.  Some have already been dealt with through the code of practice and changes in the budget, initiatives with hubs such as mapping, and so on.  A lot is happening here.  Another commitment under that strategy was the legislation that we are now bringing forward.  The T&aacute;naiste has been leading this conversation.  It is certainly not one the Government is hiding from.  Like everybody who spoke today, we would like to make remote working a positive feature of our work environment going forward and get that balance right.</p>  <p>  In March 2020, people were sent home to try to work remotely in a way that was unplanned and not co-ordinated in many situations.  They had to balance work, family, care and Covid, and were in a panic in some cases.  It took a while to adapt and adjust but in most situations there was a positive outcome and employers and employees said the experience was positive and good.  To build on that, we want to make it a permanent feature where we can, where it makes sense and where the job suits.  It will not suit every job.  We know and accept that.  That is something we have to recognise and tease out.  It is about getting the balance right between employers and employees, protecting the jobs we have and growing more of them.  There are great benefits to remote working, including for families, communities, volunteering, climate, transport and many others.  There is so much positivity around remote working, be that at home or in a hub provided through LEOs, local authorities, enterprise plans, Enterprise Ireland or the Department.  A lot of effort has been made in that regard as well.</p>  <p>  According to the research from the public consultation, there is a strong interest in the hybrid model, that is, some days working in the office and some days working at home.  There is also very strong interest in working in a hub close to home.  We need to capture all those choices and options.  It is about giving people the choice and the option.  Flexibility in a workforce is key.  A major part of the success story of Irish job creation over the last number of years is that we are a very flexible nation when it comes to work.  We need to build on that and make sure everybody is protected so we can continue to have a jobs-led recovery from Covid.</p>  <p>  The right to request remote work has its roots in work done in recent years on promoting balanced regional development and the future of work.  This conversation had started in the Department even before Covid but because of Covid that conversation took off at pace.  More and more people can now see the benefits of remote working on all sides of the argument.  It is a question of how we can make that a permanent feature.  The 2020 programme for Government contains several commitments on the topic.  Remote work is already a key consideration in Government policy documents such as the national economic plan, the climate action plan, the town centre living initiative and the smarter travel policy.</p>  <p>  New regional enterprise plans to 2024 are currently being developed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  These are bottom-up plans being made in conjunction with all the stakeholders in the regions and various counties.  We have launched five of the nine plans and there are four more to be launched.  A big focus in all those enterprise plans is remote working, including the development of hubs and the development of procedures and processes to encourage people to work from home.  We can see the benefits to our regions, towns and villages throughout the country.  This can bring people back into those areas and breathe life into many towns and villages.  That is what we are going to try to build on in order to develop our communities.  The remaining enterprise plans will be published over the next few weeks.  The State is committed to increasing remote work adoption in Ireland through removing barriers, developing infrastructure, providing guidance, raising awareness and leading by example in this area.</p>  <p>  Some speakers said we need a plan for broadband.  They might want to wake up because there is a plan for broadband.  A spend of &euro;5 billion has been committed to make sure broadband is rolled out.  Of course we all want it to happen much quicker.  We would rather it was there tomorrow.  At least there is a plan in place and a contract signed.  Part of this remote work strategy is a commitment that negotiations around speeding up that plan and that delivery will continue, while recognising that there were delays from Covid.  It is wrong to make out that there is no plan.  Thankfully, the cheque is signed and people now know broadband is on its way.  Of course, every effort should be made to deliver that fibre broadband to everyone's home as quickly as we possibly can because access to top-class broadband is a game changer, for so many reasons.  There is no doubt about that.</p>  <p>  The right to request remote working Bill 2022 will provide employees with a right to request remote work and will provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing such a request can be based and judged independently.</p> <p>It will also provide legal clarity to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests.  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment commenced on 9 February and continued on 2 March.</p> <p> It is recognised that not all occupations, industries and roles within enterprise will be suitable for remote working.  Therefore, even in cases where employers want to support workers and can be as flexible as possible, it will not always be an appropriate or suitable option.  Technology changes by the day, however, and that could change as well.  The Opposition's call to introduce a blanket right to remote working is not realistic.  It does not recognise that, for some jobs, it just is not yet possible, and we need to bear that in mind.  Many companies already offer remote working and the Bill is not intended to undermine existing remote working agreements, which may offer more favourable terms overall.  Many of them offer remote or hybrid working from day one of the employment relationship.  The Bill is intended primarily to act as a floor-level protection and to ensure workers, particularly those employees who currently have no access to remote working, will have an entitlement to make a request and to understand the employer's clear obligations to deal with it.  The employer will not be able to ignore the request but must process it properly and fairly and with the option to work remotely if that is possible and if it makes sense.</p> <p> The Government wants to give employees a choice, which is why we are progressing the legislation and why we will not oppose the motion.  The conversation is a live one and the legislation will be enhanced and brought through these Houses in the weeks and months ahead.  The T&aacute;naiste is clear, and has said on a number of occasions, that as long as the business gets done and services are provided, employers should facilitate remote working where they can.  We will do all we can as a Government, through our remote working strategy and the legislation, to make that an attractive option for everybody involved.  I reiterate the research has captured that employers, employees and many organisations now recognise that remote working is, without doubt, a positive experience.  Of course, as I said, the way it was rushed in at the start of the pandemic came with complications, but many of them have been ironed out and we can build on that.  There are benefits for families, communities and the towns and villages where we live, by bringing life back into them through a positive remote working option, whether that is working at home or in hubs that will be developed in conjunction with the State or with employers, and that is what we want to build on.</p></speech>

I welcome and will support the motion.  If the Government were to read the wording properly, it would see it &quot;rejects as inadequate the Government proposals in the general scheme of the Right to Request Remote Work Bill, on the grounds that they: fail to provide that access to flexible work should be the default entitlement and not the exception; [and] fail to include a presumption that if work has been done remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic it is reasonably practicable for it to continue to be done remotely&quot;.  What we are arguing for, and what is the unanimous approach of the Opposition, is to reflect the fact there has been a paradigm shift in society, which has had a major benefit, not least for women.</p><p>I might give the practical example of a woman who works in the pharmaceutical sector.  She is a lone parent, highly skilled and educated.  Earlier in the Covid pandemic, she obtained a promotion.  Her employer now says she is expected to work overnight shifts in other parts of the country.  Given she received a promotion during the pandemic when she was able to take care of her childcare responsibilities, surely she should have a right to continue to work as she has been doing and not to have to work those overnight shifts.  There is a risk she will now have to leave that job because she will not be able to make alternative childcare arrangements.  All we are trying to do is to instil a presumption in favour of the right to have a flexible arrangement.  If nothing else, it is to ensure lone parents, in particular, who want to work but who cannot do so at present because of their childcare arrangements will be given that opportunity to be able to do so, such as in the case of the person I mentioned.</p><p>The Government's legislation, with all due respect to the Minister of State, will yank that out of the equation.  It is too weak.  The paradigm shift has occurred, as he will have seen on his commute to the Houses of the Oireachtas from wherever he resides, as will the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, when he travels along the M4.  They will see that people are back on the road, going to work.  The whole place is snarled up and many of those people would be just as productive if working from home or having that flexibility, but the Government's legislative proposal is too weak.  We argue that the Bill fails to live up to the ambitions of the remote work strategy published last year.  The Government has watered it down.  Let us give women, in particular, and men a chance.  I refer to women who have attained some autonomy, been able to come back into the workplace and achieved promotions, and who otherwise would not have been promoted because of that pull towards the need to provide childcare and the domestic arrangements they may have.  Let us give them a chance and embed it as a right.  Female full-time employment increased by an impressive 7.5% in the two-year period between the end of 2019 and the end of 2021.  That was as a result of the pandemic because people were able to make more flexible arrangements.</p><p>All we are asking for is a bit of common sense.  There is a significant opportunity to reflect the <i>zeitgeist</i>.  People want flexible working time, instilled as a right, and our motion speaks to that.</p></speech>

The Government's proposals, which would require employees to wait up to 26 weeks before they could ask to work remotely and a further 12 weeks before a decision is made, that is, a full pregnancy of 38 weeks before an employee might actually be given the right, go to the heart of all workers' rights legislation in this Republic.  A worker has the right to ask, but it will always be the employer's right to say "No".  It feels as though the Government handed its legislation to IBEC and asked it to script it, and then presented it to the House and was surprised people would have an issue with it.  We had a round-table discussion, organised by Senator Sherlock, at which we heard from Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council of Ireland, Liam Berney of ICTU, Louise Bayliss of SPARK, Gareth Murphy of the Financial Services Union, Fleachta Phelan of the Disability Federation of Ireland, and Alan Eustace, all of whom argued that we need to grasp this opportunity that has been presented to us during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  We are not suggesting a young worker will not want to go into the workplace.  I can appreciate that somebody who is starting out in life may have housing or accommodation difficulties whereby working from home may not really be an option for him or her, given that person may not wish to grasp the opportunity of working at the end of the bed, for example.  If, however, a worker in good faith has the opportunity to work from home, why do we once again have to place all the power in the hands of the employer?  It is as though there is a lack of trust at the heart of Irish legislation such that the worker will always try not to be honest.  If we are honest with ourselves as a legislative body, however, we will appreciate that the productivity of the worker would improve if he or she did not have to run on this treadmill of traffic congestion and rush and push in the morning and of having to deal with childcare arrangements.</p>  <p>  Indeed, this is a gender equality issue, given it will encourage more women into the workplace and to seek empowerment there too.  Furthermore, it goes hand in hand with the right to switch off.  It cannot be that in Irish workplaces, whether at home or in the traditional work setting, workers must be constantly contactable, whereby they do not have the right to switch off and are expected to receive a message or email at any hour of the day or night.</p> <p> We are trying to expose the fact that what the Government has brought forward in this right to flexible working legislation is actually the right of an employer to say "No".  There are 38 weeks before a worker can get a decision.  The reasons for refusal are so wide as to make the workers powerless.  In good faith the Labour Party has been working assiduously on this.  Senator Sherlock, as our workers' rights spokesperson, has been drafting legislation.  She had correctly pointed out the issues in the legislation.  A number of weeks ago, the T&aacute;naiste told me some employers were not happy with the Bill either.  It is quite clear nobody on either side, workers or employers, is necessarily impressed with the Government's legislation.  We cannot have a situation where somebody has to wait 26 weeks before applying to work remotely.  We cannot have a ridiculous situation where people have to wait 12 weeks to get an answer.  We cannot have the employers' rights of refusal to be so broad as to make the legislation worthless.  As my colleague Deputy Sherlock has said, it is a gender equality issue and it is a workers' rights issue.</p> <p> It is about taking from the pandemic all we have learned and bringing it into the mainstream of the workplace and workers' rights.  I hope the Taoiseach and representatives from the Government might listen to this.  My greatest regret of ten years ago at the time of the previous crisis is that we did not learn enough from the financial collapse and build a more robust economy on the basis of workers' rights and human interaction.  Having learned from what happened in the pandemic, we have an opportunity to do things much better.  This is why we have tabled the motion.  We do not want the Government just to support the motion; we want it to work on it and make the legislation better.</p></speech>

I appealed to him to bring forward a financial resolution to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel and to remove it entirely from home heating oil.  I am very glad to see that good sense has prevailed and the Taoiseach accepts the need to act.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach's approach as set out does not go far enough.  It is very important we get this right for people.  The proposal I put to the Taoiseach yesterday was to reduce excise duty so that we get the price at the pumps down to &euro;1.75 per litre.  The cut proposed by the Taoiseach does not get us anywhere near this point.  In fact, hikes overnight erode the benefit of the proposed cut.  In many places, prices per litre jumped to as high as &euro;2.20.  This means even following the Government's proposed intervention, people will wake up tomorrow and still pay &euro;2 per litre.  The Taoiseach acknowledged yesterday that this is not sustainable for people, and it is not.  They simply cannot afford &euro;2 per litre today and they will not be able to afford it tomorrow.</p>  <p>  I am very disappointed to see the proposal does nothing to bring down the outrageous price of home heating oil.  As the Taoiseach knows, it has doubled in the past year and last night the price shot up again.  People now face prices of between &euro;800 and &euro;900 for a half fill of oil.  This is crazy.  It is very stressful for workers and families trying to heat their homes.  The energy and fuel costs are a disaster for hauliers, school transport companies, taxi drivers and everybody.  They expect the Government to act speedily and decisively.  Will the Taoiseach recalibrate the intervention to make it fit the realities of the crisis and deliver meaningful relief immediately?</p>  <p>  I have received hundreds of messages this week from people regarding the real-life impact of these hikes.  I want to mention two of them, two women as it happens.  Amy, who has young children, told me she now chooses between driving the children to school or having a hot meal ready for them.  She describes what she is experiencing as torture.  She told me she has spent &euro;120 on diesel in the past eight days alone.  She told me her son has a hospital appointment on Monday and she seriously does not think she will be able to afford to take him even though he really needs to go.  Lorraine, who is in the process of saving for a mortgage, says it is costing her and her partner an extra &euro;50 a week each for fuel.  This is a total of &euro;100 a week in total.  She has calculated this at &euro;5,000 a year just to travel for work.  She describes her situation as soul destroying.</p>  <p>  N&iacute; th&eacute;ann an ch&eacute;im seo s&aacute;ch fada.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn an praghas ag na pumpa&iacute; a fh&aacute;il s&iacute;os go &euro;1.75 an l&iacute;tear, agus n&iacute; m&oacute;r don Rialtas gn&iacute;omh pr&aacute;inneach a dh&eacute;anamh chun costas ola t&eacute;imh a laghd&uacute;.  This is the day to get this right.  We will work with the Taoiseach to get this right.  We cannot have delay or half measures.  The financial resolution has to get the cost of petrol and diesel down to &euro;1.75 per litre and keep it there, by further cuts in excise if necessary.  We need action on home heating oil.</p></speech>

Everybody knows that global factors have caused the massive increase in the price of oil and the price of gas.  Oil is an internationally traded commodity.  We are price takers.  The price increases have been beyond the Government's control and the control of most governments across Europe.  The impact of the war in Ukraine has been stark in terms of the dramatic increase in the prices of oil and gas.  Yesterday, Deputy McDonald said she wanted a 25 cent reduction in petrol and diesel.  We cannot bring diesel down by 25 cent because of the energy directive.  The reduction of 15 cent in respect of excise on diesel is the most that can be provided for when taken in conjunction with the diesel rebate scheme in the context of the minimum rates of excise established in the EU energy tax directive.  The Deputy did not do her homework yesterday.  She came in here and said she wanted it done now.</p> <p>We want to reduce the pressure on people.  That is why we are reducing excise duty on petrol by 20 cent and the duty on diesel by 15 cent.  We would like to do more on diesel-----</p></speech>

We are working with our European Union colleagues to see whether we can introduce greater flexibility in that area.  The same applies to VAT.  Home heating oil is not subject to excise duty but is subject to VAT at 13.5%.  If we reduced that rate, we would run the risk of having to move to a higher rate, 23%, once the crisis is over because we have a derogation with regard to VAT on energy.  We want to protect that derogation, which keeps the VAT rate lower than it otherwise would be, for the long term.  The objective facts are that, in 2020, we spent &euro;3.4 billion on importing fuels into this country.  This year, we are spending &euro;6.2 billion.  That illustrates the extraordinary change that has occurred.  The price of home heating oil has gone up by &euro;400 in one year because of global factors and nothing else.  That needs to be acknowledged as the reality of the situation.</p></speech>

I welcome those measures but I want to ask him about his intentions with regard to some other measures that have recently been discussed.  Cutting 15 or 20 cent off the price of a litre of diesel or petrol will really only bring us back to where we were two weeks ago with regard to prices.  There is no indication that prices will stop increasing exponentially after those cuts are implemented.  There have recently been reports that the Government intends to introduce a swing mechanism, that is, to implement a cut in excise duty if prices go above a certain level and an increase if they fall below that level.  However, given how complicated the &euro;200 electricity grant has proven to be, with measures that were announced in December not yet reflected in bills, you have to ask how long it would take to design and implement a swing mechanism.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could update us on that.</p>  <p>  At least for the short term, the Government needs to cap prices at the pumps at a maximum level and to reduce excise duty and VAT to sustain prices at that level.  The Taoiseach said previously that VAT could not be reduced due to EU rules but peacetime rules should not apply during wartime.  Extraordinary measures must be taken to try to insulate ordinary workers and families from Putin's price shocks.  If prices are not capped, there is a further danger, which is the danger of price gouging.  How can the Government be confident that cuts to excise duty will actually be passed on to customers?  There were some anecdotal reports last night of prices on forecourts shooting up after the Government announcement.  Having just begun to emerge from a pandemic, we are now in yet another unprecedented and perilous situation, that of war in Europe.  The coming months will be very hard but we in this House have a duty to do all we can to ease the burden on ordinary workers, who are already struggling to cope with the increase in the cost of living.</p>  <p>  I have a few questions.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether the Government intends to introduce a swing mechanism to moderate fuel prices?  If not, will he advise as to whether the Government intends to cap fuel prices in the short term?  Is the Government advocating a VAT cut as part of the EU response to this disaster and what actions is it taking in that regard?  What has the Government done to guard against price gouging?  Has there been any contact with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on this issue?  Does the Government intend to take action with regard to the price of home heating oil?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900021#T02600"><p>These issues will be kept under constant review by the Government.  The measures we have announced today will cost approximately &euro;320 million.  That is on top of the &euro;550 million package we announced just one month ago.  The &euro;125 fuel allowance payment will occur next week and that one specific decision will benefit approximately 390,000 recipients.  On the broader European issue, we are advocating for greater flexibilities with regard to what member states can do to offset the pressures on consumers and people more generally resulting from the war in particular.  Prior to the war, issues relating to emergence from the Covid pandemic and restrictions on gas supplies, which may have pre-empted the war, were already driving prices up fairly significantly.  Since the commencement of the war, prices have shot up even further.  The impact of that has been very hard on people.  We are trying to cushion that blow as much as we possibly can but there are limits to what we can do arising from existing regulatory frameworks that were adopted by everyone in Europe in peacetime.  I take the Deputy's point about wartime.</p>  <p>  In themselves, price caps cannot work.  Oil is an internationally traded commodity.</p> <p>Therefore, people will pay a price for it.  We cannot expect a retailer who pays a wholesaler a certain price to just arbitrarily put a cap on a price.  Likewise, all the way along the chain, people will not sell petrol at a loss.  The issue of a price cap is being articulated without the obvious implications being fully thought through.  It simply would not work because it is a market where we are price takers.</p> <p> The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is there to monitor price gouging and can go after anybody where there is evidence of price gouging.  The Deputy raised a fair point in respect of existing supplies procured prior to the increases in prices.  That authority works independently and has its responsibilities and obligations.</p> <p> This morning we had a preliminary meeting in advance of the informal EU Council meeting in Versailles over the next two days.  This morning four countries engaged on the issue of energy pricing with the President of the Council.  Particularly in the context of the war, these are issues that we will be pushing.  We will be advocating for maximum flexibility in how we respond to the price pressure on people.</p></speech>

These included the possibility that household gas and electricity might need to be rationed, that public transport services might be cut and that food prices could rocket even further.  How likely is the prospect of gas and electricity being rationed?  Is this something that could happen on an EU-wide basis?  What preparations are being made to address that possibility?</p>  <p>  My other question relates to the ESB's unprecedented profits last year of, I believe, &euro;679 million.  Last year, the T&aacute;naiste said that if there were hyper profits, the Government should take a larger dividend.  Is the Taoiseach considering that action as a means of raising more funding which could be used to subsidise prices for the consumer?</p></speech>

We do not envisage rationing of oil and petrol.  We have oil and gas reserves.  However, scenario planning can be carried out for varying scenarios and one can be worse than another.  It makes sense for public servants to do this.  We have asked Departments to outline the potential impacts on the country if this gets worse, if the war becomes more difficult.  Clearly in the immediate sense, the biggest impact is the increase in the price of energy.  We have an energy crisis now affecting supply and prices.  The prices then feed into the broader economy.  The other key area will be food because of the central role that Russia and Ukraine play as grain exporters.  The prices of commodities, metals and food are rising significantly along with energy prices.  I see those as the more immediate impacts.</p>  <p>  The ESB also has significant debt; it has borrowed significantly to expand.  Our focus with all energy companies at the moment is security of supply over the medium term.</p></speech>

While it may vary around the country, the diesel pump price that I have been given this morning is &euro;1.899 and it may be higher in certain parts of the country.  The Government tax take is 96.58 cent, which is 50.86%.  Taxes applied include excise duty, carbon tax and the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy.  The actual pump price for petrol this morning is &euro;1.922, which also may be higher in parts of the country.  All Government duties include excise duty, carbon tax and the NORA levy.  The actual price per litre without those duties, which add 55.23%, is &euro;1.0653.  VAT is actually applied to the aforementioned taxes at 23%.  Is that not right?  VAT is applied to excise at 23% and then onto the base price as well.  The 23% is added to the carbon tax, the NORA levy and excise duty.  The Government should not be doing that.</p>  <p>  The reductions the Taoiseach is reporting today are not reductions at all, are they?  It is the equivalent of the tax on tax because the tax that is on the tax on a litre of petrol is actually 20 cent.  That is the tax that is on the excise.  That is the 20 cent reduction we are supposed to be getting.  The tax on the tax on a litre of diesel is 18 cent.  Therefore, the Taoiseach has 3 cent to play around with, but he is trying to tell the people that he is doing them a favour.  I just cannot believe it.  To be fair, Dick Turpin wore a mask when he robbed the people but the Taoiseach can sit here barefaced and tell them that he has done something that he believes will save them.  It is time to be honest with the people and it is time to be transparent.  The Government is adding tax on tax at a time when the most vulnerable and marginalised income earners in this country are choosing between heating and eating.  The Government is adding VAT to excise duty, VAT to carbon tax and VAT to the NORA levy at a rate of 23% on petrol and diesel.</p>  <p>  I have listened to the Taoiseach on the national airwaves all week saying that we are in unprecedented times requiring extraordinary measures.  It is time he put those words into action and took an extraordinary measure to temporarily remove all excise duties and all VAT.  He should not hide behind the EU.  We are clear on what it says in Annex 3 about VAT.  The Taoiseach has already heard it today.  This is not an ordinary time; it is an extraordinary time, something the Taoiseach has mentioned all week in reference to taking in refugees from Ukraine.  He should apply it now to our tax rate and save the rural people who cannot afford to go to work.</p></speech>

We are only in March and we have already allocated an extra &euro;800 million in about five weeks because of the international crisis and the war.  That is the reality.  No government wants to preside over escalating energy and fuel prices.  We want to cushion the blow for people, both for households, for whom we would do more if we could, and in respect of the price at the pump.  However, this is an internationally traded commodity.  That is a fact and we have to deal with that reality.  I think the measures today will help people in bringing prices down somewhat.</p>  <p>  As to what will happen over the coming weeks, the most important thing we can do as a country is to keep advocating a peaceful resolution and to get a cessation to hostilities and to the appalling humanitarian crisis, to which we have to respond and for which we need to allow expenditure.</p></speech>

Not doing so will increase the cost of the food the Government wants the farmers to produce up in the heavens and add to the cost of tractor fuel.  Two cent a litre is a joke, but the farmers are not laughing.  Not removing tax and VAT will drive inflation through the roof and drive the country head-on into a deep, dark recession that will make the 1980s look like a holiday.  It would be funny except that the joke is on us.  The Taoiseach has not addressed the fact that the Government is applying tax on tax and there is no real reduction here for anybody.  Do not quote to me that it is a commodity.  The Government has done nothing to safeguard us from the fact that the experts say the price of a barrel of oil will rise to $200 and the pump price could go to &euro;3.50 a litre.  What will the Taoiseach say to the people then?  Today people are thinking prices should be reduced when in effect last night Diesel Card Ireland, DCI, and many other suppliers put fuel up by 15 cent a litre.  That was notified to customers two days ago.  This is what the Government cannot seem to take on board.  It cannot seem to join the dots.  It is time to get real.  People will not be able to afford to go to work.</p></speech>

My question relates to our neutrality.  I refer to the Taoiseach's comments, the comments of the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Defence and various well-placed articles telling us it is time to get rid of our policy of neutrality.  I stand here today without any hesitation in saying I am absolutely appalled and worried by those comments.  The policy of neutrality is not a passive policy but a very active policy.  One of the Taoiseach's predecessors, whom he has quoted, ironically in an article written by a Russian on the background to the non-proliferation treaty, said, "It was not only the persistence, skill and persuasiveness of Irish diplomacy but its strong motivation that, taken together, achieved the result recorded in these pages."  That was the effort over numerous years by Frank Aiken, almost a single voice, with the help of good public servants, that eventually led many years later to the non-proliferation treaty in 1968.</p>  <p>  Neutrality has been under threat by every single representative of the establishment for a long time.  It happened with the Nice treaty, on which we had to vote twice, and then a declaration was made in Seville.  It happened with the Lisbon treaty, on which we had to vote twice, and all the arguments that we made then came true and we eventually got a declaration on protocols.  Fast-forward now to the middle of a crisis, where we should be using all our effort to help the Ukrainian people, with whom I stand in solidarity, and we are being deflected by various powerful voices that infantilise and demonise people, including Deputies, who dare to speak out.  They tell us we should grow up, that we should be a voice for war and more death.  I fundamentally object to that and to the pressure being put on that we would all speak with the same voice.  I will not.  That is not what I was elected to do, while still standing in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and doing everything possible to help them.  Where is our voice for the diplomacy that should be taking place?  It seems to be lost on the Government that it is meeting in Versaille and the last time an agreement was made in Versaille it related to a second world war.

Yesterday in the House I spoke on this.  I referenced Frank Aiken and our policy and our proactive role in nuclear non-proliferation as well as the role of Fianna F&aacute;il's Frank Aiken, the heroic work he did and how that would impact any debate on military neutrality.  Our neutrality is a military neutrality insofar as we are not members of any defence alliance.  It is up to other countries if they want to volunteer to be part of defensive alliances, which is what NATO is.  From the Irish perspective, we stayed outside any military block.  In the context of the Nice referendum, we inserted into the Constitution a provision which means we cannot join a European defence pact without a constitutional referendum.  Also, over the years we have agreed a triple lock mechanism which means that the participation of Irish troops in any mission has to be under the auspice of a UN resolution, with approval by the Government and the Oireachtas.  The point I am making is that, given what has happened in the appalling imperialist war of atrocities on the people of Ukraine, undertaken by Russia alone, people are questioning things and reflecting.  That is legitimate in a democracy.</p> <p>I am not diverting anybody because I did not raise these issues.  They were raised on the left by Deputies Paul Murphy and Mick Barry. They have raised the issue of NATO consistently over the past three or four weeks and they were blaming NATO for the war before it started.  They called NATO "warmongers".  We should concentrate on the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and on using everything to end the war and stop the appalling humanitarian crisis that is unfolding.  Discussions are under way about humanitarian corridors.  We need to get humanitarian assistance into the cities under bombardment because we are hearing of children dying from dehydration.  We saw on the news last evening families not having access to proper food.  That should be our immediate priority and I suggested a citizens' assembly well after this could be a meaningful way of having an informed reflection.  That would include Ireland's unique role in nuclear non-proliferation and our role as peacekeepers, which has been a consistent factor in our independent foreign policy and has stood us well through the years.</p></speech>

If he is confirming that he is not in favour of changing our policy of neutrality, I welcome that and I apologise if I misinterpreted anything that was attributed to him.  The people have spoken repeatedly, most recently in research by Am&aacute;rach, and overwhelmingly have said we should stand by Ukraine and help it in every possible way with humanitarian aid, but we should retain our neutrality, not in a passive, negative way but in a positive way for peace in the world.  That is what they are saying and have always said, including prior to the Nice and Lisbon treaty referendums.  I am asking the Taoiseach to confirm that and he seems to have done so.  On whether the citizens' assembly is the way to go, I am open to that and I do not mind.  I want confirmation, which he appears to have now given.</p>  <p>  The biased commentary in all the media, which has suggested we are bold children when we stand up and has demonised us, is not helpful to democracy.  It certainly is not democracy because at this point we need people to reflect like Frank Aiken reflected, even though he made it clear he was for democracy and western power.  We need a period of reflection and of thinking how to use our voice in the best way possible to promote peace and diplomacy.   The Taoiseach should reflect on Versailles when he is there.</p></speech>

De Valera is regarded as the person who conceived the policy during the Second World War because of historical issues in our relationship with the UK.  Nonetheless, during the League of Nations in the 1930s, he was deeply disappointed that force was not used against Italy when it invaded Ethiopia, the point being that we can never be neutral against despots and dictators who invade a country unprovoked and unjustifiably.</p>  <p>  We are not politically neutral.  We are members of the EU and we have consistently pursued a policy in that context on security and defence.  We joined the Partnership for Peace with NATO in 1999 to develop interoperability of our military forces so they could operate with countries in NATO on peacekeeping or peace enforcement measures.  We have participated in battle groups that have not been deployed.  The triple lock applies if we are ever to participate in any mission of that kind.</p>  <p>  In the context in the new world of cybersecurity, we are vulnerable.  Who came to our assistance when we had a savage cyberattack on our health services?  Poland, the UK and countries in the European Union.  We have to acknowledge the world is changing from a security perspective and there are vulnerabilities in Europe that we cannot be blind to.  That is why we need, at a later time, a more informed debate and reflection on it.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach acknowledges and we all know the pressure that people are under; therefore, it is incumbent on us to act and to prepare to act.  On several occasions this afternoon, the Taoiseach has referenced the price of food.  From his commentary, I am reading that he assumes sharp increases in food prices.  He mentioned Ukraine as the breadbasket of the world, so the price of bread, for example, will rise.  What plans, preparations and mitigations has the Government made for the likely spike in food prices?  What preparations have been made at a European level to ensure we have full and necessary flexibility to protect our people?</p></speech>

A child coming to a new country, walking into a classroom and not understanding what anybody is saying faces a particularly difficult experience, especially if that child has run for his or her life.  Children of Ukrainian-Irish families and children of a Russian background in our school system will also need support.  Will the Taoiseach speak to those families and to the Government's intention to provide every support possible to Ukrainian and Russian children currently in our education system, those who may be coming into the system and to those teachers, SNAs and school communities who will be working with these families?

The challenges for Ukrainian children fleeing war to access our schools will be enormous, in terms of how we respond from an educational perspective.  The Government will not be able to do it all on its own and will have to draw on resources across society, particularly from the perspectives of psychology, language and curriculum content.  It will involve working with the Ukrainian community in Ireland and identifying what talents Ukrainian people coming in have, so we can redeploy those talents to help in the mission the Deputy spoke about.  I agree with him that it is a significant issue that we have to address.  We will spare no effort in doing so.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, Ireland is still failing women in the provision of high-quality healthcare.  While the CervicalCheck scandal and the shortages of HRT are prominent examples, many other issues are not receiving the support required.  Endometriosis affects up to one in ten women, yet such is the lack of services that waiting for diagnosis can take up to nine years.  While waiting for treatment, women can experience fertility issues, severe menstrual pain, damage to internal organs and chronic fatigue and nausea.  This is a serious condition that has a real impact on many women but there are too few specialists in the area and GPs are not properly resourced, leading to a focus on pain relief and self-medication rather than addressing the issues.  What actions will the Taoiseach take to improve the service?</p></speech>

Reports are already coming in of petrol stations increasing their prices for petrol and diesel today before the cut.  Around the corner from where I live, one petrol station increased the price of diesel by 15 cent at lunchtime today.  Presumably, then, the station will reduce the price tonight by 15 cent, having made a tidy profit.  The petrol being sold now was bought some time ago at lower prices, so the companies are already taking advantage of the crisis to make some bumper profits while they can.  We welcome the cut to the rate of excise duty and we have pushed for a cut in VAT as well, but fundamentally what we need, at least alongside these measures, are price controls.  The Taoiseach spoke earlier again and again about how we are in wartime.  Under the Consumer Protection Act 2007, the Government has the power to bring in price controls.  We need them for petrol, home heating oil, gas, electricity and so on.</p></speech>

In 2016, the Taoiseach and his party gave a commitment to deliver 24-7 cardiac care to the south-east region, yet in the intervening six years, however, not one single hour of additional service has been provided and we remain at 39 hours per week.  Along with 14 other Deputies from the south east, I wrote to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, on 15 December, 3 February and again on 7 March, requesting that he meet all Deputies from the south-east region and asking him to take personal charge of the resourcing and capital issues being experienced at UHW that are delaying the roll-out of expanded services at the hospital.  There has been no answer and nothing has been forthcoming from the Minister as yet.  Our outpatient waiting list now stands at more than 50,000 people and, despite the pleas from the hospital management for additional capital resources, little to nothing has been provided by way of a solution.  Will the Taoiseach direct his Minister to meet with Deputies from the south east to deliver on his party's promise to the south east and to provide the capital and personnel resources required to give us the required quality of care in the region?</p></speech>

The paltry efforts being talked about now include the reduction of 20 cent a litre in the price of petrol, 15 cent a litre for road diesel, 2 cent a litre, which is an insult, for green diesel,  the price of which has more than doubled in the past year, and nothing for home heating oil.  This is an insult to the people we are supposed to represent.  The Taoiseach is more beholden to Europe and to globalists than he is to serving the people of Ireland.  That is quite evident in that he will not act.  He has quoted European laws for VAT and everything else.  How can other countries such as Poland, Sweden and Denmark bring down the cost of oil to 2018 prices, while we cannot do anything because of the high masters in Europe whom the Taoiseach must adore, along with honouring the globalists?  That is what is wrong.  The Government is in the pockets of the globalists and to hell with the people.  Does the Government want the road hauliers to pull in on the side of the roads and to have no food delivered and the tractors to be parked in the fields not sowing or reaping?  That is what is going to happen.  The Government is staring this in the face and it will not look at it and will not see it.

It allows Ukrainian citizens to access the EU and that is more than welcome.  Irish people have been very forthcoming in offering accommodation, and they never let themselves down in this regard.  That is very true.  While the focus is on Ukrainian citizens, however, what about the other nationalities affected by the war over there?  I wrote to the Minister for Justice last Monday week concerning this issue, without receiving a response.  Are other nationalities covered under the remit of the temporary protection directive as well and can they access safety in the EU and Ireland?</p></speech>

It is an unprecedented measure to have applied the temporary protection directive in respect of all Ukrainians fleeing their country.  That must be the focus now in respect of those issues.  Again, there are limits too, but those issues will be explored further concerning other nationalities.  It is difficult to quantify the issue right now but let us be fair all around.  Some countries on the border of Ukraine, such as Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Moldova and others, have taken an extraordinary number of refugees.  Balance must be applied to all of this as well.  We are willing to explore the issues around that, but suffice it to say that this is an unprecedented response by Europe.</p></speech>

He briefed me on the shocking situation evolving in Ukraine for people with cystic fibrosis.  These vulnerable people are living in bomb shelters, often without water and food and with no basic medical supplies.  A request has been made by CFI to the Department of Foreign Affairs for immediate financial assistance that could be channelled through CFI to other cystic fibrosis associations near the border with Ukraine. </p> <p>I ask for the Taoiseach's support for that initiative.  Mr. Philip Watt also asked me to raise the question of the long-promised human tissue Bill, including a commitment to introduce a soft opt-out organ donor consent.  Where is the Bill and when will it be enacted in full?</p></speech>

It is extremely difficult for people in Ukraine because of the bombardment they are under and I can only imagine how difficult it is for people with cystic fibrosis because of the added complexities arising from their condition and the difficulties arising.  Given it is a condition that is particularly prevalent in Ireland and we are involved in much research and so on in that area, I will certainly speak with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and officials to see what practical assistance we can give.  I will get back to the Deputy on the legislation in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

I know there are plans in place to address the backlog but right now thousands of people are waiting for passports.  Many of our constituency offices are turning into passport offices so what immediate measures are being taken?  Is there a way extra staff can be seconded into the Passport Office on a temporary basis?  There are promises for two and three months from now but people are losing money right now that they can ill-afford to lose.  They have paid for flight tickets but cannot use them because they have not had a passport service.</p></speech>

I will come back to the Deputy but I believe 1.7 million passports will be issued this year.  There were 634,000 issued in 2021, despite Covid-19 restrictions.  A total of 45% of online adult renewals are processed within one working day while 99% of online applications for renewals for children are issued within 15 working days.  First-time applications take longer to process and so forth.</p>  <p>  As of 31 January, the number of passport service staff increased by 300 from June last year, which is a very significant increase.  We will bring in additional staff in the coming months to bring the number of staff to in excess of 900.  This week the capacity of passport servicing in public offices increased in Dublin and Cork significantly.  I take the Deputy's point but the numbers are expanding.</p></speech>

Energia, SSE Airtricity and the ESB are three examples.  It is reported ESB will report record profits of &euro;679 million for 2021, up 10% on 2020.  To give some perspective, the Government's cost-of-living package was &euro;505 million.</p>  <p> The European Commission is very clear and it has spelt out how governments can, and should, assess and tackle excessive crisis-related windfall profits.  Does the Government believe these profits at ESB and elsewhere are excessive?  How is the matter being assessed?  Is the Government considering introducing a windfall tax?</p></speech>

Second, it is making very significant investment in projects now and for the future that will need to be financed by borrowing, and the debt already accumulated by ESB is quite significant.  It needs profits to enable it to meet debt obligations and to ensure its capital expansion plans in future can be realised.  One of the most important matters for us will be energy security.  The question of the amount that can be returned on a dividend increase, for example, which is under consideration, will not dramatically impact the &euro;500 million or &euro;300 million package we have just announced.  That must come from general Exchequer resources.  I understand people are looking everywhere to see millions of euro here and there but we must keep our heads and focus on the energy security issue.</p></speech>

It relates to whether we should be militarily non-aligned or otherwise.  The Taoiseach yesterday referred to the prospect of a citizens' assembly debating this subject and in light of the Commission on the Defence Forces report, which I acknowledge the Government will respond to by the summer, it is critical that we have this discussion and harness the conversations taking place across the country.  Will the Taoiseach outline his proposals for the citizens' assembly referenced yesterday?  What is the likely timeline for such an endeavour?</p></speech>

He might also have picked up on the latter part of my commentary where I indicated that our immediate focus should be on the current war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis flowing from it, as well as the need to direct all our policies and energies to that.  I am somewhat concerned as we need a united approach in the country on how we deal with Ukraine.  People have different perspectives on military neutrality and how security policy evolves, and I am simply saying that one mechanism to facilitate such a discussion would be a citizens' assembly.  I do not have a timeline just yet or anything like that.  I put that as a contribution to that debate to try to separate that from the immediate need to focus on the crisis in Ukraine and its impact on the European Continent.  There is nothing related to our military neutrality that so far has restricted what we or Europe is doing in anything it is doing.</p></speech>

We are very glad a friend of Ireland holds the presidency.  I am thinking in particular of the undocumented Irish, with best estimates indicating there may be up to 10,000 Irish people in the US who have not had their status regularised.  Those people, in the main, are working, paying taxes and raising families while contributing to society.  A legal framework needs to be put in place to ensure Irish people can emigrate successfully and with proper status to the US.  We saw during the pandemic the difficulties that could arise when people do not have their status regularised in the country.  It is very important for the issue to be very much on the agenda.  The E3 visa Bill option fell at midnight when one member of Congress objected.  I sincerely hope the Taoiseach can make progress on that.  I hope he will raise with President Biden the need to appoint a special envoy to Northern Ireland.  Distinguished persons in the past, such as Senator George Mitchell, occupied such a position.</p></speech>

I will certainly raise that with President Biden.  It is subject to the domestic political environment and realpolitik in US politics.  I will also meet representatives of Friends of Ireland in Congress and I look forward to engaging with them on the matter.  It was very unfortunate what happened to that E3 visa Bill on the last occasion.  We will continue to pursue those issues.</p></speech>

It will be larger than anything seen since the Second World War.  On the Irish response, have any efforts been made or planned to engage those already here, whether they are from Ukraine or, more pertinently, countries close to Ukraine, such as Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova and Romania, to work with recently arrived refugees into Ireland and provide that pastoral practical care?  To provide that, they need co-ordination, funding and support from the State.  At what stage is that preparation?</p></speech>

In the initial phase, the Government was determined to give cash aid to trusted international agencies such as the Red Cross and UN agencies, and &euro;20 million has now been allocated for humanitarian assistance.  A further &euro;10 million was allocated through the European Peace Facility in respect of non-lethal supplies to be sent to Ukraine.  A pledge register has been established by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, and there has been a very strong response to it.</p> <p>A lot of work will be required here.

He went missing on 21 June 2020.  Shockingly and tragically, he was found dead in a storm drain in Belfast some days later.  Since then his family have been seeking answers to the circumstances surrounding his death.  The PSNI has actively sought to withhold information surrounding his death and instead has put more effort into questioning and potentially prosecuting his mother for holding a memorial walk.  The PSNI seeks a public interest immunity certificate.  These certificates have traditionally been used by the authorities to protect the identity of an informant in a paramilitary context.  More than 280,000 people have signed a petition that Noah's mam collected, calling for the files to be released.  Will the Taoiseach raise this issue with the British Government to ensure the PSNI makes sure justice is achieved for Noah?</p></speech>

It received a devastating setback from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on Friday, having failed the environmental assessment.  The environmental impact was such that the scheme was refused.  There are a number of elements to this scheme.  I am asking that the new bridge, infrastructure and walls be allowed to proceed.  On the other issue of the dredging, I ask that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Office of Public Works and Wexford County Council work together to try to overcome the environmental issues.  I know the Taoiseach will understand the importance of the scheme and the impact flooding has had on the town of Enniscorthy over many years.  This scheme has been talked about for more than 40 years.  The funding was secured under the previous Government.

This decision was not taken lightly.  As the Deputy knows, there has been a significant increase in judicial reviews and other legal challenges to a range of infrastructure development projects arising from increased cross-cutting environmental legislation.  It is in everyone's interest that the decision is made now so that the OPW can proceed to consider the matters at hand and assess options available to mitigate the environmental issues identified in the process.  The key role for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is to ensure any proposed scheme is compliant with the Arterial Drainage Act and associated legislation through independent environmental impact assessments to ensure there are no significant impacts on the environment.  The OPW now needs to assess this decision and come back with proposals.</p></speech>

The last thing they need when they get a devastating diagnosis like that is to have to fight for a medical card.  Could the application process for a medical card for cancer patients be simplified?  It would only be required for the duration of the treatment.  Many patients also have to travel to receive treatment.  In Cavan we often have to go to Dublin depending on the treatment.  Because they are medically vulnerable, they do not feel like using public transport.  There should be a free taxi service available to all people in these circumstances.  One patient was told by a social worker in Dublin that you could only avail of supports for one session of treatment.  That should not be the case.

Will the Taoiseach reconsider them in the context of home heating oil?  The rationale is lost on me.  Is it the intention of Government that we would get into the car and put on the heating rather than heat our homes in the few short months that are left in the winter and spring?</p></speech>

The exemption criteria were set out in a circular in 2019.  A two-year review was promised.  A lot of it is still unworkable.  A child has to score below the tenth percentile in an area such as comprehension, word meaning or spelling.  We need to have this review and make it possible.  The Irish language is very important but it is equally important we do not overburden and overstress kids who are struggling, who have difficulties with receptive or expressive language, dyslexia or any other condition that makes it difficult to receive and learn a second language.</p></speech>

It is a matter of the instruments that are available to us.  There is an issue with VAT.  If we bring it down significantly on a temporary basis, we could end up with a much higher rate once the temporary situation is over.  We have concentrated on the measures we can do within the various frameworks and legal situations.  That is a cut of 20 cent and 15 cent per litre on petrol and diesel, respectively, and 2 cent per litre on marked diesel.  This is on top of the last measure.  About &euro;800 million has been allocated in five weeks.  It is a very serious issue for people, there is no doubt about that.</p>  <p>  I take Deputy Crowe's point.  He has experience in the field as a primary school teacher before he was elected to the House.  I will talk to the Minister for Education about the points he has raised.  Language should never be a burden or something people hate, particularly those who have challenging issues or learning difficulties already.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Andrews, it is envisaged we would have 40% representation on sports bodies' boards of governance by the end of 2023, and measures will be considered in respect of incentivising or indeed penalising failure to reach those targets.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="13:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900027#Z01600"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to disapply at separate future dates, in relation to recognised primary and post-primary schools, the exemption provided by certain enactments from the prohibition against discrimination on the gender ground in educational establishments, and to provide for connected matters. </blockquote>  <p>I thank my Labour Party colleagues for co-signing this Bill, which provides for all schools in receipt of State funding and recognised by the Department of Education to reflect society outside the school gate, which they serve.  We have an unusual scenario in Ireland whereby 17% of Irish primary school children attend single-gender schools.  At second level that figure is 30%.  Since 1998, the Department of Education has not given sanction or recognition to a new single-gender school.  Effectively, for the past 25 years the Department has decided we should be moving towards a co-educational model.</p> <p>It is strange to me, therefore, and I expect to anybody who comes to this country from elsewhere, that we are so obsessed with separating children.  We love separating them on the basis of religion, gender and income.</p> <p> If we really are serious about our education system, there are a number of issues we must consider.  We have to look at equality in education, eradicate illiteracy, end educational disadvantage and make education entirely free.  We also need to get rid of the legacy issues in the Irish education system, including why we consider it so important that boys go through one gate and girls through another.  It does not stand up to any analysis anywhere internationally that such separation is good for children or society.  In my constituency, in places like Raheny and Marino, for example, parents are beginning to ask strong questions as to why their children need to be separated for school, with one gate for the boys and another for the girls.  I see strong young women in Maryfield College in Drumcondra who are standing up against this old-fashioned, outdated practice of demanding girls wear skirts to school.  They have managed to change the uniform practice in their school.</p> <p> It is time for the State to lay out a vision that all children and young people should go to the same schools and that we do away with outdated gender stereotypes.  There is no reason why girls need to go to one school and boys to another.  On that basis, our Bill proposes that, over a ten-year period, we get rid of the single-gender legacy issue for primary schools.  We are trying to be as reasonable as we possibly can in providing for a period of ten years to make the change.  We recognise that conversations are needed in school communities and between patron bodies.  We acknowledge that the Department of Education has to lead this charge.  After ten years, however, it is our vision that every primary school in the State will be co-educational.  In addition, after 15 years, we want every second level school in the country that is in receipt of State funding and recognition from the Department of Education to be co-educational.</p> <p> If we are serious about gender equality, this seems to be the only area of Irish public policy about which we never speak.  We talk about gender equality in sport, politics, the media and business, but our education system is separated on the basis of gender to a degree that is unparalleled outside of the Arab world and we seem never to want to tackle it properly.  We are trying to be as practical and reasonable as possible in our proposals in this Bill.  There is no justifiable reason to contrive a scenario where all the boys go through one gate and all the girls through another.  It does not stand up any more.  Let us have an education system that is truly reflective of the society outside the school doors.  Let us believe in gender equality.  If we pass this legislation, we will be in a position, after ten years, to ensure all our primary schools are co-educational and the same for all secondary schools after 15 years.  Our education system will then properly reflect the society it tries to serve, which is a co-educational society in which there is gender equality.</p></speech>

The committee last met on 4 March 2021.  A meeting scheduled for 29 November 2021 was postponed due to a Covid meeting.  A meeting on 24 February 2022 also had to be postponed due to the convening of a European Council at short notice.  This meeting of the Cabinet committee has now been rescheduled for Monday, 21 March.</p><p>Relevant issues arising in regard to Brexit and Northern Ireland are regularly considered at meetings of the full Cabinet.  For example, the Cabinet considered two comprehensive memorandums on North-South co-operation and the shared island initiative in December.  The Cabinet committee on Europe also discusses related matters and that committee met last Monday.</p><p>In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and of Cabinet committees, I also meet with Ministers on an individual basis to focus on particular issues, where required.</p></reply>

This is an issue that many of us raise with him regularly.  The events in continental Europe at this time and the fear arising from them really put Brexit into context.  Nevertheless, I have a few questions for the Taoiseach.  Will he outline the ongoing discussions that will continue to take place between Commissioner &Scaron;efčovič and the British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, and her team on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and the importance thereof?  Second, and more pertinent to the issues at hand in continental Europe, what efforts are being made between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government on co-ordinating the response to refugee accommodation in Ireland?  There is a requirement, I would argue, for an all-island approach.  There have been concerning leaks in the British media from certain sources in the British Government that, somehow, the common travel area will impact on the UK.  That is something we need to nip in the bud.  Ireland's refugee policy is a warm and open one and is tied to our European partners.  It will not be dictated to by domestic politics in Westminster.</p></speech>

Earlier today, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, of which I am a member, had a meeting with the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, at which Brexit and the protocol were major issues of discussion, along with the need to implement the Good Friday Agreement fully.  People with all shades of political opinion at the meeting spoke about the need for pragmatic solutions and getting a consensus on the outstanding issues.  We have to be realistic and recognise there will be a very demanding agenda for all governments and for the EU given the crisis arising out of the brutality of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  There is an urgency in trying to progress the issues concerning the protocol.  In the area I represent, there is, fortunately, a huge amount of cross-Border trade and enterprise.  The all-island economy has grown immensely since 1998.  People want to ensure that any impediments to trade, business and commerce are removed.  That is coming from all shades of political opinion and from all businesses that I have dealings with, both north and south of the Border.  Many enterprises are based in both jurisdictions and there is a huge interdependence, as the Taoiseach knows, between the economies on both sides of the Border.  It is in the interests of all the people of this island, and of Britain, to ensure the remaining issues that need to be resolved are put to bed as soon as possible and that we can get on with our daily lives, from both a business and travel point of view, and not have impediments to the movement of people, goods or services on our island or between our islands.</p></speech>

In this regard, Sinn F&eacute;in has made several proposals, including on observer status, representation at the European Committee on the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee, the ability of Executive Ministers to participate at Council of Ministers meetings, and the participation of civil servants from the North at relevant Council working groups.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the EU needs to create formal mechanisms by which the North's politicians and civil servants can engage with the EU institutions?  What actions has his office taken to advance these matters?</p> <p> The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il yesterday that he wants a citizens' assembly on neutrality.  The programme for Government commits to several assemblies, for which no date has been provided, and a referendum to extend presidential voting rights to citizens outside the State.  We are nearly two years into this Government's term of office, so surely the Taoiseach can provide us with some indication as to when this long-awaited referendum will take place.</p></speech>

Two weeks ago, People Before Profit proposed in Stormont a 10% rent cut for private tenants right across the North.  It was passed.  At the time, MLAs from the SDLP, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Alliance Party all backed the proposal but since then buckled to the landlords' pressure.  They did a U-turn and, two days ago, reversed the decision at Stormont.  The proposal would have given renters a much-needed break, but rather than stand up for tenants, Sinn F&eacute;in, which has the Minister, buckled under the pressure of the corporate lobbyists.  We stand by our proposal for a rent cut and make the same proposal here in the South.  It is to oppose the profiteering landlords and cut rents to affordable levels.  Does the Taoiseach agree that rents need to come down North and South?  Will he take action to ensure it happens?</p></speech>

We also welcome the continuation of the technical talks and the meeting yesterday of the Specialised Committee on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  At the meeting, the EU and UK reiterated the importance of further engagement with business groups, civil society and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland and committed to further joint engagements.  Vice President &Scaron;efčovič and the Commission continue to have my full support.  I hope the British Government will engage constructively so we can find pragmatic solutions.</p><p>Deputy Brendan Smith raised the issue of pragmatic solutions given the international crisis we are now experiencing owing to the appalling war in Ukraine.  The focus has to remain on addressing genuine problems that have been raised.  Reaching an agreed approach to the protocol is an important factor in allowing us all to turn the page and open up a new chapter in a forward-looking constructive EU&ndash;UK relationship and partnership.  Flexibility and pragmatism, to which Deputy Smith referred, are key.</p><p>It is emerging that the protocol is presenting significant opportunities for business and employment in Northern Ireland.  I take what Deputy Smith said about his conversations this morning at the committee, indicating that people of all shades of opinion wanted a pragmatic solution to this.  Northern Ireland is now the only place in the world that has free and full access to both the EU Single Market and the UK's market.</p><p>Invest Northern Ireland is seeing historically high levels of FDI interest in Northern Ireland.  Investment announcements have been made throughout the year based on dual market access.  Recent figures from the UK's Office for National Statistics show the Northern Ireland economy has outperformed and recovered from the impact of Covid-19 faster than the rest of the UK.  Recent polls on attitudes to the protocol show support across communities for solution-seeking and a pragmatic approach.  That gives me hope that both sides can reach a conclusion in the best interest of the people of Northern Ireland.</p><p>On the common travel area, I take the point that the humanitarian response is our priority.  We will engage in ongoing discussions with the UK Government on this.  The UK Government is also reflecting on its position given the scale of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding.</p><p>On Deputy Farrell's points, the EU has been very open to facilitating dialogue in the context of the protocol discussions through the joint committee but also through working with and meeting all the parties and stakeholders.</p><p>With regard to the EU institutions themselves, there is a limit to what can actually be achieved in respect of the agreements arrived at between the EU and UK.  We have advocated engagement by Northern Ireland with EU institutions and so on.  However, with regard to Council meetings, it becomes far more problematic from an EU perspective.  There are limits to what can be achieved in this regard.</p><p>The Government is working on a referendum on voting rights.  I have referred to this in the context of what is now a debate, involving all perspectives, on the security situation in Europe.  A citizens' assembly is perhaps a good forum to have the issues properly teased out and researched and in which to have an informed debate on them.</p><p>I am not fully familiar with what Deputy Paul Murphy mentioned.  He said he had secured the passage in the Assembly of a 10% reduction in rents but that this has now been overturned.  He said Sinn F&eacute;in buckled under the pressure of the corporate landlords, which is some assertion.  That would be a surprise.  On the other hand, maybe there is a sense of realism breaking through because, as we have indicated here, there are realities associated with the private rental market that cannot be ignored.  In Northern Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers tend to have a greater grasp of the realities and <i>realpolitik</i>associated with what is and is not possible, as opposed to Sinn F&eacute;in leadership in opposition in the Republic, who very often put forward ideas their colleagues in the North simply cannot implement.  It illustrates that, objectively, one has to be realistic in the proposals one puts forward.</p><p>In the Republic, landlords are leaving the market right now.  Those with one or two houses are leaving it.  There has been a decline in the number of landlords over the past two years.  We need more.  We need an increase in the number of units in the private rental market to deal with the broader housing issue.  We need more social housing, affordable housing and cost rental housing.  The latter has great potential but we must increase its scale massively.</p><p>I take Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's point.  There is a lot of research under way.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, will shortly be publishing its comprehensive research on economic opportunities in an all-island context, including opportunities associated with the environment, climate change and biodiversity.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and other bodies have undertaken research on aspects of health services, particularly primary care services, in the North and South.  We have commissioned some research in respect of the educational curriculum.  Interestingly, through the shared island unit, we recently allocated about &euro;37 million for successful collaborations between third level institutions in the North and the Republic.  They are to be fully funded by the shared island unit.</p> <p>One of the research projects, for example, is a collaboration between Magee College and NUI Galway around maximising human and social capital in the Border area in terms of economic and social development and along the western seaboard in the north west and the west.  A lot will come from those individual research projects also.</p></speech>

This will help us to do things differently and place an emphasis on quality of life issues, as we recover from the impacts of the pandemic, and sustainably rebuild and renew our economy and society.  The framework aims to provide a joined-up way of considering and understanding life in Ireland by bringing different outcomes together across environmental, societal and economic areas.  It will also help us to measure and compare Ireland's progress more holistically as we move forward.  This work is being led jointly by the Department of the Taoiseach, along with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  There has also been close collaboration with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in developing an interactive dashboard at its well-being information hub.</p>  <p>  A first report on the development of the well-being framework for Ireland was published by the Government in July last year and was informed by consultation facilitated by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  A second phase of consultation and research on the framework, as committed to in the first report, was launched in October last year and included the launch of a Government portal providing accessible information on the initiative.  The purpose of the recent public conversation, which concluded in January, was to create awareness, to test the framework and the vision, and to get a further sense of people's priorities.  It included a comprehensive communications campaign, an online stakeholder event, an online survey and thematic workshops.  Specific research is also being carried out by key Departments and the NESC on sustainability and lessons from other countries that have undertaken similar initiatives.  A follow-up report will be submitted to the Government in the coming months informed by this second phase of consultation and research, with the objective of embedding the well-being framework into the policymaking process.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="13:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900030#CC01200"><p>On launching the framework's first report, the Taoiseach emphasised that its approach is fundamentally about making people's lives better by better understanding people's lived experiences.  Next week will mark Brain Awareness Week.  I want to commend the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Irish Dementia Working Group, whose members are incredible advocates and activists.  Covid presented a unique and distressing challenge for people living with dementia and those who care for them.  The Government can and must do more in terms of budgets, staffing and capital investment to deliver the support services and the strategy that the working group has so comprehensively set out for decision makers.</p>  <p>  The risk of dementia is five times greater for people with an intellectual disability.  This heightened risk requires enhanced efforts by policymakers and clinicians to improve awareness of brain health and the importance of early diagnosis.  As Professor Mary McCarron has explained in her work, the toxic proteins that cause Alzheimer's build and accumulate for 15 to 25 years before clinical symptoms present, but cognitive reserve, education, exercise, cognitive stimulation and social engagement at any age will help to slow or counteract these changes.  In short, Professor McCarron's message is that it is possible to reduce the risk of dementia, and active promotion on brain health is absolutely fundamental to this objective.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has made some progress but she needs significantly more support from her Government partners if she is to develop adequate memory services throughout Ireland.  What action will the Taoiseach take to support this work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900030#CC01300"><p>The pre-condition for well-being of the people of this country is for them to have a secure, affordable roof over their heads.  One of the standing scandals in that regard, besides the abysmal failure of the Government to deliver new public and affordable housing, is the inability to deal with the utter scandal of vacant and derelict properties the length and breadth of the country.  They are sitting there torturing people who are actually in need of housing as they lie empty but could be used to house people impacted by the housing crisis.  The measures that the Government has taken to deal with this have been self-evidently not working.  The answers to a number of parliamentary questions - as the Taoiseach may have seen, they got some coverage in the newspapers in the last day or two - are pretty stark.  There is now &euro;14.3 million outstanding in vacant site charges.  There is &euro;7.9 million outstanding in derelict site levies.  In 2020, &euro;378,000 was collected in derelict site levies out of &euro;5.4 million that was levied.  On the vacant site levy, it is even worse, with &euro;21,000 collected out of &euro;11.8 million levied in just one year.  Only seven councils sought to bother to impose the vacant site levy, and 14 councils did not bother to impose the derelict site levy at all.  My question is very simple.  First of all, judging from these figures, how is it that there is no serious intent whatsoever to actually pursue the vacant and derelict site levies?  Is it not self-evidently the case that this is not enough?  They are not working and we need much more radical measures, such as robust use of compulsory purchase orders, to get hold of vacant and empty buildings to use to address the housing crisis.</p></speech>

Those living in the shadow of the Aughinish Alumina plant in County Limerick have suffered massively from the toxic pollution from that plant.  People have got sick, animals have died and livelihoods have been wiped out by the pollution.  When an investigation was done into the health impacts of the plant in the locality, Aughinish Alumina used the notorious lobbyist, Frank Dunlop, as its fixer.  Later, 18 medical samples from resident Pat Geoghegan and his family mysteriously disappeared.  When the Taoiseach was the Minister for Health and Children, he was on record as supporting an independent inquiry into the missing samples, yet he ended up doing a U-turn and blocked such an inquiry.  To this day, the Taoiseach has not explained that U-turn.  Mr. Geoghegan has written to the Taoiseach asking for that inquiry.  Will the Taoiseach grant the inquiry?  Mr. Geoghegan has also asked for the publication of records of any contact between Mr. Dunlop, the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach's officials at the time about the investigation.  Will the Taoiseach publish those records?</p></speech>

It measures our well-being, education attainment, community involvement and so much more.  It is so different from measuring GNP or GNI* or any other economic indicators.  The pandemic really highlighted core needs that many people had not recognised up to then, including connections with people and family, taking part in community events and so on.  It really highlighted pressure in areas such as mental health and well-being, and spiritual well-being as well.  Will the framework focus attention on these various needs as it is advancing and being used?  It needs to.  Late last year, there was a stakeholder event and a further report was due to be published earlier this year.  That was going to be focused on the way it would be embedded into policy formation.  Budget 2023 is advancing.  Do we have an indication of whether the framework will be available to inform budget 2023?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="13:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900030#CC01600"><p>The excise duty cuts are welcome, but they are a sticking plaster on a wound when we look at the overall cost of living crisis that is now impacting working people and their well-being.  The Department of Finance wrote to Deputy Boyd Barrett last week and estimated that the Russian invasion of Ukraine will add 4% to the rate of inflation in this State.  That clearly raises the spectre of inflation reaching 10% or more.  Does the Taoiseach agree that inflation may now reach 10%?</p> <p>An inflation rate of 10% indicates to me the advice of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, to workers to submit pay claims of up to 5.5% is being overtaken by events.  I suggest that workers now need to submit wage claims of a minimum of 10% and to start balloting for industrial action to show the Government and employers they are serious about defending living standards.  Can the Government stop 10% inflation or do workers have to prepare to combat it in that fashion?</p></speech>

Families have spoken about the shocking manner they have been treated in the wards of court system.  Wards of court lose their autonomy and civil rights and the right to make decisions.  One of the biggest issues they have experienced in the past 15 years is the collapse in the funds that were given to them so they can survive and provide for themselves.  Since as far back as 2001, the Committee of Public Accounts and others have been focusing on the need for oversight of those funds.  When the law changed in 2005, it again stated there needed to be oversight.  Every annual report from 2005 to 2013 stated there needed to be oversight.  For some reason, the objective of oversight was dropped in 2018.  The families are left with massive questions in respect of why significant sums of money that were given to wards of court so they could pay for all of their life-changing experiences have disappeared as a result of a collapse in the financial system.  They want to know who is responsible, what decisions were made and who will be held to account.</p></speech>

The first question related to the setting of policy and budgetary priorities.  The well-being framework will ultimately help to inform policy, the budgetary framework and budgetary initiatives.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell specifically raised the issue of Brain Awareness Week being next week and the issue of Alzheimer's, dementia and so on.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has made a significant difference in terms of that issue.  She worked hard on it while in opposition and met all the organisations involved.  She made rapid progress in a year and a half in respect of responding to dementia and the recommendations of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and so on, particularly in terms of appointing advisers across the country.  That will continue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will continue to get the full support of the Government in pursuing that issue, to which she has really committed herself.  I remember that while in opposition she, along with then Senator Colette Kelleher, initiated a review of this whole area.  It has been a yardstick by which she has worked to implement some of the policies.</p><p>As Deputy Boyd Barrett knows, the Derelict Sites Act has not worked effectively in this country and there has been a lack of pursuit of levies and so on.  Local authorities will cite various legal difficulties around that.  The Government is looking at this afresh in terms of a new vacancy tax and also in terms of a use-it-or-lose-it approach to planning permission.  The Minister for Finance has done a lot of work in terms of the current local property tax, LPT, review and consideration of research as to what the level of vacancy is and how that can be dealt with.  In addition, there is further work being done in respect of getting a contribution in terms of the shared value of any uplift in value arising out of planning permissions being granted.  Some of that would be used in terms of infrastructural investment.  A lot of work has been done in this space.  Compulsory purchase orders are, by definition, lengthy.  They take up an inordinate length of time, it seems to me, in the courts.  They again have proved problematic.  In terms of the public side, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has worked extremely fast since he came into office to avoid any voids in terms of public housing and ensure they are used.  As regards Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, he wants to use part of that fund to ensure vacant sites in towns across the country could be refurbished with grant assistance to ensure housing is being provided.  That is necessary.</p><p>  In terms of Aughinish Alumina and Pat Geoghegan, I recall meeting him back in the period from 2000 to 2004 when I was Minister for Health and Children.  My understanding is the EPA had done a lot of research at the time in terms of the implications of Aughinish Alumina and the health assessments and so on and it had not been established by statutory authorities in respect of the impact on health.  I met Pat Geoghegan at the time in terms of the impact on both animal health and human health.  I do not think it is fair to say an inquiry was blocked but, again, I do not have any recollection of meeting any individuals bar Mr. Geoghegan himself and talking to officials in the Department about that.  It was a matter in relation to which the EPA had been doing a lot of work in terms of its role and statutory duty to monitor industrial plants and ensure they meet health and safety requirements and public health requirements.  It still remains for baseline public health studies to be done in the context of plans like that.  I recall that in other locations baseline health studies have been done.  Those have been continued in areas close to industry, monitoring pollution levels in cattle, soil and so on.  My sense was the evidential base was not one that was established around that, notwithstanding the very strong personal testimony of Mr. Geoghegan himself, who has pursued this on a lengthy basis.</p><p>Deputy Moynihan made some good points in respect of the well-being framework and whether issues around community spiritual health and so on will be considered.  They will.  Our framework is based on the OECD model but has been moulded to suit the Irish context based on consultations with stakeholders, experts, policymakers and the public.  The framework will encompass 11 dimensions: subjective well-being; mental and physical health; knowledge and skills; income and wealth; housing and built area; environment, climate and biodiversity; safety and security; work and job quality; time use; community, social connections and cultural participation, which is the area the Deputy identified; and civic engagement and cultural expression.  The initial well-being framework will be refined to reflect recent consultation and further research in the second report, which will be published in the coming months.  There are also some indicators now from the dashboard and the CSO and so on, measuring life and progress in Ireland through a set of about 34 indicators.  Again, this relates to our performance relative to the OECD How's Life initiative, which is the basis for our framework.  This set of indicators was based on the areas that were highlighted as important for Ireland through the NESC-----</p></speech>

As part of the semester, Ireland, along with all other member states, prepares and submits a national reform programme to the European Commission each April.  This provides an overview of economic reforms and policy actions under way in Ireland, including in response to country-specific recommendations given as part of the preceding year's semester.</p>  <p>  Preparation of the national reform programme is co-ordinated by the economic division of my Department with input from relevant Departments and agencies.</p> <p>Work on this year's programme, which includes engagement with stakeholders, is now under way.  Last year, in line with guidance from the European Commission, Ireland's national reform programme was integrated into the 2021 national recovery and resilience plan, NRRP.  This was required to access funding under the European Union's recovery and resilience facility from which Ireland was allocated &euro;950 million in grants.  The NRRP was approved in September 2021 and implementation is now under way.</p></reply>

When the students subsequently contacted the English-language schools, they were told they had no record of this.  Many students have been scammed out of thousands of euro.  The reason for this is that the Department has failed to ensure its own rules are enforced.  The rules are enforced for the students - they must have an attendance rate of 85% - but not in the case of the rules that state very clearly that the money should be placed in an escrow account so this sort of scam cannot happen.  This is not what has been taking place.  As a result, companies are able to walk off with hundreds of thousands of euro from unsuspecting students who have lost their life savings.  Will the Government act to enforce the current rules so that this cannot happen any more?</p></speech>

A fortnight ago I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of opaque shell companies.  These companies are used for aggressive tax planning by firms accused of money laundering which have funnelled billions of euro from the IFSC to Russia.  When I mentioned this to the Taoiseach, he mentioned securitisation but these accounts are not securitisation vehicles.  If changes to our financial regulations and tax codes are not necessary, why has the EU demanded that Ireland implement reforms on money laundering and aggressive tax planning?  The NRRP clearly states that the State must "enhance the supervision and enforcement of the anti-money-laundering framework as regards professionals providing trust and company services."  If we want to show solidarity to the people of Ukraine, we must take real action on this.  Will the Taoiseach commit to ending the use of anonymous company ownerships through trustee structures and ending the ability of these companies to operate from the IFSC for the purpose of aggressive tax planning through section 110 of the tax code?  At a minimum, will the Taoiseach ensure the Minister for Finance undertakes a cost benefit analysis of section 110 to ascertain whether it is consistent with current reforms to the international tax regime?</p></speech>

It is bombing civilians.  It has torn up the multilateral rules-based order with no regard for UN universal values of territorial integrity, sovereignty and democracy.  Russia is afraid of democracy and wants to kill democracy in Ukraine.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is saying that Europe is using this as an excuse to militarise.  Europe did not want this war.  The European Union did everything it possibly could to prevent this war as did President Macron and Chancellor Scholz.  When one is dealing with authoritarian regimes that do not apply democracy or democratic principles to how they conduct their countries and states, it creates vulnerabilities.</p></speech>

The latest manifestation of that is the wholesale war on Ukraine.  We already had a taste of it in 2014 with the invasion of Crimea.  People like the Deputy and others in this House were very silent about it in 2014.  I refer not so much to the Deputy but to the main party opposite, which was quite silent at the time.  When I raised it in this House during European debates at the time, Sinn F&eacute;in did not want to know about it.  The point I am trying to make is that the very unfair tendency in the debate is always to blame the EU.  The Deputy&rsquo;s whole contribution sought to blame the EU and not Russia.  Russia has caused this war.  It makes complete sense that Europe would now reflect and look ahead.</p></speech>

The EU is probably the biggest provider of such assistance in the world to less developed states and to areas of conflict.  Enormous sums of money are allocated.  Similarly, the recovery and resilience facility coming out of Covid-19 is providing enormous sums of money.  For the first time ever, Europe has collectively borrowed and has given enormous sums to countries to enable them to come through the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  I share Deputy Paul Murphy's abhorrence of students being abused in the manner he outlined.  Those who have perpetrated these scams are fundamentally responsible for them, without question.  The enforcement of it is something that should be followed through.  Any swindling or untoward behaviour should be reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="14:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900034#MM00200"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating the motion.  I also thank the House.  Yesterday, the Government approved my request to seek the House's approval to opt-in to this EU Commission proposal.  The proposal seeks to extend the list of EU crimes under Article 83 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, to include hate crime and hate speech by way of Council decision.</p>  <p>  Hate crime is so corrosive of the social solidarity and mutual understanding we need between groups in this increasingly-diverse island.  The Government has no hesitation in commending to the House the motion that we opt in.  Opting in under Article 3 will allow us to be involved in the detailed discussions of this measure and help us to shape the final text.</p>  <p>  Article 83(1) of the TFEU lays down an exhaustive list of areas of EU crimes whereby the European Parliament and the Council may establish minimum rules concerning the definition of "criminal offences and sanctions" applicable in all member states.  A number or areas or crime are currently listed.  Trafficking in human beings, illicit drug trafficking and organised crime are three examples.  Article 83 also provides that, based on developments in crime, the Council may adopt a decision identifying other areas of particularly serious crime that have a cross-border nature, resulting from the nature or impact of such offences, or from a special need to combat them on a common basis.  This is what the Commission is seeking to do in particular with this proposal.  To develop a common approach to hate crime and hate speech at EU level, adoption of a Council decision to extend the list would be a first step to creating the necessary legal basis.</p>  <p>  Opting in to this proposal demonstrates our commitment to tackling hate crime and hate speech, crimes which go against the very foundations of a democratic and inclusive society.  These crimes undermine the fundamental rights and values upon which the Union itself is founded, in particular human dignity and equality.  They cause harm not only to the individual victims but also to wider communities and society at large.  I know sometimes there can be a tendency among those of us who have never known what it is like to be the target of hate crime or hate speech to think that these issues are not serious or that they are rare.  Sadly, they are not as rare as we would like.  In terms of impact on the people who are targeted, the effects can be very serious for them and for their communities.</p>  <p>  Hate crimes target people on the basis of their innate characteristics - parts of their nature they cannot change.  Hate speech is designed to silence people with these characteristics by making them afraid to speak out and to show who they are, where they come from or whom they love.  There is nothing free about making people hide, making them afraid to go where other people go, or shutting them out from the basic freedoms we should all be able to enjoy.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reported at national level on hate-based motivation for crime incidents in previous annual reports.  The Garda Commissioner has said to me that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully accepts there is under-recording of hate-motivated crimes.  As such, actions are under way to improve internal recording of crimes motivated by hate and to encourage more reporting by the public.  This will enable the reporting of hate crime-related incidents and more accurate collation of data in future.</p>  <p>  At European level, unfortunately, hate speech and hate crime are widespread across the Union and have been increasing over recent years.  In particular, the Covid-19 pandemic has heightened the feelings of insecurity, isolation and fear.  This has created an atmosphere in which hate speech has flourished while also being used to target already marginalised populations, also resulting in hate crime.  Both crimes spread across national borders.  Hate speech is easily reproduced and widely shared online through the Internet, including social media, and offline through television broadcasts, public events, written press and political speech.  Hate crimes can be committed or facilitated by networks with members from several countries, who inspire, organise, or carry out physical attacks.</p>  <p>  The 2008 Council framework decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law covers certain aspects of xenophobia and racism in respect of crime.  Ireland gave notice of our compliance with this decision before the 2010 deadline for that instrument as it was in line with the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.  There is a need to effectively address hate speech and hate crime on other grounds beyond those covered by framework decision.  Hate speech and hate crime on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, age and disability have been identified in current EU strategies, namely the gender equality strategy, the LGBTIQ equality strategy and strategy for the rights of persons with disabilities.  The current proposal from the Commission is designed to go further in terms of hate speech and hate crime as these, in its view, constitute serious matters within the scope of "particularly serious crime with a cross-border dimension", which should, therefore, be included in the list under Article 83(1).</p>  <p>  Opting in would also be in line with work under way to improve our domestic response through the criminal justice (hate crime) Bill 2021 and the online safety and media regulation Bill.  As the House knows, Ireland does not currently have any specific legislation to deal with hate crime.  The only legislation in Ireland that deals with hate-based offences is the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.  Although incitement to hatred is an offence, it is difficult to prosecute and there have been very few convictions since its introduction.  A hate motive is something that a judge can take into account as an aggravating factory, on a non-statutory basis, in sentencing for any crime.</p>  <p>  The general scheme of the criminal justice (hate crime) Bill 2021 was published in April 2021.  This new legislation, which will repeal the 1989 Act in its entirety, will create specific, hate-aggravated forms of existing offences that can be investigated, prosecuted and recorded as hate crimes.  The Bill will also provide for new offences of incitement to hatred, which should prohibit deliberately or recklessly inciting hatred against a person or group of people due to their association with a protected characteristic, and displaying or distributing material inciting hatred.  This will have relevance to online hate speech in particular.  Following its publication, the general scheme was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.  This took place in November and the report is awaited.  The Bill has also been referred to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  I intend to publish the new hate crime Bill in the summer, subject to the committee's report of its deliberations.</p>  <p>  In terms of hate speech online, the hate crime Bill will be supported by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media's online safety and media regulation Bill, the general scheme of which was published in January.  It addresses harmful content online as "material which is likely to have the effect of intimidating, threatening, humiliating or persecuting a person to which it pertains and which a reasonable person would conclude was the intention of its dissemination".  The online safety and media regulation Bill will provide for the formation of a media commission, a component of which will be the online safety commissioner.  The Bill will also provide for the preparation of online safety codes governing standards and practices to be observed by designated online services.</p>  <p>  As the development of EU law in this area will have a direct impact on the amendment of our domestic law in this area, participation by the Department on the working groups, committees or other bodies at EU level that will formulate the proposed measures under Article 83 is essential to ensure Ireland's contributions to those proposals are provided from an early stage.  It is also essential to ensure development of the forthcoming hate crime Bill is framed in light of developments at the EU level.  We can take part at a later date but if we do not opt in in the first three months we cannot contribute to any change that may be necessary.</p>  <p>Members will have seen in the explanatory memorandum provided to the Library and Research Service by my Department that there is no expenditure associated with this proposal and that the Office of the Attorney General has advised that opting into the proposed decision does not, in itself, create any constitutional or legal issues for the State.  </p> <p> We have traditionally been very cautious about regulating hate speech.  This is because any restrictions on speech are, of course, a very serious matter.  I am committed to ensuring that the legislation we introduce domestically is completely in harmony with the very important right to freedom of expression we all enjoy.  When we think of hate speech and our own freedoms, we should remember that there is nothing noble or free about hate speech.  There are people who have been the victims of crime and attempts to sow hatred in our society.  Any directives proposed as a result of the expansion of Article 83 to include hate crime and hate speech will need to be carefully examined in detail by my Department and the Attorney General, particularly if they raise questions with regard to freedom of expression.  However, by opting in now, the State can be part of those detailed discussions in Brussels.  We will have an opportunity to consider whether we should be included in any such new proposed directives that will follow because Protocol 21 will apply.  </p> <p> I reiterate that Ireland's involvement at the initial stages of the development of this proposal and other further legislative proposals brought forward by the commission under Article 83 is both prudent and necessary for us to be involved in detailed discussion on such measures.  The French Presidency will take this proposal forward and we are eager to get a Council decision on this agreement within its term, which ends at the end of June.  It is appropriate that we stand with the French Presidency as France is our nearest neighbour in the EU.  We propose to support this proposal by opting in.  I commend this motion to the House.</p></speech>

Anyway, I thank the Minister.  We have no difficulty in supporting this proposal.  In the context of world politics and what we are seeing across the world, the concept of hate crime and hate speech affects all of us.  We need to be very conscious of it.  I was reading up on some of the issues and came across the report, Legislating for Hate Speech and Hate Crime in Ireland, that was published in 2020.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	Hate crimes are signal crimes.  They send a message to the victim, and to other people like them, that they are not safe, not wanted, or somehow not a real member of Irish society who is entitled to the same protections or the same freedoms as other people.<br /><br />Victims of hate crime are made to feel afraid for the future, not just for themselves but for their friends, their loved ones and their children.  This type of fear can lead to anger, and ultimately to a more divided society where whole communities can feel unsafe. </blockquote>  <p>Those paragraphs at the beginning of the report are a very good synopsis of what we are trying to deal with here.  As the Minister said, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 goes some distance towards dealing with some of those issues but very little has happened as a result of that Act.  I believe we all recognise that it is not strong enough.  I agree with the Minister that we are all a little hesitant to act in this area, particularly when it comes to hate speech, because freedom of speech is paramount.  People must be able to express their views and opinions on issues that are affecting their lives at any given time.  However, it is not appropriate for people to insult, attack or intimidate others, and some people stretch the concept of freedom of speech to cover such actions.  That is one of the core issues we have to deal with.  </p><p>Of course, we also recognise that hate crime is generally an aggravating factor in another crime.  It occurs when a person is being physically attacked or abused if it can be shown that the perpetrator is doing so with a racist motive or a motive related to the sexual orientation or gender of the person being attacked.  I particularly think of issues related to violence against women.  Can they be described as hate crimes in some of these situations?  I believe they can be.  </p><p>We need to try to deal with these issues.  I welcome what is being done and I would welcome anything that went further in that regard.  I acknowledge that the Minister is doing other work in this area.  The big area where we all come into this is the online sphere and what the various platforms can do.  We have to recognise that those behind the keyboards typing the words in are ultimately responsible for what goes up but the platforms that allow it to go up also have a responsibility to ensure that people are not defamed or attacked and that their integrity is not undermined.  These issues have to be dealt with conclusively.  I understand this legislation will go some way towards that.  I hope that we can get into more of the detail as the legislation progresses.  I will leave it at that because three other speakers are waiting.</p></speech>

At the time, the committee heard that the Bill is an attempt to consolidate all legislation related to crimes motivated by hate.  I have listened to what the Minister has said as to how this might affect the Bill and what interaction between domestic and EU law will look like afterwards.  Minimum standards regarding crime with cross-border implications makes sense as we are in an increasingly connected world and, as she said, an increasingly diverse society.  In addition to Ireland being seen as a tax haven and carbon emissions haven for corporations, there is a risk that we might be perceived as being weak on hate speech on social media.  I welcome what the Minister said with regard to the online safety commissioner.  I look forward to seeing the minimum standards set out in the motion, which should combat such speech.</p>  <p>  At the same time, we must be conscious of the context of speech.  This must be advanced in tandem with equality and free speech.  Sometimes, people who are fighting for material fairness, for example, with regard to the Palestinian cause, must be taken into account.  I reject any notion that standing with oppressed peoples must constitute hate against others.  We must be careful not to end up in a worse place as a society by introducing laws in a vacuum.  </p>  <p>  During the committee's meeting, I raised a number of surveys and statistics.  I welcome what the Minister said about her conversation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to internal recording.  We need more comprehensive data, particularly with regard to sexual violence and other categories of crime.  In dealing with the Traveller community, confidence in the justice system is vitally important.  We must remember the experiences of the Irish community in England and what they had to deal with.  Irish people did not have confidence in the justice system there.  Our minority communities and Travellers are in a similar situation and they must have confidence in the justice system here.  With regard to data, while I do not advocate following the UK's approach, it is streets ahead of us in respect of data and statistics and we should seek to match it.  I look forward to a more in-depth examination of the upcoming Bill and the implications of this motion when the Bill goes to First Stage proper.</p></speech>

Perhaps the most devastating of all of these images were those of families being ripped apart and of women and children and, in some cases, children on their own travelling across borders.  I am very aware that thousands of these children and women will be coming to Ireland in the coming weeks.  Some have already come.  We have spoken about that.  I am also very aware that the trauma these people have experienced, and will continue to experience, is unimaginable.  These people will soon be on our streets, in our schools and in our shops.  They will be anxious, waiting for news from home.  Their families will be missing fathers and they will be missing friends and other relatives.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend that there is no racism or discrimination in this State.  We have seen on social media racism and vicious attacks from certain individuals who are determined to bring down this State.  We need to make sure that our streets are safe for those coming from Ukraine, Syria, Yemen or Palestine, for refugees from other parts of the world who might come here in the future and for members of other marginalised groups such as the LGBTQI community, disabled people and members of the Traveller community.  Ireland has a long history of oppression but we also have a long history of compassion.  We cannot let that be overshadowed by the voices of a few who want to target and discriminate against people based on differences.  Hate crime and hate speech have no place in our society.  We are better than that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="14:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900035#NN00800"><p>Our society is very much lessened by the creeping incitement to hatred that has increased over recent years.  While social media is often blamed, and rightly so because it speeds up the spreading of toxic hate speech, it is not the only cause.  There are also often headlines in our supposedly reputable press that covertly, and sometimes overtly, incite hatred.</p> <p>We must look across the board and we must hold people accountable.  That is why I welcome this common legal framework to combat hate.  As the Minister rightly said, hate speech is often used as a way of making people afraid after which it is easier to control them and their thinking.</p> <p> Hate speech has no place inside or outside politics.  Since coming to this House, I have seen things said in this Chamber that people really need to be held accountable for.  During the Covid pandemic, it was used by extreme ideological movements to spread hatred on a range of grounds, including religion, sex and sexual orientation.  When I talk about hate crime, I always remember Sophie Lancaster.  Sophie Lancaster was a 20-year-old woman who was kicked to death for looking different.  We did much work in the community in County Mayo with the Sophie Lancaster Foundation and with her mother Sylvia.  We went into the schools to use the toolkit they had provided, which was the acronym for Sophie - stamp out prejudice, hatred and intolerance everywhere.</p> <p> I welcome the domestic legislation that is to follow.  We absolutely need to get it right.  We also need to ensure it permeates down into our schools and wider communities.  Hate speech has no place in our communities and no place in our country.  People who spread it must be held accountable and this will allow us to do that.  Attempts to dehumanise or spread fear and hate of those with opposing views or those who, somehow, we perceive as being different must stop throughout the island.  We also need to call it out.  Sometimes we choose to ignore it in certain quarters while we focus on it in other quarters.  This is a very important step forward in a longer journey we will all make together to introduce legislation to stamp out hatred and intolerance everywhere.</p></speech>

The European Parliament and EU Council can establish rules concerning the definition of "criminal offences and sanctions", as they are recommending.  The framework decision requires member states to criminalise hate speech, that is, public incitement to violence or hatred on grounds of race, colour, religion, descent, or national or ethnic origin.  It also requires member states to ensure for offences other than hate speech that such racist and xenophobic motivation is considered as an aggravating circumstance or alternatively that such motivation can be taken into account in determining the penalties.</p>  <p>  Hate crimes and hate speech are very important matters for our times.  We look forward to the legislation coming before the House so that we can deal with these in more detail.  These matters go to the core of our humanity, the essence of being a person that all people can be in essence themselves without being abused, harassed or denigrated because of the race, religion, gender or sexuality that they are entitled to be.  It goes to the core of the value systems of the European Union that in Europe all our people can be themselves, express themselves and rejoice in their own uniqueness without fear.  That is the hope and we need to ensure that we can create as far as we can a framework to make that a reality.</p>  <p>  This is, of course, a new situation.  In my period in this House, we have seen Ireland transformed.  The Ireland I grew up in was largely monocultural and mono-religious.  It was enormously intolerant of difference.  It was male-dominated, oppressive of same-sex love and, at best, suspicious of different races.  Sometimes it was far more than suspicious and was downright hostile and violent.  That has greatly changed.  Through our own efforts we have largely transformed our society.  However, we still have a long way to go to make that vision of a truly equal society a reality.</p>  <p>  Europe also has other voices.  We hear too often the increased drumbeat of the far-right nationalist voices.  Those core values that we hold dear and that have been hard won and recently won are not guaranteed to last.  Just as the unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia has jolted all of us from complacency on the issue of an enduring peace on our Continent, which we thought was a fixed reality, so too must we be ever-vigilant in the defence of the values of tolerance and willing to be heard on those who would divide us as a people and our continent on racial, religious, gender or sexual-orientation grounds.</p>  <p>  We still marginalise certain ethnic groups in our own community, including Travellers.  Although we have clear legislation and have walked a long distance towards having a truly inclusive society, much more remains to be done.  There are still the snide comments as well as the bad and wrong use of language.  All these things are part of our experience but there are things that go well beyond that into the realm of the wholly unacceptable and for those we need to be clear.  The platforms available now for social discourse are new and the level of abuse out there must be regulated and dealt with.  Coco's law was one step in doing that last year and I thank the Minister for her support in doing that but we need to go much further.  I welcome the suggestion she has made in this debate.</p>  <p>  We will support this motion and look forward to enactment of concrete legislation that will underpin it for the future.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for bringing to the House following yesterday's Cabinet meeting.  In combination with the hate crime Bill and that is due to be published this summer the Minister has clearly showed her leadership on an issue that is in that always been a nasty part of our society, as has been alluded to quite clearly by Deputy Howlin.  However, it has taken an edge in recent years because while society has become more accessible it has allowed people to engage in the sort of hate speech at a level not previously seen.</p>  <p>  The need for a common EU approach is obvious because the world is a much smaller place.  We regularly see disinformation and misinformation campaigns with the level of hatred in one country exported to another member state.  This has been quite pronounced in debates in recent years.  These include the Brexit discussion, the rule-of-law crisis and the refugee-migration crisis.  It has certainly been very stark and it would be remiss of me not to mention it.  In recent weeks following the brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russia we see that part of Vladimir Putin's regime of hybrid warfare is hate speech and the campaign of disinformation that is infecting all of our lives.  It is infecting all our tablets and devices.</p>  <p>  Yesterday when I was posting a tweet, as we all do, I went to use the hashtag, #IstandwithUkraine and the first suggested tag was #IstandwithPutin.  I struggle to believe this is a popular hashtag in Ireland.  Why is Twitter's algorithm pushing these messages?  While we are passing this extremely important motion and there will be related legislation, there still remains the absolute abdication of responsibility by social media companies, in particular when it comes to regulating this area.  Our traditional print media have very defined rules.  Our National Union of Journalists abides by a very strict code.  However, increasingly social media are becoming the Wild West of hate speech.</p> <p>Anyone can say what they like.  Not to make it personal, but officially I am ranked as the sixth most abused politician in the D&aacute;il on Twitter.  It is not a badge of honour, it is not particularly pleasant, and while we are all grown-ups who can deal with it, it is not very nice reading for my wife or my siblings, who perhaps do not get that the comments, which are largely sectarian, are aimed and do not always come from this State.  When we see this particular disinformation campaign and see how it creeps into mainstream discussion and how people are saying it is because there is a Nazi regime in Ukraine and that sort of approach, it comes to the very importance of ensuring not only that we have a common EU approach but also, crucially, that this jurisdiction leads.  We are proudly the European headquarters for so many of the digital companies, social media companies, tech companies and many of the other companies that enable such wonderful things from sharing holiday pictures to reconnecting with old friends to accessing real-time information.  Crucially, however, they also provide a platform for hate speech that simply is incomparable to the graffiti or the snide remarks we would have seen a generation ago.  They continue to go completely unregulated.</p> <p> Deputy Howlin is absolutely correct that passing this motion is a welcome start.  I hope to see it get unanimous support in this House, but it is just a start.  It needs to be accompanied by real legislation.  Even today, despite European sanctions against Russian media operations, despite the banning of RT, Sputnik and everyone else, there still are proactive accounts flooding Europe with disinformation about the war in Ukraine.  That is hate speech, it is wrong and it is why this motion is so important, but equally, it is why the related legislation is so important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1570" speakername="Patrick Costello" time="14:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900037#PP00200"><p>I will start in that place.  This motion is very important but the tapestry of legislation the Government is introducing in this area is also very important and very welcome, such as the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  These things are very important and show we are acting.  This motion and the opt-in are very important because a lot of the hate speech, hate organisations and far-right organisations are organising on a European-wide level, so we need to work together at a European level to push back against them.</p>  <p>  What we see on our streets here is an emboldened far right, organisations driven by racism and hate which are much more open and much more open in their activities and in the language they use.  We have seen the assaulting of left-wing activists on the streets, calls for the lynching of Ministers based on who they are, calls for deportation, and protests arguing for the deportation of Irish people who do not fit narrow, often racially motivated, definitions of what it is to be Irish.  We have seen arson attacks against Deputies who have stood up for people in direct provision.  None of this is acceptable, yet it continues with this emboldened far right.  We have seen an exploitation of Covid and the lockdown, using people's genuine fears and concerns and exploiting them to continue to build a far right hate organisation and organisations in this country.  We have seen the Institute of Strategic Dialogue talking about the far right building layers of lies using Telegram and other platforms.  The Irish Network Against Racism, INAR, has spoken about the Irish far right fake news industry adding to racism in this country.  We therefore need to pass these bits of legislation.  We need to opt into this in order that we can work together to push back against the growing, more aggressive and more organised far right hate organisations in this country that are actively on the streets and pushing their aggressive, racist, violent agenda.</p>  <p>  Equally, while there are those who are trying to pull us apart and trying to pull society part, and these pieces of legislation are very important in stopping them doing that, there is a responsibility on all of us to ensure we are pulling people together more quickly than they can pull them apart.  This legislation will help that because it will slow down the pulling part.  However, in the communities, organisations, clubs and societies in which we are involved, we have a responsibility to ask whether we are being welcoming, reaching out and being inclusive.  When I was still a scout leader, I was involved in a pilot project trying to reach out to young people in direct provision.  It is things like that, where we are building the tapestry of a modern Ireland quicker than those who are hell bent on tearing it apart, even if that is by violence, and we do not let them tear us apart or turn us against one another.  As I said, this needs to be a Europe-wide thing, so I am very glad the Minister is bringing this and the other Government legislation before us.</p></speech>

For example, the American elections, the referendum on Brexit and the pandemic brought these manifestations to the fore.  We witnessed misinformation, hate speech, hate crime, xenophobia, racism and conspiracy theories dangerously becoming the norm.  Without doubt a need for robust legislation is required and copper-fastened definitions need to be put in place.  We agree we need dissuasive criminal sanctions across Europe.  However, we must also have a duty to make sure free speech and freedom of expression are equally balanced and protected, as provided by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights.  We must also make sure regimes that exploit dignity and human rights are not given impunity through default.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask the Minister - and I know there will be further opportunities to scrutinise this proposal - to verify here in the D&aacute;il that no citizen's constitutional rights will be affected by the proposal to extend the list of EU crimes to hate speech and hate crimes.  I am a member of the Oireachtas committee that conducted the pre-legislative scrutiny on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  Through this work I have seen at first hand how complex these issues are to regulate.  We have grappled with real-life examples from children's rights organisations on the harms of online harassment and bullying but, on the other hand, we have been warned of the danger to democracy that over-regulating speech can bring.  The core of this issue is who gets to define "hate" and who gets to enforce punishment of same.  We must have a broad and authentic input from all sides of this debate and consider all knowledgeable stakeholders as we do the work on this motion here on this island.  We must also take into account that the digital age has revolutionised the way people are communicating across the world and we must make sure it is a tool used for good, not evil.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900037#PP00400"><p>Hate speech and hate crime really have a ripple effect.  The fear and anxiety caused by crimes resonate through communities and through generations.  Targeting people on the basis of their identity sends a message to every other person in that community that they are not safe and they do not belong.  It undermines the core values we strive for in society of equality, diversity and inclusion, and it undermines the fundamental right of everyone to be treated with dignity and respect.</p>  <p>  I welcome the decision of the EU to begin the process of forming a common legal framework to combat hate speech and hate crime and welcome the Government's commitment to supporting it.  However, any final agreement in the EU will be as a result of a consensus with countries such as Poland and Hungary, whose governments have relentlessly pursued minority groups such as the LGBT community over recent years.  Our domestic legislation can be stronger and can go further.  I know the Minister has drafted the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill which is at pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  I hope it will be prioritised in the Government's coming legislative programme once the programme has been completed.</p>  <p>  We are one of the few western democracies that does not have any legislation that targets the hate element of crime.  Introducing strong legislation on hate crime and hate speech, in consultation with minority groups, will be a public statement by this country that we do not tolerate that kind of behaviour.  It would send a message that there are serious consequences for anyone who attacks or terrorises individuals and communities for who they are.  We all know there are many things that happen that are categorised as antisocial behaviour but which are much more than antisocial behaviour.  These kinds of crimes very often fall into that category.</p>  <p>  The absence of hate crime legislation in Ireland has not sent a good message.  Hate crime has an horrific impact on victims.  Direct impacts range from physical injury to lasting emotional and psychological harm.  Victims of hate crime are twice as likely to suffer anxiety, depression, a loss of confidence and feelings of vulnerability in comparison with other victims of crime.</p> <p>That is because hate crime is not random but is purposeful and directed at someone's identity.  The perpetrators want the victim to be scared, to feel the other and to feel less themselves.  One account in the Irish Council for Civil Liberties report, Life Cycle of a Hate Crime, demonstrates how damaging an effect these crimes can have.  It states:</p><blockquote>	I was working with a mother last year whose son was abused by [a] neighbour physically, verbally, they suffered property damage &ndash; spray paint on the house.  The child tried to kill himself twice.  He poured detergent over his skin because he thought it would make him white. </blockquote> <p>We cannot properly combat discrimination of any kind unless we know the basic facts of where it is happening and how prevalent it is.  We do not have any official data on the prevalence of hate crime in Ireland.  The Garda records discriminatory motives for crime on the PULSE system but these data are not publicly released and we have no idea how accurate they are.  The data we have show some worrying trends.  The Irish Network Against Racism has collected reports of racist incidents for years on <i>iReport.ie</i>.  The latest report in 2020 found 159 criminal incidents, a record 51 racist assaults and a record 334 hate speech incidents.  There were a total of 700 incidents, up from 530 in 2019.  I suspect that is a significant understatement of the problem.<br/><br/>Over recent years during Covid, forces have aligned and some of the things we are concerned about have been heightened.  Undoing that will be a question of understanding the prevalence.  For people to appreciate they are participating in a crime will be important in making a public statement.  We support this initiative and hope the legislation will come through pre-legislative scrutiny quickly so we have something tangible on the Statute Book.</p></speech>

I fully support Ireland's approval of the initiative to extend the list of EU crimes.  In Ireland, hate crimes are on the rise.  Hate crimes and related incidents increased by more than 80% in the first six months of 2021, according to Garda figures.  On a positive note, this increase may be due in part to people feeling more encouraged to report crimes of this nature because we are improving our recognition of hate speech and hate crimes and learning to stand up to them and call them out when we see them.  That is welcome but it still points firmly to a growing prevalence of hate crimes and hate speech in Ireland.  Sadly, this phenomenon is not unique to our country.  There is a similar trend around the world and across Europe, with hate speech and hate crime becoming a worryingly staple behaviour in the real world and the virtual online world.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister is working on furthering the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill, which would give us increased powers to deal with perpetrators of crimes motivated by prejudice, whether that prejudice relates to race, colour, nationality, religion, sexuality or other protected characteristics.  That is welcome but at an EU level there is no legal basis to criminalise hate speech and hate crime.  I was shocked by that.  I did not realise it and was surprised to learn it given how prevalent these crimes are.  In recent weeks, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has re-emphasised to many of us the importance of our connection to Europe and the EU and the importance of being able to take part in a unified response to a crisis or threat.  Creating an EU basis for criminalising these offences allows us collectively to recognise the threat that hate speech and hate crime pose.  They are a threat to safety and decency, to our right to be different and celebrate unique identities, and to our democracy, a pillar which we recognise, now more than ever, is imperative to our peaceful existence.</p>  <p>  Online hate speech is probably the crime that unites us most at EU level, given how fast hate speech on social media can spread and how quickly it can be accessible to everybody, providing multiple opportunities for people to weigh in with hate-filled comments.  In many cases, the veil of social media gives users a kind of virtual Dutch courage to share and spread hate speech that they probably would not do in the real world.  In other cases, it can be the jumping-off point for bigots, racists, misogynists and people who will become extremists, egged on by an echo chamber of people who share in hate.  We desperately need a united EU approach that recognises online hate speech as dangerous and criminal.  Most importantly, users need to understand that engaging in hate crimes online is no different from perpetrating them in real life.  Both should be treated with the same severity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="14:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900038#QQ00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on hate speech and hate crime.  One of the reasons I welcome it is there is a certain amount of confusion and uncertainty among the public as to what is meant by hate speech legislation or hate crime legislation.  There would be benefit in the Oireachtas enunciating to the public what is meant by that.  On one level are people who are fearful of hate crime legislation because they think it will criminalise their thoughts or what they say privately.  It will not.  On another are people who think there will be no protection for minorities unless hate speech and hate crime legislation is enacted rapidly.</p>  <p>  I welcome the proposal that hate crime and hate speech be included in Article 83 of the treaty so directives could be promulgated and issued in respect of those offences.  Criminal justice is generally a competence of the member state, but there are certain types of criminal activity the European Union and the members states have, through ratification of the treaties, agreed could also be dealt with at a European Union level.  For instance, money laundering or illegal trafficking of humans is dealt with on a European Union level.  Part of the reason for that is because it involves pan-jurisdictional offences and it makes sense to have a Europe-wide legislation and directive to deal with it.</p>  <p>  We need to have two principles at the forefront of our mind when we talk about hate speech and hate crime.  One is that we know from experience and history that groups can be targeted and subjected to extraordinary violence and criminal activity as a result of incitement to hatred against them.  We saw that in Europe in the 1930s with what happened to the Jewish population.  Second, we need to take into account that freedom of expression is important.  People need to be reassured this legislation will not criminalise their thoughts or that they will not be able to express their hatreds.  Many people in this country hate politicians, though Members of this House may find that extraordinary.  After the legislation is enacted, they will still be entitled to hate politicians.  Some people hate lawyers or bankers, and legislation in respect of hate speech or hate crime will not affect that.</p>  <p>  We need to send out a message as to what is hate speech.  Hate speech legislation is legislation introduced to prohibit the public incitement to violence or hatred on grounds of race, colour, religion, provenance or national or ethnic origin.  We have had it on the Statute Book since 1989 in the form of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act.  There are not many prosecutions under it but it exists.  The important point about it is it is only triggered when somebody advocates for hatred or violence against a particular group of people.  We have very few examples of that in Ireland, and when this legislation is enacted, there will not be many prosecutions in respect of it because people are measured and balanced in their public commentary.  We would have to go back to the previous century to find examples of people who strenuously advocated incitement to violence or hatred against certain groups in this country based on race, religion, sexual orientation or gender.</p>  <p>  Then you come to ask "What is hate crime?"</p> <p>What is proposed when it comes to hate crime is that there will be an aggravated element to a sentence if a person is convicted of a criminal offence because he or she targeted an individual due to that person's race, religion or identity.  If somebody, for example, assaults an individual, and does so on racist or xenophobic grounds, it will be possible for a court when sentencing the perpetrator to take into account as an aggravating factor that the motivation in committing the offence was based on targeting the victim for xenophobic and-or racist reasons.  We must be careful and clear about what is meant by hate speech and hate crime.  This is not going to change the world or be the panacea for all our ills, but it is something that is beneficial, is there at present and must be clarified in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="15:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900039#RR00200"><p>According to the UN, there has been an alarming spike in online and offline speech in recent years.  In examining the reasons for this, the UN has said that this rise can be linked to changes in the social, economic and technological environment and to Covid-19 and Internet use.  For the European Commission, only the identification of hate speech and hate crime as a new and distinct area of crime can enable an effective and comprehensive criminal law approach to these phenomena at EU level.  That is because there is now no legal basis to criminalise hate speech and hate crime as an EU standard.  It is unfortunate that we find ourselves at this stage, but it is important that we legislate to protect people, demographic groups and minorities from this type of abuse.  If we do not, then we will fail not just the people concerned, who, of course, are our primary concern, but also every strand of our society, as it would weaken the basis on which we can count on a democratic society to embrace tolerance, diversity and inclusiveness.</p><p>Let us take online hate speech for a moment, because it is often accompanied by other issues that seek to marginalise people.  This is because where online hate speech is present, other manufactured reasons for discrimination against one group or another are likely to accompany it.  Hate speech online is often accompanied by misinformation, something that is presenting itself to us now as even more of an issue when those responsible for perpetrating the Russian invasion of Ukraine have tried to get people behind them by falsifying the truth and making extreme claims, which is what we have seen.  As the European Commission put it:</p> <blockquote> 	Online hate speech spreads fast and is accessible to everybody anywhere.  The ideologies behind hate speech and hate crime can be developed internationally and can be rapidly shared online.  Hate crimes can be committed by networks with members from several countries. </blockquote>  <p>While it is welcome that we are seeking to have an EU-wide legal basis to criminalise hate speech and hate crime, it cannot be done in isolation.  Social media platforms must do far more to protect their users.  We cannot allow them to shirk their responsibilities here any longer.  Some action has been taken to monitor false information about Covid-19, but there are still many gaps in this and many other areas, including hate speech and bullying.  In a study linked with the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal, researchers found that 52% of young women and girls have experienced online violence, including threats and sexual harassment, while people with disabilities were more at risk of being victims of violent crimes, including hate crimes, than other people and they also face harassment.</p><p>They are important for ensuring we can reinforce protections for all EU citizens by addressing this deficit in EU law.  We must also look to the future.  We have seen the start of a refugee crisis the likes of which has not been seen in Europe since the Second World War.  Every country in the EU will play its part, but a challenge will present itself when voices that may be critical of the approach of one or all states to offering refuge becomes transformed into a vehicle for hate through words or actions or both.  This is definitely something that all member states must be ready to address quickly as the EU enters a new era in which it must adapt to some very pressing issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.434" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="15:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900039#RR00300"><p>I will raise two specific points, but before I get to them I will make some general remarks.  Hate speech, racist speech and the kind of hatred spewed by those on the far right, which must be combated and fought and the best way to do that is by building a mass anti-racist and anti-fascist movement, is connected to the hate policies and state racism of the EU and the Irish Government.  They are not two unrelated things.  It is not the case that the EU can hypocritically say that it is against hate speech, and so on, over here, but over there treat migrants the way they are treated.  I refer to turning the Mediterranean Sea into a graveyard of refugees because of the pursuit of Fortress Europe.  Those are related things.  They are even politically related because one legitimises the other.  Let us consider what is happening now in the French presidential election campaign.  The candidate of the supposed centre-right is chasing Le Pen and Zemmour in the race to be the most Islamophobic and anti-migrant, which, in turn, legitimises their discourse and allows them to go further to the right.  I refer as well to the scenes we have seen in recent days in the Spanish enclave of Melilla, where a couple of thousand desperate refugees made it over the guard wire only to be mercilessly beaten by the Spanish police.  Let us look at the Irish State's racist policies of direct provision, DP, and how people are treated in what are basically open prisons.  There is a relationship between the two and it is utterly hypocritical not to see this.</p><p>Turning to the two specific points I wish to address, the first concerns an email we received from members of the Russian-speaking community here, which raises concerning points about the racism they are facing.  The email made the point that the community is made up of all nationalities, including Ukrainians, Belarusians, Russians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Armenians, Georgians and children of Russian-speaking parents.  In the context of Putin's horrific invasion of Ukraine, the email states that these people's children have faced verbal and physical abuse from other pupils, that there has been verbal and physical abuse of members of the Russian-speaking community in workplaces and in public places and that a member of the Orthodox Church in Ireland had received threats and was verbally abused.  It is vital that a message goes out that any sort of racism or discrimination directed against Russian-speaking or ethnically-Russian people here is to be condemned.  It is, potentially, an unfortunate by-product of treating the Russian people collectively as being in some way responsible for Putin's crimes.  The effect of having sanctions aimed at the people, as opposed to simply at the oligarchs, can be to legitimise that kind of behaviour, and a strong statement must be made in that regard.</p><p>My second and last point is a worrying one, about which new evidence has just emerged.  I have repeatedly raised the issue of the racist discrimination concerning refugees fleeing from Ukraine.  There definitely seems to be discrimination based on skin colour and on passports.  This has previously been dismissed as a Russian disinformation campaign, despite it having been reported by CNN, <i>Time</i>, <i>Vox</i>and many other outlets.  Credible stories have been reported of black people being separated into different queues and of being forced to wait much longer by elements of the Ukrainian military and by Polish border guards.  I saw one story about people being forced to wait four days at the border and not being given anything to eat.</p><p>Unfortunately, the evidence that this is taking place is much stronger again today based on what Ukraine's envoy to the UK, ambassador Prystaiko, told a select committee at Westminster.  What he said was extremely concerning:</p> <blockquote> 	Problems arise when young foreigners are prioritised over women and children of Ukrainian citizenship who are trying to get on the same trains.  Maybe we will put all foreigners in some other place so they won&rsquo;t be visible and there won&rsquo;t be conflict with Ukrainians trying to flee in the same direction.  This is something that has to be taken care of and we will be doing it. </blockquote>  <p>It is vital that a strong statement comes from the Irish Government and the EU to say that all refugees are welcome, regardless of their skin colour and passport and that there should be no discrimination by the Ukrainian authorities, Polish border guards or any other EU border guards.</p></speech>

When I was a primary school teacher, kids would come in from the yard and an elbow, punch or trip would have hurt them, but words hurt them far more.  It should come as no surprise to us as adults that hate speech and all that it encompasses is equally as hurtful.  It has taken us a long time to do this and there have been many iterations of legislation that has tried to deal with this issue, but it is right that in 2022 this is being dealt with at EU level.</p> <p>Any utterances that diminish one's equality, standing and self-respect on the grounds of race, colour, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or religion are disgusting, immoral and, very soon, will be in the realm of crime.  Too many people have hidden behind veils of anonymity when it comes to hate speech.</p> <p> I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s, and in the schoolyard of an all-boys' school, the homophobic slagging was very much a staple diet.  Many people here could relate to that.  Those words were brushed off by many of us, but for some they were words that hurt and lingered for many years afterwards.  It is good this Irish State has atoned for much of that awful stuff that went on in schoolyards over the years, with the marriage equality referendum being one of those acts of atonement.  Now children are growing up knowing that another boy or girl in their school can have two dads or two moms.  It is acceptable and something they grow up with.  Books in school libraries now reflect the family make-up we have in Ireland, and all that is progressive and normalised.</p> <p> There is a murky underbelly on social media and every one of us uses such media.  It is a way for us to engage.  The mainstream media are not present in the Chamber but they may be following the debate on the monitors, and much of what we do now as public representatives plays out on social media.  Such media can be a murky place with many individuals and people who are politically affiliated throwing punches and who are practitioners of hate speech.  I have checked some of the people posting on my comments.  I posted the other day about very local issues and had an audience from Carrickmacross, Newry, Derry and Dundalk weighing in on it, despite it having no relevance to them.  Some people have questioned if the Ab&uacute; system is working but it is working very well.  It is time to call some of it off.</p> <p> I want to speak to the targeting of Ukrainian President Zelenskiy.  It is absolutely disgusting that Russian President Putin has time and again thrown out terms like "Jew" and "neo-Nazi" as a way of discrediting a European democratically elected government.  Our Taoiseach and Cabinet should show our full alliance with Ukraine when engaging with European counterparts, as we do today with the lighting of the building and all the actions taking place in and outside the building.  It is very important those hate words that are being used as a tool and weapon of language are knocked on the head.</p> <p> There is a political party that does not yet have a seat in this Chamber, the Irish Freedom Party.  It practises hate messaging and it is how it operates.  Its members message on topics of gender, transgender and immigration.  They are the issues on which they campaign.  It can be argued it is a political party with a right to represent and speak, but it does not have any elected mandate in this country.  If its members believe they have a right to speech, they will have less of a right to make their statements when we sign up to this because any form of rallying people or inciting hatred in that regard will be illegal.</p></speech>

This is a transnational crime, and particularly with Europe in a time of war, it is really important we are sensitive to the way in which difference, vulnerabilities and hostilities can be blown out of all proportion.  That said, the criminal bar is very high and we must often look elsewhere for the drivers of what eventually emerges as hate speech and appalling hate crimes.</p>  <p>  Not unlike the discussion we have had recently on gender-based violence, where we find a very low level of reporting of such crimes and low detection rates, this is an area where people are feeling extremely intimidated in reporting.  There is a wider responsibility for society, including in politics, as Deputy Crowe mentioned, to identify the smaller ways in which a tolerance for caricatures of opponents are created that are deliberately designed to discredit.  Such action has been magnified by social media and it seems the apparent remoteness or anonymity of social media has created an extraordinarily feral environment where people seem to think they can say anything.  They sink into their own little capsules and only listen to the views of those who are like them.</p>  <p>  We who are in politics have a particular responsibility to try to restore some sort of a common forum with common standards being applied.  I was proud to be part of the development of the online safety commissioner.  We developed that concept and we must steer a course between the right of freedom of expression on the one hand and the right to respect people and protect their privacy on the other.  The approach being taken in that respect is very important and we must see it go beyond the fairly narrow criteria that were being thought of in the context of that Bill, which considered things that would be unsafe.</p>  <p>  We must see the development of codes of practice within social media platforms that observe more standards than they have been used to in the past.  It is correct there should be flexible codes so that an online commissioner would not have to try to set out inflexible rules in primary legislation.  Instead, we should be able to give some discretion to an online commissioner to be able to identify the trends emerging and cut them off at their source.  The anonymity of some of those who put up this material must be challenged as well.  I am not sure it is acceptable that we have the creation of capsules of hate with anonymous people fuelling that hate.</p>  <p>  There is real scope to go beyond the criminalisation of the very extreme cases and look within our society to see how we might correct other features that are the early starts to the sort of appalling abuse that can emerge.  I wish the Minister well but the House will need to return to this subject to try to ensure standards across a range of communications can be upheld.</p></speech>

We support this motion and there is a need for a significant amount of due diligence to be done so we can get a system that is fit for purpose.  We all agree there are major issues when it comes to hate crime and hate speech and we see them far too often in society.  Unfortunately, the online world provides a large forum for this too.</p>  <p>  We are talking about online safety and we need to do some real work in bringing technology companies to book.  We have heard what Ms Frances Haugen said about Facebook, how its algorithms work and the idea that they basically feed from, enable or facilitate that type of aggressive hate, with people finding themselves in a rabbit hole where they follow views of a similar ilk.  That will happen to a point where they will lose all sense of reality and go down the rabbit hole.  If that is a rabbit hole of absolute hate and bile, it is not a good place and it is not good for what people might do in society.  We have specific work to do there.</p>  <p>  We must look at the context in which we find ourselves following the absolutely criminal invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  We are dealing with a huge humanitarian crisis and, in fairness, this State is stepping up to the mark, along with a huge number of Irish people.  We have all been contacted by people looking to help, where they can, those fleeing war, murder, war criminality and all that goes with it.  Russia must be absolutely called out on that.  Again, we must ensure these people come to an Ireland that is welcoming and open.  We must not leave any room or space for a level of insidious racism, which we all come across from time to time through inference.  People might say something would be different if they were of a different colour or persuasion, for example.  I am constantly looking that special section of the local authority that looks after people who come from certain parts of the world in a faster way, because I would like to use it myself for constituents.  However, I do not think I will find it.</p> <p>Unfortunately we have to close that stuff down where it exists.</p> <p> The major players in this are the social media companies.  Beyond that, if we are talking in this general sphere, we are the tech hub of Europe.  We are a major base for social media and IT companies across the world.  Given the circumstances we are in, we also need to make sure we are doing due diligence as we are open to cyber and hybrid attacks.  It has never been more dangerous than now.  That is also a piece of work that needs to be done.  There is no room for hate speech or hate crime and we need to ensure we have all the tools necessary to shut them out of our society.</p></speech>

I am happy to support the addition of hate speech and hate crimes to the EU list of crimes that are indictable.  As Deputies we all appreciate the importance of freedom of speech.  While we should be allowed freedom of expression inside this Chamber and beyond, the majority of us appreciate also that there are limits to that.  Freedom of speech is not an absolute right.  There is a threshold beyond which we should not stray.  Reassuringly, that threshold or bar is quite high, as Deputy Bruton pointed out.  It allows us the opportunity to have very robust debate and discussion, which is essential.  Thesis, antithesis and synthesis are central tenets of a democratic society.  When we come into the Chamber we should always be mindful that we are here to trade ideas rather than insults.</p>  <p>  I am reassured by the advice of the Attorney General that if we decide to opt in to this proposal, it does not cause us any constitutional problems at the moment.  If any directives ensue out of this proposal there will be an opportunity to go into granular detail and decide to opt in or out thereafter.</p>  <p>  Apart from any directives, legislation or regulations, as public representatives we should be leading by example in social media and discourse.  We all know Deputies and colleagues who are quite active on social media at night and then the following morning they are on local radio complaining about cyber-bullying and how it is affecting our teenagers, causing self-harm, suicides and so on.  It is very important that we lead by example.</p>  <p>  Deputies from Government and Opposition benches were keen to point out the dangers of social media.  I love social media.  It is a wonderful tool provided it is used properly.  It is important that it stays social rather than becoming antisocial or unsocial media.  A lot of people have weaponised social media and used it to radicalise and polarise society.  When I look at what is happening in the UK and the US, I hope the same situation does not occur in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have been fortunate to work in a number of different workplaces before coming to Leinster House.  There does not seem to be any voluntary code of conduct for the use of social media by employees in Leinster House including Deputies.  Perhaps that is something we could look at through the Committee on Standing Orders and D&aacute;il Reform or the Business Committee.  Maybe the Whips could come together and come up with a one or two-page document setting out the standards by which we should conduct ourselves inside the Chamber and on social media.  I will leave it with the Ceann Comhairle.  I do not think one exists.  We should recognise that many teenagers and people in general are looking at how we conduct ourselves both verbally and on social media.  They are taking the beat from us and behaving accordingly.  I am happy to support the proposal.  It is appropriate, sensible, proportionate and reasonable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.441" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="15:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900041#TT00300"><p>I thank the Minister for the opportunity to discuss this important motion.  In recent years we as a society have become more aware of the corrosive and insidious problem of hate crime and hate speech.  The advent of social media has connected the world in ways that until recently were beyond imagination.  Unfortunately this is not the first war to be seen on social media but it certainly feels like it.  I think it was in its infancy on the last occasion there was a significant dispute around the world.</p>  <p>  The Internet and social media have brought many positives to the world and our own lives and communities.  However, we can be blind to the serious issues that have been created in the process.  The anonymity of social media and the Internet in general not only allows for a plethora of serious crimes to be committed but also for highly personalised attacks on public and private people.  There is no Member of the Oireachtas who will have escaped the direct abuse and threats that have been given a refuge on social media.  This is also happening to private citizens and whole communities, however, with frightening regularity.  It may be because of ethnicity, creed, sexual orientation or indeed any reason at all.  The inclusion of hate crimes and hate speech under article 83 is a positive step to rooting out this behaviour and ensuring that these crimes will not go unpunished.</p>  <p>  It is fitting in the week marking International Women's Day that we highlight that the Minister has been working on specific measures to expand protections under the hate crime legislation.  I understand it is the intention of the Minister to publish the Bill before Easter and to target stalking and non-fatal strangulation, making them criminal offences.  Furthermore a new hate crime Bill due this summer will target defined incidents resulting from certain characterisations including gender, which will mean that those types of crimes can be prosecuted as hate crimes where they are motivated by misogyny.  I also believe we can sharpen our ability to detect, collect and act upon data with specific regard to hate crimes and similar offences.  I speak in particular about the recording of racially motivated attacks and how these incidents are conveyed between the institutions of the State.</p>  <p>  I note that in her state of the Union address, President Von der Leyen highlighted with particular emphasis the expansion of the list of hate crimes and hate speech with regard to definitions and repercussions.  Ultimately we must strive in this House and right across the European Union to make progress to achieve a warmer and more inclusive and equal society across Europe.  Unfortunately, we have seen in the past two weeks how years of progress and advancement can be rolled back and that we can find ourselves facing challenges we thought we had consigned to history.  We are reminded in such a time that progress is never guaranteed.  We must continually strive to tackle misogyny, racism, xenophobia, homophobia and more.  The work will never be fully completed but by expanding our legislation to support moral and ethical progress we can begin to turn the tide in this effort.</p>  <p>  To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, in appealing to the better angels of our nature, this message given to the world during a conflict driven by racism reminds us that hatred of the "Other" is a problem we have faced for millennia.  I commend the Minister and the work she is doing to protect those who find themselves the victims of hate crime or hate speech and to defend the rights of all people who call Ireland their home, be they citizens or not, be they here for the long term or the short term.  If we allow the fabric of our society to be pulled, we cannot ensure the long-term stability of any community or group in Ireland will prevail.</p>  <p>  I ask that we continue to engage with minorities and our communities, to listen to their lived experience and understanding of the Ireland they see.  By doing so we can build a stronger and safer Ireland for everybody who is here now and who will follow in their footsteps.  I echo the comments of the previous speaker who said Members of the Oireachtas must lead by example.  How very true.  I encourage all Members to take note of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="15:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900041#TT00400"><p>The Commission published notable research after President Von der Leyen's speech in December about the scale of the worrying trend of hate speech and hate crime, in particular the level of hatred manifested against, for example, the Roma community, Jews, Muslims, persons of Asian origin or those perceived to be of that origin, and the effect that had in terms of linked crimes in the communities.  At EU level there has always been a strong statement against public incitement to hatred and hate speech, which comes from the very difficult background in Europe of post-Second World War efforts to solidify peace and stand against hate speech as it then was and as it has evolved.  There is a real concern about how social media amplifies hate speech in considerable ways.</p> <p>The use of the algorithm to amplify and excite through conflict is negative in itself and negative for users and society generally.  It has a huge impact on democracy.</p> <p> There have been important contributions about social media abuse of politicians, but the problem goes beyond that.  It speaks to standards in democracy and the quality of the information people are getting.  More and more over the past 20 years, we have seen in action the idea of taking a measure of dissent or concerns about a local problem generally and amplifying them into a criticism of the establishment, the way things are and the elites who are responsible.  We have seen how that has been weaponised, not just politically but by states and other entities that would like to see the value of democracy, particularly western and European democracy, eroded over time.  We have seen the amplification of local dissent into something much bigger throughout the Brexit referendum, for example, and during United States elections, particularly in 2016.  This is a cause for serious concern and we must look at how we contribute to that ourselves.</p> <p> There are two things going on in this regard.  First is how we treat each other on social media and generally.  The important work the Minister is doing in bringing in hate crime legislation will have a big effect on gender-based violence and on people with disabilities, where those characteristics are an aggravating factor in offences committed against people.  Second, crucially, the EU must think about how it is going to stand against this weaponisation of information and the amplification of dissent, including by political parties, particularly populist parties that refuse to explain how difficult life is, how difficult financing things is and the constraints placed by constitutions, rules-based orders and finances on how decisions are made by governments on behalf of peoples, as though such matters were straightforward in business or even in running a household.  It is important to deal with that level and to manage and control populism and expectations about what can be delivered for citizens.  Some of the threats to democracy come from nefarious actors, whether organised criminal gangs or rogue states.  All of these things are linked and how we manage social media amplification of dissent is very important, never more so than at this time, when there is not only a land-based war but an information-based war going on right across Europe and, as we have seen, right across western democracy for the past ten years.</p></speech>

It has become a particularly worrying and serious phenomenon both online and offline.  Hate crimes are existing crimes motivated by hatred against people because of their actual or perceived membership of a particular group.  They are message crimes intended to frighten, intimidate and silence entire communities.  Hatred comes in all shapes and sizes across the world, even in our own country.  We see the sad situation in Ukraine at the moment where a Russian leader who must be full of hatred and the politicians who surround him continue to show such hatred and inflict such pain on innocent men, women and children.  I do not include the Russian people in that comment.  It is the Russian leader at whom I am pointing the finger.  Most Russians are good people and we should not forget that as this terrible affliction is being imposed on Ukraine.</p>  <p>  In our country, many young people have been hurt on social media.  It may be beyond the scope of these provisions but it is very worrying and there have been many reports of young people dying by suicide as a result.  I hope that, in some way or another, we can see a means of giving some protection to young people in this regard.</p>  <p>  As I said, hatred comes in all shapes and sizes.  There is frustration among people with the Government to do with the fuel crisis.  Such frustration leads to anger, and anger leads to hatred.  The Minister and her colleagues need to step back and understand the pain people are feeling at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="15:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900042#UU00300"><p>It is ironic that we are discussing this issue at a time when the incidence of hate speech and crime has seen a sharp increase across Europe and has become particularly serious and worrying, both offline and online.  That is before even starting to talk about what is happening in Ukraine.  The common EU action is needed to tackle this EU-wide challenge.  However, there is currently no legal basis for criminalising hate speech and hate crimes at EU level.  The existing list of crimes in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union needs to be extended to ensure there are minimum common rules on how to define criminal offences and sanctions applicable in all member states.</p>  <p>  It would be wrong not to speak about how we all were both glad and sad this morning that the Ukrainian ambassador had to come here.  We were all very welcoming of him and it gave us an opportunity to hear at first hand what is happening and explain how upset we all are.  What can we call what is happening if not a hate crime?  It is the result of one individual's hatred and desire to take over and invade a peaceful people.  It is beyond belief.  Most of us never thought we would live to see something like this happening in our time.  We must stand united and help in every way we can, whether by finding accommodation for people coming to this country or ensuring there is funding to provide them with an acceptable lifestyle and access to education when they are living here.</p></speech>

Hate speech and hate crimes do not come in any one shape or form.  They happen across all sectors of society.  A case was presented to me recently concerning members of official bodies in Ireland and some of the texts and other abuse that is happening.  I have spoken before to the Minister about the abuse prison officers receive.  The Prison Officers Association has talked about this but neither the Minister nor any of the superior people here seem to be doing anything about it.  Whistleblowers are being ignored.  That leads to frustration for people.  It is the same when we come into this House and cannot get proper answers on issues.  People get very frustrated, especially with the current crisis.</p>  <p>  I compliment An Seanad&oacute;ir Keogan from the bottom of my heart on the exceptional job she did this morning.  I thank all the Members, the Minister who was there and everybody involved.  Getting more than 30 ambassadors into the room was a statement in itself.  I was glad to meet with the Ukrainian ambassador.</p>  <p>  There are many Russian families in Ireland.  In my county, there are many Russian children who were adopted by Irish families.  They are lovely young people doing their best.  We cannot tar all Russian people with the one brush.  Their President is power hungry and it is savage what is going on but we cannot allow RT&Eacute; to set the narrative on this.  We did that with the Covid crisis and that is why people get so frustrated online.  There was tunnel vision and no other view from anybody else was tolerated.  This is a dangerous road to be on and we must keep that in mind in regard to the war in Ukraine.  It is a very dangerous place to go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="15:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900042#UU00500"><p>I thank the Minister for providing a copy of her speech.  I am not sure what the colour of the paper, which is unusual, represents.  It is handy to have a copy because it sets out the background to the proposal.  We are having this debate because the approval of the D&aacute;il is needed under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution in regard to extending the list under the article.  I agree that we should extend it to include hate speech and crimes.  I have no difficulty with that whatsoever and the proposal will be coming back before us again.</p>  <p>  The Commission report sets out clearly why this proposal is necessary.  It states, on page 10, that research shows that hate speech on social media leads to more crimes against minorities in the physical world, which are set out in the document.  Hate speech online has led to a rise in violence against refugees, emigrants and ethnic and religious minorities.  The report goes on to give some examples of the scale of that hate speech and hate crime.  One in ten of LGBTIQ respondents to a survey reported that they were physically or sexually attacked because they were a member of that group.  Hate speech and crime against persons of Asian origin, particularly Chinese origin, or those perceived to be of Asian origin has also increased significantly.  The survey was carried out by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.  Antisemitism, of course, has also increased, with 40% of Jews in the EU expressing fear of being physically attacked.  Similarly, 27% of Muslims have experienced incidents of hate-motivated harassment in the previous 12 months.</p> <p>Significantly, women, particularly young women, are targeted with gender-based hate speech online and offline.  According to the 2020 global survey, 52% of young women and girls had experienced online violence, including threats.  Older people are also mentioned.  I am aware that the Minister is familiar with these statistics.  That is the background to this.  We could not but support it.</p> <p> Let us return to the title of the Commission document: A more inclusive and protective Europe.  I am on the record as saying I do not believe Europe is moving in a more inclusive direction.  It is quite the opposite.  It is one thing to introduce legislation down the road &mdash; I will be welcoming it subject to looking at the details, based on opting into this decision &mdash; but it is another to consider the reality on the ground regarding what Europe is becoming.  The Minister will have heard us talk repeatedly on this side of the House about Fortress Europe, which is coming from organisations on the ground, and about what has happened in terms of the othering of anyone who is different.</p> <p> It has already been mentioned that there are frightening images coming from the Spanish enclave in northern Africa.  People are desperately fighting for their lives, drowning in the Mediterranean and climbing over fences, all to try to get a better life.  Ultimately, as leaders and women, we need to ask what is happening in Europe.  We talk about the Europe of our values but we must ask what values we have when we regard refugees of a particular race, colour or country in one way and refugees of a different colour or race in a different way.  What is happening when we suddenly change the law for refugees from Ukraine, which is welcome, and refuse point blank to change it in any speedy manner for those in direct provision, 2,000 of whom have status and can go nowhere?  There is a huge fight to get a right to work, and this is only obtained after a certain time and so on, with restrictions.  With one hand we change the law just like that, and with the other we do not, depending on the circumstances.</p> <p> Regarding Yemen, I have repeatedly quoted the figures.  The figures and pictures are shocking.  Ten thousand children have died in seven years.  Do we think about that?  Some 370,000 people, including the 10,000 children, are dead.  Almost 20.7 million people are in dire need of humanitarian assistance and so on.  We have a duty as a neutral country to have a reflective approach to dealing with each situation in the most humanitarian way possible as it arises while at the same time beginning to ask what is causing all these wars, what is leading to this and why we support certain countries and not others.  We must ask why we do not take action in respect of Israel, notwithstanding that I fully stand with the Jewish people against any antisemitic language or attack.  Why do we not stand with Amnesty International regarding it?</p></speech>

I said a lot in my introductory remarks but will make a few points that reflect so much of what has been said in the debate.  First, there are people living in this country who are afraid.  They are afraid to leave their houses, go on public transport and live their lives the way I and others here do.  That might sound extreme or like I am exaggerating.  Before we published the draft Bill, the hate crime Bill, there was a lot of consultation, not only with my Department, State agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, NGOs and community organisations but also with individuals who came forward and wanted to tell their stories.  It is quite sad that there are people living in this country who are afraid to leave their homes.  We need to respond to that and do so effectively.</p>  <p>  Second, we live in a world that is changing.  Hate crime, hate speech, racism, xenophobia and antisemitism know no borders or boundaries.  We have to take on the facts that people now communicate in different ways and that online platforms and social media play a huge part.  It is fantastic that we can communicate with people on the other side of the world literally at the push of a button, but ease of access now means it is much easier for people to spread hate and fear and discriminate in new forms.  We have seen this manifest itself in extreme ways, most recently in France, where an individual was radicalised via his computer screen in his room to the point where he decapitated a teacher because of his beliefs or what was said to him.  This is an extreme case but it reflects what is happening.</p>  <p>  Most recently, as we all mentioned, we have noted the extreme circumstances in which a particular group of people, Ukrainian citizens, are being targeted and hate speech is being spread.  We are now at the point where there is a war happening on Ukrainian soil, Ukraine being a sovereign state that has been invaded.  We need to respond to this effectively.</p>  <p>  I reassure Deputies that I am in no way in favour of limiting free speech or expression.  It is a right we all have.  In no way will this motion or the Bill I will soon introduce conflict with people's constitutional right.  We have clear advice from the Attorney General on that.  Hate speech, whether delivered in person, in print or online, is real and in many instances leads to hate crime.  We need to respond effectively.  The best way to do that is to make sure we have appropriate laws that the Garda can implement and that allow it to prosecute.  Also, we must work collectively across the EU to call out hate crimes and ensure we have the right measures, laws and policies in place at EU level.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their support today.  We will be engaging on this issue again as we bring national legislation through the House.  I am really pleased we have been able to agree this motion and that Ireland can certainly play its part in tackling all forms of racism, hate speech, hate crime, xenophobia, antisemitism and every type of discrimination against people.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="15:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900044#XX00200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&quot;.</p><p>The Bill provides a legislative basis for a number of changes to the main Covid supports that have been announced by the Government and are being implemented by the Revenue Commissioners at the moment on an administrative basis.  I am using the opportunity of the Bill to include a number of other financial items that require legislative solutions.  One of these is to ensure the pandemic special recognition payment of &euro;1,000 to be paid for or on behalf of the Minister for Health will be tax free.  I will return to this and other items in a moment.</p><p>It is my hope and expectation that this will be the last Bill I will bring forward with the phrase &quot;Covid-19&quot; in the Title.  When the pandemic struck two years ago, we quickly brought in emergency legislation, namely, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 to provide various supports for businesses, including the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  The Government allowed a significant increase in public debt to absorb the fallout from the pandemic.  The prudent management of the public finances in the years preceding the pandemic allowed this.  However, as we look beyond the pandemic, even with the latest significant challenge we face with regard to the war in Ukraine, we need to again be careful with the public finances and begin to put the debt ratio on a downward path, and, therefore, the necessary supports that we put in place are coming to an end.  The ending of these supports has been well flagged and I have kept my promise that there would be no cliff edge to the withdrawal of supports.</p><p>The labour force survey has shown the economy has rebounded quickly as businesses reopened.  Employment increased by almost 225,000 in 2021 and the total number employed is very close to the target of 2.5 million people at work that was set out in the economic recovery plan last year.  The Exchequer figures last week were also positive.  They showed that tax receipts continue to record strong growth in the opening months of this year.  Although the annual comparisons are flattering due to a number of factors, the underlying trends are a good signal of the continued momentum in the domestic economy.</p><p>As we hopefully leave the great challenge of Covid behind us, there are now other exceptionally serious developments to be faced, most notably the awful situation and horrendous war in Ukraine.  The discussion of the Bill is not the time to speak about that or the response of the Government to the emerging situation there.  However, it does show that while recent trends have been positive, we cannot be complacent.  For example, we are already seeing, and responding to, the effects higher prices are having in the economy and households. </p><p>Part of the restoration of public finances will involve the removal of supports for businesses as they reopen and no longer need them. and the Bill includes a number of final adjustments to these supports.  The TWSS was introduced on 26 March 2020.  It was replaced by the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, on 1 September 2020.  The EWSS was provided for in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  It provided an economy-wide support and has been extended and amended on a number of occasions.  The Finance Act 2020 introduced the enhanced rates of subsidy with effect from 20 October 2020 to 31 January 2021.  The enhanced rates were extended to 31 March 2021 by ministerial order.  There was a further extension of EWSS with the enhanced rates of subsidy to 30 June 2021, by way of ministerial order.  Then, as part of the Government&rsquo;s economic recovery plan, the EWSS was extended to 31 December 2021 by the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021.  Those arrangements were subsequently enhanced as part of an announcement on 9 December 2021.</p><p>Section 2 provides for further enhancements in response to the evolving public health situation.  First, the scheme was reopened for certain businesses that would not otherwise be eligible as announced on 21 December 2021.  Second, enhanced support would be provided to businesses that were directly impacted by the public health regulations introduced in late December 2021, with a delay in the step-down arrangements for such firms that will continue to receive support until 31 May.  As Members will be aware, the EWSS has played a central role in supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees.  It has now helped 719,900 employees. </p><p>The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, was introduced by the Finance Act 2020.  Section 4 gives a legislative basis for the final change announced in response to the public health restrictions in December last.  It provides for an increase in the turnover reduction criteria from no more than 25% of 2019 turnover to no more than 40%.  It was also made available to newer businesses during the period 13 October to 26 July.  In addition, certain charities and sporting bodies that carry on similar trading activities to businesses became eligible to apply for CRSS in the most recent period of restrictions, that is, from December 2021 to January 2022.  </p><p>Tax debt warehousing was introduced in 2020 by the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020.  As announced in January last year, the Government has agreed that the period when tax liabilities arising can be warehoused will be extended to 30 April 2022 for all businesses eligible for Covid-19 support schemes.  This will allow businesses that have been most impacted additional time to recover before their tax liabilities have to be paid.  Their period of zero interest will, therefore, commence from 1 May 2022 until 30 April 2023, with interest at the reduced rate of 3% payable thereafter until the debt is paid down.  This extension is provided for in sections 5 to 10, inclusive.</p><p>Section 11 relates to the Government decision of 21 January to waive the excise duty associated with court fees in respect of applications for special exemption orders until 30 April.</p><p>As I stated, there are a number of additional matters I am using the Bill to deal with. </p><p><i>[Further text to be inserted.]</i></p></speech>

I also commend the departmental officials on their work on both schemes.  I know a massive effort went into this and I am sure they went beyond the call of duty in making sure that as many jobs, workers and people were supported in as timely a manner as possible.</p><p>This shows how agile and responsive the State can be in times of crisis.  We must ensure that this agility and responsive State are a permanent feature here, not just something that happens at a time of pandemic when we are all worried about each other's health and safety and, indeed, the impact it has on the economy and on the well-being of society.  It showed the capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to get support out to citizens in a speedy and targeted manner.  While we are dealing with a finance Bill here, that was not unique to officials in the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners.  We also saw it in other Departments, such as the Department of Social Protection, as well as among front-line workers, health staff, hospitals, nursing homes and throughout society, where everybody put their shoulders to the wheel.  Unfortunately, given the position today with a war in Ukraine, there is a lot to be asked again of the public as we deal with the consequences of that war, including a huge influx of people who are fleeing the war to our shores and the challenges that will bring.</p><p>Returning to the Bill, the tax debt warehousing scheme has been crucial to support the liquidity of businesses, and I welcome the extension of both the repayment dates and the interest-free period.  Another measure relating to the pandemic that I must mention is the pandemic special recognition grant.  It should be noted that the criteria for a qualifying individual who receives this grant are not included in the Bill but are instead delegated to the Minister for Health.  We have been waiting for the details of this payment, including who will receive it and who will not.  The criteria governing it have been discussed for many months now.  The Government must clarify these details as healthcare workers have been waiting for a long time.</p><p>I will briefly talk about the miscellaneous provisions in the legislation, particularly those relating to stamp duty.  The Minister knows well my strong views and the strong views of my party on the issue of stamp duty and how it is applied.  It is applied at too low a rate.  That is not surprising given that the Minister refused to even countenance this for many years until there was a public outcry and he could find nowhere else to hide on the matter.  He introduced it at a rate of 10% and excluded apartments completely.  That has allowed for the plunder of this city and others by these funds, which are snapping up apartments from under the noses of first-time buyers and renting them at exorbitant cost.  Obviously, the Minister has provided sweetheart tax deals that mean they do not have to pay any tax on that rent also.  This Bill deals with an exemption from even that low rate of tax.  Where, for example, an investment fund bulk-purchases homes and they are subsequently designated cost-rental homes by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the fund will evade the 10% stamp duty surcharge that was introduced last year.  There are a number of issues in this regard.  First, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 is vague regarding the criteria for being designated a cost rental.  There is no minimum period established in that legislation so it does not say whether it is six months, six years or 60 years.  It does not say many other things, yet here there is a very clear criterion where the funds can avoid paying that stamp duty at even that low rate, if the Minister, and it is solely the responsibility of the Minister, designates a scheme, a housing estate or, indeed, a number of houses as cost rental.</p><p>This legislation is an example, in the month of March, of how we are able to deal with things that were introduced last year.  It shows that there is flexibility, and not only flexibility but that where there is a willingness, there is a way to meet the needs of society.  It is extremely unfortunate that the Minister has decided not to use that today, but has decided to bring forward a resolution that does not go to the limits of what he could do to reduce the cost of excise on motorists in respect of fuel, petrol and diesel.  The Minister has completely ignored the plight of those who are trying to heat their homes, who face a &euro;700 hike in home heating oil, and has decided not to reduce that excise by even 1 cent.  That is deeply regrettable and shameful.</p></speech>

As was mentioned previously, we all are hoping that this will be the last time that we have to deal with these Covid-related measures.  Hopefully, we really are seeing the back of Covid-19.</p><p>This Bill will give legislative effect to the changes to certain Covid support schemes announced by the Government in December 2021 and January 2022.  They were the changes announced in response to the most recent period of public health restrictions.  The Bill deals with the changes to the CRSS, the EWSS, tax debt warehousing and so forth, but it also provides for the introduction of a new measure, the pandemic special recognition payment or what is more commonly known as the Covid bonus, which is what I wish to focus on.  Its introduction is most certainly welcome.  We all have recognised for a long time how difficult it has been for front-line healthcare workers during the pandemic.  At a time people did not know much about, or have much information on, Covid-19, those workers were very much on the front line.</p><p>There has been concern about the scope of who qualifies and the fact that certain sectors are not included.  People feel that it is too narrow.  There is ongoing uncertainty about who will meet the criteria for this award.  All Members will have been contacted about this by different people in their constituencies.  As to the payment itself and how it will work, the Minister outlined that the Bill provides for an exemption from income tax, USC and PRSI in respect of the recognition payment made to specified categories of front-line healthcare workers up to a maximum of &euro;1,000 per individual.  However, as I said, many who worked on the front line appear to have been left behind.  Family carers have been to the forefront in this pandemic and should be included in this payment.  I have spoken to many carers who are bitterly disappointed that they appear to have been forgotten.  As Ms Catherine Cox of Family Carers Ireland pointed out in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>last week, carers:</p> <blockquote> 	...went above and beyond the call of duty to protect the most vulnerable, and this risk must be rewarded.  Over the course of the past two years, family carers saw services and supports for their loved ones depleted and, in many cases, eradicated.  As a direct consequence, the State saved money. </blockquote>  <p>Ms Cox contends that family carers save the State in excess of &euro;20 billion every year.  At present, there are 116,000 carers in receipt of the carer's support grant.</p><p>Many Members will have dealt with family carers during the pandemic in the past two years and we saw how they were affected.  They experienced reduced respite hours and limited access to day care centres.  I dealt with people whose children were unable to attend their schools.  That had an impact.  As a result, it increased the workload for all family carers.  It also meant great hardship for all the families affected.  The carer's role is 24-7, and, in some cases, it means exactly that because the carer has to stay awake during the night to mind the child.  The carers had hoped to be recognised through this recognition payment.</p><p>T&aacute; a fhios againn ar fad gur fhulaing na daoine is leochail&iacute; in&aacute;r gcuid socha&iacute; go hollmh&oacute;r le linn na paind&eacute;ime.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="16:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900045#ZZ00300"><p>I welcome the extension of the tax warehousing arrangements for businesses impacted by the new restrictions that were introduced in December 2021.</p> <p>This is a practical move and it will benefit many of the businesses affected by the severe but very short-term changes.  More broadly, we need to look at the serious issue of hidden debt for SMEs and microbusinesses to ensure it does not hinder their recovery in the medium term.</p> <p> Increased energy and fuel costs, a shortage of materials and goods, inflation and a host of other difficulties have hit businesses like a ton of bricks at what is the worst time, I am sure the Minister will agree.  If SMEs and microbusinesses are going to have a chance of returning to profitability and getting out from under the current crises they are going to need to have this warehouse debt taken into consideration.  I have spoken to many SMEs, microbusinesses and family businesses and they are concerned that on top of their hidden debt, such as warehouse tax debts and commercial rent arrears, fuel and energy costs and inflation are creating an unsustainable business environment.  Warehouse tax debt currently stands at approximately &euro;3.2 billion.  This debt will have to be repaid with interest of 3% from next January.  It is important the Government looks at the feasibility of repayments, the rate of interest, the length of repayments and other factors in the face of rising costs.  Circumstances have changed and they continue to change on an hourly if not a daily basis.</p> <p> We all agree SMEs are the backbone of our economy, especially in terms of employment and local employment.  The fact they have this warehoused debt should be a concern for all of us.  It might be a case the Government needs to look at this specific issue, assess the structures that could be put in place for businesses to recover and for people to re-enter employment as we move, unfortunately, from Covid into a new and growing crisis.  Many businesses have suggested solutions such as repayment of tax debt over an elongated period or reduced interest rates that would ease the burden of tax liabilities and ensure they can survive in the current climate.  However, as is ever the case in these situations, a two-way dialogue between business and the State will inevitably uncover the most workable solution for all parties.  I encourage the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance to engage with businesses in this regard.  Unfortunately, the current situation is radically different from that which prevailed a month ago.</p> <p> Does the Minister agree that the EU fiscal rules need to be amended or at least suspended until 2024 given the inflation crisis and the impacts of the war that we see are growing?  The effects of inflation and the war in Ukraine mean this option must be seriously considered.  We are experiencing a fragile recovery, which was already threatened by consistently higher prices than forecast.  Now we have the turmoil caused by the Russian attack on Ukraine.  This brutal attack has rightly provoked sanctions from the EU and others.  These sanctions are acknowledged as not being cost free for those of us living in the EU.  Their impact on any recovery must be seriously considered.</p> <p> The Covid recognition payment is provided for specifically in the Bill.  The manner in which the payment has been dealt with has been shocking.  The payment was dangled in front of workers at the coalface of the Covid crisis.  Many were led to believe they would qualify for the bonus, and justifiably so given the rumblings and murmurs that were coming from Ministers.  However, they were then told by a variety of Ministers they would not qualify and it would only be a select and small group of healthcare professionals, who are absolutely deserving, who would receive the payment.  The way this was done was very unfair.  The Government led workers right up the garden path.  It should have been clear and upfront from the very start.  It should have been straight with workers to tell them who would qualify, how they would qualify and when it would be paid instead of leaving all of these questions in the air.</p> <p> People feel they were told they were going to qualify only then to be told they would not.  This is very much true in the case of family carers.  We all know the work they do.  We see them in our constituency offices.  More often, we speak to them on the phone because very often they cannot get out to visit us in our constituency offices.  They deserve recognition for the additional work they have had to undertake in the past two years.  Practically all supports were withdrawn.  Carers were left very isolated.  They really are the forgotten of our front-line workers.  They protect our health service on an ongoing basis.  If the Minister recalls, in March 2020, the cry from the Government and the Opposition benches was to protect the health services at all costs.  These people did so.  They absolutely protected the health services by staying inside and minding their loved ones on their own.  The world of a family carer is very small.  Their world got even smaller.  The Minister should consider rewarding them because in their own way they were on the front line.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.458" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="16:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900046#AAA00200"><p>I will pick up from where Deputy O'Reilly left off.  There has been some anxiety with how the Covid recognition payment has been managed.  My colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, first mooted the notion of a Covid recognition payment for all those who work in the health service in various roles.  They worked very courageously, bravely and selflessly during the darkest days of the pandemic.  They put themselves in harm's way.  To the credit of the Minister and the Government they have introduced a scheme, although it has divided opinion.  Inevitably, schemes such as this do.  Sometimes it is difficult to know when and where to draw the line.  Will the Minister confirm on the record in his response that the payment will be applied to all workers who work in sections 38 and 39 organisations and in residential disability services?  I understand this is correct but there seems to be in my constituency among those I represent some confusion about this.  I am pleased the scheme will not attract tax or USC.  It is important the entire extent of the payment being made will find its way into the pockets of those healthcare workers who need it.  It is an important recognition.</p>  <p>  We are living through an incredible time in our history.  Of that we have no doubt.  We have experienced the most significant public health event of the past century with Covid-19, followed closely by war in Europe the nature of which we have not seen since the Second World War.  We are living through an incredible period of history.  History will record that the previous caretaker Government and this Government introduced phenomenal unprecedented measures to support our society and our economy through the darkest of times.  History will also record the fact the House united in support of the measures proposed by the Minister and his colleagues, and that these measures have so effectively helped workers, businesses and society more general through an extraordinarily difficult period.  It was important that the House and society united behind those measures in our battle against an unknown pandemic.  I recall very well the long and late nights we had in here almost two years ago debating how we might approach Covid-19 and the types of supports we ought to introduce when we did not know the full extent of what we were dealing with.  The country has by and large responded very well.  That is to the credit of the Minister, the Government and everybody in the House.</p>  <p>  Many of the supports introduced during Covid-19 were crucial in supporting jobs and businesses through a difficult period.  The EWSS helped more than 719,000 employees and protected jobs, wages and businesses.  It is not difficult to imagine where we would be if we did not have the extent of those supports available in our economy.  With its continued presence for a period, there are a few things that need to be considered in the context of the wage subsidy scheme.  I recall in previous months there were concerns about mortgage eligibility for those on the EWSS and tax liability issues for employees been paid through the EWSS and the TWSS.  While the EWSS scheme is still operating, the Government must ensure these issues are dealt with and that employees who did not get to choose whether they were paid through the EWSS are not negatively impacted as a result from a tax point of view.</p>  <p>  We have to hold onto the lessons we learned during the pandemic and not simply remove all vestiges of support all of a sudden.  That could plunge businesses and employees back into a normal that never really worked in the first place.  Since 2019, the Labour Party has been calling for a permanent form of wage subsidy scheme to be in our toolbox for dealing with crises in our economy.  The EWSS worked by and large.  It can continue to provide people with greater opportunities to train, upskill and grow.</p> <p>As the reality of climate change worsens with each passing day, a permanent wage subsidy scheme with an appropriate retraining element could be a crucial tool in ensuring a just transition as we decarbonise our society.  The Labour Party's own proposal for a permanent wage subsidy scheme would put the protection of workers, jobs and wages first by protecting State-subsidised employees from lay-offs and would ensure support was linked to prior earnings with compulsory employer top-ups.  Importantly, the kinds of schemes we have been talking about would guarantee that each worker would have, for example, an individual retraining or upskilling plan to help improve productivity and prepare workers for potential new opportunities.  We know only too well that, with the pace of change in our economy, many jobs we are familiar with now will be entirely obsolete in the not-too-distant future.  That is a challenge facing our economy.</p> <p> In October 2020, the OECD published a comparative report on Covid wage subsidy schemes.  That study emphasised the need to "Promote training while on reduced working hours".  This includes digital upskilling that could be tailored to individual needs and delivered remotely.  Half of all Irish adults lack the digital skills needed to compete in the modern workplace, and in the two schemes we have had, there has not been any attempt to link wage support with in-work training and continuing professional development.  When Covid threatened the economy, the Government made very important interventions.  We have to learn our lessons with regard to how those wage subsidy schemes worked, how they could be placed on a more permanent footing, and how they could be tailored to meet some of the demands we will inevitably have in future.</p> <p> My views on the question of the payment of dividends by firms that have benefited from the wage subsidy scheme have been on the record for a long time.  The operation of certain schemes across the European Union essentially prohibited the payment of dividends to shareholders in companies benefiting from state largesse and support during the pandemic.  We have consistently made the case that strict conditions for accessing cash support should have been introduced.  These would have included a prohibition on the payment of dividends and bonuses by firms using the scheme and a prohibition on companies that operate from tax havens making use of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.</p> <p> As we know, it emerged late last year that, as we could have predicted, profitable multinational companies and profitable indigenous Irish companies that had received significant taxpayer support subsequently paid out millions in dividends to their shareholders.  That was not illegal or unlawful.  There was nothing in the legislation governing the wage subsidy schemes that prohibited it.  However, that does not mean it sits well with me or with members of the public.  Based on an approach I made to it, the Committee of Public Accounts has asked the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister's own Department and others for their views on this.  It is important to establish those views, especially if we are to develop new wage subsidy schemes in the future to meet some of the challenges we will inevitably have in our economy.</p> <p> Some very profitable companies that made use of the EWSS, thereby benefiting from State largesse, paid out dividends to shareholders while, in contrast, nearly half of all workers who availed of the TWSS have been hit with a double whammy of tax bills of up to &euro;2,900 in addition to many seeing a significant cut to their pay packets.  Last year, I called for these tax bills to be scrapped on a once-off basis and I am doing so again in light of the cost-of-living crisis we are facing.  The Minister will recall that, in late 2020, the Government set aside considerable resources for a subsidy scheme to support tourism that went almost untapped.  The resources were there to try to help people by means of scrapping those tax bills on a once-off basis but, unfortunately, Government chose not to do that.</p> <p> I will now move on to the response to the cost-of-living crisis because it is important, when talking about all of the supports that were introduced to help combat the economic and social problems associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, to look again at the Government's response to the cost-of-living crisis.  The Government acted very boldly and with ambition and courage in responding to Covid-19 but I do not believe as much courage has been targeted at the problem of the cost of living.  There has not been as much innovative thinking.  It seems we are back to normal and to an assumption that the market will resolve itself and that people will ultimately be fine.  Notwithstanding the measures the Government has brought in, it is simply the case that people will have to suck it up and get through this as best as they can and that we will come out the other side.</p> <p> In the context of the war in Ukraine, our principal concern is obviously for the people of Ukraine who are the victims of Vladimir Putin's illegal war and occupation of that sovereign nation.  That should be our first concern, but Ireland and the Irish people are going to face very significant economic impacts and we need to be mindful of that.  We already have an enormous challenge in respect of the cost of living, especially for low and middle-income workers.  That is going to become even more complex in the coming period.  We cannot anticipate precisely what is going to happen.  Nobody can.  However, we need to scenario plan at this time and to use the spectacular resources available to us because of the hard work of Irish workers, the nearly 2.5 million people who are at work.  We need to target those resources where they are needed most.  There needs to be some serious thinking from Government with regard to how to address those challenges.</p> <p> I look forward to engaging later with the Minister on the financial resolution with a view to developing some alternative measures to assist workers and ordinary families through the worst of this crisis.  We need to do everything we can to protect the living standards of the people at this very uncertain time.  I will engage with the Minister constructively, as I always try to do and as will my Labour Party colleagues, over the coming period to try to develop solutions to those very serious challenges.</p></speech>

It gives legislative effect to the changes to the Covid support schemes announced by Government in response to the public health restrictions and introduced from 21 December 2021 right through to January of this year.  These supports have been vitally important to businesses throughout the pandemic and it is very important the necessary legislation be put in place as soon as possible.  I do not always pay tribute to the previous Government but, at the outbreak of the Covid pandemic, we were moving from an election cycle and through Government formation talks and the Minister and his colleagues took up the cudgels and carried it on until this current Government was formed.  From the very get-go, the mantra was to keep Ireland and its population safe and to protect lives but also to protect the economy.  We are still not fully out of the Covid pandemic.  Some people close to me received a diagnosis of Covid just this week.  We are still in that realm or space and, even though the matter has left a lot of the public discourse, we are still dealing with it.  In the fullness of time, what those who serve in government and those who support it will truly be judged on is how safe we kept the country and how well we supported the economy.  In both regards, not a perfect job has been done but a pretty good job has.  I believe that has been recognised internationally.</p>  <p>  There are, of course, problems as we emerge from a situation of peak Covid.  Is Deputy O'Reilly okay?  I am sorry.</p></speech>

There are, of course, challenges as we emerge from that situation of peak Covid.  One of these is the cost of living.  The cost of living has spiralled out of control for many families.  Many families are put very much to the pin of their collar.  I welcome what the Minister has done overnight and into this morning in looking at ways to alleviate the burden of costs on people with regard to their fuel bills.  More needs to be done because what I have seen and what has been spoken about in all forms of media, including social media and mainstream media, is overnight price hikes.  We saw some forecourts upping the price of petrol and diesel by 15 cent.  That could be in the realm of price gouging.  There is a taxation regime in place and there is excise duty and the Minister is taking measures to deal with that.</p> <p>It is unforgivable that petrol stations would try to get ahead of Government by increasing prices before policy gets there.</p> <p> I wish to speak about construction costs.  The Government has a very comprehensive policy to deal with the housing crisis and there are many elements to that.  Key to everything is building houses, be they social housing, affordable housing or private housing.  At the moment it is nigh on impossible for someone who has planning permission and who wants to develop a home to get a contractor to tender and carry out the work.  The Government and indeed all of Europe have not yet fully grasped the supply chain issue there.</p> <p> Prior to and in the early months of the Covid pandemic, the Government, in step with our European partners, was able to work across international boundaries to develop a very fluid supply chain of personal protective equipment, PPE, and then, latterly, vaccines.  The next supply chain that needs to be corrected is building materials.  At the moment workers have been forced to walk off some construction sites because the next pay cheque is not coming in; the materials are not there.  Government needs to grasp this issue.</p> <p> This legislation deals with Covid supports.  Overnight, I was appalled to receive an email from someone in my constituency who has spent the past two years proffering a theory that Covid does not exist, that RT&Eacute; is fake news and that none of this ever really happened.  I was appalled to see that now the rhetoric has moved to fake news on Ukraine.  That is where that whole ideology has now shifted to.  Shame on those promoting that ideology because Covid has been very real and has taken many lives.  The nurses, the front-line staff and those who shored up the economy during this period need to be front and centre of our minds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="16:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900048#CCC00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and to outline some concerns regarding business supports in the short term but probably more importantly in the medium term.  Before that I would like to take moment to reflect on the past two years and the role of the State during this period.  While we in the Social Democrats might have done some things differently during the pandemic, we all accept that major efforts were made to scale up radically the role of the State, efforts which many possibly on the Government benches could not have imagined themselves undertaking.</p>  <p>  While this is not necessarily the view of the Minister present, I know some of his colleagues would be very much in favour of a small state.  We had been moving in that direction somewhat with the provision of particular public services.  However, that changed very radically and we only survived the pandemic by the State becoming very heavily involved in many aspects of our country and economy.  It is a matter of some regret that we seem to be unwinding that approach to a certain extent, and there is a strong case for us to learn from the experience of the past two years of the critical importance of the State taking responsibility for the provision of particular services - obviously housing, healthcare and childcare.</p>  <p>  The experience of the past two years also exposed very substantial weaknesses in how we provide our key public services, certainly in the housing area where the State had to move to introduce a ban on rent increases, how publicly provided housing had to be made available very quickly for people who were especially vulnerable, and where the State had to move to create a single tier-health service.  That worked very well and we would not have survived if we had not brought in capacity from the private sector.  It highlighted many weaknesses in how we provide services and it is important we learn lessons from that.  It took a crisis to teach small government proponents the critical role of the State in society and in our economy.  People across the board would recognise that and certainly the business community recognises it now.</p>  <p>  I was at that recent IBEC seminar where the Minister was a guest speaker.  This goes back a few weeks before the developments in Ukraine.  I was a bit concerned that people were talking about the top-line figures.  While the top-line figures for the performance of the economy are very strong, and all credit for that, when we look below those and see what is actually happening in our society, it does not paint a such a good picture.  The prime issue is the impact of the unaffordability of housing on so many people.  In addition, many other people are denied timely access to healthcare.  Childcare is very expensive and takes up so much of family budgets.  They are the real world matters people are dealing with in their day-to-day lives and it is regrettable there was not much recognition of that.  While credit is due regarding the top-line figures, we also need to consider what is happening with the so-called lived experiences of many people.  In the key areas of public provision, the picture is certainly not so rosy.</p>  <p>  I hope the Government does not have a short memory regarding the role of the State.  Instead of unwinding the role of the State, it should strengthen it, particularly in respect of public provision of services.  I think that is now being recognised in the childcare area where there have been important developments in the budget.  Although we still have a very long way to go, the principles are recognised.  The principles of Sl&aacute;intecare are also recognised and set out in the all-party plan, but we have not yet fully committed to implementing that.  It would appear those lessons have not been learned yet on the housing front.</p>  <p>  The employment wage subsidy scheme and the Covid restrictions support scheme were examples of major of Government interventions that would have been unthinkable not so long ago.  They proved to be invaluable supports for businesses throughout the pandemic.  We now look forward to the weaning-off phase, which by its nature must be slow.  Those supports kept many businesses and workers afloat by critically keeping staff connected to their place of employment and their employers during an exceptionally difficult period.  All of those principles were very good and I recognise what has been done.  Credit is due to the Minister and others who have been involved in providing those supports.</p>  <p>  However, the difficulties facing businesses, as we all know, have not gone away.  They have just receded somewhat in many cases.  We are seeing a rapid and welcome bounce-back, but the medium and long-term future of a certain cohort of businesses could still be a doubt.  While the disruptive force of Covid has, thankfully, waned considerably, its effects are still deeply felt by many small and medium-sized businesses in particular, especially those in sectors that were forced to close completely for periods of time or seriously curtailed their operations in some cases on an ongoing basis.  Therefore, these changes to the EWSS and the CRSS are very welcome, especially for businesses that missed out on the all-important Christmas trade or were only established during the pandemic.  However, more targeted supports will, of course, be needed.  I think there is a recognition of that, especially for businesses that bore the brunt of the rolling lockdowns.</p>  <p>  While the Government has established schemes for the entertainment and tourism industries, ongoing engagement with these sectors is needed to ensure their survival to the greatest extent possible.  I believe there is recognition of that.  The relatively high number of jobs lost in these sectors during the pandemic was clear evidence, if any were needed, of the size and importance of our tourism and hospitality industry.</p> <p>Those small and medium-sized businesses, which is what they are in the main, may continue to need Government supports to remain viable in the medium term.  Without these businesses, the very heartbeat of so many of our villages, towns and cities would be lost.  Such losses would further compound the dereliction found across a large number of towns and villages since the recession.</p> <p> Notwithstanding the importance of these schemes, it should be noted that there have been abuses of business supports throughout the pandemic.  We have to recognise that, and those abuses must be dealt with.  While we all accept that the vast majority of companies that availed of Covid-19 wage supports did so absolutely legitimately, it has been widely reported that some companies exploited them and that there was an element of gaming the system.  I remember the T&aacute;naiste talking about this in the early days of the pandemic.  I think he was Taoiseach at the time.  He spoke about the importance of being aware of the potential for that and having systems in place to deal with it.  The exploitation took the form of businesses paying out dividends to shareholders while claiming wage subsidies.  That is abhorrent to many people.  Obviously, it has been an exceptionally difficult time for so many of our people, and the idea of some of our big and successful companies gaming the system, as I said, leaves a very unpleasant taste in the mouth and should not have been allowed.  One of the most egregious examples of abuse of taxpayers' money, and it has been reported as such, was by O'Flaherty Holdings, which distributes Mercedes-Benz products in Ireland.  That company claimed almost &euro;1.8 million in wage subsidies in 2020 before then paying a similar amount in a dividend to an offshore company in the Isle of Man.  Lest we forget, a huge amount of money, over &euro;7 billion, was paid out to private companies, so the importance of robust checks and balances cannot be overstated.  That profitable companies effectively hoarded large sums of taxpayers' money is absolutely reprehensible.  Conditionalities to ensure that dividends could not be paid out from companies receiving state supports were applied in the UK.  There is no valid reason, as far as I can see, why that could not have been replicated here, aside from some kind of unwillingness to upset that particular community.  While I appreciate that these schemes were set up in a hurry and in very much crisis circumstances and, on balance, have been hugely successful, their design must be evaluated and an audit of firms that paid out dividends should be carried out.  Although the Minister has said he is keeping the schemes under review, I wonder what exactly that means and why the Minister refused to ban wage-supported companies from paying dividends to shareholders.  I just cannot understand the rationale for doing that.  Some members of this Government have previously been quick to highlight social welfare fraud or misuse by individuals, but they are not so quick to do so when it is large private businesses involved in fraud.  It seems sometimes that ideology clouds their reading of the numbers.</p> <p> I wish to talk for a few minutes about the PUP.  I recognise that it is a somewhat separate issue but it is on a related note.  I wish to raise some concerns about the planned review of PUP claimants.  My colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, is pursuing this issue at the Committee of Public Accounts, but I would like to flag these concerns with the Minister now.  While I understand that work on this is only commencing, many questions have arisen.  For instance, will this retrospective review lead to sanctions or penalties where non-compliance is identified?  Will there be a payment or a tax credit adjustment?  We just do not know how the Government intends to pursue this.  If something wrong has occurred, we should ensure that people make amends, but how exactly is it proposed to do so?  These are quite important questions, and a degree of understanding will be needed in many cases - for instance, where a worker did not return to work as his or her employer was not following public health advice or enforcing public health measures.  Regrettably, there were quite a few instances of those problems.  Also, I think many of us had raised with us instances in which a worker or family member was in what was regarded as a very high-risk category and his or her workplace was not a safe environment.  I am sure the Minister, like the rest of us, had such cases brought to his attention.  There were people who had very vulnerable people at home or had very serious underlying conditions themselves, which put them at a very high risk, but they were expected to go into work.  That could have been a life-threatening situation to put themselves in.  They did not go into work and claimed the PUP.  It is therefore important that there is a recognition of the difficulties involved for many people and that a sympathetic view is taken in pursuing this issue.</p> <p> Finally on this matter, there are legitimate concerns about the review of self-employed PUP claimants.  I understand that Revenue data such as self-employment PRSI returns and business analytics tools will be used in this exercise.  It would be very important to establish whether there is a legal basis for that data exchange first.  We had those difficulties in the past, with question marks around the public services card.  Before any of those data are shared, the exchange has to be in keeping with data protection law.</p> <p> Those are just some of the issues that must be addressed.  I ask the Government not to turn this review into any kind of scapegoating exercise against all PUP recipients, not least when the same level of scrutiny is clearly not applied to powerful private companies.</p> <p> Another scheme that kept many businesses afloat during the pandemic was debt warehousing.  According to Revenue figures, 105,000 businesses availed of that scheme, while &euro;3.2 billion worth of tax owed has been warehoused.  The decision to extend the period during which tax liabilities can be warehoused will be a welcome relief to businesses that have been most impacted by the pandemic.  A lot of debt has built up, however, and for many businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, that looming horizon is a cause for much concern.</p> <p> The Department of Finance's annual taxation report, published last August, depicted a positive outlook, with income tax revenues declining by just 1% to &euro;22.7 billion.  The fact that some businesses did exceptionally well during the pandemic must be borne in mind.  I am talking about IT businesses, pharma businesses and so on.  It was a very profitable period for some, and that skews the figures somewhat.  However, that does not accurately reflect the picture on the ground for so many businesses that are concerned about their futures.  As the report identifies, tax revenue held up strongly because the biggest disruption to the labour market was concentrated in sectors that are relatively income tax poor.  These include the hospitality industry and other service sectors, which were especially devastated by the lockdowns.  This in itself speaks volumes about the extent of the low pay issue in our economy, which brings its own problems and needs to be addressed in its own right.  When we look past the headline figures, we can see clearly that small and medium-sized businesses in these sectors are the most vulnerable.  While many are experiencing a bounceback, with 57% of SMEs having reported profit during 2021, which is extremely welcome, compared with just 31% in 2020, many fear that this could be just short-term.  We must not forget that a large number of businesses are still burdened by warehoused debt.  When it comes time to pay that back, it could have a major impact on profitability and even viability.</p> <p>This is where the medium-term problems arise, especially for those who will require phased payment arrangements.  Flexibility and understanding for the individual circumstances of small and medium-sized businesses will be of the utmost importance.  We cannot allow a situation where local businesses which would be viable in normal circumstances were it not for the inability to repay warehoused tax are forced to shut their doors.  These businesses are in this position because they followed public health advice.  For hospitality businesses, in particular, the loss of the Christmas trade had a major impact on turnover.  Now that they are recovering, they should not be punished for past restrictions on their business.  We need to be patient.</p> <p> The legislation also deals with the Covid-19 recognition payment for front-line workers.  Since this payment was announced in January, it has been mired in controversy and confusion.  The Government mismanaged the announcement by drip-feeding information from the start.  Almost two months later, it is still not entirely clear who is entitled to get the payment.  The Government has often been accused of kite-flying and it would be difficult to find a clearer example than this recognition payment.  There has been a vacuum of information since January, leading to somewhat of a bidding war.  Why is that?  It is because the Government's definition of a front-line worker is too narrow.  For example, will section 39 workers be included?  They are front-line workers who donned PPE every day and were central to keeping health services going.  They experience a lesser status than their HSE counterparts and are paid at a lower rate, even though, in many cases, they do exactly the same work.  Ultimately, I believe front-line workers would prefer better pay and conditions and reform in the health and social care sector.  A recent EU report was critical of those health and social care services.</p> <p> I hope the Government will bear in mind some of those points as this legislation makes its way through the Houses.</p></speech>

I am being contacted by people who worked on the front line during Covid-19 wondering if there are any details on when and to whom the bonus will be paid.  While Ministers are kite-flying about further restrictions to the eligibility, people are waiting on this and are relying on it in some cases.  There are still no clear signs of when they will get it and who will get it.  These decisions need to be planned by the Government before being announced.  Announcing that there will be a bonus is not good enough.  The Taoiseach spends much of the time trying to find ways to blame Sinn F&eacute;in and discredit our proposals.  His time would be better spent asking his Ministers not to get people's hopes up with half-planned schemes and confusing announcements.  Will home helps be entitled to the bonus?  Will those working in the addiction sector on the front line be entitled to it?  Will those in the disabilities sector who worked during the pandemic be entitled to it?  Many other sectors feel they should be entitled to the bonus because they worked through the pandemic on the front line to keep this country and our people safe.  People risked their lives for the State and this is the thanks they get.</p>  <p>  Will the Government look at how the electricity credit will be applied to those with hardship meters?  They are some of the most vulnerable people and they have to top up by &euro;10 each time before they get &euro;100 because there is a limit on it.  It will cost them &euro;30 to get the &euro;200 bonus for electricity that everyone else gets for free.  Is that fair?  Many of these people are struggling and need help.  We should not put up barriers to this for people who are vulnerable and who need and deserve it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="16:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900050#EEE00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The pandemic uprooted the lives of everybody in Ireland and had a severe impact on our business community.  No one will forget particularly March of 2020, when an unprecedented situation befell us.  The impacts of the pandemic spared no one and no organisation.  Businesses of all sizes faced uncertainty that no one envisaged.  I am proud of the actions taken by the previous and present Governments to protect jobs, livelihoods and lives during the pandemic.  We stepped into the unknown to provide employees and employers with certain financial assistance, be it the pandemic unemployment payment, the TWSS or its successor the EWSS.  There can be no doubt these measures prevented undue hardship for people and families throughout the country and helped businesses survive an existential crisis.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for a wide range of measures that will continue some of the supports brought in during the pandemic and for a number of other issues facing the nation today.  It will continue supports for businesses in the time ahead, address continued instability in the business community and allow some businesses which previously lost eligibility to become eligible again for those supports.  The CRSS will be allowed the flexibility it needs to act effectively, especially in relation to turnover rates.</p>  <p>  We were all amazed by the courage and determination of front-line workers through the pandemic and it is easy, now that we have much easier access to vaccines and have reopened our economy, to minimise or dismiss the gravity of the situation we were in.  Without vaccination or full knowledge of the transmissibility of the virus, nurses, doctors, hospital workers and many others stepped into the breach and risked their lives to protect others and save lives.  The Bill will facilitate the one-off payment of &euro;1,000 to front-line workers and ensure this payment is not subject to income tax, USC or PRSI.  It is right we make this offer as a token of our gratitude to workers who risked so much for our society.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the comments of other Members, the criteria are quite clear.  I understand there are some grey areas and I am sure the Minister has received similar representations to what I have received.  I hope they can be ironed out in the coming weeks.. The Bill will also benefit those purchasing a home, which is an incredibly important part of the commitments this Government has given, by increasing the rate of stamp duty introduced by the Government on the bulk purchase of properties, amounting to 10%.  The Bill will allow cost rental homes to be refunded the difference in stamp duty between the higher and standard rates.</p>  <p>  We have all watched the events unfolding in Ukraine with horror.  For good reason, there is great concern about the knock-on effects the war will have on day-to-day expenses for our citizens and on European economies.  There is no way we can avoid them.  Europe's reliance on oil and gas from Russia has exposed a chink in the armour of the EU.  The war has already resulted in the determination of EU nations to reduce their reliance on Russian gas and oil.  However, unlike the US and UK and because of the exposure certain countries have, we are unable to remove ourselves from that market.  Ireland does not use any Russian oil or gas, but we use oil and gas from countries that avail of Russian oil and gas.  Therefore, the price of their oil and gas will increase and that will have a knock-on effect here.  Whichever way we turn, unfortunately, we will face increased prices.  While Ireland does not receive a substantial supply from Russia, our partners do and this will place a significant burden on us in the coming months and, most likely, years.  It is therefore welcome that this Bill seeks to ease the burden at the pump.</p> <p>Excise duty will be eased as of midnight tonight in tangible terms.  It will mean 20 cent a litre is taken off petrol prices and 15 cent a litre is taken off diesel.  These are important steps to help families at this time of international uncertainty.  I note and want to put on the record that I contacted several service stations in my constituency last week when I noted prices had gone up.  They had not received a delivery of fuel to their stations.  They had just cranked up the prices.  As of this morning, I understand that another service station, not in my constituency but in the city centre, has cranked up its prices, even though it has not received a delivery of oil.  I verified this fact.  It was done, I presume, on the back of the notification that there would be an excise duty reduction.  This is reprehensible.  I appreciate that the Government is not in the business of setting prices for products, however we might wish we could, but it was a rather disgraceful act.  I know I am not alone in observing this phenomenon in recent weeks.</p> <p> The war in Ukraine also reminds us of the importance of doubling down in our effort to produce even more clean renewable energy here at home.  Lessons are being learned throughout the European Union regarding the need to leverage ourselves off Russian oil and gas, and oil and gas in general.  This is a good and positive step.  Investing in our renewable energy sector will not only reduce our reliance on international markets and events, but will also mean that we will be able to deliver cheaper energy to every home in Ireland and see the surplus energy that is created being exported.  This offers us a potential scenario that Ireland has rarely had, namely, to be a large-scale exporter of clean and responsibly sourced energy.  This would not only bring wealth to our nation but also jobs and investment in communities throughout the country.</p> <p> In the years ahead, when we look back on the pandemic - and we must be mindful that it is not over - we will consider the value of entering a time of national crisis from a position of strength, one I believe we would not have been able to address appropriately had it not been for the restorative measures implemented over the past decade, despite some of them being very tough.  We cannot forget the lesson that while it was easy to say it was the right thing to do, and it was, we as a nation must also understand that we need to be able to finance such actions.  I shudder to think where we might have been had it not been for the restorative actions of the Irish people in terms of the restoration of the economy.</p> <p> We do not know where the Ukraine war will lead us as a nation or a continent.  We do know there will be economic and financial impacts as we look to the future.  Therefore, we must continue to manage our finances responsibly and allow ourselves the space to react to any crisis that may emerge out of the blue and cause havoc to our economy if we were not to manage it correctly.</p></speech>

It also introduces the so-called pandemic special recognition payment or the Covid bonus.  While this is welcome, it comes late and with qualifying criteria that are far too narrow.  The Government's mushroom management means that everybody is kept in the dark until the latest reactionary leak.  Even now, there is a continuing lack of clarity over who will meet the criteria to qualify for the bonus.  The Government must include family carers who save the Government millions of euro every day, and yes, it is millions of euro every day.</p>  <p>  Family Carers Ireland estimates that carers save the State &euro;20 billion each year.  It is probably more, and yet the Government begrudges just two days' worth of that saving to give them a small token of gratitude.  This is not good enough.  While the Minister is at it, it is also high time that the long-promised pension provision for carers was sorted out.  We also need to ensure that workers in section 38 and 39 organisations are included, along with section 10 organisations that help the homeless.  These groups exist because the State has abdicated its responsibilities.  It is now payback time.  There must be clarity for community swabbers who are coming to the end of their contracts and may finish work before the payment is made.  Will they be included?</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, Bank of Ireland announced profits of &euro;1.4 billion, while AIB profits were &euro;629 million.  It is shameful that due to Government inaction they continue to pay no tax on any of these profits.  They were private companies when they almost bankrupted this country.  Each and every taxpayer is still paying for their recklessness and those enterprises should have to pay for their actions.  Families here are paying the highest mortgage rates in Europe.  The average first-time buyer mortgage is approximately &euro;225,000 and someone borrowing this amount would pay &euro;936 a month.  The average paid in the EU is &euro;762 a month.  This mean that an extra &euro;63,000 in interest is paid over the lifetime of the loan in Ireland.  Imagine paying &euro;63,000 in interest over the lifetime of a loan.  Is the Minister losing the plot?</p>  <p>  We also had the recent announcement that the ESB made a record profit of &euro;679 million last year.  Thousands of homeowners are struggling to pay soaring energy bills and the Government must act immediately to address the imbalance.  If there are to be hair shirts, it should be hair shirts all around.  As we know from recent history, however, it is hair shirts for many and Charvet shirts for the few.  The Minister must act now.</p></speech>

In general, the Government's financial response to the challenges caused by Covid-19 has been fair and mostly adequate.  I think it is fair to say that the response has been timely and that the sectors most affected have been supported.  All this, however, is coming at a huge financial cost, and it is one that will take generations to repay.  The bottom line is that these measures were needed at the time and we effectively had no choice.  Unfortunately, many businesses did not survive the periods of lockdown and many more will not survive when the financial supports are lifted.</p>  <p>  This is the point I raise today.  Many businesses are only just about surviving and the Covid-19-related supports they are receiving are effectively keeping them afloat.  As I said many times before, we need to support these businesses in future.  We cannot simply cut off the supports and see what happens.  Many of these businesses are local family-based companies, with two to ten workers.  They are the lifeblood of the Irish economy.  Most of the publicity goes to the large multinational companies, and there is no doubt that they provide extensive employment, but we must also fully support the small indigenous businesses that exist in every county.  There are many owners of such businesses in Dundalk and they all welcomed the supports they received during the lockdown periods, but they are all worried about the impact when these supports are lifted.  Many of them have stated that they fear they will find it difficult to maintain their existing workforces without these supports and, in some situations, even fear for their future entirely.</p>  <p>  If we look at the financial costs to the State, I think everybody can agree that it is better to support workers in employment than to support them while they rely on social welfare.  That is why I call on the Government to maintain these supports for the thousands of small Irish firms for as long as possible to allow them to get back on their feet fully.  The bottom line is that if we do not support these businesses now, there is a great danger they will close.  Once closed, they will be difficult to reopen.  We must keep supporting these businesses to allow them to survive.  This will, in turn, allow them to make a significant contribution not only to the Irish economy but also to our society.</p>  <p>  Another point I raise is that some large companies were able to make dividend payments to shareholders, who in many cases were also directors of these companies, while at the same time receiving thousands, or in some cases millions, of euro in Government supports.  This is morally wrong and must be examined.  It is simply wrong that these companies were allowed to do this.  What measures has the Government put in place to investigate this and what measures are in place to allow the Government to recoup this money in future if it is shown that the money was not needed?  Why is it that large companies could receive thousands, or in some cases millions, of euro of taxpayers' funds, while at the same time paying large amounts in dividends to shareholders and directors?  We need to look at this situation carefully.</p>  <p>  Turning to the dramatically rising cost of living, this is the next great challenge our society faces.  The unprovoked actions of Russia are adding greatly to these price rises.  I appeal to the Minister to put in place whatever measures are needed to support our business community.  To put this into context, I spoke to representatives of several businesses and the increased costs they are facing are frightening.  To give an example, one company in the food industry used to have an energy bill that was usually around &euro;25,000 each month.  Its bill is now averaging over &euro;55,000 per month, which means it has more than doubled.</p> <p>Another business owner I spoke with, who employs four people, has a weekly fuel bill of approximately &euro;300.  For the past number of weeks that has risen to over &euro;650 per week, and to put this into context, the business owner faces an annual increase in a motor fuel bill of almost &euro;20,000.  For that business this could be unsustainable over a long term.</p> <p> I welcome that the Government is reducing the duty on fuel, and that will be welcomed by the many thousands of businesses across the country.  The knock-on effect of all these increases in cost will eventually be substantially increased costs for the consumers in the supermarkets, and this is when we will see the real effects.  I fear consumers could be facing increased shopping costs of anything between &euro;20 and &euro;40 per week in their shopping bill.</p> <p> I welcome the pandemic special recognition payment for our front-line healthcare workers, who were heroes during the pandemic.  This is very welcome for them and I fully support the measure.  I hope that the administration of the payment is not bogged down in red tape and that it reaches those it was intended for.  It is only right to mention the many other workers who had to work hard during lockdowns to ensure we all had access to food and services.  In particular I highlight the supermarket workers, who worked right through the pandemic to ensure our supermarkets and shops remained open.</p> <p> I want once more to offer my support for the measures introduced during the lockdown.  These measures kept many thousands of businesses from closing permanently and supported them while they remained closed.  We must now continue that support for a period to ensure these businesses remain open and viable.  I also call on the Minister to address the issue of some large companies being in a position to pay out dividends to shareholders and directors while at the same time availing of Government supports.  If these companies were able to pay dividends, they should not have been receiving taxpayer money.  At the very least they should be made repay these supports.</p> <p> I thank the Government for the work done in the past two years during the pandemic and it has done a very good job.  As I said, with what is happening with Ukraine and the Russian invasion, there is much uncertainty.  I come from a border town in Dundalk and we are very concerned about what will happen.  In Ireland we have taken in over 2,500 Ukrainians and our friends in the UK have only taken approximately 500 people.  I support fully what the Government is doing and it is right that we should help Ukrainians.  I come from a Border area and we are worried that the UK is not going to follow suit.  I mentioned last week on the Order of Business about the minimum price of alcohol.  I fully supported the Government because it was supposed to happen in both the North and South.  The last thing we want to see is people crossing the Border from South to North in order to get alcohol because if they do that, they will end up getting food and everything else.  The Minister has had a thinking cap on for the past number of years so I ask him not to forget the Border areas.</p> <p> I am very proud to be Irish and what the Irish are doing to help Ukraine is unbelievable.  I come from Dundalk and all we can see are lorries loaded with food, clothes and everything else going up the M1 motorway.  It is absolutely fantastic and we welcome the Ukrainians.  Dialogue is the best way to go forward and I hope we get a quick resolution in Ukraine.  I hope Ireland does its fair bit and I hope there is a peaceful outcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="17:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900052#GGG00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill, which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has indicated covers a range of financial measures.  We must acknowledge, as other speakers have done, the pandemic supports that were introduced.  I sit on the enterprise committee and we certainly asked the Government for quite a while for a number of different supports.  Although we did not get it right from the start, at a later stage in particular the CRSS and the EWSS were of great help to employers.  They certainly allowed businesses to keep employees on hand and in the case of hospitality it allowed them to generate outdoor seating and all that.  It was a great help in summer to allow these businesses to get up and going and give them some very much-needed revenue.  The EWSS is being wound down now but we must be somewhat careful in how we do that.  I know we will not have a cliff edge and it runs until April but there may be businesses that continue to be affected and which find that the return to profitability is taking much longer than they would have thought.</p>  <p>  The question of debt warehousing has been discussed tonight.  It is a very important measure to allow businesses to park debt at a very difficult time when they face payments to the Revenue Commissioners.  In April this year, there is debt falling due.  I am glad to see that in cases in which it cannot be paid, the Government is extending the zero interest rate out to 2023, and from then a 3% interest rate will apply.  That is as it should be because it will be very hard for many businesses to really get back and thriving.  They must have low and flexible levels of interest repayments for the debt.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said in his opening remarks that the basis in offering these schemes was the prudent financial management of previous years.  I agree with that statement.  As I said, as we go to unwind these supports now, we must be mindful of how that will have an impact.</p>  <p>  The Bill also covers the final payment of &euro;1,000 tax-free to front-line workers and nursing staff.  Will the Minister confirm in his closing speech that this will be extended to section 38 and 39 healthcare workers and those working in the disability sector?  They have done sterling work offering respite and home supports and they must be recognised.  It is important that this happens along with the recognition of those who work in the nursing home sector.</p>  <p>  In the media I also see mention of a scheme to offer compensation to those health workers and families who tragically lost their lives during Covid-19 and I also welcome that scheme.  The number is approximately 23 in this country and every one of those is a tragic case because each person was coming to the aid of somebody else, using all of his or her training and expertise, without realising that he or she would ultimately become a victim of Covid-19.  We certainly send sincere condolences to families that are affected in such a way.  I know one family quite well who lost a healthcare worker in the family during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, mentioned that the economy is just beginning to open.  We see that as we try to throw off the shackles of Covid-19, although we know the virus has not gone away.  We have seen in the past week how there appears to be a new type of the Omicron variant going around, and having had one variant does not make a person immune to another.  We must continue to practice a reasonable degree of all the flexibility we had before we started wearing masks.  In particular, we must try to observe sanitisation practices and be very mindful that it is the older cohorts and those with underlying illnesses who are most at risk here.</p>  <p>  We are now facing into what is probably another perfect storm in the form of the war in Ukraine that Russian President Putin has decided to unleash.  We are well aware of the terrible tragedy this is delivering on the Ukrainian people and our hearts absolutely go out to them.  We must do everything possible in this country to try to offer our support to them, and we are doing that.  As I said in the House recently, I welcome the action of the Government and the heroes within the Irish people who are trying to campaign and gather goods; some are travelling to Poland and even into Ukraine to try to offer their support.</p>  <p>  This will see significant headwinds affect our economy.  There will be a vote tonight on fuel increases or rebates on fuel.  That is welcome but will it be enough?  My sense is that it will not be enough and I hope we will be back to discuss it soon again.  For agriculture and the heavy goods industry, the current level of fuel prices is untenable for continued operations.</p>  <p>  I know the Irish Red Cross is leading the process for pledging of accommodation for Ukrainians coming to Ireland.  It is very welcome and I know we have seen a very significant donation of pledges, with over 70,000 such pledges in recent days of different levels of accommodation and support.  We certainly need a fast-track system, which we will have, with personal public service numbers to be issued quickly to people arriving here so they can avail of public service payments and accommodation where required.  This will also allow for schooling for children.</p>  <p>  It is impossible to overstate the crisis that will come our way if the war in Ukraine extends to a food crisis.  We have a particular issue, which I mentioned in the House last week, because Russia and Ukraine account for nearly 30% of world grain supplies.  In this country, we produce very little grain that can be used to make flour and we have only one flour milling company in the country.  Approximately 20% of its turnover is based on its own manufacturing and the company buys in the rest of the flour.  That is for baking bread.</p> <p>We can do flour all right for biscuits but not for bread.  We are going to see a significant uptick in the cost of bread in the shops.  This is going to impact vulnerable households very quickly.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, met with farm leaders yesterday.  There is also the issue of tillage and fodder.  There was talk of a tillage order but I am afraid that is not going to work out for a whole range of reasons, not least that a number of EU directives would have to be bypassed to allow a tillage order to take place.  We also face a significant headwind in fertiliser costs.  I was just looking at them before I came into the House.  Calcium ammonia nitrate was &euro;390 per tonne about four months ago and is &euro;1,200 at a spot rate today, and can go to &euro;1,400 per tonne.  It is the same with urea and ammonia, which was &euro;600 a tonne and is now &euro;1,000 a tonne and heading higher again on a spot rate.  A large Norwegian fertiliser manufacturer has signalled that it is reducing its operations because they are not sustainable with the price of natural gas.  Vladimir Putin has set up the EU community from quite a long way back.  He has allowed us to become totally dependent on his gas and oil.  Even in our climate policy we unwittingly agreed to go forward with that construct.  We are going to have to look at it now very significantly.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said that employment is now close to 2.5 million in the economy but I think we can expect a significant headwind to that number also, certainly in terms of the economic stability of a lot of businesses.  A new energy policy is going to be needed.  As I said in the House recently, I am concerned that we are going to turn around in May and add further carbon prices on to fossil fuels, thereby adding to the inflation already in the economy.  We see what America is now doing with liquified natural gas, upping its capacity while we have turned our back on it.  We seem to be putting all our hopes in renewable energy, in solar farms which we have not yet developed.  We are talking about onshore and offshore wind.  Anybody who has studied the wind problem will realise that we are at least ten years away from being able to offer any type of offshore wind solution in Ireland.  That means we are basically hoping two conglomerates from abroad will come in here and we will likely still be paying a very high price for energy even if it is created on and off our shores.</p> <p> We have a significant problem in housing which needs to be addressed in light of where we are going with Ukraine.  Have we looked at the idea of creating a housing bond, almost like a war bond, in this country?  We are told we have a lot of money sitting on deposit.  Can it be put to use?  I know a number of builders who are availing of builder finance from larger builders simply because they cannot get builder finance from the pillar banks.  They are paying up to 10% per annum APR on builder finance, which is making it unsustainable for them to go out building, never mind where the costs in materials and supplies are going.  We have a major emergency and we have to do more than we are doing at present.</p> <p> Ireland is facing some particular difficulties.  We must hope that they will be short-lived, that the Ukraine crisis can be resolved through diplomacy and that we can get back onto the footing we were on, trying to build for the future, recover from Covid and build sustainability into our economy.  Certainly there are opportunities but there are threats.  It is most important that the Government would engage with all Deputies in the House.  I am not sure if this was done during the Covid crisis; in fact, I can tell the Minister it was not.  There is significant expertise among other Members of the House and the contacts they have.  It behoves our Government now given where we are to start talking to all Deputies about advancing future Government policy.</p></speech>

The objective of the scheme is to support employment and maintain the link between employer and employee.  Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Government has adopted a proactive and dynamic approach to supporting businesses and individuals during those challenging times, and they really were challenging.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the Minister about hauliers, agricultural contractors and other businesses that are experiencing the same threat.  Can they avail of such supports?  The Taoiseach this morning told the Chamber that countries all around the world are facing the same price hikes and pressures.  When Covid first came, countries all around the world faced the same threat.  We all stepped up.  The threat is the same now to the livelihoods of hauliers, suppliers and the agriculture sector.  We are already hearing that farmers cannot continue to supply food at the current prices in the face of inflation.  Even today a man rang me who was really in a desperate state.  He was really upset and said he had to think about letting go of his staff and shutting down his business because he is not able to sustain the price of the fuel.  This is really worrying.  I firmly believe that people are on their knees and businesses are going to be in crisis.  </p>  <p>  Since Christmas so many people have told me they cannot turn on their heating in their house.  The cost of heating oil has nearly doubled since January.  The weather is so bad.  My own mother is nearly 87.  She rarely goes out of the house and she has her heating on 24-7.  She is telling me now that she has to look at her options because the price of heating is unreal.  If we are able to cut the price of diesel and petrol, surely we should be able to cut the price of kerosene.  We cannot have people in their homes unable to turn on their heating.</p>  <p>  I welcome the excise cut this morning.  However, petrol pumps are already hiking their prices to absorb it.  I have seen it happening.  This is not right and we must call it out when some businesses are faced with closure and other businesses might take advantage of them.  The public feel they are not being listened to.  We have learned how to work together in the pandemic and we must work together now to save jobs.  I firmly believe we are looking at livelihoods now.</p>  <p>  We are giving more money to the fuel allowance recipients, which I welcome.  The energy credit scheme will begin to show on people's electricity bills next month.  Any help we give is so important.  However, people are crying out for more help here.  We need to do more on this.  Can businesses suffering because of the fuel crisis avail of the wage subsidy scheme?  Is the Minister exploring that in the context of the global crisis?</p>  <p>  I welcome that the pandemic recognition payment will be tax-free as agreed by the Government.  There is so much confusion.  So many nurses and others have rung me confused about who will get it, when they will get it, the timeline, the criteria and what exactly is happening.  While I welcome the payment, I wish to highlight the lack of information when we announce something.  I just cannot understand that we do not give the proper timescale and information and let the front-line workers and our nurses know what is happening.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to come back to me on these very serious issues.  I know everybody is doing their best but people are very worried at the moment.  They are worried about jobs.  We are back again the way we were nearly two years ago but this is a different crisis.  If we do not help in this crisis we are going to have massive changes.  It is not good for the people of Ireland, for their mental health, for jobs or in general.  I ask the Minister to do what he can and not to leave anyone in a home where they cannot afford to use their heating oil.</p></speech>

It has come right to the centre of the debate now but let us be honest, the issues in respect of the cost of living have been raised by many, not just the cost of fuel but also the cost of childcare, rent, housing and all these issues.  The cost of fuel is now creating a massive issue for many employers, families and workers.  It is very worrying.  I welcome that the Government has belatedly moved after we and others had been calling for a reduction in recent days.  It is not as far as we would have gone and we will be tabling an amendment today but I welcome that there is some movement.  I urge the Government to listen to what we are putting forward in the amendment.  It is not just about the reduction now.</p> <p>I urge the Government to take stock of this, anticipate that there are likely to be other changes and take forward its excise policy on the basis of what Sinn F&eacute;in is arguing for, which is a price limit of around &euro;1.75.</p> <p> I note that some petrol forecourts are increasing their prices tonight to take advantage of these provisions.  They are a minority but it is very regrettable.  It is a shame if a minority of operators are trying to exploit the situation.  I expect the vast majority are doing the best they can with the margins they have but it seems some are taking advantage.  It is vitally important that the Government's policy is clear and that it ensures the price of petrol stays at a sensible level.  It is an issue for hauliers, school transport operators and many others who rely on transport for their employment.</p> <p> As the previous speaker raised, there is an issue with the Covid bonus.  Many family carers, in particular, were very disappointed not to be included in the scheme.</p> <p> We need to ensure some of the supports that have existed in terms of capital and operating expenditure for aviation continue for the next two or three years because it will take some time for the sector to recover.  It is a hugely important industry, particularly in the cities that have airports, and it is vital to protect it.</p> <p> The issue in regard to the price of petrol and fuel generally highlights the need to make a rapid transition.  The Government has not been ambitious enough on wind energy, especially when it comes to the lack of an auction for floating offshore wind.  It is saying it will look to do that after 2030.  The Scottish Government, with an inferior grid, already is offering such an auction.  Despite the limits of its grid, Scotland is putting resources into ammonia and green hydrogen.  There is a way this can be done.  We can be a world leader in this regard and Cork Harbour can be right at the very heart of it.  The failure at this stage to offer an auction for offshore floating wind shows a lack of ambition.  Likewise, the failure to convene the seafood sector task force, which is meant to engage with the issues and challengers faced by mariners, says to me that the Government is not taking offshore wind generation seriously enough, particularly the potential it has to reduce the country's emissions and provide energy security and employment.</p></speech>

The 15 cent and 20 cent reductions do not go far enough.  Business owners, including quarry and construction business owners, have been ringing me this evening to say they have been told by companies to stop working because they can no longer sustain the expense of the fuel needed for running people to sites, transporting stone to build roads and so on.  They are going to cease working and run on what little material they have at present.  As I said, the reductions in fuel prices the Government is proposing do not go near far enough.  The carbon tax it has implemented will raise &euro;9.5 billion by 2030.  The amount of extra tax it has taken on the fuel price increase is absolutely criminal.  The Government will be remembered for what it has done.  Does it realise what will happen down the road because of the cost of production in this country?</p>  <p>  At the start of the Covid crisis, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stood in this House and asked people to grow lettuce on their south-facing windows.  He encouraged them to go to the local hardware shop for supplies to paint the back of their houses.  That is the mentality of a Minister in this Government.  The same Minister stood in this House on another occasion and spoke about people sharing 30 cars among a population of 3,000 in rural areas.  That is the mentality of the Minister.  Now the Government is proposing a 15 cent reduction in fuel prices, in an escalating situation where there is supposed to be a 90-day reserve.  The price increase should not have happened in the escalating way it did.</p>  <p>  The responsibility of the Government is to this country but what it did next was turn to farmers and ask them to grow wheat and corn.  It acknowledged that the sector is over-regulated and said it would reward farmers with a proposal, which we are being asked to vote on tonight, for a 2 cent reduction on agricultural diesel.</p></speech>

Putin will be remembered for his disgraceful behaviour in Ukraine; Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party will be remembered for what they have done to production in this country, which is no longer a breadbasket for its people.  We are no longer self-sufficient because of the regulations and stipulations the Minister and his partners in government have put in place.  Their reward to farmers is to reduce the price of green diesel by 2 cent.</p>  <p>  Contractors are parked at the moment because they cannot afford to go out and plough fields.  They cannot get the amount of green diesel they need at the excessive prices of &euro;1.40, &euro;1.42 or &euro;1.43.  The Government is offering a 2 cent reduction.  Every consumer in this country, if they buy Irish products, will pay an excessive amount because of this.  Everything on the shelves is going up by 50 cent or &euro;1 because of the actions of the Government and its failure to protect people in this country.  It has failed to protect our agriculture sector, which puts food on our tables.  It has put everything into Europe.  We are responsible for 0.1% of global emissions and we are increasing our emissions because of the amount of food we have to bring in from foreign countries.  We could provide that food ourselves if the Government gave the investment that is needed.</p>  <p>  Members of the Government know nothing about this because they live in concrete cities and think food will arrive on the shelves.  I remind them that people living in Dublin and our other cities originated from rural Ireland.  When the shelves go empty, they will hold Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party responsible for the excessive prices they must pay to heat their houses and put food on the table.  That will show the Government how far out of touch it is with reality.</p></speech>

Businesses suffered hugely through the Covid crisis, not knowing from one moment to the next what restrictions were being put in place or when they would be enacted.  The Government kept us all hanging in this regard, although it leaked any announcements to the press days before they were made.</p>  <p>  We have gone from Brexit to the Covid crisis and now to a war and, again, the Government is coming out with all kinds of rubbish.  Last week, our group put in a motion calling for a mini-budget, which we ended up having last night.  Our proposal was aimed at easing the suffering of the people who put us in our jobs.  The Minister of State should not forget they also put him in his job.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, had the audacity to stand up here and slate each and every one of us.  Now it is my turn to slate him.  How much has the national children's hospital gone over budget?  We were rightly calling it the hole in the ground at one stage, with a budget overspend of millions of euro and a site on which a helicopter cannot be landed.  The Minister badly needs to close his mouth and listen to those who understand the suffering people are going through.  The Green Party tail is wagging the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael dog.  The Minister has not a notion of what real life is like for people.  He stood here last week and tried to assassinate our characters.  In fact, he made a complete fool of himself as he persisted in refusing our request for a lowering of fuel prices.</p>  <p>  This Bill provides for the Covid-19 recognition payment for healthcare workers, which will not be subject to tax.  I am surprised the Minister is not taxing it but he surely will be getting the money at the pumps in any case.  As a colleague said this morning, he is taxing the tax on fuel.</p> <p>People working in the healthcare system want to know when they will get their &euro;1,000.  The Minister might also clarify that.</p> <p> The Bill also provides for the tax treatment of payments made under the proposed Brexit whitefish fleet decommissioning scheme.  Let us be honest: the only reason this scheme is being introduced is the Government, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, sold out our fishermen in the Brexit quota negotiations.  The Government has completely betrayed the fishing sector, with a total quota loss of approximately &euro;43 million per year.  In overall terms, the Government now wants to decommission a large proportion of the Irish fleet to allow foreign-owned vessels to fish for our stock off our coasts.  Yes, lads, we are giving it away to other countries while our Irish boys are being told to decommission.  Well done.  It is another rotten deal for the people of Ireland.  It is just like farmers and others in the agriculture sector are being treated.</p> <p> Just in case the Minister does not know, because he and his Government are so far removed from reality, there was a fisherman on the radio the other day who, instead of heading out fishing this week, tied up his boat.  I will tell the Minister why: it would have cost him &euro;30,000 in fuel to catch a &euro;27,000 quota, which is what he was allowed to fish for.  He would have lost &euro;3,000 had he gone out during the week.  That is not taking into account the cost of staff and other expenses.  It might have cost him &euro;15,000 to &euro;20,000 to go out.</p> <p> The country is grinding to a halt and the Government is sound asleep at the wheel.  It has not got a clue.  I am shocked at its councillors.  I am shocked that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il councillors - forget about the Green Party councillors because they are not with it - are not roaring and shouting on the ground seeing as their Deputies are out of touch and completely in la-la land.  Surely be to God the councillors are somewhat in touch with those on the ground but maybe they are not.  I am beginning to think they are not.</p> <p> This Bill is supposed to help businesses that have suffered throughout the pandemic but the Government&rsquo;s carry-on will put the final nail in the coffin.  The Government is telling us it will reduce the cost of fuel by 15 cent and 20 cent a litre, and 2 cent a litre for the farm industry.  Imagine, 2 cent for the farm industry.  There is to be nothing at all for those who are trying to heat their homes.  How is this going to help?  We all know the price of fuel is rising rapidly.  The Government has had its chance.  We have given it months.  For months, we pleaded with it not to introduce the carbon tax and to push it aside or out the door, but it laughed across the way.</p> <p> The advice of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is to slow down when driving.  I think he told people today that this would save fuel.  My God, has the Government any understanding of the number of emails being received and the amount of anger?  The country is on the verge of an absolute revolution and the Government sits idly by, quite happy to let it happen.  It shames politics because politicians should be available to work for and help their people.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have failed.  Forget the Greens because they do not care and that is their agenda.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have worked their way into their agenda.</p></speech>

I will give the ages of some of the people who have been waiting on trolleys for up to 60 hours.  There is a lady of 99, a lady of 98, a lady of 86 and a man of 90.  They have been waiting for 60 hours in emergency departments underneath lights that cannot be turned off.  They are so bright but cannot be turned off or down because they are fire lights.  They have to be left on.  The patients have been in the corridors for 60 hours.</p>  <p>  I thank and compliment the hard-working staff working last night, today and tonight, including doctors and nurses.  My God, what has gone wrong in a country when, at a critical time today, our emergency department could not function as such?  It is very doubtful that if there had been a road traffic accident, the victims could have been brought to it because it was ceasing to function since there was not a trolley, bed or capacity.  It has never been as bad as it is right now.  Somebody has to stand up here tonight and talk about Kerry University Hospital and what is happening in the emergency department there.  My God, it is not the fault of the staff.  What has gone wrong with management and the HSE?  They should hang their heads in shame tonight.  Anybody who doubts me may check the records to see the ages of the patients and think about the fact that there are patients in ambulances for five hours.  There are people with pressure sores who cannot be moved anywhere because they have not yet gone through the emergency department.  </p>  <p>  It is so frightening that the answer of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to the fuel price increase is to drive slowly, which he believes will make everything fine.  I hate talking about somebody when he is not present but I ask the him to get into the real world.  He should tell a man who is hauling a big lorryload of timber over county bounds tomorrow at 4.30 a.m. to go easy.  I will tell the Minister what will happen: the driver will shudder to a halt.  He should tell a fisherman sailing out into the ocean to catch a shoal of fish to slow down, turn down his revs a small bit and that he will be fine.  This is such rubbish and nonsense.  The Minister should tell a man driving a tractor to spread slurry or plough a field - please God, he will be able to plough a field again - to turn down his revs and that he will be all right because his fuel will last a lot longer.  He should tell a travelling salesman working very hard to deliver bread or milk or the drivers of lorries delivering vegetables.  We are an island nation; nothing drops in out of the sky.  The Minister should tell all the road hauliers that if they slow down and crawl away, they will be fine and that the cost of fuel will make no difference to them.  I swear to God that anybody attached to or having anything to do with the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green group at the moment would want to be ashamed to their bones.  I mean it.  How they can stand over this type of nonsense is beyond belief.</p>  <p>  What we are facing as a nation is unprecedented, but, my God, what about the crowd we have in charge?  In this regard, I heard today some of the waffle, rubbish and nonsense that come out of Taoiseach&rsquo;s mouth, having given the farmers and all the people involved in the agricultural sector and building industry a reduction of 2 cent per litre.  Does the Government know what it is after doing?  I never in my life did anything rude and I am doing it at the ground.  This is what it is doing.  I am not doing it to the Minister.  The Government is giving the two fingers or one finger, or whatever it likes, to the whole industry.  Shame on it for that.  To every one of the farmers, fishermen and agricultural contractors of Ireland, let the message go out of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann loudly tonight that they are worth 2 cent per litre according to the Government.  Every Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green politician who will ever again knock on a door will be remembered for this.  It is like long ago when the farthing was taken off the pension.  The people of Ireland will say the Government is the crowd that gave them 2 cent a litre and that this is what they were believed to be worth when agricultural diesel was &euro;1.50 per litre.  The right price would be 45 cent a litre but the Government is giving the farmers a reduction of 2 cent per litre.  My God, it is a fair insult to the hard-working people in the sector.</p></speech>

It is an insult to the people of Ireland, the working people.  It is an insult to the farmers who put so much into producing good food and who have abided by every rule and regulation.  What the Government has announced here today will make no material difference.  I have no personal gripe with the Minister of State whatsoever but does it not tell it all that the Government has a man who suggested we should bring back wolves?  There are enough wolves around barking at every fellow&rsquo;s door and people trying to stay going.  In case the Minister of State does not know it, millions of euro of work has been postponed or cancelled.  Hundreds of jobs are being put on hold because people cannot tender or see a way to carry on.  To offer a reduction of as little as 2 cent is a shame and disgrace.</p>  <p>  There is something else happening here as well, of course.  We need to get accountability.  Where is the regulator?  The price of green diesel has almost crept up to the price of white diesel.  There needs to be accountability but whatever is done is being taxed the Government.  It is talking about putting up the carbon tax again in May.  Other countries have imposed a cap to ensure people know where they are going and to ensure certainty.  The increase is too much of a jump in a short time.  It is an insult to farmers.</p>  <p>  What about the elderly who are trying to heat their homes?  They have also got a reduction of 2 cent.</p> <p>God almighty, the Minister of State will have to review this and be fair about it.  The Government must admit that since the Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations were closed down, the price of electricity has gone up weekly.  It is 38% or 39% more than it was before the Government closed down those two power stations.  What are we doing?  We are here one day castigating Putin and every day we are buying coal from him to keep Moneypoint going.  That is the truth.  That is the God's gospel truth.  It is a shame because Europe and our country have been built up.  Putin should not be anywhere doing the harm that he is.  He should not have been put in a position where he was so powerful that he could do that.</p> <p> I welcome the payment to the healthcare workers.  I believe it is unfair that some are deemed ineligible for the payment either because they were sick or had Covid.  That must be looked at.  Surely, the Minister will see the light there.  </p> <p> Of course, the Government does not want Shannon LNG.  The T&aacute;naiste says he has other plans.  When will they materialise?  We need gas at the present time.  We should be able to buy gas from the USA, or people that are inclined to sell it to us at a reasonable price.  The Government does not want Shannon LNG.  It would create jobs for people in County Kerry and, in particular, north Kerry, as well as provide energy security.</p> <p> The Acting Chairman never put up a finger to anyone else.  Why is he putting up a finger to me now?  I still have time on the clock.</p></speech>

It is very unfair.  The Government is being dishonest with the people.  It could do more.  It is saying that it cannot do more and that it is being stopped by Europe.  I ask the Government to think of the people trying to go to work, morning after morning, and what it is costing them.  I ask the Government to think of the farmers whose backs are to the wall and the employers.  It is jeopardising all of this by not helping them in a meaningful way.  The Government is making no attempt to help them.  The Greens, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael will suffer as a result of this, because the people are completely disillusioned with what is going on here in this Chamber in these times.</p></speech>

We have gone from a Covid crisis into a Ukrainian crisis.  Clearly, we have to support the people of Ukraine, but there are issues that we must deal with domestically.  We learnt a lot from the pandemic.  The measures we bring in must be quick, decisive and very much sectorally-based, and they must take away uncertainty.  What we are facing at the moment  is coming at an enormous speed, virtually overnight.  We are facing an increase in food and energy costs.  Across society, sectors are being severely impacted.  Everybody uses petrol, diesel and heating oil.  Everyone has to eat.  It affects all sections of society, some more severely than others.  Certainly, the haulage sector is under severe pressure.  Lower-income households are also under severe pressure.  We are now moving into a second unprecedented event with the Ukrainian crisis, after just coming out of the Covid pandemic.</p>  <p>  We can learn from Covid.  Many of the measures that we brought in have been road-tested and they have worked.  The EWSS and PUP scheme have worked.  The various supports for different sectors have worked.  We came through.  People in various sectors were impacted severely and many of them are still suffering.  Many in the hospitality sector are still being affected by the pandemic.  Generally, as a country, our revenues held up.  Coming into this, the economy generally, and the State's finances in particular, are in a reasonably good position. Our borrowings are high, but we are in a reasonably good position to deal with this particular crisis.  What was announced today with the cut in excise duty is just the start.  We have to keep it under review.  Obviously, there are constraints in what we can do in terms of Europe, but it is something that we must be conscious of.  The difference this time is that major inflationary measures are coming.  There are external reasons the price of energy is going up and the price of food will go up.  We need security of supply.  The Government came through the pandemic crisis.  We did not get everything right, but certainly, in the main, we got a lot of things right.  Many businesses came through.  Now, we are presented with different challenges, but the blueprint is there.  The difference between Covid and now is that when Covid happened, it was a blank page.  Now, it is happening and we know which measures worked and which did not.  The difference here is that we will have to ensure that we find ways to guarantee that people can afford to live.  That is the biggest difference now, particularly around energy and food.  This will have to be reviewed on a continual basis.  The factors are changing very much outside our own control.  The one thing that we learned from Covid is that we must move decisively and with speed.  That is what takes away the degree of uncertainty.  It is something that I would like to see happening and I have no doubt that it will.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-09a.507" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="17:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030900056#LLL01900"><p>This Bill brings to light a number of points.  First, it reminds us that the Covid pandemic is not over yet, and that families, households and businesses are still being affected by the threat and the effects of the virus.  It also reminds us that the pandemic is never far away, and that we must maintain a state of readiness for any further complications that may lie ahead.  Yet, the way certain key health workers are being excluded from the pandemic special recognition payment, which this Bill provides for, is a profound insult to them.  These people are likely to be disproportionately affected by the one factor that has made the fragile situation in which many businesses and families have found themselves even worse, namely, the onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the consequent rise in energy costs that is affecting every person and business nationwide.  Only this morning, a hospital worker contacted my office to say that where it once cost him &euro;65 to &euro;70 a week to fill a car, it now costs him &euro;110.  He also said that any changes that the Government's excise duty reduction will make have already been written off.  He rang around a number of petrol stations, which are charging between &euro;2.09 per litre of petrol and &euro;2.24 per litre of diesel.  They told him that their prices would not be changing tomorrow as they had already bought in their fuel.  By not putting a cap on prices, the changes that the Government is suggesting will do little to offset the challenges being faced by people, both now and in the time to come.</p>  <p>  I also want to raise an issue with this Bill that was discussed at length by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, namely, the provision in the Bill to provide for the tax treatment of payments made under the proposed Brexit whitefish fleet decommissioning scheme 2022.  I am sorry, but I cannot understand how this Government cannot be anything but embarrassed at finding itself in a situation of its own making, whereby the fishing industry is being asked to close for business.  This is all that this Government seems to be able to offer the sector, wiping out a third of the vessels that operate in Ireland's offshore commercial whitefish fleet.  It is equally regrettable that when another matter concerning the fishing industry was debated on Committee Stage, every amendment that was tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in and the independent groups was rejected.  That, of course, is the targeting of the fishing sector through the improper design of the traffic light system.  To conclude, as we consider this Bill and the measures taken to address the Covid-19 crisis, we have to pay particular attention to one thing.</p> <p>That one thing is the lessons that were learned and how those lessons are used to address the serious shortfalls in the health system that were exposed when the crisis hit.  How long will the emergency department of University Hospital Limerick be bursting at the seams?  How long will children across County Tipperary have to wait years to get assessments of need?  How long will we continue to see the stripping of community health services from towns such as Carrick-on-Suir and Roscrea?  Can the Government honestly say it is addressing the shortfalls the pandemic exposed?  I do not think so.</p></speech>

All Members accept the difficulties that led to the supports being introduced.  We all know that none of us had any part to play in the creation of the pandemic.  Rather, it was foisted upon us and a determination was made that we needed to protect the people and, beyond that, businesses and families, so supports were introduced.  All Members welcome the &euro;1,000 special recognition payment.  I know there are issues relating to those working in section 38 and section 39 organisations, as well as the wider issue of family carers once again feeling hard done by.  There are issues in respect of ratio payments and all the rest of it that do need to be considered.  On the whole, however, it is something that should have happened earlier.  We are very glad to see it happen now.  However, like I said, we made a determination in respect of carrying out these supports.</p>  <p>  Once again, we are in a situation that is not of our making.  There were already conditions of inflation due to the outworkings of Covid and Brexit but, beyond that, we have had to deal with the absolutely criminal and murderous invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin.  Once again, support and solidarity has to be shown to the Ukrainian people but, in addition, we have to consider what mitigations can be introduced for our own people in the present circumstances.  Plenty of Deputies have laid out the human situation of people who cannot afford to fill their home heating oil or make necessary journeys to hospitals or elsewhere.  We have all seen how prices have shot up.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the fact that there are some mitigations from the Government but more will be needed.</p>  <p>   Pegging petrol prices at &euro;1.75 per litre is not necessarily exactly where people want them to be but it is a point of mitigation and we need to ensure that happens across the board.  We recognise there has been a significant increase in the tax take and that has to be taken into account when decisions are being made.  I call on the Government to consider that to ensure there is a pegging system and some sort of baseline that people will know they will pay at the pump.</p>  <p>  I get that there are wider issues that need to be considered and that, unfortunately, we are still far more wedded to fossil fuels, and even, in some cases, to Russian fossil fuels, than we would like to be.  We are not as far on as we would like to be when it comes to wind energy.  There is an onus on us to deal with that.  We also have to deal with the specific issue of home heating oil and the pressure in that regard.</p>  <p>  In the past week, I raised the issue of the district heating system at Carlinn Hall, Dundalk.  Unfortunately, it is a very inefficient heating system.  It was initially meant to run on biofuels but ended up, as a result of unintended consequences, being heated by gas, and it loses 50% of that gas.  Basically, 100 units of gas give 50 units of heat to the house.  The problem is that Frontline Energy, the company that buys from Energia, is charged as a commercial customer.  I have raised this issue previously.  I brought it to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  It is a specific issue that will need to be dealt with.  There are several of that type of district heating systems and they work in certain circumstances, such as when they use the likes of what is being proposed for Poolbeg, that is, where there is basically a heat dump that can be used rather than wasted.  Obviously, that makes sense from an environmental point of view but we need to ensure there are no more situations such as that in Carlinn Hall.  We will need to find solutions, particularly for people in the likes of Carlinn Hall.  That will involve some sort of protection for domestic users.  </p>  <p>  It is straightforward.   I will not take up any more time.  We brought in the protections relating to Covid because they were needed.  We are now in a situation that is not of the making of the Government or the Opposition, but we do need to protect our people.  We need to mitigate where we can.  I accept some of this needs to be done at European level.  There is an onus on the State to make sure our voice is heard there, but we also need to do exactly what we can and there is still an opportunity to do that tonight.</p></speech>

A proposal such as the one that has been put forward is a mere drop in the ocean.  Taking 20 cent off a litre of petrol, 15 cent off diesel and 2 cent off agricultural diesel is an insult.  I thought I read it wrong when I saw it was only 2 cent a litre off agricultural diesel, yet the Government is expecting farmers to perform miracles by increasing crop growth and getting involved in that activity.  How does it expect farmers to do so if it is only cutting excise on agricultural diesel by 2 cent a litre?  I ask that of the Government because it appears it has no understanding of rural Ireland or how farmers operate.  It is shocking.  I would appreciate it if the Government listened to farming organisations and the people of rural Ireland, who have already told the Government this and that there was a deep crisis long before there was a war in Ukraine.</p><p>I and my colleagues have been raising for the past year and a half in the House the issue of rising costs of living and the fact that people are really struggling.  We are not alone in doing so.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has also raised it.  It is receiving unprecedented numbers of calls, such as from people who cannot afford heating oil and are in deep crisis.</p><p>There are solutions.  One solution is to completely suspend the carbon tax.  It is an unfair, unjustified and regressive tax that will have serious repercussions in rural Ireland.  I know for a fact that many agricultural contractors have gone out of business because of the carbon tax and the effect it has had on their businesses.  I hope the Government will see sense and postpone such an increase.  Indeed, I oppose this tax, as do my Rural Independent Group colleagues, because it is unfair and regressive.</p><p>It is alarming that there is no reference in the Government announcement to home heating oil or cutting excise duty on it.  That is shocking when one considers the Government has closed down the midlands in terms of Bord na M&oacute;na operations.  It is crazy.  I ask the Government to give more consideration to allowing people to continue their traditions of turf cutting and to allow that to compensate for the fact that we do not and will not have a ready supply of oil.  There is a shortage of oil, in addition to the rise in prices due to the current crisis.  The logical, common-sense and right thing to do is to allow people to cut turf to compensate for what is happening and until we have alternatives.  We do not have alternatives at present.  To close down entire operations and stop people from cutting turf is quite shocking in light of the crisis we are in now.  I ask the Government to look at that again.</p><p>I have been raising the issue of the crisis faced by hauliers for a significant time, since long before the war in Ukraine.  I asked for the rebate to being increase from the current 7.5 cent per litre rate.  In countries such as France it is 19 cent per litre, while in Belgium it is 22.5 cent.  It is alarming that there could be serious disruption to the supply chain if hauliers cannot continue in their businesses.</p><p><i>[Further text to be added.]</i></p></speech>

People are going to freeze in their houses, and they cannot boil a kettle if they are depending on the ESB.  If we get temperatures of -10&deg;C or -12&deg;C, the heat pumps to heat the air will stop.  We know that from the last big freeze we had in 2010. Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan Rialtas?  The Government is absent and is missing in action.  It is persecuting the people.  I do not know what kind of a death wish it has against the people.  Cromwell was not as bad.  We resisted him out in Cluain Meala, but he told people to head off to Connacht.  The Government is giving people no place to go.</p> <p> There is land in Kerry, Donegal and many other counties that is not arable.  It cannot be ploughed.  There is land in the valley of the Suir and the owner, Michael Morrissey, was always boasting that in 1947, when there was compulsory ploughing, he had 330 Irish acres of land - t&aacute; s&eacute; imithe anois; fuair s&eacute; b&aacute;s - and there were three fields he did not have to plough because it was wetland that flooded.  The Government is not taking that into account at all.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, is in dreamland.  He came up with a dream.  The farm organisations, including Macra na Feirme, condemned what happened.  They went in expecting action, but there was an empty room, empty heads and no ideas.  There was no vision and no passion.  It was decided to set up a committee that will meet on Friday.  Imagine that, in the middle of a crisis that was here long before a bullet was ever fired in Ukraine or a soldier moved next or near it, but the Government will blame that.  It has been blaming Covid for everything for the last two years.  As far as I am concerned, it was total overkill.  The narrative was driven by the media.  Are we going to allow the narrative in this war to be driven by the media again?  We are.</p> <p> The Government is supposed to govern.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, is talking about setting up another citizens' assembly.  This is a citizens' assembly anseo.  I have the privilege of being elected here for the time being and so has the Minister.  This is a citizens' assembly.  There is no talk about the cost of the citizens' assemblies.  The waste of money is just phenomenal.</p> <p> The Government closed down all the peat plants and the coal burning stations.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I asked the Taoiseach if he would re-examine the LNG plant - the answer was "No" - and if he will try to do some harvesting at sea - the answer was "No".  We are ten years away from any real solar energy and wave energy.  We are going to be perished with the cold.  We will have three coats on us.  I was in the Chair here this afternoon and everything went off aside from the lights.  It was a technical glitch.  We are all going technical now, with switches for this and switches for that, but we cannot light a fire.  Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta because we cannot get the kippens that I remember an old lady in Newcastle, Josie O'Connor, gathering and keeping the fire warm.  There is plenty of timber, but the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does not want to cut it.  He wants to make window boxes out of it, south-facing ones, and put carrot seeds and whatever else in them.  That is his view, and we all know what he thinks about people.  However, why is the Government allowing itself to be led along by the nose by the Green Party?  I am not a climate change denier, but it is big hoax to punish the people.  Carbon tax is a punitive tax and affects people in fuel poverty more than anything else.</p> <p> It is one fiasco after another.  The Minister for Finance was here last week and he insulted us, saying we did not cost anything.  I asked the Minister about the children's hospital, that daft black hole that was built in the wrong place.  It was a political decision by the Minister's leader and others to build it there.  It is still not out of the hole, and it is going to cost billions.  The national broadband plan costs billions.  The Government is going to bring water from the Shannon to Dublin, through the best of the land that we are going to plough and till and grow grass on, to put it into a pipe system that leaks 48% of the water, as independent studies have shown.  Kindergarten children would not behave like this, but the Government is behaving like this in the national Parliament.  The Taoiseach is gone off somewhere - I do not know where he said the summit is.  It is not a summit at all, but a gathering.  We are welded to the globalists and the EU masters.  When they say, "Jump", the Taoiseach asks how high.  The Minister for Finance is the same.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, is going to the Bilderberg conferences and God knows where else.  World order is the next thing, when we will not have enough to eat.</p> <p> In the middle of it all, I understand the Cabinet was informed yesterday that the ESB made a profit of &euro;620 million last year.  It is fleecing people with charges.  The public service obligation, PSO, levy is fleeced from customers to pay for wind turbines.  When the wind is not blowing when it is sunny, they are stopped and when the wind is blowing too strong, they are turned off.  That is plunder of the people.  The ESB should be held to account.  It is a semi-State body.  The Minister should call it in and tell it that it can make a profit of perhaps &euro;10 million or so, but &euro;620 million is more than &euro;2 million a day.  People cannot pay the bills.  The bills in restaurants, pubs or any catering industry have gone up, not to mention those of the homes, the schools and voluntary boards of management trying to collect it.  The Government has lost all sense of perspective and of reality.  The more it puts on in taxes and the higher the price of fuel goes, the better it likes it.  The Government tells us about the GDP rate and so forth.  That is on the back of the blood and sweat of the people.  People have to travel to work, but they will not be able to go to work.  Building and construction sites will be stopped.  Machines will be parked because people cannot afford to use them.  They have tenders and contracts for jobs at fixed prices.  They are in a perilous situation and all the Government does is go off to whatever city is picked - it might be Venice or the like - to have an informal, not formal, meeting.</p> <p> I would love to know what is going on behind those closed doors.  What is going on at Bilderberg?  What is going on at other global meetings to which the globalist Fine Gael is connected to?  Now, the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, is running after it, trying to be as good as it.  It is so he will get a fat job in Europe when he is run out of this Government and out of this Parliament by the people.  No doubt, he will be appointed to Europe, like many others who were here.  I could name some of them, but I will not.  Shame on the Government to do this.  We are voting against this.  I did not even talk about the measure the Minister is introducing tonight regarding the excise duty.  We submitted an amendment, but we have not had sight of the amendments yet, not even at this time of night and when we are due to debate it in 20 minutes.</p></speech>

I welcome the recognition by many Deputies that the support schemes played an invaluable role in protecting our economy as we grappled with the darkest moments of the pandemic.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, the Covid restrictions support scheme and various other schemes such as the debt tax warehousing scheme, which will be in place across the coming years, have all protected and saved jobs during a period in which we were asking people not to go to work and asking employers to close because it was not safe for them to be open.  We had a very high level of obligation to those employers and workers over this period and, as a Government, we fulfilled it.  I acknowledge the constructive role that most Deputies played in this regard by supporting this legislation and seeking to improve it in different ways.</p>  <p>  With regard to the debate this evening on the use of the employment wage subsidy scheme and the fact that a small number of employers who were on the scheme paid dividends, I acknowledge that this is an issue of concern to the House.  However, the vast majority of employers who were on the scheme did not pay dividends.  As regards those who did pay dividends in that period, it is a sign of some of them beginning to be in profit but also being able to invest in their own future and being able to maintain and grow jobs across the period and in the years ahead, in which we face even fresher and new challenges.</p>  <p>  A number of colleagues raised a point regarding the future of wage subsidy schemes.  We have a group in place, which is part of the pathways to work strategy, in which we will examine whether there is the potential for new, short-time work support programmes that will build on the lessons we have from the employment wage subsidy scheme and the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  There is a working group under way in this regard.</p>  <p>  Different points were made about the pandemic special recognition payment.  I am advised by the Minister for Health that the Department of Health and the HSE are currently consulting with health sector trade unions.  This consultation is part of the Department's and the HSE's objective to finalise the application of this measure fairly.  Upon the conclusion of consultations with trade unions, full details of the application process will be published by the HSE.</p> <p>It is intended that the payments will be instructed later this month.</p> <p> Other issues have been raised regarding excise and fuel costs.  I will leave that to the debate this evening.  We will debate the proposals that have been brought forward by the Government.  A number of Deputies, including Deputies Shortall and Shanahan, touched on the proposals on debt warehousing.  I emphasise this is a scheme that will be in place for some businesses until 30 April 2023.  That is some way away from where we are at present.  I know Revenue will engage on a pragmatic basis with companies to agree a suitable phased payment plan for tax liabilities.  I know it will be flexible and will recognise the value of those employers.</p> <p> As I said in my introduction, I hope this is the last piece of legislation that will refer to the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic.  It puts in place many of the provisions we need to conclude schemes that played a very valuable role in supporting jobs and employers during the pandemic.  I thank Deputies who have recognised the work of the officials and the Revenue Commissioners in acting with great speed in implementing large programmes.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

Such an event causes pressure on days like this when we are trying to introduce a financial resolution late in a day with limited deadlines for amendments.

</table> </p><p><font face="Times New Roman">(2)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</font></p><p>Before I address the substance of the resolution and lay out the rationale for it, I will mention that, as will be the case with many of the speakers this evening, I know that, as important as these issues are and as acutely aware as I am of how much they matter to so many people in our country, we are all very moved by and deeply aware of the horror of what is happening in Ukraine at the moment.  I am also aware of the obligations we will have to the many thousands of Ukrainians who will come to our homes here in Ireland and the commitments we will have to them, which I know the Irish people and the Government are determined to discharge.</p><p>With regard to the motion itself, I will first address the economic background to it.  The opening point I would like to make to the D&aacute;il this evening is to emphasise that we are in the very early days of the economic consequences of a war.  The duration of those consequences, their scale and what they will mean for our country and economy is still unclear at this point.  However, we know the risks are very significant.  While the risks are very different from the risks faced by those in Ukraine, we nonetheless know that from an economic point of view, they are very serious for families, employers and our economy.  However, I will again emphasise that we are in the early moments of all of this and we may need to face many other challenges.  We will have obligations to meet the humanitarian needs of all those who will come to our country.  We may face other challenges in other parts of our economy.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has already indicated this evening that he will need to provide further support and interventions to those who work in our agricultural communities to help with the supply of food.  As we do our bit to work our way through the consequences of this war, we are still in an early phase.  There are very significant economic risks and they need to be recognised.  We need to ensure we make decisions that are sensible and can have an impact, but they must also be affordable to our country and we must be capable of sustaining them.</p><p>As I look at the need to sustain these measures, I am very conscious that when I talk about issues with regard to our national finances and the need for them to be sustainable, what will be motivating all Deputies in the House this evening as they speak on the resolution is the personal finances of the many people who are now affected by the rising cost of energy and the rising prices we are seeing in our garages and forecourts.  I also know what the changes in the cost of energy mean for many people who are in business, particularly those with smaller domestically owned businesses.  I acknowledge it is a particular issue for those in our haulage and transport sectors.  I also acknowledge that the rising price of energy is of great concern to those in our business community and that, for those pulling up at forecourts and garages, seeing the price of a tank of petrol or diesel going up and up is a cause of great concern.  I know it is a cause of much anxiety to many people.  I recognise that and want to play my part in making a difference in it.</p><p>The Government wants to play its part in alleviating some of the difficulties that many people are facing at the moment but, equally, I want to emphasise to Deputies this evening that the forces that are causing the changes in energy prices these measures are responding to arise from a war.  Changes were taking place in our economy and energy markets beforehand but they have been heightened beyond recognition by the consequences of a land war in Europe.  That is a development that is beyond the control of this Government.  We can play a role in helping our economy to deal with many of the consequences of it, we can help with those costs, we can offer support and we can make a difference but we cannot entirely insulate our economy, our business community and those who are concerned about the price of fuel from the changes that are taking place.  It is not possible for this Government or any other government to give a commitment to offset all of the costs that will arise because of the war taking place at the moment.  What we can do is make a difference and help.  That is what this motion aims to do.</p><p>In bringing this financial resolution before the D&aacute;il this evening, I am proposing a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction on auto diesel, with a proportionate 2 cent reduction in excise on marked gas oil.  The measures I am proposing to the House this evening are inclusive of VAT and will last until 31 August 2022.</p></speech>
