It is interesting that back in 2011, that figure was at 184.  These children feel isolated and anxious and they crave the security of their own home.  Those in hotels cannot even have their food cooked for them and, as the House will be aware, have to travel long distances to their schools.</p><p>Children with special needs in Ireland today are waiting far too long for an assessment of need, which is their legal entitlement.  Some 4,000 children are overdue an assessment under the Disability Act.  Access to therapists for children, which we know is key to early intervention and the full realisation of the potential of the child, is at an unacceptable level.  We know speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists can do an enormous amount to help children with special needs in particular, yet there are thousands on the speech and language waiting lists, covering assessment, initial treatment and further treatment, and thousands awaiting their first assessment for occupational therapy.  We know the impact an occupational therapist can have on a child with dyspraxia, for example, and on the parents also in terms of facilitating the progress of that child.  We do not have a comprehensive early education programme for the youngest of children aged from one to four - we simply do not have it.  We do not have access in any shape or form to multidisciplinary professionals for children with special needs aged between one and six.</p> <p> Too many children, some 4,000, are waiting for inpatient hospital treatment across the three Dublin children's hospitals and over 10,500 are waiting for outpatient appointments.  We know those delays compromise a child's health and have long-term repercussions.  Some 18,000 are waiting for orthodontic treatment, with 7,500 children waiting over two years for an appointment with an orthodontist.  In mental health, over 300 children are waiting over a year for access to child and adolescent mental health services and 1,600 are waiting more than a year for psychology appointments.  In our education system, NEPS is hopelessly understaffed.</p> <p> Children in difficulty or with complex needs in this country are simply not prioritised to the degree they should be.  That is a fact.  We have all met parents of children with special needs.  They have far too many hurdles to jump and too many battles to fight on behalf of their children, particularly in regard to health and education.  This is about priorities.  Children should not have to wait so long for a house, for assessments or for vital intervention services.  Does the Taoiseach accept the Government is failing these homeless children, children with special needs and children with mental health difficulties, and that far more needs to be done to alleviate these pressures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000004#B00200"><p>Today is International Children's Day, as Deputy Martin said.  Therefore, it is only fair to recognise the progress we have made in recent years, not just the shortcomings.  While it is right to acknowledge the shortcomings, it is wrong to ignore all the progress that has been made in recent years and in the last year.</p>  <p>  I will give some examples.  Real progress has been made in terms of educational outcomes for our children.  Education is the great leveller and we see real improvements in outcomes for children in education, particularly around reading and maths.  That is down to the excellent work in our schools but also down to the correct policies being pursued by Government and investment by Government over the last couple of years.  We have the lowest pupil-teacher ratio ever in primary schools this year for the kids attending those schools.  There is huge investment in special needs assistants, meaning there are more special needs assistants in our schools than ever before, recognising the enormous needs of children and the fact we need to make sure children with special educational needs get additional support.  There is also investment in preschool.  For the first time, all children are guaranteed two years of free preschool.  We know those early, formative years are the most important years in terms of determining how well kids do in life, which is why we have been so committed to expanding free preschool.</p>  <p>  In the area of health, the national children's hospital is at long last under construction.  That will be the mainstay for improvements to paediatric care across the country, including a new paediatric unit planned for Cork, which Deputy Martin will be aware of, and, as the first element of that, the new satellite centre at Blanchardstown is almost complete.  Free GP care has been extended so more children are able to attend their doctor or primary care physician without their parents having to pay.</p><p>It has been extended to all children under six years and in recent years to 40,000 children with severe disabilities who when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government might not have been granted a medical card because of their parents' income and would have faced regular reviews.  We have taken all of that away and guaranteed as of right that all children with severe disabilities will receive a medical card, regardless of their parents' income.  </p> <p> There will be a &euro;1 billion investment next year in mental health services.  If spent well, properly and efficiently, it will bring about real improvements in child and adult mental health services, CAMHS, particularly with the hiring of the socio-psychologist.  </p> <p> There has also been big investment in childcare services in the past year.  On mandatory reporting which has been long promised and which some people said would never become a reality, mandatory reporting of child abuse is now a reality.  The change has worked well because we had prepared for it and ensured Tusla was ready for it.  We have introduced universal subsidies for childcare which are paid to all parents of children aged between six months and three years without a mean test.  As announced in the recent budget, the affordable childcare scheme has been expanded.  As a result, low income families will receive more subsidies towards the cost of their childcare schemes, while more middle income families will qualify.  Next year middle income families earning up to &euro;100,000 will qualify for affordable childcare services.  </p> <p> The Deputy is right to point out that there many shortcomings and that there is a lot of work still to be done in improving the lives of children in Ireland, but it would be wrong not to acknowledge also the enormous progress made in recent years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000005#C00200"><p>Being homeless is not a shortcoming.  It is a devastating experience for a child, not a shortcoming.  Being the parent a three year old child who has yet to be assessed by an autism panel is not a shortcoming; it is a terrible, devastating position in which to be.  Being the parent of a young child with severe mental health difficulties and not being able to access services is not a shortcoming; it is a terrible situation for the mother and the child.  These are the living realities and experiences of many families throughout the country.  On International Children's Day, these are unacceptable experiences that too many children in this country are experiencing in the realm of special needs.  The lack of access to physiotherapists and speech, language and occupational therapists compromises forever a child's potential.  The inertia and lack of action in providing access to therapists are unbelievable, while the waiting lists are too lengthy.  In referring to these failings as shortcomings the Taoiseach displays a remarkable detachment from the hard reality of families' lives across the country.  Instead of the glossy brochures and the fancy launches, it is time that we got to grips with the real issues that affect too many families.  They represent a very sad indictment of Government policy to date in dealing with these issues.</p></speech>

I do not think we should play with words in dealing with these issues.  I would prefer if the Deputy offered solutions, rather than that sort of glib rhetoric.</p></speech>

We all acknowledge that these are terrible situations which people are in.</p>  <p>  With reference to children in emergency accommodation, the solution is housing supply.  This year 8,000 additional homes will be added to the social housing stock, more than half of which were built by local authorities and housing associations, with the others being acquired or leased.  Eight thousand is a big increase on the figures for previous years and 10,000 will be delivered next year.  We are also expanding the family hub programme which I know is not an alternative to a home, but we do know that families who spend time in family hubs tend to spend less than six months in them and tend to move on much quicker than those who are in hotels.</p></speech>

Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin will also be aware of what we are doing in the provision of speech and language therapy.  We are trying to change the model because we know that providing additional money and staff has not worked when it comes to therapies.  We are trying to change the model by investing in speech and language therapy services in schools to see if it works differently and better, provides quicker access and gives children the support the need.</p><p>As I said, I have no difficulty acknowledging there are terrible situations and failings.  I am also giving Deputy Martin the solutions and examples of the enormous progress that has been made in education, health and childcare in recent years.  I am sorry that on International Children's Day he cannot even bring himself to acknowledge any of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000006#D00200"><p>I see arriving into the Gallery some of the Stardust families who have handed in a petition today.  I extend a very warm welcome to them and wish them the very best in their campaign to reopen the inquest into that fire on St. Valentine's Day 1981.  T&aacute; f&aacute;ilte romhaibh.</p>  <p>  At the weekend, to rapturous applause, the Taoiseach made the bold claim that he would, if re-elected, deliver five years of tax cuts.  He did not couch his comments with the word "but" or explain to people that his plan was to give with one hand and to take back with the other.  However, this is exactly what we see with the latest announcement that tens of thousands of workers, many of them very low-paid workers, will lose their entitlement to claim flat-rate expenses.  This was confirmed in the response of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, an Teachta Pearse Doherty, last week.  We are talking here about a few bob that workers claim to cover the cost of equipment that they need for work, things like uniforms, tools and stationery.  We are not talking about wholesale tax breaks which, as the Taoiseach knows, others enjoy.  We are talking about very legitimate and necessary expenditure which certain categories of workers incur as part of their jobs.  Some 75,822 shop assistants, the group worst affected, will lose more than &euro;120 a year.  This will mean a net saving to the Exchequer of &euro;9 million per annum.  It is hardly a massive outlay.  Nonetheless, the loss of it for individual workers on low wages will be felt.  This entire proposal is a prime example of policy set at a complete disconnect from reality.  The high cost of living weighing down on ordinary workers cannot be tackled if the taxman snipes away at the very modest and necessary expenses they can claim.</p>  <p>  Let us contrast this with the Government's treatment of the super-rich.  As of this summer, there were nearly 500 high-wealth individuals who possess wealth in excess of &euro;50 million each.  In 2015 this cohort claimed a combined &euro;93 million in tax credits, a great multiple of what was claimed by low-paid workers.  Of this sum, &euro;45 million was claimed in capital allowances, mostly by landlords claiming tax relief on furniture.  The very rich can avail of &euro;93 million in tax reliefs, yet the Taoiseach wants to scrap the very small tax relief of a couple of euro a week for ordinary working people.  This is unbelievable.  Ending the tax break for banks would have brought in &euro;175 million; ending the tax break for multinational corporations, which onshore-----</p></speech>

The Revenue Commissioners have an ongoing review of concessionary flat-rate expenses.  The review is to ensure that the expenses granted are still justified and are appropriate to modern-day employment and work practices.  As a result, they said that certain flat-rate reductions for tax purposes may be withdrawn in certain sectors.  This would not have an effective date and would not take place before 1 January 2020 so it will have no impact on people's incomes next year and no impact on the budget announcements or budget calculations for 2019.</p><p>The Revenue is independent in the administration of the tax code and this issue relates to concessionary practices operated for ease of administration.  There will be no change to the general rule set out in legislation and all employees will still be able to claim deductions for valid expenses incurred to the extent not reimbursed by the employer.  While certain employees may no longer be able to get a deduction on a universal flat-rate basis, they will still be able to get a deduction on a specific vouched basis.  It is a move away from flat-rate expenses to a vouched basis and will not take effect until 1 January 2020, if at all.<br/><br/>I am certainly happy to clarify that for the Deputy.  I have seen some coverage which would give a very different impression as to what is happening.  I am interested to see that the Deputy once again returns to the theme of the super-rich and my priorities.  That causes me to ask a question about Deputy McDonald's relations with the super-rich and her priorities.  I read in the <i>Irish Independent</i>- I thought it was <i>Waterford Whispers News</i>at first but it actually was the <i>Irish Independent</i>- that on 11 November, on the day of the Armistice, when all of the party leaders here remembered the war dead and paid respect to those people who gave their lives in that war, when we that evening showed respect to our Constitution and inaugurated our President, Deputy McDonald was in New York.  She was hobnobbing with the super-rich at a $400 a plate lunch for her super-rich supporters.</p></speech>

This is the list of the categories of workers to which this flat-rate expenses scheme applies.  It includes people such as panel beaters, kitchen porters, nurses and members of the Defence Forces, whom we all know are appallingly paid at the lower ranks in any event.  The Taoiseach wants to create for these workers an elaborate system for them to vouch and claim very modest reliefs.</p>  <p>  Many of these workers will look into this Chamber, will have heard the words of the Taoiseach and will know that many of the expenses enjoyed in this Chamber are not vouched.  There is no such elaborate paperwork required.  The Taoiseach's answer simply amplifies his position.  A very different view is taken of the very rich, the very wealthy, the banks, the billion dollar corporates and the landlords.  Landlords claimed an astonishing figure of &euro;45 million in capital allowances and the lion's share of that was claimed for tax reliefs on furniture.</p></speech>

We hear it far too often.  We have already seen the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in exposed in her attitude to the Armistice and her attitude to our President and our Constitution.  She chose to hobnob with the super-rich in America at a $400 a plate lunch rather than respect the war dead or respect our President.  We see members of Sinn F&eacute;in trying to claim that somehow they can put themselves in the shoes of low-paid shop workers while we know for years and years they told porkies about their own salaries.  I refer to the false claim that they were living on the average industrial wage.

The note I have indicates that any change will not take effect until 1 January.  I will confirm that that is the case later today.  It is a move away from unvouched to vouched expenses.  At the same time in the Finance Bill we are clamping down left, right and centre on tax breaks and tax evasion.  It includes putting a limit on the special assignee relief programme, the exit tax, closing the double Irish and getting rid of concepts such as stateless corporations.</p></speech>

As the Government knows, many households are awaiting the delivery of high speed broadband.  Access to the Internet brings countless new opportunities and it is no exaggeration to say the Internet is shaping society in a variety of new ways.  Many people, especially young people, socialise via the Internet and for many, sharing their lives online has been completely normalised, although the technology was not available to the previous generation.  However, the Internet also has a dark side.  Young people are often in a phase of self-discovery at a time when they are involved in nearly continuous online activity.  We have repeatedly seen cases of older men using Internet websites to fool young people into sending intimate photographs of themselves or even arranging meetings, with frequent reports of sexual assault or even rape as a result. We also know that some people use the Internet to hurt others, for example, in the taking of revenge by putting up compromising photographs for the whole world to see.  There is growing evidence of a strong link between cyberbullying and the online harassment of young people and those young people indulging in self-harm and even suicide.  Ireland's teenage suicide rate is already among the highest in Europe.  Tragically, recent Central Statistics Office figures show that 20 to 30 young people die by suicide annually in Ireland.</p>  <p>  On 16 May 2017 the Labour Party's Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017 was passed on Second Stage in this House.  In a debate with cross-party support the Government pledged full co-operation to bring legislation through the House to regulate the area of online harassment and bullying.  Since May last year dozens more young people have tragically lost their lives by suicide.  Too often they were the victims of online bullying and harassment and many more are suffering today.  The legislation is urgently required.  We would happily accept any amendment from the Government side.  For example, as an Opposition party, we could not table a proposal to establish a digital safety commissioner, a concept everybody now supports.  It is possible to have these fundamental issues addressed in the coming weeks: we have waited too long.  My question is simple.  Will the Government facilitate the early enactment of this much-needed law?</p></speech>

We are very much in the process of implementing the national suicide strategy Connecting for Life which I was involved in putting together with the former Minister of State, former Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It is making a real difference.  I know that it is difficult to calculate these things, but we have seen an approximate 30% reduction in suicide rates overall in Ireland in the past couple of years.  In part, that is down to the additional resources given to the National Office for Suicide Prevention and additional investment in mental health services, but there are many other factors at play.</p><p> I do not know what the current status is of the particular legislation that the Deputy mentions.  I do not know if we have any principled objection to it, so I will have to check up on that.  I think we indicated in the past that we would support it, so I will have to check that out again and perhaps get back to the Deputy to see if we can progress it.</p></speech>

I have also spoken to the Attorney General directly on this matter.  Second Stage was passed a year and a half ago, which is a long time, yet there is urgency about regulating a sphere of activity that did not exist ten years ago.  Our law still references telephones and telecommunications but says nothing about protecting people using the Internet, which is so much more intrusive in everyone's life today.</p>  <p>  Regarding this bespoke legislation, which is to establish a digital safety commissioner to protect vulnerable people of all ages, but particularly young people, will the Taoiseach give his Government's commitment, if possible, to at least have the Bill passed by this House before the end of this session?</p></speech>

We certainly want to do that as quickly as we possibly can.  When it comes to the Internet and the worldwide web, what I can say is that the era of self-regulation is over.  Self-regulation has not worked for the Internet and the tech sector, and we need now to do more.  We need to make sure that whatever regulatory moves we make and whatever we put into place actually works and is effective.  We are very happy to work on a cross-party basis with Deputy Howlin and others to make that possible.</p></speech>

Those 48,000 signatures are the culmination of the heroic Truth campaign begun by the Stardust Relatives and Victims Committee, which has been courageously led over the years by Ms Antoinette Keegan, her mother Chrissie, Ms Gertrude Barrett, Ms Bridget McDermott and Mr. Eugene Kelly.  I welcome them all to the Public Gallery today.  We were accompanied by some distinguished Irish citizens, including the great musician Christy Moore, famous journalist Charlie Bird and many others.  I commend our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and especially Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, on her Trojan work with the committee on this campaign.</p><p>As the Taoiseach will remember, St. Valentine's Day 2019 will mark the 38th anniversary of the appalling Stardust nightclub tragedy.  The horrific death of 48 young and mostly teenage citizens and the serious injury to another 225 young people was the worst fire disaster in modern Irish history and still affects many people in my constituency of Dublin Bay North.  The families of these victims have never received justice or closure.  We have had a litany of reports, most recently that of the former judge, Mr. Pat McCartan, in late 2017.  For the past year, there has been a motion in my name on the cl&aacute;r of the D&aacute;il, supported by colleagues from Independents 4 Change, People Before Profit, Solidarity and Sinn F&eacute;in, rejecting Judge McCartan's report.</p><p>Why has the Taoiseach not met the Stardust committee and its solicitor, the distinguished human rights lawyer from Newry, Mr. Darragh Mackin, despite their many requests to meet him on the campaign to reopen the inquest?  The committee and its supporters have travelled the length and breadth of this country gathering signatures for the campaign.  The 48,000 cards are addressed to Mr. Woulfe and call for a new inquest.  They include the following statement:</p><blockquote>The original inquest into the tragedy was held in March 1982, just over a year after the fire, when little detail was known about the events of that night.  There is now much more detail which has exacerbated the rumour and suspicion surrounding the Stardust fire.  It is time for truth for the Stardust victims.  I call on you, as the Attorney General, to exercise your right under Section 24 of the Coroners Act 1962 to grant a fresh inquest as soon as possible.</blockquote><p>The Taoiseach may remember that, early in this D&aacute;il, I tabled a motion on establishing a new commission of investigation.  It was defeated in January 2017 when the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, lacked the courage and bottle to insist on a new commission and instead put us through the pointless McCartan exercise, which was a much shorter rehash of the earlier Coffey report of 2009.</p><p>Constituents ask why Mr. Justice McCartan did not consider new testimony from witnesses like Mrs. Brenda Kelly who saw flames shooting from the roof at 1.43 a.m., from notable investigations including the book by Mr. Tony McCullagh and Neil Fetherstonhaugh and RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s "Prime Time Investigates" programme on the twentieth anniversary or from other fire safety professionals and ordinary citizens who witnessed the fire.</p> <p> Does the Taoiseach support this campaign?  Does he agree that these families deserve truthful answers about what happened on that fateful night in 1981 and that they deserve justice and closure?  Will he meet them and determine how he can progress this matter?</p></speech>

Once again I wish to express my condolences to the families and friends of those who died in that terrible tragedy.  As the House will know there has already been an inquest and a full tribunal of inquiry into the Stardust tragedy.  We must respect the fact that there are differences of opinion among families as to whether they want this to be reopened.  I acknowledge the work of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Finian McGrath, on this issue.  He fought for and secured a commitment in the programme for Government to have the Stardust fire looked at afresh.  Former judge Mr. Pat McCartan, a former member of this House, carried out an inquiry.  He acted independently and found that there was insufficient evidence to merit a reopening of this inquiry.</p>  <p>  Under Article 30 of the Constitution, the Attorney General is the advisor to the Government in matters of law and legal opinion and has to exercise and perform all such powers, functions and duties under the law.  One of the statutory powers conferred by the Oireachtas on the Attorney General in section 24 of the Coroners Act is that of directing the holding of an inquest.  The Attorney General acts independently of Government in carrying out his or her role under this section and must do so in a manner that is impartial and fair to all.  Section 24 provides that where the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person has died in circumstances which, in his or her opinion, make the holding of an inquest advisable, he or she may direct the coroner to hold an inquest into the death of that person.  Where an inquest has already been held, which is the case here, and if a further inquest is to be granted, grounds would need to be set out for the holding of it.  It would be expected that any formal request for a new inquest would set out the grounds on which the request is based.</p>  <p>  KRW Law, the solicitors acting for the Stardust Relatives and Victims Committee, wrote to the Attorney General on 12 April stating that it was putting the Attorney General on notice of its intention to make a formal request to grant a new inquest into the Stardust deaths, pursuant to section 24 of the Coroners Act 1962.  The letter indicated that KRW Law will proceed to lodge an application on behalf of its clients in the forthcoming weeks.  This letter was acknowledged in a response from the Attorney General's private secretary.  However, no such application or formal request to grant a new inquest has been made to date.  In July and November of this year the Attorney General's office wrote to KRW Law noting that the Attorney General awaited the formal request under section 24 of the Coroners Act.  In the office's November letter, clarification was sought as to who was instructing the clients of KRW Law solicitors.  The office also asked for the grounds for any request to be stated.  In July the office also acknowledged the receipt of emails sent by an architect with technical information about fire safety standards.  The current position is that although the office has written to the solicitors on two occasions since receiving the initial letter on 12 April in anticipation of receiving a formal request, no such request under section 24 of the Coroners Act has been received.  However, I spoke to the Attorney General this morning and once the request is made, he will give it full consideration and will look at it afresh with an open mind.</p></speech>

Quite clearly under the Coroners Act, Mr. S&eacute;amus Woulfe has the power to order a second inquest and there is no doubt that the papers requesting that inquest, with detailed grounds, will be served on him in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In Northern Ireland a new inquest has been ordered on approximately 56 different occasions.  The inquest that was held into the Stardust tragedy dealt only with medical evidence of death and not with how the young people lost their lives.  The Attorney General can expect the request soon and I ask the Taoiseach to liaise closely with him.  It should be noted that the Stardust Relatives and Victims Committee, some of whom are in the Public Gallery today, have received strong support from the Hillsborough families and from the Justice for the 96 campaign.</p><p>Another striking feature of this morning was the massive support we received from the people of Derry and, indeed, there were some young women from Derry in The Stardust on that fateful night.  Of course, that is very striking because, as the Taoiseach knows, the original Bloody Sunday inquiry by Lord Widgery was a whitewash and was overturned by the Saville inquiry.  Is the Taoiseach committing to ask the Attorney General to grant and prioritise the holding of a new inquest and will he also commit to meet the committee and its solicitor, Mr. Macken?</p></speech>

That would be unfair to the very many people who request meetings in the normal way.</p>  <p>  It is within the power of the Attorney General, under the Coroners Act, to direct the holding of an inquest.  However, it is not an untrammelled or discretionary power.  There must be sufficient grounds for him to order a second inquest and, in doing so, he has to act independently of Government, so I cannot, nor should I, put undue pressure on him to do so.</p>  <p>  I did speak to the Attorney General this morning about it as I was aware that the protest was happening today, and he has confirmed to me that, once he receives a request under section 28 for a second inquest, he will give it full consideration and look at it afresh.</p></speech>

It is an excellent report and the former judge articulated well on it on "Morning Ireland" this morning.  He has recommended that publicly funded legal advice for victims in rape trials be considered.  Approximately six months ago, Fianna F&aacute;il, through our justice spokesman, Deputy O'Callaghan, introduced legislation in the D&aacute;il which seeks to afford legal representation to victims of alleged sexual offences.  Without question, we are agreed that there is a need for greater legal protections to be offered to complainants in cases of this nature.  Every victim should feel encouraged and adequately supported by the State to pursue justice.  It is disappointing that the Government has failed to get behind and rapidly progress this legislation.  Last June, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, said there would be a review of how rape cases were conducted in Ireland.  At that time, he made a firm commitment that he would bring forward a package of procedural and legislative changes by the end of summer.  We are now in November and we are yet to receive an update on this review.  Will the Taoiseach indicate where this review is?  When can we expect legislation in the House to deal with this issue?</p></speech>

I expect that it will be completed in its entirety by early next year or perhaps even by the end of this year.  A working group involving representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Courts Service and interested parties is being chaired by Mr. Tom O'Malley of the National University Ireland, Galway, who is a considered expert in this area.  The review covers the precise point raised by Deputy Martin.</p></speech>

Over the course of the weekend, I read that under the scheme women who worked in the laundries when they were girls under the age of 12 will be asked to provide evidence that they worked in these institutions.  That goes against the grain of everything that has been said repeatedly on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  It certainly does not represent anything compassionate and is causing terrible strife and anxiety.  I ask the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, if he will amend, change or revisit whatever part of the scheme or legislation that needs to be changed to ensure this impossible demand is not made of these women, who were only very young children at the time.</p></speech>

We have all been concerned since the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, about where we are going.  We understood there was to be a three week process to be led by Mr. Peter Smyth to evaluate whether the existing tendering process was sufficiently robust or if we needed to go back to scratch.  We understand Mr. Smyth's report has been received by the Attorney General and considered by the Government, but I understand a decision has yet to be made.  When will we see the report and when will we have clear views from the Government on how we are to proceed to ensure this vital facility will be provided?</p></speech>

It has to go through due process, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate.  It is with the Attorney General.  Parts of it may need to be redacted for commercial reasons and the people named in it have to be given an opportunity to comment or reply.  We anticipate publishing it as soon as possible.  I anticipate that happening in a matter of days, rather than weeks, but the report was not actually discussed by the Cabinet because we have to follow due process first.</p></speech>

I understand the Law Reform Commission is examining the questions of social media usage in court, contempt of court and so on.  It seems publication of the report has been pre-empted by Chief Justice Clarke who has announced the banning of the sending of text messages from and social media usage in court by all, other than so-called bona fide journalists.  It is extremely worrying and represents a restriction in the administration of justice in public and of the right to freedom of speech by giving a monopoly to report from court to bona fide journalists.  It seems to indicate that more attention is being paid to preventing the public from seeing what is going on in court than to the actual problem displayed in, for example, the Jobstown trial, with co-ordinated perjury by numerous garda&iacute;.</p></speech>

We have now found out that no full-time replacement has been acquired and that the standing consultant is leaving Bantry General Hospital.  This, coupled with the retirement of one of the two local injury doctors who has not been replaced either, raises serious questions about the Government's commitment to the hospital which is the most remote in Ireland and serves a vast area of west Cork and County Kerry.  We cannot sit idly by and allow it to be downgraded.  Will the Taoiseach give an honest assurance that both positions in Bantry General Hospital will be filled immediately by full-time replacements?</p></speech>

Apart from supply, the lack of affordable housing has been a crucial factor.  Despite years of promises by this and the last Government, we still do not have an affordable housing scheme, which is outrageous.  We regularly see, in the Dublin local authorities in particular, situations where there are umpteen sites that could be developed to provide social housing, especially affordable housing.  The sites are waiting to be developed and local authorities are ready to develop schemes.  There is a huge demand for affordable housing, yet we do not have any direction from the Department on the long promised affordable housing scheme.

Perhaps the Taoiseach will take a moment to check the record.  He may have misled the D&aacute;il a little while ago when answering a question from Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin on social housing.

That is what the Department has said.</p>  <p>  There is promised legislation on statutory regulation of approved housing bodies.  These are a key component to delivery on the housing crisis.  Since there is no statutory regulation in this area, the Minister does not know how many houses are being built by these bodies.  There is only a voluntary code of regulation in place.

The stock of social housing will increase by approximately 7,900 homes this year.  A little over half of those homes will be social housing homes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about approved housing bodies.  These bodies currently operate on a voluntary basis in terms of regulation with the Housing Agency.  That does not mean we do not have sight of what they are building.  They are part of our programme of delivery because we have gone not for one stream but for a number of different streams to deliver social housing.

As part of the programme for Government, there is a crystal clear commitment to maintaining our post office network.  It is true that in Dromod and Mastergeehy last night the talk was of another post office facing closure.  A total of 80 post offices face closure by the end of January and another 231 post offices are lined up for closure after that.</p> <p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>I am asking the Minister to act on the Private Member's motion that was passed in this House almost two years ago.  Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Independents all came together to support the motion.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the content of that motion is now adhered to in order to save many of those post offices.</p></speech>

The An Post mail centre in Cork, we are told, is now under threat of closure, with the potential loss of 200 jobs.  I am asking the Minister if he can confirm that that is the case.  It would have a devastating effect on postal services in the southern region.</p>  <p>  I also want to raise the issue of the promise that was made in respect of a new post office that was supposed to be tendered for in Kilworth, County Cork, which has not come on stream yet.  Does An Post intend to close the Cork mail centre, with the loss of 200 jobs?  We need confirmation on that.</p></speech>

There is huge concern about the potential closure of the mail centre in Portlaoise.  Some 250 people are employed there, and a further 40 or 50 seasonal jobs are available there during the Christmas period.  There is huge uncertainty around its future.  This issue has bounced around for two years.  There have been rumours about Athlone, Portlaoise and Cork.  We need clarity on this, and we need to know where the postal services are going in this country.  The mail centres are a vital cog in the wheel of that service.  If one is removed the mail services may be depleted.  The workers need certainty.</p></speech>

It is very worrying that there is a possibility that over 200 people will lose their jobs before Christmas.  The issue of new equipment was raised, but that will probably never happen now.  There will be no investment in Athlone and Portlaoise, never mind the Cork mail centres.  I did not want to bring it up here today because I respect people's privacy, but when the news breaks one has to be fair.  This is a very worrying thing, especially in the run up to Christmas.  Cork is such a big rural area, and if it is let it down in this manner it will be absolutely devastating.</p></speech>

It has had to take steps, including increasing the prices of stamps, among other things, to ensure that it can continue to deliver a service.  It has negotiated a settlement with the postmasters whereby some post offices will voluntarily close.  It has also developed a protocol under which it has given assurances that there will be a maximum distance that people will have to travel.  It is ensuring that pledge is honoured in the context of any closures that occur.  It also seeks to ensure that where other commercial outlets wish to continue to provide the service there will be an opportunity to do so.</p>  <p>  An Post has set up an independent review process, and communities can submit to that independent review.  There are two independent reviewers, and they will examine any submissions in that context.  I assure the Deputies that An Post will seek to ensure the very best delivery of service to its customers in a way that is consistent with being commercially viable.  It has a strong record of communication with its workforce, which it will continue to respect, but it has to develop plans that allow it to continue to be able to deliver on its mandate.  That is what it does as an independent body.</p></speech>

In that context, a review was carried out a couple of years ago by the company Lightfoot Solutions which proposed an upgrade of several ambulance services throughout the country and the provision of new ambulances.  I understand the 2019 service plan of the National Ambulance Service has been submitted to the Department of Health.  It calls for a new ambulance to be allocated in south Leitrim and north Roscommon and one to be assigned to the Inishowen area of County Donegal.  The plan aims to enhance services in these areas.  With other Deputies from my area, I have been talking for years about the huge problems we have experienced with delayed services.  This is very positive, but it needs to receive approval from the Department of Health.  Will the Taoiseach commit to ensuring it is approved and that we will have new ambulance services?</p></speech>

The different elements of the HSE will always request additional funding and the total amount requested will always exceed the total amount available.  The amount available for improvements in health services in 2019 is more than &euro;1 billion.  There is an extra &euro;1 billion available for health services next year.  I agree with the Deputy that we should make sure that money will go towards service improvements, that is, new and better services, not higher costs.  It will be up to the HSE and the Department of Health to develop the service plan.  I cannot make any commitment on any aspect of it today.</p></speech>

I want to talk about a report in the <i>Irish</i><i>Independent</i>on a whale that was washed up in Asian waters.  I argue that the contents of its stomach could be found inside any large sea animal washed up in Irish waters.  They included 115 plastic cups, two flip-flops, 13 lbs of trash, four plastic bottles, 25 plastic bags and more than 1,000 other items.  What plans does the Government have to clean up the waters around the Irish coastline, the Atlantic ocean and the Irish Sea, which, as the Taoiseach knows, are very much polluted with plastics, causing detrimental effects for the health of the fish that swim in them?</p></speech>

In total, the European Union releases about 200,000 tonnes of plastics into the oceans.  There is a serious problem throughout the Union which has decided in principle that it will introduce a ban on the use of single use plastics which will I hope become enforceable early in the new year.  Obviously, the directive has to be finalised, but it will give us the potential to introduce similar bans.  On microbeads, as the Deputy knows, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has the approval of the Government to introduce a Bill which it is hoped which will be passed before the end of the year.  On a wider front, we are seeking to dramatically increase our recovery and recycling of plastics and reduce the use of packaging.  We will publish targets to deliver these outcomes.</p></speech>

On the commercial broadband delivery front, we have dramatically expanded the availability.  It has gone, even since this Government's creation, from 50% up to 75%.  That is entirely commercial.  Those commercial outreaches still leave amber areas quite close to what is being delivered commercially but they remain the subject of the question of Deputy Dooley, which is the national broadband plan which is to deliver in the amber regions to more than 500,000 premises, both business and residential.</p>  <p>  A final tender after a lengthy process has been delivered to the Department in mid-September.  The evaluation of that is ongoing.  As the Taoiseach referred to earlier, there is also an audit by Mr. Peter Smyth on the process.  Both of those processes are at an advanced stage.  We are close to a point where it will be possible to bring to Government proposals for decision one way or the other.</p></speech>

It is quite straightforward.  It is one of a number of measures that have been introduced by the Opposition and that I have introduced on behalf of the Labour Party because of the exploitation of the thousands throughout the country who are all squeezed into the rental market and who are in desperate situations trying to find an affordable home for themselves.  This is merely one of the practices that we have heard and found out about, whereby those who are renting properties are requiring those who want to view them to pay in advance.</p><p>It is not the only exploitative practice in that area.  For example, as I raised previously in the D&aacute;il, we have heard of landlords requesting more than one month's deposit, in some cases two months or three months, to squeeze out certain categories of people and to make it impossible for those on low and medium incomes to be able to raise the kind of money required to get into a home in the first place before they even start paying the kind of exorbitant rents that we have heard about recently.  According to the recent <i>daft.ie</i>reports, the average rent is &euro;1,334 per month nationally and much higher than that in the Dublin region.</p><p>Another issue I have heard about is that some prospective landlords are looking for letters from the employer, in other words, squeezing out those who are unemployed, getting information about prospective tenants, and clearly trying to exclude certain people from access to the available accommodation.  There are so few places for rent that are affordable to those on average incomes that this is becoming more and more of a crisis.  This is one measure that my party would like to see introduced that would protect people from exploitation.</p><p>We heard yesterday about tenants being asked to share beds.  One website called the Dublin Rental Investigator, which is on Twitter, seeks out examples of situations where tenants are being asked to share beds and share bedrooms.  At a debate here last year, I gave the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, evidence he sought on a website in a foreign language that was directed at students and workers coming from South America and that asked them to share six, seven or eight persons to a room with bunk beds, with scarcely room for a person to squeeze his or her shoes in between them.</p><p>There is a series of such exploitative practices that are causing significant difficulty for those who are trying to rent in the private sector, not to mention the other issues that have been the subject of Private Members' Bills, from the Labour Party and, indeed, from other Opposition parties, looking for fair rent, security of tenure and control of rent increases.  We are not only talking about the current legislation of the Minister.  I am aware he intends to bring forward amending legislation.  The rent pressure zones only cover certain parts of the country.  Even where they provide cover, there are all kinds of loopholes.</p><p>There are a variety of issues arising for those desperate people who are queuing up for maybe one affordable apartment and for which there are dozens queuing.  Now those who are renting out those apartments are placing more and more obstacles in the way of people even viewing them or being able to pay deposits, and they are asking people to produce certain documentation that would exclude them from those homes.  For all of those reasons, I wish to see this Bill proceed through the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

The council analyses and reports on strategic policy matters relevant to Ireland's economic, social, environmental and sustainable development.  In accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006, I have certain functions, such as appointing the members of NESC, presenting reports to Government prior to publication or prior to laying them before the Houses, as in the case of the annual reports.  The council is funded through my Department&rsquo;s Vote and my Department also has governance responsibilities in regard to the council.</p>  <p>  NESC membership comprises representatives of business and employer organisations, ICTU, agricultural and farming organisations, community and voluntary organisations and environmental organisations, together with heads of Departments and independent experts.  This composition means it plays an important and unique role in bringing different perspectives from civil society together with Government.  It helps NESC to analyse the challenges facing Irish society and to develop a shared understanding among its members of how to tackle these challenges.</p>  <p>  The most recent NESC reports are Urban Development Land, Housing and Infrastructure: Fixing Ireland's Broken System and Moving from Welfare to Work: Low Work Intensity Households and the Quality of Supportive Services.  I have brought both reports to Government in advance of publication.</p>  <p>  The council has recently adopted a work programme for the year to September 2019, comprising three themes, namely, housing and land: transport-led development; social insurance and the welfare system: towards a sustainable developmental welfare state; and climate change and low carbon transition.</p>  <p>  A Programme for a Partnership Government specifically notes there are policy challenges where long-term thinking is required.  I hope and trust the council will continue to contribute to policy development, with a focus on the strategic and longer-term view.</p></reply>

I know one of the main areas of the work of NESC is in this arena.  Last week the European Parliament approved four of the eight proposals comprising its clean energy package for 2020 to 2030.  The directives in question originally had binding renewable energy targets in place for each EU member state to achieve but, regrettably, national targets have been removed in favour of an overall EU-wide target.  Under the current 2020 targets, the State faces hefty fines for not meeting our 20% energy efficiency and 16% renewable energy targets.  Our current shift to renewable energy is not even touching 10%, which we should regard as an abject failure.  Without a binding target for 2030, where is the incentive for us to make real, significant changes in respect of climate change policy?</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Network Europe has reported in the past that Ireland has played a negative role in climate change negotiations, so it is possible, if not probable, that the Government played a part in removing national targets during negotiations on the important directives agreed just last week.  The Taoiseach might enlighten us as to the Government position on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000018#Q00800"><p>As the Taoiseach rightly said, NESC is an important forum where workers' representatives, through their trade unions, meet employers' groups and Government.  Over the years it has done an amount of important background research work that informs national policy on areas like public housing and so on.  The set of priorities the Taoiseach has indicated for NESC into the future includes, as Deputy McDonald said, the whole issue of climate change.  I said recently at our party conference that this is one of the moral imperatives of our time.  I genuinely believe that public opinion is light years ahead of opinion in this House, and certainly ahead of opinion within the Government, which talks the talk but, in terms of actually achieving the targets, is pitifully bad.</p>  <p>  We will not meet our 2020 target and there is no rescuing that at this stage.  However, it is also highly likely that we will not meet our 2030 target, which would be shameful, not only because it is an indictment of this generation and the whole issue of generational solidarity, but also because, economically, it is hugely damaging to us.  We will have to make those changes to become a carbon neutral economy.  The longer we delay the achievement of those targets, the more expensive it will be, because the fines that will accrue to the State will be extremely severe at that stage.</p>  <p>  In terms of the work programme of NESC to inform the Government, will the Taoiseach make it clear in terms of national priorities on the economy and social policy that climate change is a priority, and that carbon reduction and carbon abatement will be practically implemented as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

I ask this because it will explain to him what those of us who will be marching for emergency action on the housing and homelessness emergency on 1 December want and the sort of radical change in policy we are looking for.  What the NESC report does is set out examples of what is done in places like the Netherlands and Austria.  The contrast with the policies the Government has pursued on housing is stark in the extreme.  It points out that in Amsterdam, for example, 80% of zoned building land is in the hands of the state, which does not sell it.  Some 30% of Dutch housing stock is social housing, which contrasts with 5% here because of the failure of the Government to build social housing.  In Austria, between 2000 and 2014, the austerity years when Irish Governments slashed housing budgets, helping to generate the current housing crisis, the Austrians did the exact opposite.  Between 28% and 36% of all housing built in Austria in that period was social housing.  It is extraordinary.  In the period when we stopped building social housing, more than 30% of all of their housing output was social housing.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach see the point?  The Government is selling off public land and allowing the private market to dictate, and we have a disaster.  However, in other countries of Europe land is kept in public use, strict land management policies apply and a large amount of social housing is built.</p></speech>

Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to have a conversation with NESC members or to address or meet them recently?  Has he asked, for example, about the affordable housing scheme that was launched with great fanfare by the Government under Rebuilding Ireland?  A recent report shows that, of 1,000 applications, only 60 loans were drawn down, and only 20 loans were drawn down in the city of Dublin.  We are talking about people who have a joint income of about &euro;75,000 or an individual income of &euro;50,000, for example, skilled tradespeople towards the beginning of their careers.  They are being turned down for these loans which the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government launched as a cornerstone of housing recovery.</p>  <p>  I happen to agree with the Minister that affordable housing is critical to solving the housing crisis.  With all of the expertise that is available from NESC, has the Taoiseach taken the opportunity to have a conversation with NESC as to why, under the Government's housing policy, ordinary people with decent jobs and an income which has passed the test are unable to get affordable housing, in the way their mothers and fathers could get affordable housing?</p>  <p>   Deputy Mary Lou McDonald: One of those key lnog-term challenges that rqeuires long-term planning is climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy.

It is great on the public promotion, but the report shows that its policy is producing minute numbers, with only 60 of the 1,000 promised produced.  How can anyone stand over that?</p></speech>

However, it is not clear if its work is having any impact at political level in government.  The council has presented its work, and that of conference speakers, on how to achieve a more sustainable impact on rough sleeping, for example, and land use.  Two weeks ago, a man sleeping rough in a public park approximately a mile and a half from here became the 27th person to die on the streets of Dublin in less than a year and a half.  In response, the Minister of State for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, claimed that enormous progress is being made and that there will be no issue with the number of beds in this area this winter.  This was quickly followed by Fr. Peter McVerry's statement that there are more rough sleepers today than there were last year.  He pointed out that the Government continues to miss the fundamental point that beds for rough sleepers would be only used if people feel they would be safe accessing the service.  In regard to the Government's most recent claims, he said: "I don't see any evidence of them learning."  Does the Taoiseach disagree with Fr. McVerry's point that many homeless people are reluctant to access beds because they are concerned for their safety?  Is there not something terribly wrong that people would rather risk sleeping rough than access or enter some of our services?  Is the Taoiseach confident that the policies and services are in place to stop this unprecedented level of deaths on the streets of our capital city, in particular this winter?</p></speech>

Rather than having an outside agency telling us what to do, we need to use existing resources.  The secretariat of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, could and should have a key role in advising the Taoiseach's Department on its work to tackle climate change.  As I understand it, the Taoiseach wants to see an initiative like the action plan for jobs, which is run by his Department, for climate change, which makes sense.  The NESC 2012 report on how to get a circular iterative approach to address this issue could give real practical advice and assistance to the Department of the Taoiseach in that regard.</p>  <p>  Beneath that, we should give further resources to the Climate Change Advisory Council, chaired by Professor John FitzGerald, to improve the council's work.  As recently set out in legislation from this side of the House, we need a just transition commission to assist the members of the National Economic and Social Council in dealing with transition difficulties.  We also need a green investment bank and to change the delivery board for the national development plan, which is chaired by the Secretaries General of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government, to a delivery board for a climate development plan, co-chaired by the Secretaries General of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The NESC secretariat has a critical role to play in co-ordinating this work.  I commend this approach to the Government.</p></speech>

I imagine it was handled by either the former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, or the current Minister, Deputy Richard Burton, or perhaps by their respective officials.  The advantage of EU-wide targets is that they allow for burden-sharing.  In other words, where some countries are doing well and others are not the targets can be offset against each other.  One country might meet its targets in one area but not in another area and another country may meet its targets in the latter area but not in the first area, in which case the targets can be offset against each other.  Often these negotiations are done through the big blocs, with the EU negotiating on behalf of all of us with China, India, America and so on.</p>  <p>  CO2 emissions are lower than they were notwithstanding a significant increase in population but we are nowhere near close to reaching our target of a 20% reduction by 2020.  With the reduction likely to be closer to 1%, it is evident that we will not reach our 2020 targets but I do think we will meet our 2030 targets.  I am determined that we should do so for renewable energy and CO2 emissions.  Project Ireland 2040, by way of investment in energy -renewables and grid - transport and the insulation of homes and public buildings, will bring us about one third of the way towards this achievement.  Other measures will make a difference too.  For example, a carbon tax, if we get it right, can make a difference, as can other changes.  We need to put them all together, particularly changes in agriculture.</p>  <p>  On the NESC report on land management, I have read it.  It is a very good report, which informed the Government decision to establish the land development agency, LDA, which is modelled on similar agencies in The Netherlands and Austria.  The LDA follows on from the successes of the models in The Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Austria and its purpose, as the House will be aware, is to develop publicly owned land for housing of all sorts, including social, cost rental and private housing because housing of all types is needed in Ireland.  The LDA is also tasked with acquiring privately owned land and other land banks that may be developed and zoned into the future, which flows from the advice of the NESC report and is in line with the model in The Netherlands.  The LDA staff have visited The Netherlands to examine its model with a view to replicating it here.  Cost rental is huge in Vienna.  The House will be aware that the first cost rental project is being developed on Emmet Road.  It follows the Austrian model.  The LDA is modelled on The Netherlands model - a Government agency taking a much more active role in developing housing and acquiring and putting together land banks for development.</p>  <p>  We estimate that in 2018, excluding ghost estates that are being brought back into use, student accommodation and reconnections of abandoned homes, approximately 18,000 new homes and apartments will be built in Ireland.  We know 5,000 alone were built in the last three months.  Of those, 4,000 are social housing, that is direct builds by local authorities and affordable housing bodies.  This indicates that in terms of new build this year between 20% and 25% are social housing, which is the percentage of social homes for which Members opposite have been advocating.  This is where we are at this year.  We are just not there in terms of quantum.  We want to get to a build of 35,000 per annum, of which 10,000 to 12,000 or between one quarter and one third will be social-public housing.  I am sure Deputy Boyd Barrett will be horrified to hear that what he is describing is Fine Gael policies.</p></speech>

However, a new count is due soon and I have no idea what the outcome of it will be.  We all understand that rough sleeping is a complex social phenomenon.  It is not just about housing, it is also about mental health, addiction, alcohol, drugs and family break-up.  Often, people have been in trouble with the law and many are non-EU migrants as well.  It is a very complex social problem.  These are people with enormous needs who need a lot of help.  I had the opportunity to visit Merchant's Quay last night to get a better feel for the kind of services it provides and to meet some of the people who use those services, many of whom are rough sleepers.  When one gets a feel for the diversity of people who sleep rough - I have also been out with Safetynet to meet people who are sleeping rough, living in tents and so on - and when one gets a feel for the individual stories one understands why they may not wish to accept a bed or accommodation.  There are lots of different reasons for it, which are individual reasons in different circumstances.</p><p>However, we are doing a lot of work with Peter McVerry Trust on Housing First, which is a programme whereby we assist rough sleepers into housing and give them wrap-around supports so they are able to hold onto the housing.  We know that when many rough sleepers get an apartment or other accommodation, for various reasons they are not able to hold onto it.  We have seen a lot of success with Housing First.  If housing is provided to people who have been sleeping rough and the supports around them continue to be provided, there is a much better chance they will stay in their housing.  This is a partnership we have with Peter McVerry Trust and, I think, Focus Ireland, and it has worked very well.</p></speech>

The programme pledges to "reduce the percentage of patients waiting longer than six hours in emergency departments from 32% currently to less than 7% by 2021, and reduce average Patient Experience Times for patients attending emergency departments and average waiting times for appointments, procedures and diagnostic tests across the health service".  I do not have time to go into all the details of each of these sections, but in every single case we are going backwards, not forwards.  I now deal with cases in which people get appointments in the south east four years hence.  I raise these cases with the Department constantly.  Even getting accurate information from the Department and the HSE is becoming increasingly difficult.  Reports we now get from various sources claim that hospitals are being instructed to cancel elective surgeries to bring down waiting lists to make people believe that the waiting list problem is being resolved.</p>  <p>  I will ask the Taoiseach a very direct question which should have a very direct answer.  Is there an instruction to hospitals emanating from Government - from the Department of Health, the Taoiseach's Department or any other Department - to reduce waiting times and hospital trolley figures by cancelling elective surgeries?  Is this or is this not a fact?</p></speech>

Whereas the toing and froing - it seems to me like a sham battle between Fine Gael and its partners in government, Fianna F&aacute;il - might be depicted as a matter for themselves, it has implications for the entirety of the D&aacute;il and, more importantly, for policy delivery and for the people who elect us.  I have no doubt that the Government's progress report, should it arrive in May of next year, will reflect that the housing and health chaos and crises continue.  Of course, if the Taoiseach were thoughtful about these matters, he might take a few steps back and figure out that this is because the policies the Government is pursuing are simply the wrong ones.</p>  <p>  I hope the progress report in May 2019 will not reflect the current state of play, which is that one of the measures in the programme for Government that I actually support, namely, the commitment to recognise the state of Palestine, still has not been met.  This is despite the fact that, as the Taoiseach knows, in 2014, a Sinn F&eacute;in motion was passed in the House in which we resolved that such recognition would be delivered.  The Seanad, I should add, likewise passed such a motion.  Here we are, however, in a state of splendid inertia on the part of the Taoiseach's Government and nothing has happened.  I did hear the T&aacute;naiste a number of weeks ago float the notion of Middle East peace talks here in Ireland, possibly in January.  As the Taoiseach knows, Israel has boycotted previous attempts such as these, but he might enlighten us as to the current state of play in this regard.  Whether the Government is ever serious at all about recognition of the state of Palestine or whether it will remain in its state of splendid inertia remains to be seen.  In this regard the Taoiseach might let us know if the confidence and supply agreement between Deputies Martin and Varadkar will remain in place.</p></speech>

It stated, "Full regard will be had to any new evidence which emerges which would be likely to definitely establish the cause of the fire at Stardust".  The reason the Stardust families have had to go to the lengths of collecting 48,000 postcards appealing to the Attorney General is that the Taoiseach's Government has failed on this promise in the programme for Government to have regard to evidence that has been provided and gathered by the families.  Thirty-seven years on, they are still fighting and are now having to go to the Attorney General because the Taoiseach's Government failed on a promise to take into account evidence gathered by them which suggests that the real cause of the fire was completely different from the causes claimed in the official reports.  This evidence has been provided and I do not understand why the Government will not look at it, acknowledge it and give the families what they are asking for, which is an independent commission of investigation into the real causes of the fire so they can finally get truth and justice.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach not pass the buck but rather answer the families.  Why has this not been done?  A desktop report by Pat McCartan was not what they asked for.  It did not look seriously at the new evidence they had provided, evidence that is staring the Government in the face, about the fire having started earlier in the roof space, eyewitness reports, maps of the Stardust building used in the original inquiries that were completely inaccurate and many other things I do not have time to mention.  This evidence has been provided.  Why will the Government not look at it and give the families the commission of investigation they have asked for?</p></speech>

The fight against climate change was relegated by the previous Government and there has been little more than lip service since.  When Commissioner Phil Hogan was a Minister, he led the charge when Fine Gael came out of the 2011 election and climate change policy went backwards.  I was interested to hear yesterday on the "Six One" news the Minister, Deputy Bruton, say he will announce an action plan for climate change.  This is very worrying because we all know that when the Government says it will have an action plan for something, it means more claims of action rather than any reality of action.  What the Taoiseach said earlier is extraordinary.  He said we will not make our 2020 targets but will make our targets for 2030.  He is getting fairly benign media treatment on this issue because it is an extraordinary story of failure.  I understand there was a memo before Cabinet this morning about the purchase of carbon allowances.  They will cost somewhere between &euro;96 million and &euro;500 million, perhaps on the lower end of that scale - I do not know.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could enlighten the House as to how much it will cost the State to pay fines to buy carbon credits in order that we can make some effort to meet our targets for 2020.</p><p>The Taoiseach is in a position to outline how much he thinks can be afforded in tax giveaways for the next five years, so surely he or the Government has some idea as to how much it will cost to purchase carbon credits or pay the fines we may face as a result of our failure to meet our climate change targets by 2020.  That failure is dramatic.  Instead of going downwards, our carbon emissions are going upwards in every sector, from transport right across.  This represents a monumental failure on the Government's part.  It is not good enough to state we will get there by 2030.  That is 12 years away, when it will be the next generation's issue.</p></speech>

I think he may have been mixing up patient experience times in accident and emergency departments and waiting times and waiting lists for people who are waiting for an operation or a special appointment.  Those figures are collated independently by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  The numbers of people waiting for hip, cataract, eye, knee and similar operations as well as angiograms and similar types of procedures have been falling for well over a year.</p>  <p>  The figures I tend to look at are for those waiting for more than three months.  There will always be tens of thousands of people waiting for a procedure for four, six or eight weeks.  That is also the case for people who go private and it is certainly the case in any public health service across the world.  For this reason, the figure I tend to look at is for those waiting more than three months.  That figure has gone down from more than 60,000 in July 2017 to about 48,000 now.  I may not be 100% accurate because I do not have the figures in front of me.  We know, however, that the average waiting time for those operations and procedures is now less than six months.  Much progress is being made in respect of operations and procedures.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, there is a long-standing protocol in the health service that when emergency department overcrowding reaches a certain point elective operations and procedures are cancelled or not scheduled in the first place.  This is often the case during the busiest period.</p></speech>

The number of people waiting more than three months to see a specialist is now more than 350,000.  However, the number of missed appointments is 500,000.  The slots are available but they are not being filled.  I know it is not as simple as that but this demonstrates the efficiency problem we have in managing the waiting lists.  We need to do a big job on that and we will give the NTPF the job of centrally managing waiting lists into the future.  It has done a good job on operations and procedures, on which I outlined the figures, through a combination of outsourcing and insourcing.  People forget that the NTPF now acts as a commissioning agent and pays public hospitals to do much of this work, often on Saturdays and during the evening time.</p>  <p>  On recognising Palestine, the programme for Government position is that we support the recognition of Palestine as an independent state but we will do that in the context of there being a two-state solution.  Unfortunately, that is not yet the case.  We stand together with our western European partners in believing that is the best context in which to recognise Palestinian statehood.  Sweden acted unilaterally and decided to recognise Palestine on its own, as it is absolutely entitled to do.  Other western European countries have decided that we should do that in the context of there being a two-state solution, which is not yet the case.  It would be more powerful for western European countries to do this together rather than individual countries doing it on their own.  </p>  <p>  On the question on the Stardust fire and the programme for Government, as I mentioned, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, secured a commitment in the programme for Government that this matter would be examined.  A former judge and Member of this House - I do not know him personally but I know he is held in high esteem by the vast majority of Members - was given that work to do.  He examined the matter and the evidence presented and issued his report.  He took the view that the evidence presented was not sufficient to warrant further inquiries.  There is now a request for a new inquest.  I explained earlier in the House the procedures as to how that could happen.  That is a decision for the Attorney General acting independently of Government.</p></speech>

These staffing levels are in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's instructions on ministerial appointments for the 32nd D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The special advisers working in my office provide briefings and advice on a wide range of policy matters, as well as performing other functions as I may direct from time to time.  They also liaise with other special advisers in each Department so that I remain informed on developments across Government.   The details are as follows.  Brian Murphy is chief of staff.  John Carroll is head of policy and programme Implementation.  Patrick Geoghegan is special adviser mainly on research and speech writing.  Angela Flanagan, Philip O&rsquo;Callaghan, Clare Mungovan and Jim D&rsquo;Arcy are the other special advisers.</p>  <p>  In addition, the newly appointed Government Chief Whip has two special advisers.  Special advisers are also working with the Minister of States, Deputies Helen McEntee and Paul Kehoe.  Those special advisers are employed by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence, respectively.  Excluding politically appointed staff, 23 staff currently hold senior positions in my Department, namely, those defined as at the grades of principal officer and above.  Of these positions, 13 or 57% are held by men and ten or 43% are held by women.</p>  <p>  In line with action 8.5 of the Civil Service action plan, my Department has in place a gender balance action plan.  As part of this, my Department has committed to 15 actions to improve gender balance, including further flexible working arrangements and actions and that the gender balance of the nominees for the talent management programme is at least 50:50.</p></reply>

He said he would reorganise Cabinet committees to make them more dynamic, but it has since been revealed that they rarely meet, irrespective of the urgency of the issues involved.  The health reform committee is almost dormant, while the committee responsible for broadband has met once this year.  We all know what happened on that issue before a meeting was scheduled for this week.  The Taoiseach also said he wanted to align the Department closely with Government policy priorities, but in practice this simply meant a major increase in resources for marketing.  He indicated that he would ensure his team of advisers would see to it that active progress would be made in dealing with priority issues.  Will he explain if he is happy with the level of engagement by his staff and the Department on health issues?  Some years ago the Department took a formal role in overseeing budgetary restraint in the Department of Health, but given the record Supplementary Estimates required to keep that Department going, is the Taoiseach satisfied with how it is operating?  Will he explain how he ensures the Department stays closely engaged on housing and major infrastructural projects such as broadband provision?</p></speech>

There were hundreds of aerial attacks in each direction, causing the deaths of eight people.  In addition, very large numbers of civilians on both sides had to spend hours in shelters.  Hamas knows only too well the response that is likely to come from Israel when it fires hundreds of rockets into Israel.  I have said over and over again that terrorism and violence will not achieve a lasting peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians.  In view of the potential for a further escalation, I was relieved an effective ceasefire was quickly re-established and commend all those who were instrumental in achieving it, notably Egypt.  I hope it will allow progress to be made towards a more durable truce.</p><p>These events strongly reinforce what I have stressed in all of my discussions on Gaza, both in the region and at European Union and international level at the United Nations.  So long as the position in Gaza is allowed to fester, the outbreaks of violence, each one threatening to be bigger and more destructive than the last, are likely to recur.  The blockade is inhumane and should be ended.  All parties need to consider and attempt ways to change the dynamic and break the cycle, including on the Palestinian side and in the context of reconciliation, to allow for the prospect of a Palestinian authority to govern Gaza in the future.  Conscious as I am of the particular needs of Gaza, Ireland is advancing specific projects on educational scholarships and power infrastructure to contribute to humanitarian efforts there.</p><p>My intention to hold a small ministerial retreat-style meeting in Dublin relates to the overall Middle East conflict and peace process, rather than specifically to Gaza, although the two are, of course, interlinked.  I have had a largely positive reaction to the idea from Ministers and others with whom I have discussed it and I am proceeding to see if such a meeting can be arranged for early in the new year.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The intention is to hold a meeting away from the spotlight to allow for off-the-record reflection and the sharing of ideas.  I do not wish to say much more about the event at this stage, pending consideration of an agenda with other potential participants.</p></speech>

The ceasefire to which the T&aacute;naiste refers which was brokered by Egypt and Qatar is pretty uneasy.  It comes against a backdrop of the Israeli Minister for Defence, Mr. Avigdor Lieberman, resigning from the Israeli Government and accusing the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, of capitulating to terror.  It demonstrates how precarious is the position.  In the past year alone we have seen protests along the Gaza border, the passing of the nation state law, the ongoing expansion of the illegal settlements, the United States moving its embassy to Tel Aviv, the cessation of funding for UNWRA, the closing of the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington DC and an increase in violence.  All the time, this much vaunted peace initiative that we await just has not materialised or does not seem to be any nearer.  There is no progress being made.  I referred to the visit of Palestinian President Abbas to Ireland.  I know that the T&aacute;naiste was cut off because of time, but will he expand a little on the discussions he had with EU and Arab leaders on the holding of the peace meeting in Dublin?</p></speech>

Like many others, I await a new peace initiative led by the United States and it will only have a chance of success if there are a number of countries involved in the negotiations that may follow and if the content of the initiative is fair to both sides.  There must be equality of esteem between Israelis and Palestinians in the negotiations that we all hope can result in a lasting peace deal.</p><p>Time and again we have seen political decisions leading to reactions that have made the tensions between Israel and Palestinians more difficult, for example, the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the moving of the US embassy to Jerusalem, the cutting of funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees in the Near East, UNRWA, and the closing of a Palestinian office in Washington.  Ireland wants to introduce some new thinking and bring together a number of Arab Foreign Ministers and the Palestinian leadership, as well as several EU Foreign Ministers who are involved and interested in there at least being discussions.  We hope to be able to do this in January in Dublin.</p></speech>

What has been the feedback from the people to whom the Minister has spoken - Palestinian and Arab representatives and the Minister's colleagues across Europe - in trying to co-ordinate the meeting?  Will he give us an insight into their reaction to the idea he has mooted?  It is, of course, more than an idea.  Is any effort being made at EU level to pursue the two-state solution?  Is anything happening at EU level in that regard?  Whoever we talk to has the feeling the situation is drifting in a state of abeyance.</p></speech>

What I can say is I have spoken to a number of Arab Foreign Ministers, including those of Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon, and the Arab League.  I have also spoken to a number of EU Ministers, primarily the French Minister but a number of others, too.  I have spoken to the US side.  I have a good relationship with a person by the name of Jason Greenblatt who is involved in helping to put together a US initiative with Jared Kushner and others.  Ireland is not trying to make a secret of this.  We are an interested party that wants to be constructive and bring some new thinking to a situation that has seen so many negatives stacked up in the past 12 months, in particular.  There is justification for greater EU involvement in a constructive way.  I do not believe that, at the end of a meeting such as this, we will have any declaration or demand.  Instead, we want to have a meeting at which people will be able to speak freely without the pressure of the media spotlight and talk about new approaches to get people around the negotiating table to try to create some positive momentum.  I will happily brief the Deputy in more detail, if he likes.</p></speech>

Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>  <p>  This is an extraordinarily tragic situation.  The Yemeni people have suffered over three years of unrelenting conflict and are in the midst of the world's largest humanitarian crisis.  While I am glad to say recent weeks have seen indications that a ceasefire could finally be in prospect, there has also been an alarming increase in fighting around the port of Hodeidah which is a lifeline for imports into Yemen.  My EU colleagues and I discussed the situation in Yemen at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday.  We reconfirmed our strong support for the efforts of the UN special envoy, Mr. Martin Griffiths, and hope he will succeed in convening peace talks in Sweden by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The humanitarian crisis has a number of interlocking causes &ndash; historical underdevelopment, economic collapse, reducing the ability to buy available food, and delays in the distribution of commercial and humanitarian supplies, both in ports and at in-country checkpoints.  Since the conflict began, Ireland has advocated relentlessly for free access for humanitarian aid and commercial goods.  Any necessary security check must avoid causing blockages or delays that have a humanitarian impact.  I reiterated directly to the Saudi ambassador when I met him last month the importance Ireland attached to humanitarian access.  My officials have also made this point strongly to the embassy of Iran, in view of that country's close relationship with the Houthis and the serious delays in deliveries in Houthi-controlled areas.  I call again on all parties to the conflict to prioritise access for humanitarian aid and essential commercial goods such as food and medicines.  Ireland has provided almost &euro;16.5 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance for Yemen since 2015.</p>  <p>  While there have been calls for an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia and there was a discussion on the matter at EU level yesterday, there is no consensus at EU level as a whole.  For now, Irish efforts are concentrated on ensuring the effective implementation of export control regimes and the implementation of the 2014 arms trade treaty.</p></speech>

Aid organisations state the blockade of Hodeidah port by the Saudi-led coalition for the past three years is the main factor contributing to the famine.  Essentially, the coalition is targeting the port and food as part of the ongoing war.  The port which handles 90% of Yemen's imports has been closed by the Saudi military coalition.  Responsibility for the humanitarian crisis falls completely at the feet of the Saudi regime.  We have seen how it uses its military might to bomb civilian areas, infrastructure, homes and even school buses.  Data collected by Al Jazeera and the Yemen Data Project show that 18,000 air raids have been carried out in Yemen since 2015 by the Saudi and UAE-led military coalition.  Almost one third of all bombing missions struck non-military sites, yet Britain and the United States alone have sold weapons worth more than $12 billion to Saudi Arabia since it entered the war.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the calls for an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia because of these war crimes.  Does he support the calls made?  I heard what he said about other countries, but what is Ireland's position?</p></speech>

It is an EU competence.  A number of member states spoke yesterday to make the point that, even though they had sold arms to Saudi Arabia in the past, they had a policy of not selling arms to countries currently involved in conflict and, therefore, were not continuing to sell to Saudi Arabia.  I do not believe there is the capacity to reach consensus on an EU position because any one member state could prevent it.  While this affects the possibility of reaching a collective EU position on an arms embargo, there is an opportunity that the European Union needs to take in applying as much influence as it can at UN level where, to its credit, the United Kingdom is leading within the UN Security Council and other EU countries are supporting discussions that can lead to a permanent ceasefire.  There are indications from the Houthi side that that is what it is willing to accept.  It is why there is now a prospect of talks taking place in Sweden before the end of the year which we hope will be substantive.  There has not yet been confirmation that both sides will turn up to those talks, but that is the hope.  For the first time in many months, there is a realistic prospect of a lasting ceasefire, on which we need to focus.</p></speech>

The last round of peace talks collapsed in September but by all accounts, the Saudi-backed Government and the Houthi rebels have recently shown a renewed commitment to work on political solutions.  I note the recent statement from the Houthi commander expressing a willingness to bring an end to drone and missile strikes by his forces and a readiness to move towards a wider ceasefire if the Saudi-led coalition wants peace.  Is Ireland providing support for these peace moves?</p></speech>

That said, we are a very active commentator and are part of the debate and conversation at an EU level.  I made it very clear to Ms Federica Mogherini yesterday that countries like Ireland want detail on what is happening in a timely manner and all EU countries will get that information now.  The truth is that if a ceasefire is achieved and lasts, that will be just the start of the story.  A reconstruction and humanitarian assistance effort will be required in Yemen that will present enormous logistical challenges.  Countries will have to contribute towards that and Ireland will certainly do so.  As I said, we have already contributed over &euro;16 million to humanitarian assistance linked to the war in Yemen and I suspect we will contribute a lot more.</p></speech>

This is a very significant and welcome breakthrough in the Brexit process.  An extraordinary European Council summit will be held on Sunday, 25 November so that the agreement, together with the political declaration, can be endorsed.  The political declaration will be a much bigger document by then.  A preparatory meeting of the EU General Affairs Council, which I attended, was held yesterday.</p><p>The EU and UK negotiators have worked intensively over a long period to achieve this and I offer them all my congratulations and thanks for the work they have done.<font color="#002041">  I</font>n particular, Michel Barnier and his team have demonstrated extraordinary commitment and understanding.  This outcome would not have been achieved without the unity and solidarity of EU member states and institutions.</p><p>The draft agreement, notably the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, meets Ireland&rsquo;s objectives.  It protects the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process.  Importantly, nothing in the agreement will prejudice the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the principle of consent as set out in the Good Friday Agreement.  The withdrawal agreement translates the UK&rsquo;s political commitment to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland into a legal guarantee.  It provides for a backstop that will apply unless and until another solution is agreed.  This means that there will be no hard border in any circumstances.  That said, we hope that the backstop will never be used and that we can resolve the Border issues through a future relationship agreement that is both comprehensive and generous.</p><p>The withdrawal agreement underpins, in a dynamic way, continuing North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.  It provides for the maintenance of the common travel area and protects the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity.  It also confirms that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy the rights of EU citizens.  The agreement also provides for a period of transition, which can be extended, in which preparations can be made for the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  We are committed to working with the UK and our EU partners to secure a future relationship that is as deep and comprehensive as possible.  Once the European Council has given its endorsement to the agreement, it will be for the British and European Parliaments to consider and approve it in accordance with their respective procedures.</p><p>We will have a four hour debate on this issue in the House tomorrow, with the opportunity to vote on the detail of the draft agreement at the end of that debate.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il very much welcomes the forthcoming debate which we requested.  My party welcomed the draft withdrawal agreement between the UK Government and the EU.  The agreement represents a positive step towards a potential deal.  However, its ratification is not a certainty.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been accused by the T&aacute;naiste and members of his party of playing politics with Brexit which is simply not the case.  We have been generally very supportive of the Government's negotiating position on Brexit and have never sought to undermine the national position.  We have put on the green jersey, so to speak, and have been advocating for the least damaging Brexit possible for the island of Ireland.  The Government may not like it but it is our responsibility and right, as the main Opposition party, to ask questions and though it may be difficult for the Government at times, we will continue to ask those questions.  We will not apologise for holding the Government to account, particularly in regard to one of the greatest threats ever faced by this State.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste met Mr. Michel Barnier yesterday.  I ask him to update this House on that meeting and what was discussed.  The withdrawal agreement is a draft agreement at present.  Does the T&aacute;naiste envisage any changes to the agreement as it is currently drafted and is there room for manoeuvre?</p></speech>

Political unity in Ireland has been a key factor in allowing us to take clear positions that have subsequently resulted in achieving solidarity across the EU and has played an important part in helping us to get a wording across the line that protects core Irish interests.</p>  <p>  Regarding the text of the agreement, it is only a draft agreement in the sense that it is awaiting approval by the European Council.  This is a text that has been agreed between the negotiating teams and by the British Government and to that extent, it is not a draft text.  It is now the text and it is not going to be reopened.  The Spanish have some concerns with the agreement as it relates to Gibraltar but it was very clear from the General Affairs Council meeting yesterday that while we want those issues addressed, the text should not be changed now.  It has taken two years to put that draft withdrawal agreement together.  It is sensitive and difficult and represents a compromise on both sides, with the EU and the UK both trying to accommodate the other's concerns.  It is a balanced text that is good for the UK as a whole and protects core Irish concerns and mitigates potential damage.  I do not believe that it will change and it is not open for change.  What will change, however, is the political declaration on the future relationship.  That was a short, seven page skeleton document last week which will become at least a 20 page document.  Hopefully, we will see the wording of that later this evening or tomorrow.  We know that Prime Minister Theresa May is planning to travel to Brussels tomorrow to meet Jean-Claude Juncker, presumably to talk about the final wording of that declaration, in the build-up to a summit on Sunday which I hope will be successful for both sides.</p></speech>

Perhaps that speaks more to the political situation in the UK than the tone of the conversation between the two teams.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that there is no such thing as a good Brexit but the withdrawal agreement contains the necessary protections and precautions to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  It also upholds the Good Friday Agreement, particularly in the first line of the Northern Ireland protocol, which is necessary and has been very well received.  It also ensures the continuance of North-South co-operation.  Under the terms of the draft text, Northern Ireland is effectively given special economic status, broadly in line with what Fianna F&aacute;il first proposed more than two years ago.</p><p>The British Prime Minister now faces difficulties and divisions within her own party and across the House of Commons.  The T&aacute;naiste also mentioned the situation in Spain over Gibraltar and there are issues about the text of that aspect of the agreement.  What happens in the event that the withdrawal agreement is rejected by the House of Commons?  What is the plan of the Irish Government and what is the plan of the EU negotiating team in that event?  What happens the next day?  What is the timeline?  What is plan B if that happens?  We will know in a very short time.</p></speech>

It has never agreed with it and regrets that the United Kingdom has made the decision through the referendum to leave the European Union.  Before that decision was made, this country was planning for how it would need to respond to protect core Irish interests and British-Irish relations in the context of Brexit.  Last week was an important step forward in getting a text agreed, but there is still a long way to go on this.  I hope the withdrawal treaty is supported on Sunday by EU leaders and subsequently supported in the House of Commons, but there is still a future relationship to negotiate which will take at least the next two to three years.  Ireland will have to continue to be vigilant and try to mitigate the unintended consequences of the fallout of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Many people have been far too quick to start jumping past the time when the Parliament in Westminster makes the decision and are assuming the worst.  We should not do that.  We should spend the next couple of weeks explaining to people and reassuring them as to what is in the deal.  We have spent two years putting it together.  It is a good deal for Ireland, the UK and the EU.  It captures the complexity of an economy the size of the UK leaving the European Union and tries to deal with a whole series of competing and complex questions to do with that.  Instead of focusing on contingency after a failed vote in the House of Commons, we should be talking about how we talk this up to maximise the chances of it getting support in the House of Commons, which is what the Prime Minister is doing.</p></speech>

It was co-chaired by myself and David Lidington, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, was there as well as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley.</p>  <p>  One of the key items discussed at this meeting was a joint paper prepared by Irish and British officials which outlined a number of possible models to maintain and strengthen the high level of bilateral co-operation between Ireland and the UK after it leaves the European Union.  The conference agreed that new structures for systemic bilateral co-operation would demonstrate the strength and depth of the relationship, provide opportunities for Ministers and officials to continue to engage with each other, and provide an overall architecture for co-operation that is both meaningful and sustainable in the future.</p>  <p>  It was agreed that new structures should include summits involving Heads of Government and senior Ministers in addition to ongoing sectoral work at ministerial level.  Officials have been tasked with preparing a fully worked-through proposal for future east-west co-operation for consideration at the next intergovernmental conference which we agreed for the spring of next year.</p>  <p>  The conference also provided an opportunity to discuss the ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland, and the two Governments reiterated our shared commitment to securing the full operation of all the Good Friday Agreement institutions at the earliest opportunity.  Unfortunately, to date, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an Executive, despite intensive efforts by both Governments.  I am engaging with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on how the two Governments can most effectively secure the operation of the institutions, and we are also continuing contacts with the political parties to seek a way forward.  All parties have reaffirmed their commitment to operating the devolved institutions and have provided views on their key concerns and issues.</p></speech>

The intergovernmental conference will probably have to be upgraded post Brexit as we will not have the same formal or informal meetings with our UK colleagues.  Was there any discussion about this?  Obviously that is something we will have to look into.  What practical steps are going to be taken in relation to the 2014 Stormont House Agreement on legacy issues?  This needs to be dealt with.  Were there any discussions about security issues and, if so, how in depth were they?</p>  <p>  What concrete discussions were there about east-west matters?  For instance, and this is important, was there any discussion about the common travel area and how that will work and the need to put the rights of citizens into law so that Irish and British citizens, for instance, can continue to reside, use public services and, indeed, vote in each other&rsquo;s countries?  The T&aacute;naiste might outline some progress on those issues.</p></speech>

That will not happen in the future so we are planning to set up the kind of structure that France and Germany, and Portugal and Spain, have, whereby, at least once a year, there will be a Government-to-Government summit every second year in Britain and Ireland.  It would obviously involve the Prime Minister and Taoiseach and also the relevant Ministers in the key portfolios.  That would require that senior civil servants prepare for that a long way out to look at what Britain and Ireland should be doing together strategically in the interests of both countries, and there are many examples of areas where we could be doing more.</p>  <p>  The Government is absolutely committed to the Stormont House Agreement.  We have just been through a consultation process in Northern Ireland on that and the British Government is committed to bringing forward new legislation to follow through on that consultation, which was a difficult enough consultation, as one would expect, because legacy is particularly sensitive in Northern Ireland for all families concerned.</p>  <p>  The security co-operation was primarily around PSNI and Garda co-operation.  There have been a lot of joint initiatives that have been very successful in recent weeks and months in respect of cross-Border crime and so on.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, dealt with that comprehensively.</p>  <p>  Both Governments are committed to introducing new legislation, if necessary, to reinforce the functioning of a common travel area post Brexit.  That will take effect, in terms of new proposals, in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

It has been said that there is going to be ambition as to how bilateral co-operation is maintained and strengthened post Brexit.  The T&aacute;naiste might outline how that will work.  Are we considering a model like the Nordic Council of Ministers?  How would the joint funding of projects go ahead etc.?  How would EU rules be involved in that, or has any discussion taken place about that, from an Irish perspective?</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said the UK and Irish Governments reaffirmed their shared commitment to securing the operations of the devolved power-sharing Executive in the North.</p><p>It has been 680 days.  Was there any discussion about any way in which we can, on some level, limp forward with this?  Finally, it was agreed that the conference would meet again in the spring of 2019.  Is there a lack of urgency in this?  Should it not be meeting more regularly?  From memory, the minimum under the Good Friday Agreement is two meetings a year.  That is all that is being adhered to at the moment.  Should there be more, particularly as we move into a post-Brexit situation, or is this covered by the new format which the Minister outlined and which will be set up in the future?</p></speech>

I am not quite sure how many, but it had been quite a few years.  We had one in the summer and one in the autumn and we are going to have one in the spring.  That suggests there will be up to four a year.  We are insisting on the structures of the Good Friday Agreement now being actually used.  We need to use them appropriately rather than over-reaching in a way which some people would feel threatened by.</p>  <p>  In terms of British-Irish interaction and structures to reinforce that interaction in the context of an intergovernmental summit, the BIIGC and other Good Friday Agreement structures are often associated with Northern Ireland and the joint responsibility Britain and Ireland have as co-guarantors of the agreement in the context of the peace process.  There is, perhaps, a need to separate from that in the context of a primarily east-west summit which deals with British and Irish issues.  Of course we need to co-operate closely and regularly on Northern Irish issues, but there are many other things we should be doing together.  Whether linked to trade, climate, or the marine, there are so many different areas in which co-operation between Britain and Ireland makes sense given our geographic proximity to each other and how well we know each other.</p></speech>

However, any Brexit scenario will mean considerable change and impact for Ireland.  We are taking forward extensive and detailed Brexit preparations and contingency work across all Government Departments and agencies.  As part of prudent preparation for Brexit, steps need to be taken at national level, at EU level and at the level of businesses and citizens.  The underlying strength and resilience of our economy is critical in ensuring that Ireland is in the best possible position to respond to the challenges of Brexit.  This has been a key factor in developing successive budgets, including the last one.</p>  <p>  The Government has already taken a number of key decisions on measures to be put in place for the necessary checks and controls for trade on an east-west basis between Britain and Ireland.  The recruitment of an additional 1,077 staff for customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, controls, in addition to ICT and infrastructure measures at our ports and airports, has been sanctioned and implementation is already under way.  Various contingency measures such as the rapid redeployment of customs staff are also under active consideration in the context of a disorderly Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  Businesses and other affected sectors need to respond and prepare themselves and the Government is providing an array of support and information measures to assist them.  Specific support measures and schemes are now in place for businesses and across the agrifood sector.  To inform our businesses and citizens better, the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign was launched in September.  Very successful outreach events were held in October and more will follow this month.  We are in Limerick on Friday and Letterkenny next Friday.</p>  <p>  Of particular relevance to citizens is the work on the Common Travel Area to ensure that the arrangements by which Irish and British citizens can live, work and access public services in each other&rsquo;s countries will continue into the future regardless of what Brexit scenario unfolds. </p>  <p>  In a number of key areas the appropriate response and mitigation will be at an EU level and we are continuing to engage actively with the Commission on areas of priority for Ireland.  The Commission has flagged the particular impact of Brexit on Ireland and Irish business in its contingency planning communication last week.  Ireland is also working closely with fellow member states to discuss areas of key concern, particularly the issue of facilitating the use of the UK as a landbridge post Brexit.</p></reply>

Last week, after the withdrawal agreement was announced, Simon McKeever of the Irish Exporters Association said companies were increasingly looking to take action around issues like customs and stockpiling of goods.  He noted:</p><blockquote>There's huge demand for warehousing space from the pharma and food and drink sectors both here and in the UK.  Companies are pre-placing items in the event of a hard Brexit</blockquote><p>He also said:</p><blockquote>I wouldn't describe it as a sense of panic but we're starting to see the signs of concern that we have put our eggs in the basket of a deal and mitigating against outcomes in a deal scenario.  There really isn't a plan B if there isn't a deal.</blockquote><p>I also note that in the aftermath of the recent budget the Parliamentary Budget Office said:</p><blockquote>no sensitivity analysis has been provided by the Government on the impact of changes to the Irish output induced by a &lsquo;hard&rsquo; Brexit on revenue and expenditure projections.  In addition, conventional economic models are based on historical long-run relationships between economic variables and may not adequately capture the impacts of unprecedented shocks such as the occurrence of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit.  Due to the significant uncertainty over the nature of the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU and a consideration of recent developments on negotiations, it may not be prudent to plan on the basis of an &lsquo;orderly&rsquo; Brexit.</blockquote><p>In light of the Taoiseach's recent comments regarding five years of planned tax cuts, I believe our over-reliance on just balancing the books over the coming years is definitely not enough to prepare for a hard Brexit.  We need to be preparing for all possible scenarios.</p><p>I am equally concerned about the uptake of Brexit supports.  Figures released to me and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party show that, as of 12 October, only &euro;8.5 million of the &euro;300 million available under the Brexit loan scheme had been sanctioned at bank level.  Only 137 Be Prepared grants have been approved by Enterprise Ireland.  That equates to approximately 3% of Enterprise Ireland firms.  It seems to be the case that businesses are still not as prepared as they should be.</p></speech>

I have just been with Mr. McKeever for an hour and a half at an export trade council.  I am going to see him for a couple of hours later this evening at a Brexit stakeholders' meeting.</p></speech>

I will be talking to hundreds of businesses again on Friday, in Limerick.  We will be doing the same in Letterkenny next week.  We are planning in the areas in which we can predict outcomes and we are planning for all potential outcomes.  We are not, however, going to add to a sense of panic.  For the next two to three weeks, which is the time we have before the vote in Westminster, we should talk about the deal which has been agreed, which solves many of these problems, and we should help maximise the chances of it being fully understood, in a reassuring way, so that we can increase the chances of it passing.  We should not be ratcheting up tension about what will happen if it does not pass.  If it does not pass, we will have to respond to that, and we will.  We have been working for months to prepare for that.  I will bring new contingency plans to Government in response.  We will work with industry and other parties.  We will work in the national interest.  Let us not create some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy here.  Our job is to plan calmly for all outcomes, to try to predict what is coming down the tracks in a few weeks' time, and to advocate strongly for a deal that is good for Ireland, fair for the UK, and fair for the EU which negotiating teams have taken two years to put in place.  That should be our focus between now and the vote in Westminster.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000027#Z00100"><p>Let us leave the condescension at the door.  I think we are all being calm, but it is prudent and reasonable for an Opposition party to ask the Government what planning is being engaged in and to ask for details.  The quotes I gave from Mr. McKeever were his own words.  They are not mine.  The Minister says he is talking, but is he listening?  I gave figures which the Government provided for the take-up of Brexit supports.  They are very low.  That is a fact, not opinion.  I appreciate that we all want the deal to go through, but it is reasonable to ask what is plan B.  Other member states are releasing details of their contingency planning, as is the United Kingdom.  We ask that it be done here too and that the Minister inform the House and citizens of the details of preparations and planning.  Last week in the Chamber the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, outlined that her Department had been working for almost a year to ascertain what we needed to do to maintain reciprocal arrangements under individual schemes between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic.  Even though it has been happening for the last year, the details of the outcome of this analysis are not available.  The Minister and the Government have the information, but they are not providing it for the rest of the House.  That is why we are asking the questions.  I acknowledge that it is difficult to be fully prepared for all scenarios, but it is reasonable to ask and it is not in the interests of ramping up pressure or creating difficulties.  I would not be doing my job if I did not ask the questions.</p></speech>

We make no apologies for this as our job is to get a deal and we got one last week.  We did it by trying to negotiate with Michel Barnier and his team, working with the United Kingdom to explore solutions, to find a fair way forward for everybody.  In public communications we focused on achieving an outcome, as opposed to contingencies, but that does not mean that we have not been making contingency plans, about which I have talked to the Deputy, as I have to many others.  We signed off on an extra 1,077 customs officials and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, inspectors at the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health.  Dublin Port is preparing and investing in contingency plans linked with Brexit.  We have said the primary focus will be on east-west inspection infrastructure at Rosslare Europort, Dublin Port and Dublin Airport.  There is a raft of supports and advice available for companies.  Some are relatively new and have only been in place for the last couple of months and the uptake is building all the time.  The Deputy is right to ask whether we are putting contingency plans in place or thinking about how we would react if Westminster was to vote against a deal.  Of course, we are thinking about it.  My judgment is that our primary focus should be on trying to talk about the deal that was done last week, which is still live, because we want it to be supported, rather than moving on and focusing on failure.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.301.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000027#Z01100"><p>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 81, 91, 92, and 109 together.  </p><p>I have already set out in general terms my views on the situation in Yemen, which is shocking.  I share the Deputies' concerns about the dire security and humanitarian situation in Yemen and the urgent need to bring about a political solution for the country.  There are direct threats to civilians from the ongoing fighting and credible reports of violations of basic human rights in the course of the conflict.  The United Nations has warned of an imminent threat of famine on an appalling scale, with millions of people potentially at risk of starvation, as well as significant public health risks due to the almost complete collapse of the healthcare system.</p><p>The challenge of resolving this complex conflict should not be underestimated.  The civil war which has been ongoing for almost four years has opened fault lines in Yemen which will be difficult to heal.  Historically, the country was divided between north and south, with a larger proportion of the population in the north being Shia and the south being largely Sunni.  The two parts of Yemen were united in one state in 1990.  The internationally recognised Government of Yemen now controls less than half of the country, while the <i>de facto</i>authorities, usually referred to as the Houthis, control much of the north and west, where the largest concentrations of people are located, including the capital.</p><p>Both parties to the conflict have the support of outside actors, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates among those supporting the internationally recognised government, while Iran is closely connected with the Houthis.  Rockets have been fired from Houthi controlled areas into Saudi Arabia, including towards Saudi cities.  This has put civilians at risk and I firmly condemn the attacks.  There are serious concerns about violations of international humanitarian law on all sides, with indiscriminate attacks endangering civilians, unfortunately, being very common.  There are reports of serious human rights abuses on both sides, as well as of obstacles being placed in the way of the effective delivery of humanitarian aid, a matter about which we spoke earlier.</p><p>Both at UN level and in EU discussions on the issue, Ireland has sought at all times to stress that military action cannot be a solution.  Rebuilding stable and inclusive government and rebuilding links between communities across Yemen will require a painstaking and long process.  There are already clear challenges in restoring effective governance in these areas where the government has resumed control.  This is particularly worrying in a country where al-Qaeda has had a significant presence for over a decade.  A ceasefire will be only the first step, but it is essential.</p><p>Even prior to the conflict, Yemen suffered from serious underdevelopment, corruption and drought.  This has exacerbated the impact of three years of fighting on the Yemeni people.  The war has had a severe impact on the economy and public services.  Access for humanitarian aid is a key issue, as is access for commercial goods.  However, there are reports that even when food and medicines are available for purchase, the devaluation of the currency and the cessation of much normal economic activity owing to the conflict mean that many families have no resources or income left to buy what they need.  As the United Nations and humanitarian agencies report, we now have an acute humanitarian situation, with a cholera outbreak and the real risk of starvation for millions of Yemeni civilians.  The United Nations' humanitarian co-ordinator in Yemen, Lise Grande, has warned that as many as 13 million civilians are at risk of famine if the fighting continues.</p><p>At the Foreign Affairs Council in which I participated in Brussels yesterday EU Ministers discussed the humanitarian situation in Yemen, the difficulties aid agencies faced in attempting to reach those in need and what the European Union could do to help to alleviate the crisis.  We are particularly concerned about the recent violence in Hodeidah which is the entry point for an estimated 70% of goods imported into Yemen.  Ireland and the European Union strongly support the efforts of the UN envoy Martin Griffiths who is working to bring the parties together for a new round of peace talks which may take place before the end of this month.  At the request of the United Nations, Sweden stands ready to host such talks.  The United Kingdom which currently leads on the Yemen file at the UN Security Council is also making efforts to bring this about, for which I thank it.</p><p>Ireland is doing what it can to address the devastating humanitarian situation and try to help to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people.  Since 2015, it has provided almost &euro;16.5 million in humanitarian assistance for Yemen.  This includes a contribution of &euro;4 million made this year to the UN Yemen Humanitarian Fund which provides assistance in the areas of education, logistics, food security, nutrition and health.  Ireland also provides humanitarian support for Yemen through its contributions to EU funds.  Since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the European Union has contributed a total of &euro;438 million to Yemen which includes humanitarian, development, stabilisation and resilience support.  On 6 November Commissioner Stylianides announced an additional provision of &euro;90 million in assistance for Yemen, bringing the total this year to &euro;118 million.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>On 6 November, Commissioner Stylianides announced an additional provision of &euro;90 million in assistance to Yemen, bringing the total this year to approximately &euro;118 million.</p> <p> Ireland is using its leverage in other multilateral fora to focus on the situation in Yemen.  At the Human Rights Council in September 2017 Ireland was part of a core group of countries which ensured the establishment of a group of eminent experts on Yemen to investigate alleged violations of human rights and contraventions of international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict.  In September of this year Ireland worked to ensure the extension of the mandate of the group for another year to allow the group more time to complete their valuable work.  I assure the House that we will continue to support all efforts to bring an end to the violence and to alleviate the humanitarian situation.</p></reply>

As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, almost four years of war has resulted in the world's greatest humanitarian crisis.  The UN reports that 17.8 million people are currently categorised as food insecure, including 8.4 million who are categorised as severely food insecure.  At the same time the country is suffering the worst cholera crisis in modern history.  The unrelenting violence in the city port of Hodeida has impacted on the availability of food and essential supplies.  Government regulations have hampered all port commercial activities relating to imports.</p>  <p>  We welcome and acknowledge the fact that Ireland is doing what it can to try to help alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people.  I note that since 2015 Ireland has provided almost &euro;16.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen.  This includes a contribution of &euro;4 million made to the UN Yemen humanitarian fund this year.  We note that since the beginning of the conflict in 2015 the EU has contributed a total of &euro;438.2 million to Yemen.  This includes humanitarian development as well as stabilisation and resilience support.</p>  <p>  There are multiple actors involved in the war, as the T&aacute;naiste said, each with their agenda.  We acknowledge that efforts are being made to broker a ceasefire.  Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the UN envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, in his efforts to bring all sides of the conflict to the negotiating table to work on a political solution.  Let us be clear: the impending famine and the starvation being experienced by millions are man-made.  In addition, the Yemeni Government is withholding salaries from civil servants, including teachers and health workers, in the Houthi-controlled northern part for two years.  Most of the Yemeni population live in the north.  State employees are a large proportion of the workforce.</p>  <p>  Starvation is being used as a weapon of war.  The international community must act urgently to unblock imports and ensure distribution of aid.  We must remember that the delivery of humanitarian assistance is a requirement under international law.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste update us on efforts to broker a ceasefire in Yemen?  We read that Yemen's Houthi militia announced that it was halting drone and missile attacks against the country's Saudi-led military coalition and would consider a broader ceasefire.  This is of course welcome and I would like the T&aacute;naiste to expand on the detail.  Given the high risk of famine, is the T&aacute;naiste aware of any new plans, financial or otherwise, being considered at EU level to protect the people of Yemen from starvation?</p></speech>

At the time, the T&aacute;naiste expressed grave and serious concern.  He has told us today that the situation is shocking.  Some 13 million people are in danger of famine.  This number includes hundreds of thousands of children.  Perhaps up to 50,000 are dead.  Is there something more proactive the T&aacute;naiste can do?  I asked the T&aacute;naiste about the use of weapons by the Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates collation and the steps that could be taken in that regard.  For example, I mentioned the referring of Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud to the International Criminal Court on foot of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the litany of serious war crimes in Yemen.  I note that yesterday Germany issued a travel ban on 18 Saudis who are suspected.  The CIA produced a report about the matter recently in which it directly accuses the Crown Prince of bring responsible for the murder.  Germany has announced a travel ban on 18 Saudis in the Schengen area.  Is that something the T&aacute;naiste will support?  It could bring serious pressure to bear on the Saudi authorities to stop this fighting and bring it to an immediate end.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000028#AA00800"><p>My question is very simple.  Why is the T&aacute;naiste not demanding, and why is the EU not imposing, sanctions on Saudi Arabia?  The humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding in Yemen is due, to a large extent, to the Saudi military intervention, the blockade and the deliberate attempts to starve and bomb the population into submission.  Of course, standing behind Saudi in this regard are the United States, France and Germany.  They are arming the Saudi regime, a regime whose agents murder a man who is a dissident journalist.  They dismembered his body and, if the reports are accurate, they burned the remains of his body with acid to destroy them.  This is what we are dealing with.  There are 22 of these characters around the corner from this building in the Saudi Embassy.  Why are there no sanctions?  Why is this not being said?  Can we impose sanctions on what is an absolutely rogue barbaric regime that is inflicting the sort of humanitarian horror that we are seeing?  The T&aacute;naiste knows the answer to this question.  We do not do it because France, the UK and the United States make a great deal of money backing these people.  Even worse, geo-politically these countries do not mind what those people do.  It suits them to have Saudis do this because Saudi is a reliable ally for western interests in the region.  That is the truth.  We all know it is the truth.  Millions of people are suffering.  Will the Government not stand up and say that is the truth of it?  Can we not expect the European Union to have a little more moral backbone and do something about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000028#AA00900"><p>I do not agree with the manner in which the T&aacute;naiste presents this war.  The Minister described it as the Saudi and UAE administrations backing the internationally recognised government against the Houthi, who are recognised by Iran.  The Minister referred to the internationally recognised government there.  Hadi was put in place in 2011 as a puppet of the US-Saudi alliance.  Unfortunately, this happened with the involvement of the UN.  The UN has not covered itself with glory in this area.</p>  <p>  Reference has been made to the opposition there.  The notion that this is a war against the Houthi only is rubbish.  A total of six different groups are involved.  The people of Yemen are on the other side.  It so happens that the Houthi are one of the groups who garnered arms initially.  The notion that Iran is getting arms to the Houthi now is not backed up by any evidence.  No one has come up with evidence that Iran is giving weapons to the Houthi.  Iran says openly that it supports the Houthi politically.  Iran tried to bring medicines and food in a civilian airplane to Yemen.  The Saudis did not attack the airplane but they bombed the airport where the airplane was supposed to land to stop the supplies from getting through.  Iran has tried to bring medicines and food to the Yemeni, not arms.  That is the story that is being peddled all the time.  RT&Eacute; cannot mention the Houthi but refer instead to the Iranian-backed rebels.  There is no evidence for the claims.  This is a Saudi-UAE invasion against the people of Yemen.  They are starving the people there to death.</p></speech>

However, it is not helpful for Deputy Boyd Barrett to talk about Saudi citizens who are in an embassy here and who are diplomats.  The ambassador, whom I met last week, is from my experience a decent person who is trying to make a coherent case in very difficult circumstances in the context of the Khashoggi murder.  I do not think it is either right or accurate to be referring to all Saudi citizens in the way the Deputy has today.</p><p>That is the first thing.  Second, I agree with some of what Deputy Wallace said.  This matter is more complex than it is sometimes portrayed.  There are clans and many different sources of power in Yemen.  The impact of this war is devastating across those multiple clans.  They are being bombed from the air, and many women and children are being killed alongside soldiers.  That has to stop.  The EU wants to use all of the influence it has to stop this conflict.  I attended the meeting yesterday and heard French and British Ministers, among other EU ministers, speaking about how we can put as much pressure as possible on Saudi Arabia to stop military attacks in Yemen.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's portrayal of the western world is driven by an ideology, rather than accuracy, unfortunately.</p></speech>

The United States has been looking for and demanding a ceasefire in recent weeks and we need to build on that positive momentum.  There is a clear signal from the Houthi side that it wants a ceasefire, and a lot of pressure is being put on the Saudi side to facilitate real and substantive talks in Sweden before the end of the year so that we can have a political solution rather than the futility and tragedy that comes from continuing military action.  From an Irish perspective, we will support collective EU efforts, and indeed Swedish efforts, to provide the basis for those talks.  Even if this ceasefire takes hold a significant international effort will be required to prevent a massive famine in Yemen which will cost a lot of money.  The EU must be part of that solution, financially and logistically.  We also want to be part of that solution.  Our focus is very much on ensuring that these peace talks happen and that the humanitarian assistance required is in place.  It will involve a long, expensive and difficult process to help to rebuild a country, politically and in terms of infrastructure and social regeneration.  Ireland will be a strong, positive voice on this.</p></speech>

Does that include supporting the German foreign minister on the travel ban issued to 18 Saudis?  The Minister told us about the implementation of the arms trade treaty in 2014, which sought to stop high grade weapons from being used in a country such as Yemen.  Every member of the EU has signed up to that treaty.  How does that work in reality, in terms of American and British weapons in Saudi Arabia?</p></speech>

Given what happened in the Saudi consulate in Turkey it is ever so slightly alarming.  That was the point I made.  We are talking about a rogue state that, as we have seen with the killing of Jamal Khashoggi and with its actions in Yemen, is quite willing to engage in barbaric acts.  The elephant in the room is that the UK, France and the United States sell vast amounts of weapons to this regime on an ongoing basis.  How can that possibly be acceptable?</p></speech>

However, he has accepted that Germany has made the decision not to sell any more arms to the Saudis, given what is happening in Yemen.  Could Ireland take a similar role and stand up and say that we support an embargo on all arm sales to Saudi Arabia while it is involved in the conflict in Yemen?  If the T&aacute;naiste is talking to the French and UK ministers, he should point out that their countries are still supplying Saudi Arabia with arms.  It is not good enough.</p></speech>

Some products are sold in Ireland that have been described as having a duel use, but I am not aware of any sales of products used by the Saudi Arabian military.  There was a discussion over lunch yesterday, and a number of ministers spoke about the approaches taken in their countries.  Some do not sell arms to countries that are involved in wars while the wars are ongoing.  That applies to Saudi Arabia in this case.  The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Federica Mogherini, made it clear that she was not able to achieve consensus across the EU on an arms embargo because there was no agreement on the issue.  Ireland has to focus on areas in which it can have an impact.  We have focused on humanitarian assistance and are trying to support a talks process that could lead to a lasting political solution.  Hopefully Irish aid agencies and Irish funds can play a part in the long and difficult process of rebuilding Yemen, in time.

The Taoiseach and I continue to prioritise this issue in all our engagements with the US administration and Congress.  I discussed the Ireland-EU-US relationship with my Government colleagues earlier this month and we reiterated the priority that the Government attaches to Irish immigration issues in the US.  The Government&rsquo;s special envoy to the US Congress on the undocumented, Deputy Deasy, has been active on the issue, and our embassy in Washington, D.C. continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the administration and with a wide range of contacts on Capitol Hill. </p>  <p>  I welcome the recent tabling of a bill in the US Congress that, if passed, would allow Ireland to avail of E3 visas and provide another very welcome pathway for Irish people to gain experience in the US.  I do not underestimate the significant difficulties involved in securing the passage of this bill, requiring as it does a two thirds majority in the House and 60 votes in the Senate.</p>  <p>  The Government, through the work of the embassy and of Deputy Deasy, will continue to engage proactively with the US administration and elected representatives, both Democratic and Republican, on Irish immigration issues and specifically on this bill.</p>  <p>  The Government's efforts to assist the undocumented Irish in the US will also continue, as they have under previous administrations.  This remains a very challenging issue, however, as immigration reform has been a sensitive and divisive issue within the US political system for decades.</p>  <p>  On the welfare of the undocumented Irish, the embassy, as well as our six consulates across the United States, work closely with Irish immigration centres which support the needs of Irish citizens in the United States, including those who are undocumented.  These centres all receive annual funding from the Government&rsquo;s emigrant support programme to support their important work. </p></speech>

Being politicians, most of us in this House know the importance of somebody from another country lobbying and maintaining contact with us.  From a practical point of view, the reason I have raised the issue is that under the current administration in the United States there is heightened awareness of the immigration issue and people are concerned.  The families of Irish people who have been living there for a long time and happen to be undocumented are concerned about their welfare.  We have all seen cases where they are not able to return to Ireland for family occasions and so forth.  I listened to the Minister's reply in detail, but I would like him to elaborate on it.  He mentioned that he was dealing with two key issues.  One of the issues of real concern is relief for the undocumented, that is, those who are living there.  I know that the Minister is not the US Administration and cannot answer for it.  I can only hold him to account by seeking assurances that both he and the Government are doing everything possible for the undocumented and trying to secure relief for them.</p></speech>

It is really important that we continue a tradition that has been followed for many decades where there is a continuing flow of talented, bright, motivated young Irish people to the United States to be part of decision-making, politics and all of the other things in which Irish people are involved.  That is in our interests and those of the many people who want to continue to do this by choice, rather than necessity.  We also need to help the thousands of undocumented in the United States who are now living in a far more coarse political environment when it comes to immigration and feel a lot more vulnerable than in the past.  However, we also have to be realistic about what is achievable.  We have gone down the E-3 visa route to find a way of introducing legislation that could actually get a result for us in the short term.  The United States has an arrangement with Australia whereby E-3 visas are provided for Australians who want to travel to the United States.  Each year a quota is provided.  In many cases, that quota is not used in full.  Therefore, we are hoping to use visas that would otherwise not be used.  In fact, it can be shown that they have not been used and it will be the following year when they could potentially be available for use by Irish people.  I have been on Capitol Hill with Deputy Deasy.  We have met people like Representative Paul Ryan, Representative Nancy Pelosi, Representative Richard Neal and many others from both parties to try to get this done in a sensible way.</p></speech>

I want to reflect on a comment he made previously.  About six months ago he said, "The Government has been exploring a number of different options, including the possibility of a reciprocal agreement covering the undocumented Irish in the US, on the one hand, and US citizens looking to move to Ireland, on the other."  Has the Government made any progress in dealing with that element, in particular?  I am clear on what the Minister is saying about people who are looking for new opportunities, but the focus of my question is on those who are in the United States who are classed as undocumented and effectively in limbo.  Has any progress being made on the reciprocal arrangement since the Minister made that comment?</p></speech>

It is currently possible to do so, but we could improve the conditions under which it happens.  We continue to explore ways by which we could both help the undocumented and ensure a visa system was available.  There is nothing available, except for students in the summer.  Let us take this one step at a time and try to deal with what is possible in the short term, without losing sight of the other priorities such as constantly looking for avenues and opportunities to make progress for the undocumented.</p></speech>

Mr. Bolsonaro's campaign was based on fear, division, racism, sexism and homophobia.  He poses a major threat to human rights protections, indigenous communities and, as outlined in this parliamentary question, the environment.  The Minister has refused to condemn his far-right policies or even to state his concern in response to my question.  Perhaps he might do so now.</p></reply>

Officials in my Department in Dublin, at the Irish Embassy in Bras&iacute;lia and the Consulate-General in S&atilde;o Paulo followed the election process closely and have continued to monitor political developments since, including proposals the incoming government is considering.  It is important to note that the full plan of the new government will not be clear until after President-elect Bolsonaro assumes office on 1 January.  The President-elect has stated some final decisions on government policy and the structure of individual ministries, including those to which the Deputy referred, will not be made until he is in office.  He has indicated that he longer wishes to merge the agriculture and environment ministries which has reassured many.  I am aware of the difficult situation for many environmental and land rights activists in Brazil and throughout Latin America and my Department continues to monitor the issue closely.  I wholeheartedly condemn any act of violence or intimidation against peaceful activists or civil society actors.  I call on all relevant stakeholders to respect these groups&rsquo; rights to engage in a free and open civil society space, which is essential in a functioning democracy.  Officials at the Irish Embassy in Bras&iacute;lia and the Consulate-General in S&atilde;o Paulo and in our offices in Dublin engage regularly with civil society groups and human rights defenders present on the ground in Brazil, including environmental and land rights groups.  </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments closely, as well as continuing to engage with EU and local partners and raising these issues at EU and UN level, as appropriate.  However, I do not think there is anything to be gained for Ireland by slagging someone off before he even takes office.  He was democratically elected.  Of course, if decisions are taken in Brazil with which we have a fundamental difficulty, I will not be shy in being vocal about them, but he is not even President yet.</p></speech>

I see his election as a clear threat to democracy in Brazil.  He was a captain in the military during the brutal dictatorship and said its only crime was that it did not kill enough people.  He has called indigenous communities "parasites", called for tens of thousands of his opponents to be arrested and the police to extrajudicially kill more people and told a Senator famous for promoting human rights that she was too ugly to be raped.  That is the type of individual about whom we are talking, yet the Minister suggests he should remain silent and has no comment to make yet on any of these actions.  Last week the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence heard from the representative of an NGO in Brazil.  She detailed the extreme fear Mr. Bolsonaro had created in the country.  In his written reply to me the Minister stated: "Ireland looks forward to maintaining our strong relationship with Brazil in the future and will continue efforts to advance our interests and values in our engagement with the new government."  Is any of it based on human rights due diligence?  Last November the Minister launched a national plan on business and human rights, but in his written reply to me there was no mention of human rights.  I am concerned about where this is going.</p></speech>

Where a person who is running for public office asks for extrajudicial killing, is homophobic, racist, sows fear and division, and states that more people needed to be killed during the military junta, how could anyone have any empathy with a President-elect like that?</p>  <p>  Ireland is concerned about its exports and so on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.372" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="18:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000031#DD03500"><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  It is always helpful when the Minister responsible comes and takes the issue.</p>  <p>  To recap briefly on the history of the issue, before I entered politics there were two superintendents based in Connemara, one in Oughterard and one in Clifden.  In a decision which was made before my time in politics but which was made by a Fianna F&aacute;il, the headquarters for east Connemara was moved into Salthill barracks, but the regional headquarters for the rest of Connemara remained in Clifden.  I now understand that the proposal is that the headquarters for all of Connemara would be in Salthill, which means that Galway city will have the headquarters for all of Connemara as well as the regional headquarters - a fantastic massive building which the Minister opened - but of which no notice was given until the last minute.</p><p>Some of us have not got the notice yet, although we will park that as it is not the subject of my question today.  Second, an issue had been raised about having an office with an inspector in Carraroe that would be specifically for the Gaeltacht area, which would be a sub-region.  However, we understand that is not going to happen either.  Third, there is a need to ensure that, right up to the level of superintendent, all of those dealing with the Gaeltacht area can speak Irish.  This happens to be the biggest Gaeltacht area in the country and things such as court cases are habitually carried out in Irish, of course, only when the other side can deal with a person in Irish.  This is always the thing that forces language choice, and it forces language choice on me every day.  My office deals with those who can deal with us capably in Irish through Irish, but we deal with those who can only deal with us capably in the English language in the pragmatic way, that is, through English.</p> <p> We will not beat around the bush.  Why will there not be a regional headquarters for Connemara based in Connemara, with the superintendent based in Clifden, as was always the case?  Why is there not a sub-regional office for the Gaeltacht with an inspector based in An Cheathr&uacute; Rua?  Will the Minister ensure that garda&iacute; of all ranks who will be dealing with the Gaeltacht area of Connemara, which is about half of Connemara, will be able to do their business in both official languages in a fully competent manner?  That would be an ceannfort, an cigire, na s&aacute;irsint&iacute; agus na garda&iacute; in that area, so they would be able to go in and do the business i gc&uacute;irt Dhoire an Fh&eacute;ich n&oacute; Chill R&oacute;n&aacute;in through Irish or English, depending on the language chosen by the defendant, and do their business in those languages before it ever gets to a court, as the case may arise.  That is basically it.  We will not waste any more time beating around the bush.</p></speech>

I was not aware of any change.</p>  <p>  If I heard Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v correctly, he said he had not been invited to the official opening of the Garda station in Galway.

I am sorry that took place and I will certainly check it out because the Deputy should have been present.  I know the Deputy would have made representations on the matter, which is important to his constituency and the people he represents.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will appreciate that the allocation of all Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I have no direct role in this regard.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors, including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda division, including the Galway division, with a view to providing an effective and responsive police service.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Clifden Garda station is the district headquarters for the Clifden Garda district, which forms part of the Galway division.  I am informed by the Commissioner that a superintendent district officer was assigned to the district in August and that superintendent is based in Clifden Garda station.  This was to fill the vacancy created by the transfer of the previous district officer to take up the position of detective superintendent with responsibility for the western region, which is located in the Galway headquarters.</p>  <p>  The Garda strength of the Clifden district on 31 October, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 34.  There are 29 Garda reserves and 67 Garda civilian staff attached to the Galway division.  In addition, when appropriate, the work of local garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community has its own concerns and expectations, and it has been one of the key strengths of the organisation throughout its history.  In that regard, a key focus of the ongoing reform in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the modernisation of the way in which policing services are delivered so as to provide a better service to communities.  A new divisional policing model is currently being piloted in four divisions across the country, including Galway.  This new model was recommended by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate in 2015 to support the more flexible and effective deployment of resources.  The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland recommended a move towards a new local model for policing.</p>  <p>  With regard to Gaeltacht policing, I am advised by the Commissioner that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is fully committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Official Languages Act and the 20 year strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, one of the objectives of which is that the use of the Irish language by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be continued and developed.  Eligible applicants for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are fluent Irish speakers may opt to be considered for inclusion in a specialist Irish language stream within the overall recruitment competition run by the Public Appointments Service.  Candidates appointed from the Irish language stream are expected to provide a full range of services in Irish.  Successful candidates are allocated to Gaeltacht areas for a period of time, as determined by the Garda Commissioner.</p></speech>

However, when we get to the meat of the issue in the fifth paragraph of the Minister's script, we read: "A new divisional policing model is currently being piloted in four divisions across the country, including Galway."  Our clear understanding on the ground of what this means in simple English, when we strip away all the verbosity we are presented with by the Minister, is that there will be no superintendent based in Clifden, and that the superintendent will fundamentally be based in Galway city and Salthill.  This is not a matter of local deployment; it is a matter of national policy.  It seems there is a national policy of stripping everything out of the rural areas and centralising everything into major urban areas.  Therefore, on the basis of national policy, which is the remit of the Minster, is he willing to direct that rural areas would retain their key role in the provision of services and the location of headquarters, not on the basis of the whole county but the region, and Connemara is a very distinct region?  In my humble opinion, if the area was being divided, all of Connemara should be one Garda subsection, or whatever one wants to call it.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Irish language, we get verbose wording about objectives and commitments.  I asked a simple question.  Will An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ensure that all garda&iacute; who deal directly with the Gaeltacht at all levels are able to do their business in the Irish language?  It is a simple question to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the answer supplied is vague, to say the least.</p></speech>

I very much value his experience of many years representing the people of the west and the particular area to which this debate refers.  I have listened very closely to what he said.</p><p>I reject the Deputy's assertion that this is part of a grand plan to remove services from rural Ireland.  My Government colleagues and I are committed to ensuring that the Garda Commissioner has the resources to deliver an effective and modern policing service to all communities throughout the country, including Connemara and the Gaeltacht area.  Over the last few years, unprecedented resources have been made available to the Garda Commissioner to implement the Garda modernisation and renewal plan.  I acknowledge the leadership of the former Acting Commissioner, Mr. Donall &Oacute; Cuala&iacute;n, a constituent of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, until he gave way to the recently appointed Garda Commissioner, Mr. Drew Harris.  Resources are now coming on stream across all Garda divisions, including the Galway division, to ensure availability and visibility of garda&iacute;.</p> <p> I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda Training College in September 2014, almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and been assigned to mainstream duties across the country, with 31 assigned to the Galway division.  In July of this year, I had the pleasure of attending the official opening of the western regional Garda headquarters in Murrough, Galway.  I invite Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v to agree with me that the new regional headquarters will become a vital part of the infrastructure of the Galway area.  It will also support the delivery of an effective policing service to communities across the Galway division and the Clifden district.</p> <p> I do not have time to repeat the points I made about the Irish language but I would be happy to provide Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v with further information on the Irish language in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On the need for garda&iacute; in Gaeltacht areas to be able to conduct their business through the medium of the Irish language, owing to time constraints I will take up that matter privately with the Deputy.</p></speech>

Yesterday at about 4 p.m. users of Bus &Eacute;ireann service 126N, the nightrider service from Dublin to Newbridge via Naas, were shocked when Bus &Eacute;ireann tweeted that this service was being axed from this Saturday night.  The 126 bus will continue, with a last run at 11 p.m..  As the last train to Newbridge leaves Dublin at 11.10 p.m., including at the weekend, the proposed withdrawal of this service has caused uproar among commuters.  I was inundated with calls from constituents last night and this morning.</p>  <p>  This morning, the NTA said it had approved the continuation of the 126 service, which will operate late services at 12.30 a.m. and 3.30 a.m., until the end of this year, following which there would be a review of the service to determine if a public service obligation is required for its continuation in 2019.  The manner in which Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA have handled this matter is unsatisfactory.  What consultation took place between Bus &Eacute;ireann and the NTA, if the Department was aware of it?  If the NTA has known about this for a number of weeks, as a Bus &Eacute;ireann representative told me today it did, it should have communicated it to us and not just issue a tweet, leaving people thinking all of their plans for the coming weeks were ruined.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has said that operating costs for this service were not being covered owing to insufficient passenger numbers and that it is for this reason it is being axed as a commercial route.  It is hard to believe the company has operated this route all year at a loss and is now proposing to axe it as we approach peak demand in the Christmas period.  This smacks of an attempt to leverage the taxpayer to pay for the PSO for this route.  There is great demand for this service.  I have used it myself in the past.  I have been contacted by many people about the proposed axing of this route.  What analysis is undertaken of Bus &Eacute;ireann proposals to axe a route on the basis that it is loss-making, in the full knowledge that this will cause uproar?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000034#GG00100"><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I note that this is the second time Deputy Heydon and I have drawn attention to a public transport issue in Kildare in as many weeks.  I did not get the chance on the previous occasion to say I agreed with Deputy Heydon's remarks on the extension of the train service to Newbridge, taking the pressure off Sallins and other stations further up the line so I take the opportunity to do so now.</p>  <p>  To turn to today's issue, the 126N Nightrider service to Naas, Newbridge and beyond is very useful and popular.  It is a self-evident service.  It gets people home after a few drinks or a late night in town.  It operates at 12.30 a.m. and 3.30 a.m., later than the normal services.  I have used it on occasion, although not in recent times.  I spoke overnight and this morning to many people who use it regularly and I am told it is extremely popular and, in fact, generally oversubscribed.  It is very difficult to get back to Kildare after a night out without the service.  I recently spoke to people who had to travel via the airport, a very convoluted route.  There are certain other options but they are very convoluted, involve a number of stops in between and are not easy to take.  The benefits of the services are self-evident and close to the Minister's heart.  For example, having people ferried home by public transport after a night on the town means they will choose not to drink and drive, which is surely a public policy goal, as is encouraging people to use public transport in the first place.  The reason advanced for cancellation, that the service was not commercially viable, does not seem to stack up.  As I said, a significant number of people use the service and, given the clamour today and yesterday when this decision was announced, it is clear there is a ready-made market for it.  I do not buy Bus &Eacute;ireann's explanation.</p>  <p>  Deputy Heydon referred to the manner in which the announcement was made.  Eight Oireachtas Members from Kildare last week had a meeting with the NTA at which this decision was not even mentioned.  I am not ascribing blame to the individuals involved, but surely in terms of communications that was a golden opportunity to have this discussion.  However, rather than doing so or having any kind of consultation with Oireachtas Members, councillors, member of the public or, most important, the users of the service, a tweet was sent out yesterday evening after close of business.  I appreciate there has been some degree of roll-back and that Bus &Eacute;ireann now says the service will operate until Christmas.  This is better than nothing and, coming into the busy Christmas period, the service will certainly be in great demand.  What is the plan for the period after Christmas?  Is this part of the Go-Ahead takeover?  Is there a subvention opportunity?  Will the NTA take ownership of the plan in 2019?  Where do we go next?</p></speech>

As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in respect of public transport.  I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport.  Deputies will understand that the operation of Bus &Eacute;ireann services is a matter for the company, with oversight by the NTA.</p>  <p>  The NTA has entered into a contract with Bus &Eacute;ireann for the provision of a number of public service obligation, PSO, bus services.  In accordance with the terms of this contract, the day-to-day operation of these services is managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The company is required to meet performance obligations in respect of service delivery such as punctuality, services operated, vehicles in service and customer information.  Route 126, which operates along the Dublin-Kildare corridor, is one such PSO service and will continue to operate through the day until the last service departs Dublin city centre at 11 p.m.</p>  <p>  Route 126N, which operates on the Dublin-Naas-Newbridge route on Friday and Saturday nights, is a licensed commercial Bus &Eacute;ireann service.  Given that it is a commercial route, the service receives no State funding.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the costs to run the service were not being covered due to insufficient passenger numbers and it has been loss-making for some time.  As a result, the company made the commercial decision to cancel this service and the associated licence from the end of November.  I understand that the NTA was informed of this decision as part of the cancellation process.  To mitigate the impact of the cancellation of the night services on route 126N, especially during the festive period, Bus &Eacute;ireann, in conjunction with the NTA, has announced the introduction of late-night services on route 126 on Friday and Saturday nights.  I am advised that these additional services will start on Friday, 30 November and continue until the end of December.  These late-night services will depart the city centre at 12.30 a.m. and 3.30 a.m. and serve Bus&aacute;ras, the Ha'penny Bridge and all locations previously served by route 126N.  The late-night services will therefore serve Kill, Naas, Newbridge, Sallins and Clane.  The NTA has advised me that standard fares will apply on these services rather than the special fares previously charged on route 126N.  Free travel passes will also be accepted.</p>  <p>  In instances such as this in which operators withdraw commercial services, the NTA determines whether there is a public service obligation to provide the services on a socially necessary basis.  As such, the NTA intends to review the late services and determine whether a public service obligation applies in the provision of these late-night services on a continuous basis from 2019.</p>  <p>  As the Deputies may be aware, the Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO route 126 is one of six routes which were competitively tendered by the NTA as part of bus market opening.  Go-Ahead was awarded the contract to operate these routes.  Routes 120, 120C, 123, 124 and 130 will also form part of the network of services to be operated by Go-Ahead along the Dublin-Kildare corridor under a public service contract with the NTA.  Services operated by Go-Ahead are expected to commence in quarter 2 of 2019.  The NTA is working to finalise the timetables and other aspects of the services.  Any changes to the current configuration will be announced well in advance of the implementation of services.</p>  <p>  I hope the update I have given the Deputies will alleviate any concerns about the continued provision of late-night services for the travelling public in the Kildare area, particularly as we enter into the festive period.</p></speech>

I welcome the safeguarding of the Nightrider routes until the end of the year at the very least to allow a little time and space for consultation on and analysis of the use of these routes and future demand, which I expect will continue into the new year.  This is particularly important for south Kildare residents because taxi and hotel costs for these residents, who may want to have a night out in Dublin for work or whatever other reason, are prohibitive during the busy Christmas period, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.  This is therefore an important extension.  We must consider the broader scheme in this regard.  I hope there will be proper consultation with those who use the route to ascertain the level of demand, on which we should not just take Bus &Eacute;ireann's word, and to examine the time options.  It may be possible to change departure times or work with them a little if passenger numbers are down but, again, I am sceptical of Bus &Eacute;ireann's statement that there have been insufficient passenger numbers for some time.  I question this because we are heading into a period of peak business.  I think there is something afoot with this decision.  The curt way in which it was communicated to people did a major disservice to passengers of Bus &Eacute;ireann, and I express my disappointment in this regard.  Nonetheless, I am glad the service will continue until the end of the year at least.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="18:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000034#GG00400"><p>I welcome the clarification that the NTA will review the route after Christmas.  I heard from the provider, Bus &Eacute;ireann, this morning that the service was guaranteed until Christmas and I welcome the clarification today that it will review and perhaps consider the service as part of the PSO at that point.  I hope some lessons are learned from this exercise.  While I appreciate that the Minister may not have direct operational responsibility, I hope he will bring to the NTA's attention the manner in which this decision was communicated.  Does he share our concerns that a tweet late in the evening announcing the cancellation of a service established for over ten years, with zero engagement, is not the way to go?</p>  <p>  If there is to be a review, I would welcome the opportunity for engagement, as would, I am sure, all Deputies from Kildare.  I would suggest a number of improvements.  I will not detail them all now but they include suggestions on the timetable and stops on the route.  I can think of a number of changes off the top of my head that would improve the service if it is loss-making, although I am sceptical about that.  Perhaps we could help the company turn this around by making some tweaks which would make the service more popular and useful.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to press the company to engage with the users of the route and Members of the Oireachtas before it makes a decision on this service.  It is critical that lessons are learned from such an engagement.</p></speech>

I presume the NTA's promise to carry out a review is also welcome.  The Deputies will have plenty of opportunities to make representations before a decision is made.  I will convey to the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann what they said about the way in which the announcement was made.</p></speech>

He normally takes pride in the fact that he always takes his own Topical Issue matters but there may be a genuine excuse.  Had I known that, I would have requested this for another day.</p>  <p>  In my county of Donegal, 17 post offices are either closing or due to close.  This is a result of a protocol presented to the Government by An Post, and the Government accepted that protocol.  It related to post offices in areas with a population of less than 500.  They are not a population.  They are rural settlements.  It was a deceitful way to have done this.  There was no commercial analysis, no economic analysis and no rural proofing.  It is fine for the people of Dublin to be 2 km from a post office but what about the people of rural Ireland?</p>  <p>  People will have to walk or cycle or perhaps use public transport, if it is available.  I refer to 15 km.  The people of rural Ireland, and particularly the people of my county, have been conned by this Government.  I came in here with others and we voted unanimously on an amendment to provide a public service obligation, PSO, for those rural areas.  What has the Government done?  It has ignored it.  Together with colleagues, I went to public meetings around the constituency.  Committees were selected.  Days and hours were spent preparing submissions.  For whom were those submissions?  They were submissions to reviewers appointed by An Post.  What other decision would we expect from those reviewers?</p>  <p>  I know the name of one.  I am not questioning their integrity but I believe it was only a box-ticking exercise.  As I said earlier, it was a deceitful way of dealing with the people of rural Ireland.  I went to the GPO, together with my colleagues, Deputies Pearse Doherty and Pringle, with bags full of submissions.  We might as well have put a match to them in the middle of O'Connell Street because they had no effect whatsoever.  It is not good enough that An Post and the Government have not accepted the will of this House and a unanimous decision by this House.  The Government has totally ignored it.  We are not prepared to accept this and it has conned the people of rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I welcome the reappointment of Deputy Canney as a Minister of State and I wish him well in his post.  It is, however, an insult that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is not here.  There is insult after insult.  Newcastle Save Our Post Office committee sent its appeal by registered post on 26 September 2018.  It expected and was led to believe that it would have a decision within 28 days.  A committee member contacted An Post on 21 October 2018 because they still had not received any news about their appeal.  The committee was informed that it was with an independent assessor.  Independent my eye.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Gallagher said, this is a box-ticking exercise.  The appeal was a comprehensive one.  I salute the committee.  After a huge public meeting in Newcastle, the committee substantially tackled and addressed each item listed in the protocol with supporting maps, photographs, letters and almost 1,000 signatures from the small village I represent in south Tipperary and the Waterford border.  The appeal itself was seven pages long.  The so-called independent assessor did not have the manners to contact the committee, acknowledge it or even to ring.</p>  <p>  We found out this morning that a local councillor got a letter.  The committee itself has got no letter yet stating that its appeal was turned down.  This is outrageous.  The Minister of State is back in power.  I ask him to go back to his senior Minister and tell him to put manners on these An Post officials and the so-called independent assessor.  The committee worked very hard to put together a substantial appeal and the committee members are answerable to the community through a public meeting.  It was a public process which was engaged in and the committee has nothing to tell them.  The committee has not even got a letter.</p>  <p>  Kilmeaden post office in Waterford got it today as well.  The closure was part of a dirty filthy agreement reached between the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, and An Post.  It was just another aspect of the unembarrassed contempt for rural Ireland that the Government, which the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, chose to join again, has for the people of rural Ireland.  In April 2018, the IPU hyped up the outcome of the negotiations with An Post as an outcome that was, allegedly, all about maintaining the delivery of local post office services throughout the State.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is losing his own constituency and he knows it.  Today we know those words were meaningless.  The people are not cared about.  The so-called agreement included a &euro;50 million investment package to fund the post office network and negotiated redundancy settlements, and it was sold as snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.  Where is the victory for our post office?  People have been told to travel 7 km to Ardfinnan.  What happens if they do not have a car or if they are not able to drive?  There is no taxi service and there is no bus service.  This is an insult to rural Ireland.  Rural proofing my backside.  There is no such thing as rural proofing here.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to do that.  The Government is committed to supporting a post office network that meets the needs of communities throughout the country, particularly in rural areas.  A modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses as well as Government services.  We are all cognisant of the valued and dedicated service that postmasters the length and breadth of the country have given to rural and urban communities over many years.</p>  <p>  Across the country, postmasters have taken the difficult decision in recent months to leave the business.  It is important to bear in mind that this was a voluntary decision and I am sure that the decisions were not taken lightly.  It is important that the decision of those who wish to leave the business is respected.  The decision on whether to accept the package was solely one for individual postmasters.</p>  <p>  I understand the concerns of older people and communities and that this is an anxious time for many of them.  I remind Deputies that more than 500 post offices closed during the economic boom between 2002 and 2007, including 30 post offices in Deputy Gallagher's county of Donegal.  No action was taken and the post office network was allowed to fall into decline.  No new investment or services were put into it during this period.  This Government did not want that to continue.</p>  <p>  The postmasters of this country and the communities they serve deserve a clear future and a plan to be put in place for the development of and investment into the post office network and its services.  We have now set out a clear path and future for the post office network.  Almost two years ago, we were presented with a future for An Post and the post office network that was uncertain and extremely bleak.  There was a real possibility that the company would go under.  The potential for a complete shutdown of postal services with the loss of thousands of jobs was undeniable.  Immediate action was needed to ensure the survival of An Post and the post office network.  This was necessary to protect thousands of jobs across the country and specifically the 9,000 people working in An Post.  Two years later, critically important decisions have been made.  An Post has been stabilised because of the action that has been taken.  The company is changing from a 19th century model to one that has relevance and can have resonance in the 21st century in rural and in urban areas.</p>  <p>  There is widespread acceptance that the post office network requires modernisation to build, maintain and protect a service that meets the needs of communities throughout the country.  An Post's renewed vision for the post office network centres on the availability of new services in a modernised and revitalised network.  These services must include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses.</p></speech>

Key to the future network will be the willingness of us all to use it.  The agreement reached by the Irish Postmasters Union is essential to delivering on the renewed vision for the post office network.  In negotiations with An Post, postmasters and postmistresses sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business.  Talks were concluded between An Post and the IPU in April this year following three months of intensive negotiations.</p>  <p>  The agreement was subsequently endorsed by 80% of the members of the IPU.  An independent appeals process was put in place to enable communities to have reviewed a decision relating to their local post office.  In addition, any retailer in any of the locations of the 159 post offices can apply to An Post to be considered to take over some or all of the services of the closing post office.  If a retailer seeks to avail of services and if An Post decides for one reason or another not to provide them, that decision can also be submitted for review to an independent process.</p><p>The deadline for receipt of appeals under this process was 31 October.  I have been advised that 50 cases were submitted for review by the closing date from 159.</p></speech>

He knows rural Ireland as well as I do.  The response was prepared by An Post and endorsed by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The one honest sentence indicates this was based on a "voluntary redundancy package" so why would 80% of the post office union not endorse it?  It was in their interests.  I am not critical of those who accepted the redundancy package but An Post should have replaced the services lost where people took the package.  The response further indicates that some of the services or all could be provided in another retailer.  The deadline for that was Wednesday, 31 October.  How can we ask these people to run a business when decisions were not taken until into November and some will not be taken until December?  How could a submission be made in advance of that?</p>  <p>  It is a very sad day.  If the Minister has a duplication of business, it means this is less important than the business he is now attending to.  To us this is the most important business being discussed in this House today.  It is a total insult to us as Deputies and to rural Ireland that this is being done.  It is just not good enough.  We are not prepared to accept this.  We are looking for the Minister to meet a representative cross-party group of Deputies to discuss this matter and the associated protocols.  Who appointed these people?  It is a box ticking exercise.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to confirm tonight that the Minister will meet that group of rural Deputies.</p></speech>

This is a rotten and stinking deal done by the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU.  Who gave it any mandate to close post offices?  I salute all the postmasters and postmistresses.  More power to any of them who took the redundancy as they are entitled to it.  Park that first of all.  It did not give the IPU the right to negotiate away services from my village in Newcastle in Tipperary or the other five villages in Tipperary losing their post offices.  The Minister would not even come in here, which demonstrates his disdain.</p>  <p>  I have written to the four Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies, including Deputy Michael McGrath, who are renegotiating the confidence and supply agreement.  If Fianna F&aacute;il cares about rural Ireland, with the Government it will prioritise these post offices and disband this cabal of people on a so-called independent inquiry team.  Its members had neither the manners nor the respect to write back to our committee in Newcastle, which has gone about its work diligently and honestly.  This is a cop-out and disgrace for the Minister of State to say what he has about this being successful.</p></speech>

Indeed, one cannot really understand the enormous movement around water charges, property tax and bin taxes without understanding the burning sense of grievance that working people feel over the historically unjust character of the tax system.  It is not that workers are unreasonable.  They have been out on the streets on these issues again and again since before the Minister's time in politics or mine.  Taken in the round, workers justifiably feel that the tax system is unfair and disproportionately punishes them while letting the wealthy and large corporations off the hook of making a tax contribution to fund our services and society.</p><p>In that regard, the universal social charge was a bitter pill to swallow, as were the property tax, water charges and so on.  Since it was Revenue that took the USC and, subsequently, property tax, there was not much that workers could do, but they expressed their fury on the issue of water charges.  One should be in no doubt that the anger expressed on water was also an anger at the property tax, USC and many indirect and hidden taxes and charges that working people have to put up with.</p><p>It is in that context that this amendment attempts to redress the balance in the tax injustice that pervades the Irish tax system.  Our amendment proposes to get rid of USC for everyone earning less than &euro;90,000, a commitment that this Government made, and to pay for it by making some of the wealthiest in society pay their fair share.  There is something of a false debate about whether the Government should be promising tax cuts as against spending on public services.  I do not accept that as the correct parameter for the debate.  There can be tax justice for workers and more money for public services if the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share.  This is one of a suite of amendments that we have proposed to move in that direction.  I do not expect that the Minister will accept them, but they must nonetheless be aired.</p><p>The specific proposal in this amendment is that USC for those earning less than &euro;90,000 should be abolished and replaced with four additional bands of taxation on those earning in excess of &euro;100,000 so that people earning between &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000 pay 50% tax on that portion of income, people earning between &euro;140,000 and &euro;180,000 pay 55%, people earning between &euro;180,000 and &euro;250,000 pay 60%, and people earning more than &euro;250,000 pay 65%.  According to the Minister's response to my parliamentary question, this would raise &euro;2.1 billion.  That is a lot of money, and we could use it to give tax relief to workers at the lower end without undermining the famous tax base.</p><p>This is about shifting the tax balance from those who have been hard hit, the very people the Taoiseach was talking about at the weekend.  Let us take some pressure off them and pay for it by making those who are not paying their fair share do so.  It is a small cohort of people.  According to the CSO, the wealthiest 10% in society get 40% of the income.  I always laugh when I hear the Minister or the Taoiseach saying that the wealthiest 10% pay 40% of the taxes.  Of course they do.  It is because they have 40% of the income.  Proportionately, though, and when all of the indirect taxes, USC and so on are taken into account, are they paying the same amount of their income as people at the bottom?  They are not.  That was confirmed by the Comptroller and Auditor General when he pointed out that an incredible 90 of the richest individuals in this country, high net worth individuals who have well in excess of &euro;50 million each, are paying less tax than the average worker and are managing to do so on the basis of loopholes and tax reliefs of which they can avail.</p><p>This brings me to my final point.  It is a bit rich that, at the same time as the Taoiseach talked at the weekend about giving relief to working people in terms of tax, we discovered that Revenue was making a grab for the tiny bit of tax relief that some of the lowest paid and most precariously employed workers in this country enjoyed.</p><p>We are talking here about &euro;85 million in reliefs claimed by shop assistants, freelance actors whose working lives are totally precarious, freelance journalists and so on.  A further grab may be made for allowances claimed by construction workers, bar staff and others who receive relief of a few hundred euro.  At the same time, the Comptroller and Auditor General has identified an incredible &euro;213 billion worth of reliefs and allowances that are benefiting big corporations and the very wealthy.  We must address these double standards.  The amendment would make an attempt to move in that direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000038#LL00200"><p>Any debate we have in this House on the income tax system must be placed in the context of the challenges the country faces, particularly the deficits evident across a range of public services.  As elected representatives, we are all well aware of the deficits.  In the health service there are issues with disability services, families waiting for extra home help hours or home care packages and young children waiting for special needs assessments under the Disability Act.  We are all well aware of the housing crisis which is multifaceted in nature.  Whether we are discussing tax cuts or increases, the debate must take place in that context.</p>  <p>  As a country, we have one of the most progressive tax systems in the developed world.  In Fianna F&aacute;il we believe the people who have the most should pay the most.  We have a tax system which recognises that reality and has been developed over a long period of time.  It is fair to say that in the early years of the crisis the introduction of USC in an amalgamation of the old health and income levies represented a significant increase in the burden of taxation on workers and pensioners.  That needs to be recognised and is why it is important to reduce, in a gradual and sustainable way, the burden of taxation on the shoulders of workers and many pensioners.  However, the notion that one can just increase dramatically the burden of taxation on people above a certain level of income without consequences for everyone else is not one to which I subscribe.  In the context of attracting foreign direct investment or encouraging SMEs in Ireland to scale up, there would be consequences if we were to have an income tax environment that was punitive for those earning what would be regarded as high levels of income.  There would be consequences for those working in less senior positions too. </p>  <p>  The amendment proposed by Deputy Boyd Barrett does not specify rates for the different bands, but the Deputy elaborated on the matter in his contribution.  The amendment is not placed within a context which must be the challenges we are facing as a country and the clear deficits across a range of public services.  We believe there is a need to gradually reduce the burden of income tax, but in so doing we must respect and maintain the progressive nature of the tax system such that those who earn the most pay the most.  That should be the cornerstone within which we frame future changes.</p></speech>

The demographic changes taking place here are in sharp contrast to what other European countries are experiencing.  While they will provide a great boon for Ireland, it would be very foolish for any party to suggest the enormous increases in the numbers of older people and children will not be costly, particularly in areas such as health and education.</p><p>In the context of USC, there is a lot of merit in looking back to what was in place before the charge was introduced.  If we are serious about Sl&aacute;intecare, for example, which has received cross-party support and the development of a national health service in Ireland, we need funding streams.  However, we cannot just say, as the motion implies, that a couple earning &euro;100,000 should be taxed at a rate of 50%.  That would be way out of line with what ordinary people could bear.  In the original paper written by the ESRI USC was described as a universal social contribution.  When I was in government, I proposed reducing the USC burden on individuals or couples with an income of less than &euro;70,000.  USC, as originally proposed approximately 12 years ago, should be converted into a universal health contribution, with the funds raised to be used for the establishment of Sl&aacute;intecare.  A specific fund for its establishment and some funding earmarked for the HSE over and above that provided by the Minister for Finance every year would allow for planning to meet the growing demands on the health service.  When I was in government, medical cards for the under sixes were introduced.  As I understand it, the Minister agrees in principle that medical cards should be provided for children under 12 years and then children under 18.  We should also bring down the age at which older people are entitled to receive a medical card.  In that way, we could provide universal medical care for most of the population.  By all means, the Minister should review USC, but at this time, given the demands on the Exchequer on foot of population growth and an ageing population, it must be accepted that the financial position is still quite tight.  Rather than abolishing USC, we should earmark the funds generated for spending on health services.</p><p>The Taoiseach made a lot of comments at the weekend about the self-employed in the context of payment of income tax.  That is fine, but it is important to bear in mind that the Government has not yet implemented the recommendations made in a report on bogus self-employment that I commissioned when I was in office.  The report examined the incidence of people who were not declaring themselves to be employed but forced to declare themselves as self-employed.  The PAYE tax credit was introduced to provide for an element of fair play for PAYE workers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the self-employed.  As the Minister knows, self-employed persons can legally write off against tax expenses incurred in the course of employment but those in the PAYE sector cannot.</p><p>In fact, we understand the Minister is about to abolish the origins of the very small allowances for those who work in the retail sector, including shop assistants.  They are in place to provide for a small evening of the scales as a consequence of the significant allowances available to the self-employed.  This is all about balance and fairness and raising sufficient amounts of money in a fair way from the tax system to allow us, as a country, to do the things we desire.  The way the amendment is worded, were the Minister to carry it out, it would certainly be a bonanza for his officials, particularly in the case of somebody like the deputy manager of a retail shop who is earning about &euro;60,000 and whose partner or spouse is perhaps earning about &euro;40,000.  The suggestion is their tax liability would be upped to 50%, which is pretty draconian.  That may not be the purpose of the amendment, but that is what it is stating.</p></speech>

Perhaps Deputy Boyd Barrett might clarify the matter.  I completely understand the principle behind it, but I do not think it would be the right way to go for a number of reasons.  Some 28% are already exempt from USC.  We need to continue to take lower paid workers out of the USC net and continue to ensure the wealthiest in society pay it.  The Government previously stated it wanted to abolish USC.  I am sure at one stage every party represented in this Chamber stated they wanted to abolish it.  It needs to be looked at as a tax from which the wealthiest in society cannot whittle away through reliefs or tax credits.  It is based on one's income.  If one earns more, one will pay more.  In that sense, it is potentially progressive or, at least, has the potential to be progressive, given that it cannot be whittled away from through tax credits and reliefs.  If those on the lower scales were exempt and the level of USC was marginally increased for the wealthiest in society, in effect, it would be progressive taxation.  For that reason, Sinn F&eacute;in will be opposing the amendment put forward by Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>

I will use the hypothetical example of a married couple on one income with no children, although this point will stand for all citizens in different circumstances.</p>  <p>  A married couple with a single income of &euro;20,000 pay tax at an effective rate of 3.4%, including USC.  A married couple earning &euro;25,000 pay tax at an effective rate of 6.0%.  A married couple earning &euro;175,000 pay tax at an effective rate of 42.3%.</p>  <p>  I offer these figures to the House for two reasons, the first of which is to emphasise how progressive the tax code is.  Owing to the existence of the universal social charge and the fact that it is paid earlier in one's income and that one pays at a higher rate as one earns more, when combined with the income tax code, we have an exceptionally progressive income tax system overall.  Making the point that people on high incomes are in some way not paying their share of income tax, in comparison to those on low incomes, does not take account of those very figures which show that the more income a person earns, the more he or she pays in tax.</p>  <p>  The other consequence of this structure is those effective tax rates for people on low levels of income increasingly show the challenge any political party in this House will have in making a change to the tax code for somebody on a low income that will not cost the Exchequer a very large amount.  Such a tax change would flow all the way up income levels and deliver a very marginal benefit to somebody on a low income because the effective rate at which he or she pays tax is already at a low level.  As I said, a person earning &euro;25,000 pays tax at an effective rate of 6%.</p>  <p>  The point I make to Deputy Boyd Barrett is that the figures demonstrate how progressive the tax code is.  He made reference to the information on the work of the Revenue Commissioner on the allowance for certain workers.  Today the Taoiseach confirmed that this work would be deferred until 1 January 2020.  The principle is not changing.  The Revenue Commissioners were looking at another way to ensure an expense would be taxed in the right way.  That is what the Revenue Commissioners are looking to do.  The principle underpinning the tax code is that, if one has an expense, it will be treated in a different way for tax purposes than if one has an income.  That principle will not change.  Revenue was looking at how this could be administered and, as I reconfirmed, this work will be deferred until early 2020.</p>  <p>  The key point I make to Deputy Boyd Barrett about his amendment is that it has been estimated that the removal of the application of USC to all income below &euro;90,000 would cost in the region of &euro;2 billion per year.  In fairness to him, the Deputy offers other ways by which that income would be raised through the introduction of four new income tax bands.  If we were to look to find all of the lost revenue in taxing incomes below &euro;90,000 in an additional tax yield from incomes above &euro;90,000, it would mean that the new income tax bands would need to be as high as 71.25% to raise all of the revenue that would be lost as a result of the change proposed by the Deputy.  A tax rate of that level would have very serious and damaging consequences across the economy.  There are many citizens on that high level of income who are important in the operation of hospitals and the running of companies, all of whom either provide really important employment within the country or enable the provision of really specialised public services.  Such a tax rate would damage our ability to ensure that work took place here.  The Deputy referenced the tax base and acknowledged its importance.  The effect of such a change would be that anybody earning up to &euro;1,700 per week would not pay the universal social charge.  If one shares my principle that anybody earning above a certain level of income should be making a contribution to the provision of public services on which he or she depends, that is an income level that would be too high.</p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>For those reasons I am not accepting the amendment the Deputy has put forward.</p> <p> I note with interest what Deputy Burton said about the formation of the universal social charge and its history.  Deputy Michael McGrath made the point that it arose from the integration of the old health and income levies, albeit at a far lower level of income.  My concern, which I know the Deputy will understand although he will disagree with it, is that if I begin to segment particular forms of tax revenue and say that they have to go into the provision of a particular service, I will be faced with many demands to do so for other services, which in turn would reduce the flexibility needed in respect of the allocation of resources.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General identified &euro;231 billion in allowances and losses brought forward.  The figure is so big it is mind-boggling.  The gross trading profits of the corporate sector were &euro;80 billion higher than its taxable income in 2016.  That is the scale of these loopholes.  As against that figure, the allowances at which the Minister is looking or which Revenue is going to go after, most of which are given to working people who are relatively low-paid and precariously employed, amount to &euro;85 million.  Hundreds of thousands of workers get little tiny loopholes in the form of real, justifiable allowances based on the cost of working and the corporations get &euro;231 billion.  That is just not fair.  It is not even fair to look at the workers' allowances, which they really need.  They are a couple of hundred quid.  They are contributions towards the cost of getting to work, uniforms, tools, or whatever else it might be while an enormous amount is being written off in terms of taxable income for those at the top.  That needs to be looked at.</p>  <p>  I am going to keep banging on about it until we force the details of these allowances, reliefs and loopholes into the public view so that they can be scrutinised and so that they have to be justified.  Frankly, that has not happened.  It is beginning to happen a bit in respect of some of them, but we have a hell of a long way to go.  We should not even be looking at low-paid workers.  This asks for a report.  For the benefit of Deputy Burton, we were talking about individual incomes, not combined incomes.  That is the first point.</p>  <p>  Second, the examples the Minister gave leave out the middle cohort.  Workers on &euro;35,000, &euro;40,000, &euro;45,000, &euro;50,000, &euro;60,000 and so on are paying quite a lot of tax when - and this is the point I made at the very outset - it is added to all the other forms of indirect tax, such as property taxes, bin charges, and water charges.  Luckily we have defeated the latter for now.  There are many other areas in which people are paying stealth taxes such as the public service obligation levy on utility bills and so on.  It all adds up to an additional tax burden on working people that is disproportionate when compared with how these charges impact on people at the top.  The Minister's point about people paying taxes at a lower level might be justified if there were not all of these extraneous costs, which are in effect taxes, imposed on people for just about everything they do.  That is the point.  It is not just me saying that.  That is the reason people were out on the streets.  It was not because populists stirred them up but because people are furious about this stuff.</p></speech>

He is confirming that what was previously put on the D&aacute;il record about changes coming into effect in January 2019 has now changed and that they will come into effect in January 2020.  Will he clarify what will occur in the meantime?  Revenue had already decided to withdraw the flat-rate allowance system from a number of categories.  Is that withdrawal frozen and held over until January 2020?  Has the decision been made in principle to withdraw the flat-rate expense system and to replace it with a system under which people would claim relief for expenses actually incurred?  Is it the case that the review will continue or is it the case that the decision has been made to move away from that system to a system under which employees would claim relief for expenses incurred?  Are all changes postponed to January 2020?  Will the Minister clear that up, please?</p></speech>

It might be useful for the Minister to clarify that.  What are the areas that are to be investigated?  In the context of budgetary oversight and so on, we are supposed to have information.  To be honest and fair, many workers did not know about the potential withdrawal of the baseline expenses to which they are entitled.  Given that the allowances are so small, particularly if one takes into account people like shop workers who receive an allowance of &euro;120 a year, their removal would cancel the effect of the budget for those who receive them.  It would take any gain they got in the budget away from them.  I welcome the postponement to 2020, but the Minister should remember that these were introduced a long time ago, perhaps 50, 60, or 70 years ago.  They have been available in respect of a variety of different jobs and professions for a very long time.</p>  <p>  The Minister should bear in mind, when talking about rebalancing the tax system, that PAYE workers deserve to be considered in terms of fairness.  Much of this Government's message is around people who are self-employed, but it should be borne in mind that self-employed people prepare accounts or have accounts prepared for them.  They have significant expenses deductions.  The expenditure is in the interests of the business but the deductions are significant.  The Minister knows that the bulk, if not all, of the income of everybody sitting in this room is subject to PAYE.  It is a pretty flat rate system, which is proper, and which includes relatively few allowances that do not also apply to the self-employed.  I am glad the Minister is reconsidering it.  It might be appropriate to abandon it.</p></speech>

On the point Deputy Boyd Barrett put to me in respect of the effective tax rates for people on middle incomes, I have those figures.  For a person on &euro;35,000, the effective tax rate is 12.4%.  For a person on &euro;45,000, it goes up to 16%.  They are the effective tax rate figures for people on those levels of income.  Of course what is concealed there is that the marginal tax rate can be very high.  As people go up a level of income, and particularly as they cross the standard rate cut-off point, they face a very high marginal rate.  That is why the Taoiseach indicated that, if we had the opportunity to put a series of further budgets in place, the standard rate cut-off point would move ahead of the average wage in our economy.  I am committed to making that happen.  That decision makes sense.  It will reward work and deal with the difficulty we have in terms of those on middle incomes facing a very high marginal tax rate.</p>  <p>  On the question Deputy Michael McGrath put to me, I will reiterate what I said earlier.</p><p>Expenses that are wholly, exclusively and necessarily included for the purposes of work will continue to be claimable under the Taxes Consolidation Act.  That is not changing.  The Revenue Commissioners informed me that the matter will be reviewed next year and that there will not be any change to how they implement this policy until 1 January 2020.</p></speech>

Somehow, 90 of the richest individuals with extraordinary wealth, &euro;50 million on average, are paying less or about the same tax as the average industrial worker.  Something is wrong there.  That speaks to another fact which is that, overall, income inequality in Ireland before social transfers is pretty high by international standards.  This point has been made by the CSO and others.  If there are high levels of income inequality to start with, one ends up with even higher levels of wealth inequality over time.  That is very evident with the CSO again confirming that the richest 10% have 54% of the wealth.  That is in line with an international pattern where wealth and income are becoming more and more concentrated in the hands of the top earners.  Wage share as a share of national income is falling consistently, and Ireland is seeing one of the biggest falls.  I am trying to say there is something wrong with that trajectory and that we need radical measures to address it.  That means radically shifting the balance of taxation when one is earning over &euro;100,000.  It is important to say that for the earnings lower than that, people will benefit from not having to pay USC or property tax and so on.  It tries to shift the balance radically so there is a very steep cliff once one goes over the threshold of &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

The case is being made that we have to give consistent signals and not have a tax system that steers people towards a certain action and then changes the ground underneath them.  While that applies to a very small number of people in this case, the principle is worth upholding and I have often heard finance officials, when the Minister comes in with tax or other proposals, argue with themselves about the need for the tax system to be consistent and predictable and not to steer people in a certain direction and then change the rules.  It was not precise but there were clear statements by the relevant Ministers in advertising and other materials from Government that there was an intention to have a three-year period where there would be an exemption to benefit-in-kind provisions for certain types of electric vehicles.</p><p>I think the Minister accepted on Committee Stage that there was an argument and he wanted time to consider it.  If I am reading it correctly, I think he has gone a long way to recognising that we want that consistent approach.  As I see it, the only difference is that it would be a two-year continued exemption rather than three.  I presume the Minister would argue that that gives people time to sell a vehicle.  I welcome his acceptance of that point.  While it is a very small number, for those people, there is a basic principle that the State should act in a predictable and consistent manner.  Given that the Minister's amendments seem to bring us in that direction, I welcome them and, unless I have missed something, that he is willing to make such a provision.  It is two years rather than three but I think it is a significant improvement for those individuals.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's amendment.  I think it was patently unfair to change the goalposts for those for whom a car had been provided by their company over the course of 2018 up to budget day.  That was certainly unfair.  I think the Minister has recognised that because various promotional material was produced following the budget last year which made it clear that the benefit-in-kind at 0% would last for at least three years and there was no reference to a cap.  I acknowledge the number of people affected is quite modest.  The signal it sends is important.  If we change the goalposts for incentives that we are introducing to encourage people to move away from fossil fuels, fossil fuel investments, vehicles and so on and then do not see it through, there is an issue of trust that could potentially damage our tax system and the support for people to buy into the changes that we all need to move towards.</p>  <p>  I want to raise two issues.  This may be the only case in the country but a scenario has been brought to my attention where a company entered into a binding legal contract to purchase a vehicle for an employee in September but the vehicle cannot be provided until January.  In the wording of the Minister's amendment, he removes the &euro;50,000 cap where the car was first made available to the employee up to 9 October 2018.  That does not deal with the scenario here which may well be the only one or there are very few in the country where a contractual commitment was entered into.  I see the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, shaking his head.  When other changes have been made to taxation systems, such as stamp duty, the cut-off point has been determined by the entering into of a contractual commitment.  That defined the cut-off point, but what the Minister has defined as the cut-off point is the making available of the car to the employee.  That is different and I want to raise that issue with the Minister to see if there is any flexibility that might address the situation.</p>  <p>  The second point, which is the same as Deputy Ryan's, relates to the timeframe.  I assume the Minister's logic is that year one of the three years for people who will not now be subject to the &euro;50,000 cap is 2018, with year two being 2019 and year three being 2020, whereas the benefit-in-kind exemption applies, subject to the cap, for everybody else up to the end of 2021.  There is a difference of a year which I assume is because the Minister gave a three-year commitment and is taking 2018 to be year one, which is a case he can argue.  The issue of where a contractual commitment was entered into is one I ask him to look at in the interests of fairness.  In the case I am aware of, the commitment was made and a legally enforceable contract entered into on the basis of what was pledged and enacted in law last year.</p></speech>

Having regard to the value for money and tax equity considerations, the Minister announced a cap of &euro;50,000 on the original market value of the vehicle that can be fully relieved from benefit-in-kind.  It was noted that this cap received full support on Committee Stage but that Deputies Ryan and McGrath want it to be disapplied for employees or directors who had electric vehicles made available to them between budget 2018 and budget 2019 on the basis that such persons had reasonable expectations that a cap would not be applied.  In recognition of the points made by Deputies Ryan and McGrath, I am tabling my own amendment to section 9.  The effect of this amendment is that the cap will not be applied for the tax years 2019 and 2020 to employees or directors in possession of electric vehicles that were first made available to them between 10 October 2017 and 9 October 2018.</p><p>On 1 January 2021, the &euro;50,000 cap will apply to all electric vehicles regardless of when they were first made available.<br/><br/>Deputy McGrath remarked on the consideration of an individual.

I look at all the issues brought to my attention with an open mind and with fairness as the guiding principle.  The wording used by the Minister covers where the car was first made available to the employee up to 9 October 2018, and in that circumstance the Department is not applying the &euro;50,000 cap.  In the case I am aware of the company had made a binding commitment.  It had entered into a contract with the employee and with the supplier of the vehicle prior to 9 October 2018.  The wording of the amendment does not accommodate that situation.  I do not know whether there is any flexibility or willingness to look at such a case.  Will the Minister of State consider bringing forward a change in the Seanad?</p></speech>

It aims to reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals in their companies from abroad to take up positions in their Irish based operations.  The relief is time limited on the basis that it is expected that assignees will transfer skills to Irish-based employees over the course of the five-year period and thus support the establishment of long-term high-quality employment.</p><p>Ireland's enterprise policy is based on export-led growth underpinned by innovation, talent and technologies to deliver long-term sustainable economic growth.  Foreign direct investment has been and continues to be an integral part of Ireland's economic development.  The existence of an incentive like SARP is an acknowledgement that we are competing on a global basis for highly skilled and mobile executives.  The competition for this talent is intense, especially for the types of skills required to facilitate the development and expansion of business in Ireland.</p><p>Specialist assignee tax relief schemes are in operation in many of the jurisdictions that we compete with for foreign direct investment.  These kinds of incentives can be a persuasive factor.  In tandem with our corporation tax rate, SARP is intended to help us to compete for foreign direct investment.  Under the relief, a proportion of earnings from SARP employment is disregarded for income tax purposes.  The proportion is 30% of income above &euro;75,000.  USC continues to be payable as is PRSI depending on the individual circumstances.</p><p>Employer returns to Revenue indicate that in 2016 a total of 1,084 non-assignee jobs were supported as a result of SARP.  The figure is greatly increased from the early years of the incentive.  In 2012, for example, only six non-assignee jobs were supported by SARP.  Available evidence suggests that the programme is achieving its goals.</p><p>A review and public consultation on the incentive in 2014 raised concerns.  Accordingly, several changes were made to SARP in budget 2015, including the removal of a cap of &euro;500,000 in eligible income from SARP beneficiaries in the hope of increasing uptake and encouraging the growth of higher quality foreign direct investment.  In the years subsequent to the review Revenue analysis has shown that the incentive has greatly increased in popularity, with 793 individuals availing of the scheme in 2016 and employers reporting job creation and retention directly as a result of the scheme.  However, as Deputies will note from the recently published Revenue report on SARP, the cost of the scheme stood at &euro;18.1 million in 2016.  This is an increase from &euro;9.5 million in the previous years.  The report indicates some of this increase can be attributable to a small number of individuals claiming SARP in respect of particularly high incomes of over &euro;1 million.  There were 18 such individuals in 2016.  The report found that the number of participants earning an annual income in excess of &euro;675,000 increased by 340% in the period from 2014 to 2016.  Moreover, although the number of beneficiaries in 2016 earning annual incomes of &euro;1 million or more was relatively modest, the percentage increase has been in the order of 800%.  It has gone up eightfold, from two in 2014 to 18 in 2016.  It should be remembered that the average salary under SARP when the incentive was introduced in 2012 was a little under &euro;150,000.  This amount has increased to approximately &euro;250,000 and almost half of the individuals in SARP are in receipt of salaries between &euro;75,000 and &euro;150,000.  The increase in cost for this reason was not anticipated when the cap was removed and I have decided that the amount of relief being claimed at high incomes raises equity issues.  I believe I must address these issues without delay.</p><p>I propose to reimpose a cap of &euro;1 million in eligible earnings for new entrants.  Based on the 2016 figures this would affect fewer than 2.5% of recipients.  The changes will apply from 1 January 2019 for new entrants and from 1 January 2020 for existing recipients.</p><p>Reimposing the cap in this manner will ensure that the scheme is not open to over-exploitation while leaving those with incomes under &euro;1 million - still an exceptionally high income - unaffected.  This scheme is due for full review during the course of 2019.  The review will afford us an opportunity to look at all elements of the scheme.  Given that I intend to commission this report in advance of the Finance Bill 2019, I do not propose to accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty. </p> <p> A number of stakeholders made the case that the current 30 day application reporting period is too restrictive given the delays faced in obtaining a personal public service number, PPSN, and other pressures faced by individuals in relocating to Ireland.  Given that I am making a Report Stage amendment to the incentive and the fact that this is primarily an administrative matter, I propose to make a further technical amendment which will see the reporting timeframe extended from 30 to 90 days for initial reporting by the employer to Revenue after the arrival of the employee in the State.</p></speech>

On amendment No. 11, the Minister said that he could not have foreseen the inequity in this when the cap was first lifted.  I have to say that he was warned at the time.  Deputy Pearse Doherty highlighted this in his speech on the Finance Bill 2015 when the cap was removed and the programme extended.  He said that the costs would eventually spiral out of control, and that is on the record.  This is certainly a step in the right direction.  We are quick enough to criticise the Minister, but we will support his amendment on this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000043#QQ00400"><p>Some of the numbers put on the record by the Minister concerning the growth in the scheme are quite extraordinary.  I have consistently made the point, on behalf of my party, that the kernel of the issue is whether there is a demonstrable link to employment creation and retention.  It is only in that circumstance that such a scheme can be justified to the hundreds of thousands of workers who pay comparatively high rates of tax.  In considering the impact of the changes made in 2015, it is clear that the cost more or less doubled in the first year, from &euro;9.5 million in 2015 to &euro;18.1 million in 2016.</p>  <p>  Tables one and two in annex three, provided by Revenue, help to illustrate my point about a demonstrable link between employment creation and retention and this scheme.  Table one shows the increase in the number of employees as reported by employers as a result of SARP.  It shows an increase of 477 in 2016.  The number of employees retained as a result of SARP, as reported by employers, was 607 that year.  A total of 1,100 employees were either recruited or retained specifically because of SARP, according to the employers.  I presume this will be captured by the review, but to what extent are those figures probed and to what extent can we show that there is a clear link between what is a really lucrative tax break for those who are benefiting on the one hand and employment creation and retention in our country on the other, which we all support?</p>  <p>  Looking at the spread of employees across salary bands for employers who made a SARP return, while the table does not explicitly tell us the salaries of those who benefited from SARP, it is clear that in 2016 four employees across different companies on whose behalf employers made a SARP return were earning between &euro;3 million and &euro;10 million, and 14 employees earned between &euro;1 million and &euro;3 million.  Those people were employees of companies which made a SARP return, but the table does not tell us if they were the employees who benefited from SARP.  The Minister has confirmed on the record that 18 employees earning in excess of &euro;1 million benefited from SARP in 2016, and the total number benefiting was close to 800.  The average salary for that cohort was &euro;250,000.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say that this scheme has grown beyond what was imagined when it was introduced.  The only circumstance in which this can be justified is one in which the Minister can say in this House that he has evidence that jobs have been created and retained in our country across the sectors in which this scheme is popular, including IT, financial services, pharmaceuticals and medical, consumer industrial products and services, and other areas of services.  That is what I want to hear.  I note that for the existing beneficiaries the Minister is retaining the existing situation until January 2020 and that the reinstatement of the cap will have an effect from January 2019 for new entrants.  The Minister might elaborate on the logic and reasoning for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000043#QQ00500"><p>I welcome the announcement of a study on this issue because we need to see the figures.  I am concerned that, while we are competing for businesses and trying to persuade them to relocate to Dublin in the context of financial services moving from London as a result of Brexit, we are in fact driving up some of the super-salaries available in the financial services sector in a way that is neither appropriate nor required.  That does not mean that people transferring from banking feel they should be paid &euro;10 million or &euro;11 million a year.  Those figures are not unusual in the City of London, but I do not know whether we require those kinds of salaries here.  We need to see more detail about this.  The Minister has commissioned a study on raising the cap on bankers' salaries.  I do not understand the argument that bankers should earn so much more than they already do.  Perhaps the Minister is changing the thresholds for the scheme for new entrants as a direct result of Brexit, but I have doubts as to whether it is a wise approach.</p>  <p>  This scheme is effectively for the benefit of accounting service companies and legal companies so that they can sell themselves to HR recruiters.  There is a lot of money in it for those companies in terms of services, particularly the bigger accounting firms and some of the bigger legal firms.  As we all know, those companies have a history of being highly adept at creating tax break structures in Ireland that, over time, become incredibly expensive.  The structures are rarely reviewed and there is often very little knowledge of what the schemes generate until years later.  I welcome the review, but I hope that we will see fairly detailed, decent and serious terms of reference in it and that there will be some genuine oversight of the review, allowing us to consider the pros and cons.</p><p>I question the wisdom of how some of these structures work.  I also wonder how much is paid in recruitment service fees to people making these arrangements or involved in them.  In effect, what is the real return?  There may be another way of approaching it.  We all want to see more jobs, but from what we know about the relief, these are likely to be mostly in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and other parts of Dublin.  We would all agree that what we need is more jobs outside Dublin and in rural Ireland.  Any relief of this type is extremely difficult, but if the Minister has some examples of significant numbers of jobs being generated in less well-off areas of our towns and cities or rural areas, I would be delighted to see the detail.  However, I do not believe there are many such jobs because the bulk of them are beside the River Liffey.</p></speech>

I am mindful of Deputy O'Brien's point about the degree to which the cost of this scheme has increased.  That is one of the reasons we will have a review of the operation of the scheme next year.  When I was presented with the figures on the operation of the scheme for the most recent year I decided on the grounds of tax equity that it had to change.  Bringing in the cap at what is still a high level of income strikes the right balance between attracting and retaining jobs here in Ireland and addressing the fact that the level of relief available to somebody on an income above &euro;1 million was too high.  That should change.</p>  <p>  I will cite some figures as an example.  Someone with an income of &euro;6 million who availed of the scheme would not have to pay a further &euro;700,000 in income tax.  Moreover, the relief available to somebody on an income of &euro;9 million would be in excess of &euro;1 million.  That is not appropriate and for this reason, we are introducing a cap.  It is important to take on board Deputy McGrath's point that if we are to stand over this scheme, we must be able to demonstrate its effect on the creation of jobs.  However, we also have to address equity issues for other citizens who are on a high income but are not participating in this scheme and, just as important, for all the low and middle-income workers who are indirectly contributing to the cost of the scheme by forfeiting income tax from very high-income participants.  It is for all these reasons that I am making this change.</p>  <p>  To answer Deputy McGrath's questions, he is correct on the issue of timing.  Participants with an income in excess of &euro;1 million who are already on the scheme will have the opportunity to continue to benefit from this scheme for a further year up to January 2020.  However, the scheme will change for any new participants from 1 January 2019.  In answer to the question about the effect of this programme in creating and retaining jobs, my Department's report will look at this issue, which will be among its terms of reference.  The review will examine the performance of the programme in meeting its objectives, including in attracting skilled individuals and key decision-makers to Irish-based operations.</p>  <p>  In regard to the issues that Deputy Burton raised, I believe there is a role for a programme such as this.  We have consulted the State agencies that are involved in this work on our behalf.  In certain sectors of the economy, certain individuals are highly mobile and if they are located here, they can play a role in the creation of additional jobs.  There is a role for a scheme like this, but in the absence of a cap, the scheme created issues of tax equity that needed to be addressed. </p></speech>

To provide some context, not all financial services jobs are on the riverside and in the docklands.  About one third of all jobs in the sector are in companies outside County Dublin, including some large employers.  For example, Northern Trust in Limerick employs 1,400 staff, Pramerica in Letterkenny has more than 1,000 staff, State Street employs more than 500 staff and BNY Mellon, which has a large number of staff in Dublin, also has offices in Wexford and Cork where it employs hundreds of people.  About one third of the 43,000 staff who are employed in international financial services are outside County Dublin.  Significant energy has been going into efforts to attract these jobs to the regions.</p></speech>

He said that somebody earning &euro;9 million would benefit to the tune of &euro;1 million per annum as a result of SARP.  To the best of my knowledge, the salaries of those benefitting from SARP at the higher end have not been provided.  Are individuals who are earning more than &euro;5 million a year currently benefitting from SARP?  The sums of money are extraordinary if that is the case.  The Minister needs to put that information on record because the House deserves it.  I certainly do not have it.</p>  <p>  Why is the Minister not reinstating the &euro;500,000 cap?  He is bringing in a cap of &euro;1 million, which is double the original cap.  He has confirmed that those who are currently earning more than &euro;1 million will continue to benefit from the existing arrangements up to January 2020 but has not given a reason for this.  Is it that he believes he needs to give due notice of such change to employers, individuals and so on?  The Minister needs to explain this decision.  Will he indicate what will be the nature of this review?  Who will carry it out?  Will it be led by the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners or an external body?  What exactly will they be asked to review?</p></speech>

It would obviously be possible for somebody earning &euro;500,000 to leave for a period before returning and qualifying for the programme  This scheme is not clear.  It is heavily marketed internationally by many big accounting firms.  We are asking the Minister to provide some evidence.  The Minister of State basically implied that if the scheme was not in place, companies such as State Street, which has been here for a very long time, could up sticks and leave the country.</p></speech>

I made a different point.  I asked about areas which were less well-off and rural areas.</p>  <p>  We have not heard, in relation to this Bill, details of lobbying by financial service providers.  I do not know what the fees are on the allocation of these particular jobs.  The Minister may not know but if he is having a study conducted, in all fairness, we should be told about it in order that we can make an objective decision.  In the context of Brexit, there are some people we do not particularly want in Ireland.  We want quality companies with quality jobs.  We do not want to end up paying significant tax bonuses willy-nilly to persons because leading executives earning large amounts of money come here.</p>  <p>  To reassure the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, I lobbied very successfully for jobs to go to Wexford at a time when there was little investment coming here.</p></speech>

Is this being done to add an extra gloss to our effort in the context of Brexit?  If so, are we clear what kinds of companies we are trying to attract?  We may want some operators and not others.  I am asking the Minister to ensure there is discrimination in terms of the quality of people and companies we are trying to attract to Ireland.  We want sustainable, decent and well-paid jobs.  We also want executives to be well paid but we do not want them to be paid ridiculous sums that result in inequality becoming much sharper.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister answer my question on avoidance?  Can a person leave the country and become non-resident for a year or two, before returning and claiming the higher relief?  I understand that is possible.</p></speech>

When it was first introduced Deputy Joan Burton, who was a Minister at the time, insisted that it was linked to jobs when it was not so linked.  It became evident that it was a way of introducing a lucrative tax reduction for high-income earners who were not already in the State.  We should bear in mind that the scheme provides for an exemption from tax of 30% of a person's earnings above &euro;75,000. </p>  <p>  To add insult to injury, the Government was led by the nose by accountants.  This scheme did not come from the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, or the Department.  It came, as we were hearing at the time, from accountants who suggested increasing the threshold and expanding this scheme on the basis that it would result in a significant number of new jobs.  The Government threw caution to the wind and refused to apply a cap.  We welcome that the Minister is at least recognising the folly of the Government's mistake and reverting to the position of having a cap in the legislation.  However, as my colleague pointed out, the scheme should be abolished.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on the Minister to explain how the cap of &euro;1 million was arrived at.  Where is the evidence to suggest that &euro;1 million is the appropriate amount?  Will the Minister state, in black and white, the amount of income that can be disregarded for tax purposes?  Will he also tell the House what has been the benefit of this scheme?  What real analysis has been done of the scheme?  I have looked at the forms that companies must fill out to enable their employees to avail of this relief and there is no doubt that gaming of the system could be taking place.  This is a lucrative tax relief for high income earners.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the decision to defer the flat-rate expenses, it is only a deferral because, as he indicated in reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister wants this to take effect with the abolition or restructuring of other flat-rate expenses.  Workers, whether nurses, members of the Defence Forces or teachers, will now look closely at what is in store for them in respect of flat-rate expenses.  Compared with the SARP, which allows for a portion of income above &euro;75,000 and up to &euro;1 million to be disregarded, their reliefs fall into the ha'penny place.  This speaks to the priorities of this Government.</p>  <p>  As I stated, I welcome that the Minister is recognising the folly of the mistake in expanding this scheme and abolishing the cap.  Nevertheless, he has not restricted the scope of the scheme.  I reiterate that Sinn F&eacute;in warned the Government about this.  Who seriously listens to the big accountancy firms when there is no evidence to show that they have a case?  Who allows a scheme to operate in this unlimited way in the belief that it will not have this kind of impact?  The problem is the Government's view that when it comes to high earners and the super wealthy, the Finance Bill will always be available to assist them.</p>  <p>  As I stated, while this amendment is an improvement, it still allows for a significant reduction in tax for certain employees who are now in the State and who will take up employment in the next two years.  The relief is not available to those who are already here and in employment.  The questions I have asked need to be answered.  While I welcome the decision to place a restriction on the scheme, it should be abolished in its entirety.</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath asked how many individuals have incomes above a certain level.  That information is not available in the report but I will see whether, in the context of this debate, I can get that information for the Deputy.  As to why I am changing the scheme for new participants but keeping it in place for one more year, the expectation of some people is that this change should not apply to those who are already benefitting from the scheme.  I do not share that view.  I am of the view that the growth in the number of participants with salaries of more than &euro;1 million raises questions that need to be addressed now.  What I am trying to do is achieve a degree of balance by allowing the scheme to remain in its current form for one more year for those who are already participating in it, after which it will come to an end.  I believe that is proportionate.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGrath also asked how the report will be done.  My approach at this point is that it will be led by my Department in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners.  We have not yet decided whether we will have a consultant do some work on the report.  We may well use a consultant but the review will be led by my Department, with some input from the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p> With regard to Deputy Burton's questions on the need to ensure sustainable employment and that businesses that move into Ireland are sustainable and ones we want to keep here for a longer period, that spirit is much of what has guided the regulatory work the Central Bank has done in terms of looking at the kind of enterprise and economic activity that could be located here when Brexit happens.  It wants to ensure, in particular from a financial services point of view, new companies or new parts of companies that locate here are genuinely sustainable, which is what I want to see happen as well.</p> <p> The Deputy asked what effect Brexit will have on this.  From a totally precautionary point of view, in a post-Brexit Ireland or EU, the case could be made for no change to try to maximise the number of individuals with potential jobs who would be resident here in Ireland.  I do not believe that is appropriate.  We reviewed this scheme versus comparable schemes elsewhere.  It is a competitive scheme but I believe issues of equity mean the right thing to do is to bring in the cap at this level.</p> <p> In regard to the point made by Deputy Pearse Doherty on the number of jobs to which we can relate the current scheme, the Revenue Commissioners have figures in this regard showing that, for 2016, the number of jobs created was 477 and the number of jobs retained was 607.  I want to look at this scheme afresh for next year.  I am familiar with the world in which such schemes work.  This has led me to make this decision in regard to the cap.  We will look at the scheme next year with fresh eyes to evaluate whether it is meeting the objectives it was intended to meet.</p> <p> Deputy Doherty asked what my priorities are.  The only priority I have is to ensure we have a tax code that is fair and gives us the opportunity to compete in a very mobile world for certain forms of jobs that I believe it is valuable to have in our country.</p> <p> The Deputy asked about  the levels of relief that will be available to individuals participating in the scheme.  To illustrate, for someone on &euro;500,000, the answer is &euro;51,000, and for someone on &euro;3 million, the answer is &euro;351,000.  I believe the change I am proposing, as the Deputy has acknowledged, is one that is needed and will allow the scheme to operate in the way it should operate while dealing with an issue that has to be addressed.</p></speech>

The purpose of the amendment is not to get a report but to have an opportunity to discuss this scheme on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  As a result of the amendments brought forward on Committee Stage, which were about updating and consolidating the text around the EII scheme, it was incredibly difficult to work our way through it and assess the changes that were being made and whether the issues affecting those applying for the scheme were being addressed or not.</p><p>I want to put on record the significant operational issues that arise with the EII scheme.  It is an issue I am contacted about quite often in respect of individual claims where there seems to be a significant backlog in the approval process.  I hope this is something the Minister can address.  As a result of the budgetary announcement and the changes to the Finance Bill, there is a movement to a largely self-certification model, as is the norm for such schemes, and it is hoped that will go a long way towards addressing the issues that arise in the operation of the scheme.</p><p>I do not need to tell the Minister the importance of this scheme and the vital funding it provides for early stage business.  It is crucial and we need to protect it.  We need to make sure it is working and achieving the purpose for which it was established.  I know there are issues around the rules, eligibility and so on.  What I want the Minister to address, first and foremost, are the operational challenges that certainly arise.  We hope this change which is being brought about will address that, but it is an issue that needs to be dealt with.  It is consistently raised by representative bodies of businesses and directly with me by investors and companies benefiting from the scheme.  There are legitimate issues that need to be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="20:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000046#TT00800"><p>A very detailed examination of the operation of the EII scheme has just been completed and is available on the Department's website.  The findings include the fact there is a continued need for the incentive but that the design of the relief is such as to cause major delays in obtaining approval.  On foot of this, a package of priority measures has been brought forward in this Bill to address the shortcomings of the scheme.  I intend to have further work carried out before the budget and Finance Bill next year on issues such as the calibration of the amount of tax relief that should be available to investors.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, section 24 of the Bill changes the operation of the reliefs for investment in corporate trades through the employment investment and incentive scheme and start-up relief for entrepreneurs, SURE, scheme as well as introducing the new start-up capital incentive, SCI, scheme.  One of the key drivers in bringing forward this newly designed scheme was the time it was taking for applications to be approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  The design of the scheme, as it stands before the Finance Bill 2018 amendments, is insufficient and cumbersome for all involved.  In designing the scheme I have brought forward in the Finance Bill, the aim has been to strike a balance between the administrative burden being placed on companies and investors with any potential risk to the Exchequer.  I believe the proposed new design does that.  The new section will come into operation for shares issued on or after 1 January 2019.  Companies that have raised financing to which one of the three reliefs - EII, SURE or SCI &ndash; will apply must let Revenue know they have done this within 60 days of the investment qualifying for the relief.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the majority of share issues occur in the last quarter of the year.  Therefore, within three months of the passing of the Act there simply will not be enough data to report on the operation of the newly designed scheme, which would be expected to be in the last quarter of 2019.  I assure the Deputy I appreciate how important it is for these three reliefs to be operated as intended.  The operation of the new scheme will be monitored to see if there are any issues that need to be addressed in light of the substantial measures brought forward in Finance Bill 2018 to address the concerns.  However, given the fact I have just published the detailed Indecon report, which already identifies a range of measures to enhance the operation of the schemes, and the fact the statistical information needed to compile a report in the manner the amendment proposes would not be available in short timeframe proposed, I cannot accept the amendment.  I assure Deputy McGrath that I and the officials will monitor closely the effects of the changes to the scheme over the coming year with a view to taking forward further improvements in next year's Finance Bill, if necessary.</p>  <p>  To put this into context, it was taking too long - up to three months - for approval to be granted to people applying for the EII scheme in previous years.  We are moving from that to a self-certification scheme on the basis that, in the future, there will be audits by Revenue which will be a look-back at applications to see if the scheme is being applied correctly.  The audit structure will apply on a selection basis and it is self-certification, which means it will be quicker, and we hope and anticipate it will be done better.  As I said, it is also the case that the bulk of these occur in the last quarter of each year, so we will not have the data available within three months of enacting the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.525" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="21:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000047#UU00100"><p>This scheme has been tinkered with in different ways over many years.  It is clear that it has not worked in the way it was intended to work.  As mentioned, there has been criticism from industry that it was poorly marketed and flawed and that even in its early stage it did not reached the level of uptake achieved by the business expansion scheme, BES, which it replaced.  The Minister of State mentioned that self-certification is a leap forward.  He also referenced a three-month delay in the processing of applications by Revenue.  Will the Minister elaborate on the reason it took three months to process the applications?  In reality, this would become an issue if there was evidence to suggest that those who applied for the scheme did not follow through as a result of the delay.  Self-certification would be a benefit to companies only if it was shown that those who applied did not follow through as a result of the there being a three-month delay.  In other words, the three-month delay was an inconvenience as opposed to a deterrent to invest.  Will the Minister of State outline the rationale for moving from Revenue approval to self-certification?  What has been the fall-off as a result of what the three-month delay within Revenue in terms of the processing of these applications?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="21:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000047#UU00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Is he confident that the issues that affect the operation of this scheme are being dealt with and that we will see improved efficiency?  The feedback I am getting consistently is that the scheme is overly cumbersome, an administrative nightmare and that it is taking too long to get approval, with the overall consequence of it not being an attractive investment proposition.  If we want to reduce our reliance on inward investment, foreign direct investment, FDI, and multinationals, we need to help our small indigenous sector to scale up.  There are many SMEs that have the potential to reach new levels of scale, and schemes like this are of critical importance to them.  For me, this is the key issue.  I am aware of the context in terms of the general block exemption regulations from Europe as well.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that he is open to examining what rule changes may be necessary next year and he mentioned the amount of relief, for example.  Leaving aside the Indecon report, what work does he intend to undertake between now and then to guide and inform that review?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.527" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="21:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000047#UU00300"><p>The scheme as constructed is deemed to be too complicated in terms of application.  Many companies applied.  It took three months for their applications to be processed and they were then told that they did not meet the criteria.  We are trying to simplify the scheme so that companies can self-certify and get up and running.  As mentioned by Deputy McGrath, many people are of the view that we are too dependent on FDI and that this scheme replaced the BES which was easier to access and was of greater benefit than the current one.  The Indecon report is critical of the processing system in that, because it is too slow, companies are being left behind.  We are providing for self-certification following an audit structure to be put in place.  Many of the applications seem to occur in the last quarter of each year.  We will not have the information sought by Deputy McGrath until after quarter four, which is when the largest quantity of applications are made, and on that basis I am unable to accept the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.528" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="21:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000047#UU00400"><p>The Minister of State's response does not make sense.  The move from approval by Revenue to self-certification will not make a difference.  The reason for this move according to the Minister of State is that companies applied, there was a long delay of three months and in the end they did not meet the criteria.  Whether a company self-certifies or is approved by Revenue, it will still be in the same position in that there will be a Revenue look-back and, therefore, a clawback at that time unless the criteria is changed.  Self-certification as opposed to approval will not make a difference unless the delay resulted in companies falling out during the time it took to process the applications.  If, as the Minister of State said, companies applied, there was a lengthy delay and at the end of the process they did not meet the criteria, then the issue is that they were not eligible and, unless the criteria is changed, they will still not be eligible.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister of State explain how self-certification without other changes will change the circumstances which he outlined to the House, and will he also outline if he proposes to change the criteria?  I understand the purpose of this is to simplify the scheme but the only thing of substance that the Minister of State outlined to the House is a change from Revenue approval to self-certification.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="21:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000047#UU00500"><p>The proposal to introduce self-certification into this procedure is bizarre.  The Minister of State is leaving himself open to significant risk in terms of the success or otherwise of it because a lot will depend on the calibre and quality of the applicants.  If these are honest applicants who have proposals which may result in much-needed investment, it should be possible to assist them to make valid applications that are likely to be successful.  What the Minister of State is saying is that he has an idea of a scheme but he is confused as to whether the people who apply for it deserve to get it.  That is no good to a company or a local person in a town like Dundalk where the employment is much needed.  The self-certification route is riskier.  In moving to it, we risk attracting people who are only in it for the tax break and are not committed to the project.  Some level of scrutiny in regard to the project and quality thereof is necessary.  There are towns throughout the country that have experience of people who optimistically overpromised and others who set up, took what they could get and then left, leaving the people and the areas high and dry.  The Minister of State needs to reconsider this proposal.</p>  <p>  In providing for self-certification we are handing the scheme over to accounting and legal firms.  Rather than going the self-certification route, the Minister of State ought to be focused on whether this is a valid scheme that is worthy of Government support and will produce employment and investment outcomes for people and areas that badly need those outcomes.  How does one allow for self-certification in the case of a person who has no track record?  The Minister of State might not be doing people any favours.  He might just be providing for a short term boost to the figures and a lot of chaos in regard to the scheme.  There is merit in Deputy McGrath's proposal in terms of a study.  It could be a relatively small study of anonymised applications over a specific timeframe and a breakdown of the applications that have been successful, and why, and the applications that have not been successful, and why.</p><p>This could even be done by the public service, perhaps Revenue in conjunction with the likes of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  What people want is for schemes such as this to be successful.  If they are not successful, they should be changed.  I have no idea why the Minister of State has decided to go down this path.  I bet some accountant whispered in his ear.  They will do the filling out.</p></speech>

It is now being simplified so it will be easier for companies to apply for a better scheme.  This has been made available online by Revenue.  To put into context the complexity of the scheme, companies did not even know whether they were able to apply when they read the rules and regulations.  The companies themselves found they had to ask Revenue to tell them whether they could apply for the scheme.  The Indecon report is very clear that the scheme is too complicated and that if the company itself does not know that it must make a determination on everything, it needs to be simplified.  It is now simplified by the self-certification process in order that the companies themselves can know.  There are investor conditions.  Investors - not just the company, but also the investors in the company - should have no difficulty determining whether they meet the criteria.  There is a difficulty with companies and the investors within the company or the scheme and there is a further complexity in respect of the conditions that comply with the general block exemption.  There is scope for genuine uncertainty about these conditions on the part of companies.  This is why we have provided that companies can apply to Revenue for confirmation on the issues.  The scheme is overly complicated.  It is being simplified.  We are moving down the self-certification route in order that the scheme sees a better take-up now and in the future.</p></speech>

I know the Minister of State is consolidating the text, but schemes such as this do not always get the scrutiny and attention they deserve.  It is a really important scheme.  We want to ensure that those benefiting from it are eligible and that the right projects and the economic return are there in supporting companies that need access to this scheme to help them scale up and grow in the way we all want to see.  Issues with the operation of the scheme, not just its criteria but its administration, have been raised consistently, and I hope what the Minister of State says will materialise by way of an improved efficiency in the operation of the scheme.  We will work with him over the course of the year on any potential further changes.  I will withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

It amounts to approximately &euro;70 million a year, which is a substantial investment of public money in this industry.  As I said to the Minister on Committee Stage, and I will repeat myself because this issue has become very controversial, I am very much in favour not only of maintaining the current level of public investment in film, but of dramatically increasing it.  In fact, in our budget submission we proposed an additional &euro;241 million in investment in arts generally, with a substantial amount going to film, although, obviously, to other arts as well.  This level of investment would bring us towards the average expenditure in Europe, which we are well below.  I stress this because there are some in the film industry who are not happy that I have questioned some of the matters surrounding this relief and some of the issues in the industry.  However, I stress to them, and no doubt some of them will be watching this debate, that what I want is to strengthen the industry and to see more investment in it.</p><p>There are problems surrounding this relief, however.  Indeed, there is a significant dispute raging in the film industry on a number of fronts linked to this relief.  I will not go into some of them in great detail except to urge the Minister to take them seriously.  A series of articles has been running, particularly in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, about fairly serious allegations of abuses of section 481 relief, court cases pertaining to same and very prominent film stars and so on accusing certain producer companies of significantly inflating their claims under section 481.  I do not know the truth of these allegations but they indicate that there needs to be serious policing and very definite rules and regulations around these reliefs so they cannot be abused but rather do what they are supposed to do, that is, generate employment in the industry and generate a sustainable film industry.  This is very important.  As I said to the Minister, and I again stress this to all the people involved in this industry, we have a massive pool of talent in this country.  We box way above our weight in literature, the arts and so on and we could do so to a much greater extent in film if there was more investment but also if we redesigned things a little.</p><p>The focus of this amendment is the issue of the requirement in section 481 that it provide &quot;quality employment and training opportunities&quot;.  That is the condition of availing of this tax relief and therefore is a legal requirement.  The debate revolves around whether this is the case.  To outline to the Minister some of the issues at stake, the number of employees, for example, is important.  At the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, where this was discussed at the end of January, Screen Producers Ireland and the Irish Film Board said there were 17,000 whole-time equivalent jobs.  Recently that figure has come down to about 3,000.  That is a big difference, is it not?  Let us be honest.  The same amount of money is involved but now the number of jobs in the industry has gone from 17,000 to 3,000.  When we consider that quite a few of those are in RT&Eacute;, we begin to get a sense of how many are actually working in film.</p><p>This is a significant issue and it needs to be looked at.  What are we getting back in terms of real jobs in this industry?  What kind of jobs are they?  Are they quality jobs?  Will the Minister in his response to me tell me his definition of a quality job?  What is quality employment?  What is quality training?  Legally, this relief is supposed to be dependent on these questions.  To my mind, quality employment, at an absolute minimum, is adherence to employment law and EU directives on employment.  For example, if a person has three short-term contracts for the same production company in the space of four years, that person is entitled to a contract of indefinite duration.  That is not happening.  Even though the same companies are getting the money and employing the same people, these employees are not getting contracts of indefinite duration.</p><p>That is the law.  It is not up for debate but it is not being applied.</p> <p> Bogus self-employment is also happening, which the Government has started to act on in other areas.  There are objective criteria relating to this.  Some people cannot simply be declared to be contractors if the character of their work and the nature of their relationship with the employer, the producer company in this case, is one of employee.  Objective criteria need to be examined, which is important from a Revenue point of view.  With this amendment, we are asking the Minister to look into these issues.  Let us examine how many PAYE employees in the different sectors claim this relief as opposed to contractors and then examine the tax revenue from these two different groups.  We will find there is a significant difference.  If there is a PAYE employee in the same grade and doing the same job, the State gets back much more.  </p> <p> Workers were telling me that a PAYE worker in certain grades in transport, construction, etc., six-month contract pays &euro;35,000 in tax but if the same person doing the same job is designated a as contractor, he or she pays &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 in tax.  There are issues in this regard that need to be examined.  This needs to be looked into and, critically, the industry forum that was recommended needs to be convened.  All stakeholders could discuss what is quality employment and what are the conditions for availing of this tax relief.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about the benefits of this tax relief.  That is recognised by the vast majority of the industry.  It has been beneficial and it should remain in the future.  Notwithstanding that, an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht all-party report contained 11 key recommendations on reform of the section.  It drew particular attention to the precarious position of workers within the industry, which was mentioned earlier.  We would not be doing our job if we did not also note some of the reports about the recent film, "The Professor and the Madman".  Accusations and allegations were made about that film by Mel Gibson's attorney to others.  It is being suggested that this section of our legislation is being abused to inflate costs.  Whether the allegations are true will be tested in the courts and we will let them deal with that.</p>  <p>  We need to deal with what we have in front of us in the Bill.  Whenever that case may be adjudicated, the court may not look at this in the same way we would.  We need to make sure that section 481 is robust enough and that we do not have a situation where costs in a certain production, whether that be film or otherwise, are being inflated to swindle the taxpayers paying for this relief.  The joint committee also noted that &euro;73 million of the total section 481 tax relief went to the 12 largest production companies.  That is an issue I would like examined to ensure this section of our tax code is supportive of a small but expanding industry.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett has well ventilated the points on the employment issue.  That is why there is a need for a review.  Nobody is arguing that we should get rid of section 481.  There is, however, a need to make sure that it is robust, that it cannot be abused and that we look at what is happening within the sector.  We hear repeatedly of certain companies that crew trainees, for example, in a way to suppress costs.  There has been concern, which was raised again in the report, that the structure of the relief was militating against jobs coming to Ireland.  </p>  <p>   The report called for an international comparative study to be conducted to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the section 481 tax credit.  That would be worthy.  This amendment should be a catalyst for such a review.  I refer specifically to the robustness of it and the allegations that have been made.  They are only allegations at the moment but we need to ensure that Revenue and the Department are doing their job to make sure there is no way costs can be inflated to avail of additional tax reliefs above what should be legitimately paid.  Most important is the issue of whether quality employment is being provided as a result of this relief.  </p>  <p>  Nothing in what I am saying should scare the horses.  This is the right thing to do and it is timely to do it.  A number of comments have been made, a number of articles have been published, there is a court case and our own committee is also asking for work to be done on this.  This is the time to have a focused look at this.  There may be other areas we may want to review but the robustness of section 481 and the employment conditions of the workforce are two areas that need to be focused in on in a review.  </p>  <p>  We have heard concerns from employees within the sector.  They feel that if they raise concerns they will not be re-employed and they would be blackballed.  The joint committee recommended that the Government should seek to make working arrangements in the sector more secure given the level of public funding and tax reliefs that fuel the film industry.  We can all agree that there should be zero tolerance for any worker exploitation.  It is a live issue and it is coming at us from a number of different angles.  A review and a report, which laid bare the facts for all of us to see in the midst of all of the ongoing different commentary, would be welcome and timely.</p></speech>

It is one of the key sectors of any modern economy.  It has been the mechanism by which many different cities and areas around the world have had significant revivals because a vibrant film and television industry has been established.  Production and television companies such as Netflix and Amazon invest significant amounts worldwide nowadays.</p>  <p>  Ireland, with a proper plan for this area, would be well placed.  That is particularly the case with the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.  Ireland will have the chance to gain significant investment.  To some extent what has happened is that Ireland was a forerunner with section 481.  There are now competitive offers from other countries seeking to expand in this area of the entertainment business and all of the employment that goes with it.  There is an ongoing need to ensure that if practices develop, which are an abuse of the tax relief, that they should be addressed and eliminated as quickly as possible.  </p>  <p>  A comparative study should be conducted quickly because I watched some, though not all, of a recent "Prime Time" report on this industry.  </p><p>Some of the stories were deeply concerning and worrying.  Reference has been made to court cases and various conflicts within the industry.  This is a key modern industry and if there are issues and problems, there must be a way of hearing the different parties and establishing fair rules to protect good employment and address the rights of employees, including the self-employed.</p> <p> One issue relating to programmes is that many relate to a particular contracted period.  There are significant numbers of film and television production courses in almost all colleges.  There is a  problem regarding where the graduates can secure good employment.  There is immense competition for the employment and experience that is available.  These issues can be addressed and the industry should unilaterally adopt standards indicating, for example, that a living wage is the baseline condition of employment or contracting within it.  Many people in the industry earn multiples of that - much more than anybody here would ever earn - but, at the same time, there is a significant number of film schools and courses in the State.  I am concerned that people graduating from these courses may find it difficult to gain employment here.  Many people want to go abroad to gain international experience and that is the nature of the industry.  Rather like the financial services industry, this industry is globalised.  Nevertheless, Ireland has specific attractions and we have built up expertise in different areas.  It is important that the tax relief continues.</p> <p> This should happen while keeping a keen eye on ensuring first-class productions and output.  We have had many examples of that and those who follow film festivals around the world know we have come out with productions that merited awards for individuals involved in the processes, including on the acting and production sides.  These people have won many awards and brought much lustre to this country.  I am also conscious of the fact that the spin-off from the industry is significant, and it includes "Game of Thrones", "Vikings" and similar productions.  It is a significant addition to an area looking to be a visitor destination it has an active and vibrant cultural presence.  That includes the film industry.</p> <p> If the Minister is minded to consider a study, which is a good idea, the focus should be a little broader than just section 481.  Educational issues must be examined, particularly as it pertains to third level education.  We must consider how programmes in other European Union countries can be linked with schools and courses in this country.  We need to consider how we also provide a social and community dividend from the interest that could be generated in areas by film production and a well-known film or series being made in an area.</p></speech>

It is important we take that approach.  As the Deputy will be aware, the training issue is intrinsically linked with the film tax credit.  Some of the amendments I am introducing to the film tax credit for this year are a first step in addressing some of the matters raised.  The splitting of the certification process between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and the requirement for the production company to apply to the Department before the commencement of the main production, will allow for earlier engagement on the training requirement associated with the credit.</p>  <p>  An audiovisual steering group has been established and it now includes officials from my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and other Departments.  The effective and sustainable operation of the film tax credit is one of the items on its agenda.  It will participate in the newly established screen industry education forum, the first meeting of which was held on 19 November.  The aim of this forum is to focus on the skills development challenges and opportunities within the audiovisual sector in Ireland.  My officials are participating in this process with a view to ensuring that the State's investment in the sector via the film tax credit delivers an appropriate return in the development of a skilled workforce.</p>  <p>  In addition, employees in the film industry are entitled to the same legal protection afforded to all employees in all industries and sectors.  The Deputy asked what I thought good employment was.  He made the point that at a minimum, it should adhere to employment law in the sector and the effect of Commission regulations on the sector as well.  I agree with him that at a minimum, there must be adherence to the law in the area.  It is something I would expect to happen in any area of employment and particularly in an area where an important tax credit is in place.</p>  <p>  Deputies Burton and Pearse Doherty commented on the social and economic impact of the relief.  My Department has carried out a cost-benefit analysis of the operation of this scheme, including taking into account quantifiable benefits associated with the credit, such as taxes on direct and indirect wages, social welfare savings, VAT, corporation tax and taxes on earnings of foreign labour.  The report was published on budget day and is available on the budget website.  It is for that reason that I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.  Instead, I believe our participation in the audiovisual group, as I outlined, is a more appropriate way of dealing with the matter.</p><p>Deputy Pearse Doherty raised concerns about allegations of inflated claims for the credit.  I am aware of the different stories to which he referred.  I am also aware of the case that he mentioned, which will be subject to testing in court.  I would point out that, in the changes that I have made to the Bill, it will provide for the credit to be moved to a self-assessment basis.  This will allow for the normal penalty and prosecution provisions for any claim that is subsequently proven to be incorrect.</p></speech>

The Minister correctly agreed that, at a minimum, quality employment - this relief is not just about training, as current legislation refers to quality employment and training - is not just compliant with EU directives in the sector, but also with contract and employment law, the working time directive and so on.  Does he further agree that the relief should be withheld where an employer is found to be in breach of those laws?  It follows that he should.  The relief says it should be conditional on these factors.  If we find that employers are not applying contract law, they should not get the relief.  That should be self-evident to a law-abiding party like Fine Gael.  I am not joking.  Unless there is a sense that quality employment has to be provided to get the relief, then there is room for slippage.  Certainly, there are allegations that such is happening.</p>  <p>  We need to put resources into establishing what is self-employment and PAYE, when it is appropriate to fall into one category rather than the other and so on.  We need to determine whether there is bogus self-employment in the industry.</p>  <p>  The Screen Industry Education Forum was good, but was any PAYE worker or trainee at it?  As Deputy Pearse Doherty reminded us, one of the 11 recommendations was for a stakeholder industry forum.  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has indicated in principle that she is willing to take that recommendation.  It has to happen in order that we can get the various groups together to air these issues and thrash them out.  The whole industry will thrive and we will all be happy to put more money into it on the basis that we have clearly defined rules about what employment and training should look like.  We will get buy-in from all stakeholders.</p></speech>

My experience of these matters and my view on them is that someone can be a good employer but still find himself or herself committing an offence under employment law, for which the employer should be subject to sanctions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's first question requires a clear answer.  My direct answer is that, as Minister for Finance, if the Exchequer is making a credit available on the basis of quality employment and training and an employer who avails of it is frequently or in a sustained fashion in breach of employment law, it would cause me a question regarding the availability of that credit to the employer.  I included the caveat because, in complex workplaces, particularly where there are many employees, there can be good employers who, by and large, make the right and good decisions but still find themselves in breach of employment law.  At that point, they should be subject to sanction.</p>  <p>  With that context given, if an employer or project was found to be committing offences that an employment agency judged to be happening frequently or becoming an acceptable or normal part of the workplace, it would cause me a question regarding whether it should be availing of the credit in the way the credit is currently designed.</p></speech>

I am not saying that there cannot be oversights.  Of course there can be.  People can make mistakes and there sometimes are grey areas.  We are discussing quality employment.  The majority of the employment in the companies that receive this relief should be direct PAYE employment.  Of course it is reasonable and legitimate to employ some contractors or people on a freelance or self-employed basis, but if they comprise the vast majority and there are hardly any PAYE employees with continuity of employment and so on, then there is something wrong with the balance.  This is something that the Government has acknowledged in terms of bogus self-employment in areas like construction.  In RT&Eacute;, for example, 50 people were found to have been wrongly classified as contractors when they were actually employed by RT&Eacute;.</p>  <p>  I appeal for us to examine this matter closely and find out who the employees in the industry are.  It is a simple question.  Who are the registered trainees?  How long have they been trainees?  That means that we will have to have a defined training period, by the way.  At what point does someone cease to become a trainee and become qualified in a particular grade?  Can we have a register of all the people who are qualified?  Can we have a register of all the people who are employees in the various grades so that we know who the employees in the industry actually are?  We can then work out whether there is fairness in terms of the allocation of employment, compliance with employment law and so on.  These are basic elements and reasonable requests.  That is why I am asking for there to be a study.  I am not doing this to be flippant.  However this amendment goes when I press it, I acknowledge the Minister is taking the issue seriously.  I would like us to examine it comprehensively, set out all of the facts and establish what the playing field is in a fair way that sees the genuine buy-in by and involvement of all stakeholders in putting that picture together.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.566" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="21:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000053#AAA00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am sharing time with Deputies Pearse Doherty and Stanley.</p>  <p>  The Bill before the House is the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill 2018.  It is to deal with a situation that has developed in many rural areas over the past seven to eight years, in particular, but even going back further than that, where rural planning permissions have been denied because of the stringent approach of the EPA guidelines for rural housing.</p>  <p>  Rural planning permission is not about pollution, or damaging the environment, or doing anything that would have any negative effect on our watercourses, or drinking water, or anything like that.  This Bill is designed to enhance the level at which we treat sewage in rural areas and ensure people can live in the rural environment in a safe way because they also enjoy that environment and drink that water and want to ensure it is a safe and adequate place to live.</p>  <p>  The standard of practice in the EPA code of practice was written in 2009 and came into effect in 2010.  It stated that if the soil on a site was too dense and failed the percolation test, the result would be what they call zero emissions or zero discharge.  In other words, no matter how well the treatment system on site treated the effluent, even if it treated it to drinking water standard, a cup of that water is not allowed into a river or stream.  That was taking it to an extreme that I do not think anyone ever intended it to go.  The other part of the guidelines said that, as an alternative, one could apply for a wastewater discharge licence.  The legislation around that was difficult.</p>  <p>  I want to go into the detail of what this has done and the effects it has had.  The effect in places like Leitrim, where almost 90% of the soil will not pass the percolation test, has meant that, over the past number of years, in many rural parishes where there is no town or alternative, there can be no planning permission.  People have been denied permission to build a house and to live in their own community, where they grew up, or to send their children to the schools they went to themselves and have their children play for the football club that they played for.  That is the effect it has had.  It has, if one likes, sterilised whole communities and, in large areas of County Leitrim and other areas in the west, rural communities are in decline.  People deserve to be able to live where they choose to live.  Most people who want to live in rural Ireland want to do so in an environmentally-friendly manner.  In the vast majority of cases where people are building houses like that, they are doing so either on their own land or family land.  When they do not have to buy a site, they usually put the additional money from the purchase of the house into building a really good quality home because it is the home they intend to live in for their lives.  It is not like a developer who is going to shoot it up quickly and turn it over to somebody else.  Therefore, they build a good quality home that is really well insulated.  In most cases when one speaks to people in the profession, they will tell one that most of the one-off rural housing is almost to a passive standard.</p><p>The issues have had a very negative effect on County Leitrim.  It is an unintended consequence of what the EPA did.  I spoke to people in the EPA when I was putting this Bill together.  I also spoke to people in the environmental sections of the county councils.  All of them said that this was not intended.  The EPA's intention when drawing up these guidelines was to improve the standard rather than to ban planning permission, but it has had that effect.  In 2013 the Minister's predecessor, Phil Hogan, visited County Leitrim and met with councillors.  He told them that he would come back with a solution within six months because it is wrong that people are not able to build a house in rural areas.  He said we have to come up with a solution and ensure that people can live in rural Ireland again.  Unfortunately nothing happened.  We have had reports and assessments.  </p> <p> In fairness to many local authorities, and Leitrim County Council in particular as been most acutely affected, they have done an awful lot of work with the EPA and the Department to come up with a solution.  They were trying to come up with a solution that produced zero effluent discharge.  This meant that effluent would go through a treatment plant and into a reed or willow bed and that any waste left in it would evaporate.  That waste, as I have said, would be treated to a very high standard.  We live in a very damp climate however.  It is a very wet country and it proved practically impossible to do that.  Where it was possible, it involved a very high cost.  It was not possible to do it.  </p> <p> What we have done here is to look at the alternative to that, which is the discharge licence.  At the moment the discharge licence is really only available for very large projects or industrial units.  The clear intention of this Bill is to allow a local authority to issue a discharge licence for a single house where the effluent is treated to the highest standard possible.  The standard about which we are talking is bathing water standard.  That can be assessed, tested, regulated and stood over by the local authority when it issues the licence.  This would not put us in conflict with the EPA guidelines because they state that one can apply for a water discharge licence.  The environment would be protected to a new standard, which is actually much higher than the one we have at present.</p> <p> I am aware of the Minister's amendment which intends to kick this can down the road and to have us wait a year or more before coming back to assess this again.  I am very sorry to say that just does not work for people who have waited almost ten years to get a solution to this problem.  We really need to deal with it now.  We are all happy to co-operate with the Minister, the EPA and the Department in meeting whatever requirements they want met to allow people to build houses so that they can live where they want to live.</p> <p> It is not about a free-for-all.  I want to make that clear.  It is not about building thousands of houses across rural Ireland.  There have been examples of large numbers of holiday homes being built in some seaside resorts.  There are examples of towns around which an awful lot of one-off housing has been built.  People have pointed to that as a problem.  Excess in one place should not be an excuse for a famine somewhere else.  That is really the point in this matter.  This is about a small but significant sector of people who want to build houses in their own area and live where they used to live. </p> <p> I want to go into our solution in a little bit of detail, but only for a minute.  It is about producing high-quality effluent and clearly regulating treatment so that nobody would pollute, because we do not want to see that happen.  I want to make that clear.  I was on the radio a few times today and it was interesting to get emails from different parts of the country.  One person would say that it would outrageous to pump effluent into our rivers and to pollute them.  We want to let effluent of bathing water standard into the rivers.  That is what we are talking about.  It would be treated to a very high standard.  Many people in urban Ireland have been fed a myth that rural Ireland has somehow destroyed the environment.  The reality, of which the Minister and all of us are aware and with which we need to deal, is that up to 30% of sewage produced in many of our towns and villages goes into the rivers and the sea totally untreated.  That needs to be dealt with.  We all want to work with the Minister to deal with that.  Wherever people live, they produce waste.  The people who do not live in rural houses because they cannot get planning permission for them are living in some of those towns and villages where 30% of sewage goes untreated.  We are offering a solution which helps with that problem rather than hindering it.  </p> <p> I am disappointed with the amendment which has been tabled which tries to kick this can down the road.  It is not appropriate.  The notion that the EPA and all these other agencies should be given another year to produce more reports is ridiculous at this stage.  Every Department has shelves lined with reports covered in dust that have been there for years.  We do not want this to go down that road as well.  It is now time to deal with this issue.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy English, he has told me that he has been aware of the issue for many years and that he has been lobbied by Leitrim County Council and other councils to get this sorted out.  He says he is on the same page and wants a solution.  If we want a solution, let us work together and produce it.  Let us do something that is right for the people and provide a solution that will allow people to simply live in their own communities.  That is all they are asking for.  I do not think it is too much to ask a Government to co-operate, to make that happen and to commit to it.</p> <p> I know that officials in Departments can sometimes have a lot of power and stand in the way of things, but at the end of the day the Minister is the person who is elected and who is in charge.  I call on the Minister to stand up for the ordinary people out there who simply want to do the right thing for the environment, for their families and for their communities.</p></speech>

T&aacute; ard-mholadh tuillte ag an Teachta Martin Kenny as a saothar agus as an obair at&aacute; s&eacute; ag d&eacute;anamh ar an cheist seo le blianta anuas ar son muintir na tuaithe, go h&aacute;irithe in iarthar na t&iacute;re.  As we have heard, this is vital legislation.  The amendment, if enacted, would have the effect of removing an unfair obstacle currently placed before many people who are simply attempting to obtain planning permission in their own communities and rural areas.  We are not talking about large property developers, speculators or individuals who are hoping to make a killing out of housing development.  As Deputy Martin Kenny has outlined, we are talking about genuine people in rural communities who want to build according to the county development plan and building standards in their own communities.  They are being prevented from doing so by something which was not foreseen, and not intended, to have the consequences it has today and has had for quite a number of years now.  We are talking about ordinary people, hard-working people who have, perhaps, grown up in rural communities and want nothing more than to build a home in which to live and raise their families.  That is what this is about.  That is what Deputy Martin Kenny's legislation is about.  It is about supporting those families and ensuring that they can live in their communities.</p>  <p>  The implications of the zero discharge rule have prevented these people from building a place to call home in rural Ireland.  This problem is particularly acute in counties throughout the north west and west of our island, areas which have for far too long suffered from depopulation and rural decline due in no small part to existing rural planning laws.  The attacks on rural Ireland in recent years have been relentless.  We have seen successive Governments not only failing to protect these communities from attacks but, in many instances, actually being responsible for them.  Just this week my own community in Bunbeg, An Bun Beag, has suffered another attack.  It has been the victim of another assault on the village - the closure of the local post office.  It is not alone, however.  That assault has been witnessed in many areas across rural Donegal and the west of Ireland.  We need an end to this Government's policy of death by a thousand cuts to rural Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Separately it is worth mentioning, as part of tonight's debate, the current process by which areas are designated as special areas of conservation, SACs, special protection areas, SPAs, and areas of natural constraint, ANCs, in a bid to restore and maintain our favourable conservation of habitats and species by restricting certain human activities.  This needs to be looked at.  It too has resulted in large swathes or rural Ireland being "no go" areas for development.  While no one is saying that our natural environment, flora or fauna should not be protected - in fact it is crucial that they are - it is clear that the needs and interests of rural communities must not be discarded when legislators are formulating laws concerning planning and development.  </p>  <p>  I will also make the following point to the Minister.  It is something I have raised with his officials and with planners in my own county of Donegal.  I refer to the golden handcuffs that are placed on some individuals who have developed land, whether by constructing houses, placing mobile homes or extending a house, in an SAC.  When they have done so there is no ability to apply for retention permission.  In this situation planners are forced to demand the removal of such development.</p><p>In some cases, they even demand the demolition of homes.  This is not right.  There is a lacuna in the law and these golden handcuffs need to be dealt with.  This legislation will enable rural people to live and work in their own communities and in doing so, it will ensure that rural tradition and the way of life in rural Ireland, which we know only too well, will continue and thrive into the future.  I ask Deputies to support the legislation and oppose the Government's amendment, which is nothing but a deferral that kicks the can down the road.  Rural Ireland has waited for long enough for this issue to be dealt with.  Now we have a practical solution from Deputy Martin Kenny, who deserves our praise and support.  I urge Deputies to stand with Deputy Martin Kenny, rural Ireland and the rural communities that can be found the length and breadth of this State that are suffering as a result of the rule currently in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="22:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000055#CCC00200"><p>I welcome Deputy Martin Kenny's Bill.  It is a practical measure aimed at solving a problem in areas where there is rural decline.  The previous speakers mentioned the north west, Donegal, Leitrim and such counties where there is heavy soil.  There are areas across the midlands which have problems with soil types, such as the western part of County Laois including the Slieve Bloom area, Coolrain and Camross and parts of Mountrath, as well as Edenderry and the Ferbane area in north County Offaly.  This seems like a small problem but the way it is being dealt with by the EPA and the Department has been a blunt instrument.  It is adding to rural decline in areas where there is already depopulation.  We need to try to address this problem and this is a practical solution.</p>  <p>  As somebody who cares about the environment and is spokesperson for the environment for my party, I would not support this measure unless it was going to achieve a better outcome.  The Bill as tabled will get a better outcome in what it advocates.  We currently have septic tanks, which are often just storage chambers.  This legislation improves environmental protection and accounts for different soil types.  The blunt instrument currently there does not deal with that.  The legislation gives a waste discharge licence to single householders where there would be a three-step treatment of waste: a septic tank, a filter system and finally a reed or willow bed.  The Minister's predecessor came to Clonaslee in County Laois a few years ago and opened a sewage treatment plant that had a large system like this to cater for a whole village, which is held up as a model and is working perfectly.  It is located beside the River Clodiagh.  There have been no problems with it and there will not be problems with it because it is using the best of technology and a natural solution at the end of the process in the form of a reed bed.  We are talking about using this on a smaller scale.</p>  <p>  We need to deal with the areas where there is depopulation and which are suffering from rural decline.  It must also be taken into account that rural houses are being built to a more modern standard.  Several houses that I have seen being built in rural areas have been fitted with heat pumps and solar panels.  We can combine this with renewable energy to ensure that rural households are sustainable and are being built to the highest environmental standards with proper use of energy and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  We need to combat climate change but we should not see this as a burden.  The new technology exists and we are proposing use of new technology and practical solutions to deal with the issue of septic tanks and discharge from them.  There is no argument about that.  We must meet the highest standards.</p>  <p>  I note that where something fails the so-called T-test under EPA guidelines, that rules out any engineering solution, regardless of how high the standard of technology is.  The only way around this is a discharge licence.  On the other side of the Border, they have found a way to deal with this and are completely complaint with EU water protection directives.  Across from the county Deputy Martin Kenny represents, in County Fermanagh, a different system operates, so it can be done.  We must have robust planning laws.  This is not an argument for wider development with houses dropped all over the place.  We have seen bad examples of that.  This is about areas where there is poor soil quality and where parishes have lost shops, are in danger of losing schools, are losing post offices and will lose more.  It is about getting people to work in those rural areas and to allow them to live there.</p>  <p>  I urge the Government to take this on board.  The Minister has tabled an amendment.  The Government keeps amending many of these Bills and is always kicking the can down the road.  It says we can deal with issues some other day.  Now is the time to deal with this.  We must change the culture in this country to deal with issues by putting practical solutions in place that are sound with regard to the environment and greenhouse gas emissions.  We need to marry these with new technologies and move ahead.  I urge everybody in the House to support the Bill.  I ask the Government to have second thoughts about it.  The Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill as tabled is sound and we need to get behind it.  As Deputy Martin Kenny said, Sinn F&eacute;in is willing to work with the EPA and the Minister's Department to make sure this is done to the highest standard.</p></speech>

I am glad that he has provided an opportunity for us to debate this issue in the House because it is important.  It comes at a time when we are focusing on making improvements to rural water services in the context of the water services policy statement which I published earlier this year.  That statement reflects the priorities set out in Project Ireland 2040, our national planning framework for the next 20 years.  It also sets out the national policy objective, which is facilitating single housing in the countryside based on siting and design criteria for rural housing in statutory plans and having regard to the viability of smaller towns and rural settlements.  Essentially we are talking about protecting our communities.  This is exactly what the national planning framework speaks to.  Some 75% of future growth will happen outside of Dublin.  Protecting and maintaining the viability of our rural communities is a priority for this Government and the role of single housing in maintaining those communities is essential, provided such development does not have a negative impact on our natural environment.  I think we all agree on that.  This Government has been working with relevant rural local authorities such as Leitrim, Sligo and others to ensure, through the investigation of new technologies to treat wastewater and protect our groundwater sources, that those who need and want to live and work in rural Ireland are not being inhibited in doing so.  We will continue to support the provision of one-off rural housing where it is needed and wanted and where we can ensure the protection of our natural environment and water sources.</p><p>The issue is how we manage the impact of such waste discharges in a way that does not have a negative impact on our environment.  For these reasons, the Government is proposing that the Bill be deemed to be read a Second Time on 31 December 2019, to allow for the conclusion of work by the rural water review group, which was established in light of the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee.  This is not about kicking the can down the road.  We are almost there with the work that we set out to do with an Oireachtas committee, with the establishment of the rural water review group and the work it is doing and will complete in the course of next year.  It is considering issues of long-term funding and regulation of the rural water sector, a matter which is germane to the policy underpinning of this Bill.  I hope that the work will be concluded earlier than set out in the Government's amendment and, in that context, and if it would gain the support of the House for the Government proposal, I would be happy for the Bill to progress earlier on the basis that it would be predicated on the work which would be completed by the rural water review group at that stage.  In addition, the EPA will publish a revised code of practice for wastewater treatment and disposal systems serving single houses for public consultation in early 2019.  The revised code of practice is expected to be finalised later in 2019.  The public consultation will contribute further to the debate on the issue.  That work is almost concluded.  If the rural water review group concludes earlier in the year, which I believe it will, we already have the public consultation by the EPA under way.  That will better inform what we hope to achieve in this area and what is laid out in the national planning framework.</p><p>The protection and improvement of our water quality is a key challenge facing Ireland in the years ahead.  Good water quality is critical to our well-being as individuals, as a society, as an economy and as a country.</p><p>In working to protect water quality we are protecting a resource that is fundamental to Ireland as we know it.  The resource is critical to our future, rural and urban.  It underpins our well-being and our economy.  Good water quality is a key driver of economic activity in sectors such as agrifood, pharmaceuticals and tourism, all of which rely on a safe and secure water supply.</p> <p> Our water bodies are natural resources that have been passed down to us by previous generations.  We owe it to ourselves and to future generations to protect them.  In doing so we have to find appropriate solutions to maintain and sustain rural communities and connections to the countryside.  This point is equally important as we look to urban settings with a view to ensuring that we continue to build up our urban cores, as outlined in the national planning framework.  The aim of this policy is to ensure compact and sustainable growth.  We must do this in a sustainable way without doing harm to our environment, whether the local natural environment or our water bodies and courses and the marine environment.</p> <p> The Water Framework Directive recognises this reality and sets for EU member states the basic target of restoring all waters to good quality by 2027 at the latest.  The directive stipulates that we must not allow waters currently in good status to slip back.  This is a highly challenging target as Ireland continues to grow and industries and other activities with an impact on water quality continue to expand.  It is also challenging because in 2014 we established a national utility to co-ordinate many of the services that had been provided by local authorities previously.</p> <p> Research and analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency has shown that over the past decade the quality of our water has stood still at best and there are some concerning indications of decline in certain areas.  The absence of appropriate investment and a single national utility has not helped us in this regard.  Now that we have a national utility that is protected and we have investment certainty in the years ahead we will be able to make great gains in the coming years.  We must ensure that, as we do so, we do not do anything to unintentionally damage water courses or water sources throughout the country.</p> <p> As we look to the future we are faced with increasing demands on our water resources from a growing population and economy.  It is essential that we take strong steps to protect and improve our water quality.  The River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021, which I published in April of this year, sets out a range of detailed actions and implementing measures.  The plan takes a fresh approach to the protection, improvement and sustainable management of the water environment.  We now have a much-improved evidence base to support the development of new national policies and initiatives and to more effectively guide the deployment of supporting measures at local level.  We have seen the benefit of a national utility, especially in the context of the co-ordination and research undertaken during the recent summer period when we had a severe drought.  Given what we had learned through different storm events about what was happening in our water systems we were better able to manage the drought throughout the country.</p> <p> Several specific actions are to be undertaken.  One relates to extension of the domestic wastewater treatment systems grant scheme.  The scheme will assist with the costs of septic tank remediation in high status water areas.  The development of water and planning guidance for local authorities is another.  This will help local authorities to consider the risks to water quality during planning and development decision-making.  Another action relates to a blue dot catchment programme.  The new programme will create a network of excellent river and lake areas.  Agencies will work together to protect or restore excellent water quality in these water bodies.</p> <p> High water quality is essential to our rural economy and I am delighted that the dairy industry is working in partnership with Teagasc, the local authorities and my Department to engage with farmers on how best to protect this most important of assets.  Irish agriculture prides itself on quality inputs that produce excellent produce and water is, of course, an essential part of that equation.  Protecting the quality of our waters is of equal interest to agriculture and industry as it is to our environmental sector and there is now a shared recognition of this common cause.  This new collaborative sustainability and advisory support programme consists of 30 sustainability advisers who will promote best farming practice in 190 areas chosen for action for up to 5,000 farmers.  The dairy sustainability initiative, which is being spearheaded by the industry to help improve water quality, will see an additional 18,000 dairy farmers receive advice on sustainable farming practices in the 190 areas for action.</p> <p> The Government recognises the importance of the role of civic society in safeguarding water, whether for services to urban and rural areas or water in the aquatic environment.  For this reason, and in line with our commitment in the river basin management plan, I was delighted to statutorily establish An F&oacute;ram Uisce, the national water forum, this summer.  The purpose of the forum is to provide a national stakeholder-led platform for public engagement on all matters relating to water as an environmental, social and economic resource.  The forum provides an opportunity to debate and analyse a range of issues with regard to water quality, rural water concerns, issues affecting customers of Irish Water and the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive in this jurisdiction.</p> <p> Public awareness of and participation in increased water conservation and initiatives to protect water quality in our rivers, lakes and coastal waters is essential for our long-term sustainability.  A national appreciation of the links between water and public health, economic progress and environmental protection is built and reinforced by wider civic society debate and discussion on an ongoing basis.  This is happening at the moment.  Earlier today in the House we were debating issues around water quality insofar as they affect not only our generation but future generations as well.</p> <p> The local authority water programme was established under the river basin management plan as a local authority shared service with the aim of driving public engagement, participation and consultation with communities and stakeholders at local level.  It co-ordinates these activities across all 31 local authorities.  The programme works to ensure that public and stakeholder engagement will result in meaningful public and stakeholder participation in water quality improvements throughout Ireland.  The programme is engaging with interested stakeholders and individuals through their ongoing public meetings throughout the country as part of their implementation strategy for the current plan.</p> <p> Government is now approaching water in an integrated and holistic manner.  In May of this year I published a water services policy statement, the first time any Government has done so.</p> <p> While the purpose of the legislation before the House is that of rural development, it should be viewed through the prism of possible impact on water quality in the receiving rivers and lakes as well.  The discharge of effluent to surface waters presents a significantly higher risk of pollution.  The appropriate mechanism for consideration of this aspect of the issue is the rural water review group, to which I referred to earlier in my contribution.  The group has a broad remit.  Strand 1 of the work has looked at immediate funding requirements of the group water sector, the level of private wells grants and the enhanced septic tank grant scheme recommended under the river basin management plan published in April this year.  These recommendations will shortly be submitted for ministerial consideration.  Strand 2 of the work will look more broadly at the future investment needs of the sector and as well as appropriate regulation of the sector.</p> <p> Accordingly, I am proposing that the Second Reading of the Bill be deferred to allow for the conclusion of work by the rural water review group.  At that point we can come to consideration of the Deputy's Bill.</p></speech>

The Bill aims to resolve problems around planning permission in County Leitrim, south Sligo, north Roscommon and south Donegal following strict changes in Environmental Protection Agency rules on water pollution.  These changes have had a disproportionate impact on planning permissions in County Leitrim and the other counties I referenced because of the heavy soil there.  The guidelines were adopted as part of several measures to prevent ground water pollution from septic tanks but they are stopping local people from building one-off houses in their local areas.  In fact, the strict rules on effluent treatment have particularly stalled the construction of one-off housing in these counties.</p>  <p>  This Bill puts forward a change to EPA rules to allow for the granting of a discharge licence for the development of single houses in rural areas that fail the water percolation test.  The Bill will forward a viable alternative engineering solution rather than the current blanket ban.  The Bill would mean high environmental standards can be met without recourse to the current blanket ban.  The homes will have to get a licence and put in place a wastewater treatment system.  Currently, people cannot get planning permission at all due to the percolation test.  In total, 87% of Leitrim land does not meet EPA T-test standards so families and couples hoping to develop family farms and build on their family land are unable to do so.  All farmers are desperate to build on their family land and it is important for the proper running of the farm that they are living on the land.</p>  <p>  In 2016, there were 22 planning permissions for houses granted in Leitrim.  In 2017, only 21 houses were granted planning permission.  In the first quarter of this year only one house was granted planning permission and in the second quarter there were five successful applications.  That is a total of six planning permissions in six months.</p>  <p>  More and more of our young people are finding they can no longer live in the areas of rural Leitrim they grew up in.  Our communities schools shops and accompanying infrastructure are suffering as a result.  We know about the housing shortages.  The person who wants to build a house but who cannot get planning will end up eventually, as most do, on a housing list somewhere else.  Unfortunately, this policy has impacted particularly on the counties I have mentioned because of the soil types there.  The current EPA guidelines state that if the percolation test fails, there must be zero discharge of effluent.  This is impossible to achieve and results in a blanket ban on planning permission.  This has had a major impact in particular in areas of heavy soil.  Such areas are far more likely to fail the test.  Consequently, single homes have been particularly difficult to build in Leitrim and other areas in the other counties I have mentioned.  In consequence, we have seen a whittling away of the population and communities have been undermined.</p><p> This part of the EPA guidelines rules out all reasonable engineering solutions or proposals to treat and dispose of the sewage effluent where it fails the T-test, regardless of how high the treatment standard proposed.  However, the EPA guidelines also state that where the test fails, the local authority can issue a wastewater discharge licence.  The interpretation of legislation on discharge licences is that they are for multiple houses, such as a small housing estate of six dwellings, and allow for the discharge of over 5 cu. m a day.  The Bill puts forward an amendment to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 to change this.  EPA officials, planning and environmental experts in local authorities and private practice agree on the appropriateness of a discharge licence for single houses where percolation tests fail.  There are already provisions for a licence but it only applies to multiple homes rather than single units.  The Bill expands this to encompass one-off rural homes, which are a key part of the physical infrastructure of rural Ireland.  The licence can be designed specifically for single houses, where the conditions could include installing a mechanical sewage treatment system, from which effluent would pass through a polishing filter and be discharged into a reed bed and willow pond.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il will support this Bill on Second Stage in order to further tease out these issues on Committee Stage and to ensure that EU standards are maintained in order to find a route towards planning permissions for the many people unable to get it at the moment.  We appreciate that it is critical that the changes do not compromise core environmental standards.  These issues can be teased out and clarified on Committee Stage.  Supporting the Bill on Second Stage will enable this to happen; we can then get legal and technical experts to discuss the Bill in more detail.  Furthermore, any weaknesses in the Bill can be amended on Committee Stage to ensure it is of top quality.</p> <p> It is very important for the future of rural Ireland that people are allowed to live in their local areas.  I understand that the EPA is carrying out a review at the moment, but I do not believe Fianna F&aacute;il will agree with this amendment because it seeks merely to kick the can down the road.  Six applications for planning permission were granted in my county in the first six months of this year.  That is totally unacceptable.</p> <p> On costs, a figure of &euro;50,000 for planning per dwelling is being spoken about at the moment.  It is truly criminal to ask that people pay that amount of money.  I understand that Northern Ireland has found a solution to the problem of planning issues with septic tanks.  Rural people are allowed to get planning there.  We should look at the system in the North because what is happening here is unfair.</p></speech>

I reject the amendment and I will speak to it in a moment.  I acknowledge the presence in the Public Gallery of the person who is probably most qualified to speak about this matter, namely, Mr. Francis Davitt, a planner from north County Leitrim.  He is only too aware of the difficulties with policy as it stands and the opportunities that exist to reach the target set by the Government of 75% of future growth outside Dublin.  Councillors S&eacute;adhna Logan and Padraig Fallon are also present.  I am sure that, through their constituency work, they have come across families who have been prevented from realising their dream - and their right - to be able to build in their local area because of the interpretation of the rules as they stand and the lack of flexibility in those rules which means that technological solutions cannot be embraced.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il was in government for a long time.  I have been around these Houses for a long time as well so I recognise that the amendment tabled by the Government as the usual three-card trick, backed up by officials.  For Private Members' legislation, Ministers give sponsoring Deputies a superficial pat on the back while the legislation is kicked down the road, never to be seen again.  The reality is that the policies the Minister speaks of, including Project Ireland 2040 and the idea of 75% of future development outside Dublin, are all very well, but, here and now, people are actually living in County Leitrim.  That might sound strange to some people, who prefer to see the west of Ireland as somewhere they can go for weekends or on holidays when the weather is good and expect to see Peig Sayers looking out over a half-door, smoking a pipe and drinking a pint of Guinness.  The Minister should know that we have had running water there for some time.  I assure him that there are also people and communities there.  County Leitrim is the worst affected area, but as Deputy Scanlon and others have pointed out, the problem persists in Donegal, Sligo, west Cavan and parts of Roscommon.</p>  <p>  The Minister is pursuing policies but, while talking the talk and sounding great in many ways, the policies are contradicted by their scheduling.  The Government wants to kick the problem down the road so that the rural water review group can investigate it.  It promises that there will be a new revised code of practice for the EPA.  These are things that might happen at some time in the future.  Why would the tail wag the dog?  We are supporting this legislation, which means it will proceed to Committee Stage.  My advice to the Minister is that he should contact the rural water review group and the EPA and tell them that the Parliament has passed legislation on Second Stage and that they should redouble their efforts and prioritise it.  We want this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage in the short term, in acknowledgement of the fact that people do live in the north west, that young families want to build houses on their family land and that young farmers want to build houses so that they can cater to the small farms they own.</p>  <p>  One of the real ironies is that we are promoting the very real necessity to protect our environment and address the challenges of climate change.  We heard earlier about the 8 million tonnes of plastic that end up in our oceans each year.  I can confidently tell the Minister that not one ounce of that comes from County Leitrim.  Perhaps we owe it to the people of County Leitrim to introduce some measures to support their living there.  There is a small coastline in Leitrim, and I assure the Minister that not one ounce of the plastic in our oceans can be attributed to the families who have been living there for many generations.  The children of those families are entitled to live there too.  The other irony is that while we want to maintain the health of our water table, which is admirable - Deputies Martin Kenny and Scanlon, among others, have supported that ambition - at the same time we are quite happy to promote the fact that over 50% of agricultural land in Leitrim is populated by an invasive species.  I realise that we want to reach a target of 17% for forestry but that the current figure in this regard is only 11%.  I support that, but there are 35 million Sitka spruce trees now in place in County Leitrim.  Furthermore, due to airborne fertilisation, we have phosphorus, nitrogen and cypermethrin pollution, all of which are threatening the water table.  They are also threatening traditional methods of farming.  On the one hand, we are shoving the entire target for forestry down Leitrim's throat while, on the other, we are saying "Live horse and get grass".  In approximately 150 years' time, when the "gin and tonic belt" is looked after, perhaps we will throw the odd bone of placation to the people of counties Leitrim, Sligo, Donegal and north Roscommon.</p>  <p>  I advise the Minister that this Bill will pass Second Stage.  I appeal to him, as the proactive individual I know him to be, to lift the phone and contact the EPA and the rural water review group and tell them that the Government, which is supposed to run the country, has passed this legislation and needs, by 1 January next, a revised code of conduct from the former and a report from the latter by in order that this policy can become law and in the interests of the people of the north west.</p></speech>

I regret that the time available to speak on this important topic is so limited.  I congratulate Deputy Martin Kenny.  This is the kind of day-to-day issue that we should spend more time discussing in the House.  Issues of this sort affect the people.</p>  <p>  Like many policies, this tries to fix a small problem rather than a big one.  When we discussed the famous septic tank licence, the issue of the main causes of pollution arose.  If we leave aside agricultural pollution for a minute, the report pointed to municipal waste being the biggest source of pollution in the country.  That is obviously understandable.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>We are trying our best to deal with that.  Out near the Baily lighthouse there is a straight discharge into the Irish Sea.  There is a straight discharge into the Irish Sea of municipal waste from Connemara, which has a pristine coastline.  <br/><br/>There are several ironies around septic tanks.  First, despite all the hullabaloo about septic tanks, minimal remediation has been required to adhere to the standard, and these are septic tanks that were built in the old days.  They are not up to the standard of a modern system.<br/><br/>Second, the problem with impermeable soil is not that wastewater gets into the watercourse.  That is a misunderstanding.  That happens with limestone where the water goes straight down, and that is where pollution occurs.  Looking at the water framework plans, one finds that there is very little pollution in the watercourses in places like Connemara that have impermeable soil.  What happens in those locations is that it ponds.  Who are the occupants putting at risk?  Themselves.  They risk infection.  If such a person's dog goes sniffing around in it, he or she is in danger.  However, I have to say I have not yet found any doctor in my area complaining that septic tanks are causing a huge amount of infections on a daily basis.  I am sure the same applies in Leitrim.<br/><br/>The Minister has a zero-tolerance policy.  There is zero tolerance where septic tanks are concerned, but the Minister allows the discharge in large quantities from commercial development.  The <i>de minimis</i>principle would suggest going to the big end of the problem, that is, tackling the larger developments and requiring the higher standard.  The odd house here and there will do a lot less damage, even if the standard is not quite as high.  When I was studying mathematics, I learned to take the level of pollution and multiply it by the number of those polluting.  That will equate to the total national pollution.  Compared with houses that are part of schemes, the number of one-off houses is so small that the sums are obviously upside-down.  As I said, it is a pity we do not have more time for this debate.  It always seems to me the bar is set so high in rural Ireland not to keep the water clean but to keep the houses away.  There is a fetish in the Department against rural houses.  <br/><br/>I note that we have microbreweries, microdistilleries and micro-versions of everything in this world.  If it was really concerned about this issue, the Government would investigate and invest in the development of micro-wastewater plants that would do for the individual house at an affordable cost what the bigger plants do for towns, cities and housing estates.  That should not be beyond technology.  <br/><br/>It would be very easy for rural Ireland to have a system for purifying run-off water and regular desludging of all other septic tanks by the State.  At present, the State de-sludges every municipal waste tank every day.  We are only asking for once every three years.</p></speech>

They are also having a negative effect on a number of midland counties.  I want to compliment Deputy Martin Kenny on bringing this Bill forward because it is quite positive legislation.  We can get it through.  I acknowledge that his councillors are with him, as well as the planner involved in this, Mr. Francis Davitt.  It could reverse a situation that is now causing quite a lot of depopulation in parts of my region and parts of Leitrim.  That depopulation is affecting local schools, athletic clubs and GAA clubs.  It is having a really bad knock-on effect.</p>  <p>  A lot of money is spent by couples or individuals who seek planning permission and are turned down.  It is a very expensive process.  Often, people who are turned down cannot afford to go back and seek planning permission again.  That should be taken into account.  I would also say to the Minister that these really are not extra houses.  It is the next generation that is moving in.  The old homestead is there.  There may be nobody living in it.  It is dilapidated.  It is not a house that can be done up.  A lot of the people who are refused planning permission are only trying to put down their roots on what was the family farm.  Very large areas of the west of Ireland in particular will be left without anybody living in them if this policy is not changed.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said in his address to us that some of the provisions contained in the Bill may be unnecessary as local authorities are not currently precluded by law from granting licences for surface discharge.  I challenge that statement.  It is really down to the interpretation of those laws, and in reality there is very little chance of that applying to single houses.  It might be granted for five, six or seven units, but it will not work for a single rural house.  Again, I very much compliment Deputy Martin Kenny and I am glad to be able to support this Bill with my party members.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider withdrawing the amendment he is proposing.</p>  <p>  This matter cannot be held up.  It is a matter of time.  We should not be discussing this in 12 or 18 months.  In a few short months we should have moved this through the Stages so that the Bill can become law and allow some of those people who have been refused planning permission to reapply, get discharge licences and put down their roots where they want to put them down, in rural Ireland.  We must not depopulate the whole area.  Forestry is happening in Roscommon, Leitrim and Galway and we are driving people out of the area.  We need to rebalance all this, and what Deputy Martin Kenny has brought forward is a way of doing that.  There is widespread support for this within the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-20a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1301" speakername="Brendan  Ryan" time="22:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018112000058#FFF00300"><p>I congratulate Deputy Martin Kenny on bringing this Bill forward tonight.  I only want to say a brief few words on the matter.  I welcome this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party insofar as it attempts to fix a problem that I know genuinely exists.  I represent Dublin Fingal which is a Dublin constituency with a considerable rural part, particularly on the western side of the M1 motorway.  As a practising public representative, I have come across the problem that this Bill is attempting to resolve.  One-off housing in the countryside is governed in Fingal County Council by a very strict rural housing policy.  Chapter 8 of the Fingal development plan, entitled Rural Fingal, lays out very strict conditions for building in the countryside.  It recognises that Fingal is an area under strong urban influence.  Policies and objectives for villages, rural clusters and houses in the open countryside are laid out in great detail in that policy.  Demonstration of genuine rural-generated housing need is essential for any applicant seeking planning permission in the rural area of Fingal.</p>  <p>  To successfully apply for planning permission in a rural cluster, the applicant must have lived in a rural area in the county for ten years or more and must demonstrate this by meeting comprehensive evidence requirements.  In the case of an applicant for permission in the open countryside the time requirement is 15 years, and a maximum of one house per family is permitted in such a case.  The system is very strict indeed.  This can be a source of tension for family members who do not qualify to build on what they see as their own land and cannot settle in their own area.  Even for some people who should have qualified under these very strict and onerous criteria, the news on their applications has been unexpected and indeed very bad.  Applications have been turned down in certain areas of the county because of the soil percolation issue that this Bill is attempting to address by way of an alternative solution to the septic tank.</p>  <p>  It is extremely hard for applicants to accept these types of decisions.  This Bill is a fair attempt to resolve the issue and the technology is currently available to do the job in a non-polluting way.</p><p>Good work on technology development, is taking place in Dublin Institute of Technology.  Technology moves on.  We can achieve clean water by alternative methods than the old percolation system.  We cannot be stuck in that rut.  We need to move on and accept that new technology is working and delivering, and there is good work going on.</p> <p> The waste discharge licensing proposal in the Bill will form the basis of a solution in the future.  It will not be a cheap solution and it may bring the costs of owning their own home beyond the reach of those affected.  However, I am sympathetic to the Government amendment that in light of the fact that the EPA is working on a revised code of practice for wastewater treatment systems, the Bill would be deemed to be read a Second Time at the end of 2019.  That is not the comment Deputy Martin Kenny would like to hear but there will be public consultation on this as well.  This is essential and welcome.  This would also allow for the work of the rural water review group to be concluded.</p> <p> I recognise the problem that the Bill is trying to address and this approach could form part of the solution.  I was tempted to say I would support the Bill earlier when I was discussing it with colleagues but, overall, it is best to accept the Government amendment and to allow the two other bodies, particularly the EPA, conclude their work in the policy area.</p> <p> Were I the proposer of this Bill, I would be happy to have progressed the legislation with the approval of Government, albeit with a delay.  Come the end of next year, this will be deemed to be read a Second Time.  That is a positive outcome for the proposer.</p> <p> It has been put to the House that the Government's amendment is kicking the can down the read.  If I felt for a moment that the amendment was suggesting that new work was to be commenced, I would agree that it is kicking the can down the road but the Government is not doing that.  I would not support the Government, if it was.  Work by two groups is currently under way.  It is not as if something will commence following the debate.  The work is due for completion early next year.  That is why my party is prepared to wait for that outcome.  At the end of next year, the Bill will be deemed to be passed and we can move on to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

We, in rural areas, understand where he is coming from.  We all see week in, week out, the problems that counties, especially in the west, incur.</p>  <p>  In considering the current regulation, to put it simply, I would say the law is an ass.  If one has an old house in the west, especially in Leitrim, and one goes to do it up, and part of the planning permission relates to the septic tank.  If it is a reed bed system, the permission is accepted but if one has to build a new house, it is not accepted.  I would like to know what genius came up with that.</p>  <p>  I have worked on this around the country.  In Monaghan and elsewhere, even on a large scale, one of the most successful percolating systems is the reed bed system.  A group of so-called "experts" is not needed to examine this for another year.  The Government's amendment is an insult to Deputy Martin Kenny's proposal because this has proved itself down through the years on both a large scale and a small scale.</p>  <p>  People test the water where it comes out of the reed bed system or what we would call, "sallies".  Some like to put a fancy name on it such as willow.  Where the water comes out, it is better quality than bathing water.  Those are the facts, according to the experts who have tested the water.  Funnily enough, another group does not want to believe that.</p>  <p>  This comes at a time - I want the Minister of State, Deputy English, to hear me out because he is involved in the rural water schemes that they are looking at - the EPA has taken Irish Water to court.  Irish Water has been fined &euro;6,000, &euro;8,000 and &euro;10,000, respectively, for not putting in sewerage systems in towns.  At the same time, Irish Water submitted applications to make those systems better.  Let us remember that when these companies fine each other, it is all taxpayers' money.  The EPA is hedging for the past year on deciding whether it will award an outflow licence.  I have seen a situation in Glenamaddy, County Galway where there is a new upgrade being done and the discharge licence is out.  One must bear in mind that, whether the environmentalists like it, 50% of the water we extract comes from designated areas and 50% of our output through toilets and sewers will have to go into designated areas.  The EPA is imposing stipulations that one might have to bring a pipe seven miles down the road when one has an outflow beside it, and one is bringing the quality of the treatment from zero at present to 97% purification.  The EPA seems to be a body that is accountable to nobody and it needs to be reined in.</p>  <p>  As was pointed out earlier there might be a theory in Dublin 4 or Dublin generally that it could end up that we would have the half-door to welcome tourists and the west would be a wilderness.  The dream is to go down on a Friday evening and return on Sunday, and spend the weekend surfing and walking.  They are welcome, by the way, but we have to make a living and work in those areas.</p>  <p>  There are rules.  A document issued by the EPA in the past few weeks stated there were 30 places where raw sewage was being discharged.  The agency does not know how to count because there are more smaller towns involved.  Funding is needed.  Communities will help the Government in this regard but someone needs to talk to the EPA.  When one is trying to solve a problem, and the likes of Irish Water has plans in place, the EPA brings it to court.  Someone needs to call a halt to this craic.  Irish Water is dragged through the court using the money required for some of these schemes.  Every &euro;6,000 fine means less will be done.</p>  <p>  Throughout the west, there is good quality land and marginal land.  This is a solution that should be put out in place because it has been proven.  People have been brought in busloads to the plant in Monaghan, and other plants around the country, to see the way they work.  The Bill offers a common-sense solution and will make the quality of water better.  At the same time, in that same county, a helicopter flies around the place spreading fertiliser for forestry that, it has been proven, damages water.  The Government might think that it will get away with having spruce on every road and no people, but there will be a revolt.</p>  <p>  There is time yet before the vote.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment.  I am sick of hearing that this will happen in 2019 and waiting another year.</p><p>We are trying to ensure people live in rural areas, which is not that simple, to make villages sustainable.  They need whatever help they can get.  This is a proactive legislation that Deputy Martin Kenny has brought forward to solve an issue for people who want to build new houses in their areas.  Is the dream to refuse planning permission in all rural areas, push people into the cities, build more ghettos and have no one in rural areas?  It is unacceptable.  The vote on this Bill will prove that common-sense legislation is backed in this House.</p></speech>

It was said earlier that the Minister has proposed we should wait until the end of next year to pass Second Stage.  However, if the Bill passes Second Stage on Thursday, by the time it gets through Committee Stage and Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and then goes to the Seanad, it will be well past the end of next year before it becomes law.  The Minister knows that is the reality.  It will not make any difference, therefore, to delay it.  The Government should go ahead and do what it is doing and this Bill will progress through the system.  If what the Government is doing sorts out the problem, this Bill can fall at any stage without any problem.  However, the proposal to defer the Bill until the end of next year does not stand up.  Nothing will be done between now and then to deal with this situation, as the Minister and everybody in the House knows.  The Minister is just waffling to get the Government over the hump of this debate.</p>  <p>  In supporting the Bill, some Members have said that rural Ireland does not cause any problems, or if it does, they are much smaller than those caused by urban areas, but that misses the point.  All effluent causes problems and it all has to be dealt with.  The fact it is not being dealt with somewhere else does not mean I should fail to deal with my effluent.  This makes no sense.  There has to be a system that allows people in rural Ireland to build and maintain their own systems.  It would be far better if the construction of septic tanks was inspected after they were completed but nothing like this happens.  The only time a septic tank is looked at is during the planning application stage of the development, which is the only time the planners and environmental health officials get any say in what happens.  A completion certificate is signed off at the end, and everybody says it is grand.  However, there is no expectation when a septic tank is built that there should be compliance or that the householder should be sure the contractor has done a proper job.  We would be better off with the system that applies in the Six Counties, where there are three inspections, namely, inspection of the foundations, inspection of the roof and inspection of the septic tank when the building is complete.  That would ensure septic tanks and treatment systems are compatible and that the effluent system is in working order.  It should be part of the planning requirements prior to allowing the development to go ahead.</p>  <p>  It was suggested it was an unintended consequence that had stopped development in County Leitrim but that is not the case.  I believe the intention is to stop rural development.  From the Government's point of view, if it can stop people living in rural areas, they will live in towns and everything will be solved.  If the Government is serious about this, it should make land available in towns and villages for people to build on, and not give it to the private sector, which is what it normally does.  For example, if somebody in a town or village catchment area wants to build on his or her own land, he or she should be given land within the town or village as an alternative.  This would make the town or village viable and it would also keep people in the rural area they belong to, and give them belief and ownership.  It makes total sense.  This would also allow for the combining of treatment systems with other systems so that everything works, in addition to maintaining rural areas.</p>  <p>  We have to do something.  We would all like people to live on their own townland, next door to their parents and so on.  However, one reason people do that is because they cannot afford anything else.  Nothing we have done in this House has worked to make that happen for them.  We should introduce a system that makes it happen.  Until that is done in this House, and we will be a long time waiting, Deputy Martin Kenny's legislation is the correct way to proceed.  We have to facilitate people to live in the rural areas they come from.  For that reason, we should support this legislation and pass it through the Houses.  If the Government wants to propose changes, it can work away on that.  By the time this legislation goes through all the routine it has to go through to become law, the Government's system would be in place and there would be no need for the Bill.</p></speech>

I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I compliment Deputy Martin Kenny on bringing it forward and on the excellent points he made in his contribution.  It is a common-sense approach.  All rural Deputies are aware that the hoops and loops people have to go through to get planning permission make it nigh on impossible.  While there are stringent planning guidelines, I reiterate what was said by Deputy Martin Kenny and others.  We are not trying to have a free-for-all or to break any laws.  However, in 2013 and 2014, Fine Gael, especially under Big Phil, the enforcer, the former Minister, tried to maintain that every house with a septic tank in rural Ireland was causing trouble.  In fact, 99.9% of people with septic tanks look after them very well because it is in their own interest to do so.  They maintain them, unlike people in towns.  The reason the EPA report found that small towns and villages were belching sewage into watercourses, streams and the sea was to make scapegoats of people in the countryside.  I listened to Deputy Martin Kenny and the director of services from Leitrim County Council on radio this morning saying that it has become so bad that people cannot build in their own county.</p>  <p>  We have to take note of the topography of the land.  Deputies Danny Healy-Rae and Scanlon are from different counties, and many Deputies from other counties have also spoken.  My own county of Tipperary, in particular the Golden Vale, has areas with heavy land, wet land and different topography and soil types.  We must change this approach and ensure that people who want to build a house, whether to service a farm or to look after elderly relatives, can be allowed to do it.  They are not looking for a house off the State.  They are prepared to pay the planning and development charges and pay an architect to design the house and a foolproof percolation scheme.  We have seen the reed bed systems, and Mr. Ray O'Dwyer, who was a director of services and worked with Irish Water, was involved in such a scheme in County Waterford 30 years ago.  Some of these schemes are excellent but, instead, we have rules and regulations from the EPA and commonsense has gone out the window.</p>  <p>  Effluent discharges, for which a discharge licence must be obtained under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, include all trade effluent discharges to any water except in accordance with a licence issued by the appropriate regulatory authorities.  I have stopped on the bridge in Newcastle a number of times and have seen the EPA doing tests under it.</p><p>I have asked the EPA to conduct tests 300 yd. south where the sewerage scheme - a large tank - is belching raw sewage into the water but it will not do it.  The EPA is in cahoots with the council.  It will not prosecute the council, but it will prosecute the ordinary person.</p> <p> I welcome Deputy Martin Kenny's Bill, which seeks to allow people who have the wherewithal in terms of a mortgage and between &euro;10,000 and &euro;30,000 to install a proper treatment plant to build a house.  It is time this Bill was enacted.  Deputy Martin Kenny said earlier that he had discussions on the Bill with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and that he is in agreement with him.  I do not understand, therefore, why an amendment has been tabled to delay the Bill.  Allowing the EPA and other agencies to fool around with it is nothing but jobs for the boys, many of whom would not know a bog from a cornfield.  They are all experts on books and they are penalising people and causing trouble for the housing crisis.  I support the Bill and I hope the Government sees sense and deals with it as an effective measure.</p></speech>

If this measure had been in place over the last number of years it would have helped many people and young couples who wanted to put a roof over their heads to get planning permission to do so.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Government are forever telling us what they are going to do to help people and to provide housing for them.  In this instance, we are talking about people who want to build houses for themselves.  They are not asking for money.  All they are asking for is permission to build a home for themselves but they are being denied it.  In places such as Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin, Castletownbere, Lauragh and Sneem the ground is heavy.  Several proposals, whether for a raised bed or otherwise, were shot down and people were refused a discharge licence for a rural cottage.  Many people have applied for a discharge licence.  During a meeting in the council chamber I stood up and said that the council was robbing the people because it has not granted even one discharge licence.  That is the truth.  Not one discharge licence has been granted.  The facility to apply exists but a licence will not be granted.  We want change.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, read out a speech that had been written for him.  I know that he did not understand any of what he read out.  I do understand it.  Propositions can be put together and once a discharge licence can be obtained people will have a chance to put a roof over their heads.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, said that there is a review under way of the rural group schemes and so on, which is fine, but the review will not include the issue addressed in Deputy Martin Kenny's Bill.</p>  <p>  Instead of opposing the Bill and tabling an amendment seeking to delay it until the end of 2019, I am asking the Minister of State to allow it to proceed to committee where it can be discussed with the EPA.  The people who made in the presentation in the audiovisual room today could also make a presentation to the committee.  Southern Scientific, which is operated by Michael Murphy in Killarney will tell its side of the story to the committee, which is representative of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party, the Independents, the Green Party and others.  We want an opportunity to thrash out the issues to see who is right and who is wrong.  We believe that we are right because we have been told by the professionals that there are systems that will work.  We want to give those systems a chance.  We want to allow people the chance to build, including the young man who could not get permission to build on his own farm or a couple of miles away in another townland owing to the rural settlement rules.   Is this young man expected to purchase an expensive house in a town at a cost of &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000?  He cannot do that, because he cannot afford it.  This is the reason people are homeless.  All we are asking for is fair play.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw his amendment and not to hold up the Bill so that people in rural areas will have the opportunity to live in their areas.</p></speech>

The building of one-off housing has been halted in Ireland for a number of years.  This is due to an EPA guideline which stipulates zero emissions from the sewerage system in such homes.  We also have to be honest about the times we live in.  Action on climate change is essential.  We need to preserve our environment for future generations and their future generations and we all have a responsibility in this regard.  How do we measure all of this?  Rural Ireland has been under sustained attack.  Rural depopulation is a serious issue.  The consequences of this have been seen throughout this summer, with community hall meetings happening in every small town and village, fighting to preserve their post office network.  Post office closures have followed bank closures and Garda station closures and these have followed the closure of main street retail stores in small town Ireland through the recession years.  This all needs to be examined.</p>  <p>  I refer the Minister of State to the comments in July 2017 by the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, one of the highest civil servant positions in the State when speaking at the MacGill Summer School in County Donegal.  The Secretary General, Mr. John Moran, said: "The right for children to build to house on their parents' land in rural Ireland should not be an automatic given."  I will repeat this statement: "The right for children to build a house on their parents' land in rural Ireland should not be an automatic given."  This is the nub of the problem.  Government policy has directly created a major social issue.  I find it difficult to believe that indepth discussions were not held in and around Government at that time regarding the development of measures to block the building of one-off housing in rural Ireland.  </p>  <p>  What the Government has done is wrong and damaging.  We now need to look at ways of reintroducing the prospect of one-off housing as a way to repopulate rural Ireland and to allow families to dwell alongside each other in what for many has been their generational home.  What else do we need to do?  We need to bring in environmental experts to address communities across rural Ireland not just on this issue but on many issues.  Rural dwellers are more than open to contributing to our country's commitments on climate change targets.  The green economy can be built upon by repopulating rural Ireland.  They are not mutually self exclusive, as some key thinkers clearly believe, including an examination of Mr. Moran's address last year.</p><p>Solutions through green technology can be found to address the septic tank issue.  Let us find it together.  Let us build rural Ireland again and reach out to those who feel they have been left behind.  Rural Ireland, for those of us who know it intimately, is a proud Ireland, and we should all be proud of it.  I urge Government and all Opposition voices in this House to support Deputy Martin Kenny's amending proposals.</p></speech>

It has been going on for decades, and the political establishment, that is, successive Governments, has done absolutely nothing to try to address it.  Like my colleagues here, I come from and love rural Ireland but I have watched the population where I grew up and where I live decline.  The same can be said for the entire west coast of Ireland, west of the Shannon and indeed many other areas.  Successive Governments have done nothing to address this.  One consequence of the depopulation of rural Ireland is the closure of shops, Garda stations, post offices and all the infrastructure that was sustained by the population that lived there.</p>  <p>  Last night I was at a meeting with the two Deputy Healy-Raes in Dromod in south Kerry.  There were about 150 people there trying to save their post office.  We were told at the meeting that two post offices have closed in Kerry as a result of Government policy, namely, Knocknagashel and Gneevgullia.  This is another nail in the coffin for that part of rural Ireland.  I have also made contact with a number of engineers who do work for constituents, trying to get them planning permission.  All the Deputies here will tell the Minister of State that the biggest obstacle to getting planning permission has always been the population problem and trying to find ways and means of addressing it.  Many of these engineers will tell him they have come up with systems and ideas that can deal with the situation but they have come up against red tape and resistance, in particular from Government policies.  This evening I spoke with another engineer who told me about a raised bed area in Killarney measuring 4 m by 4 m by 1 m, 122 linear m, costing approximately &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000.  He was entitled to a discharge licence and has done a fantastic job.  This could be replicated all over County Kerry, and indeed many other parts of rural Ireland, if the political will was there.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny's proposal offers part of a solution to try to address this.  It deserves and demands the support of every Deputy who cares about rural Ireland.  It is not too long ago, about eight years ago, that Deputy Pearse Doherty and I brought out two reports on coastal communities and a viable rural economy.  Right afterwards, the Government initiated the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report with Pat Spillane, the former Kerry footballer.  Where is that report now?  It is gathering dust on a shelf.  It addressed all the areas we had addressed in our previous report, such as trying to bring the population back to rural Ireland.  Pat Spillane, I understand, would not be a supporter of Sinn F&eacute;in but would perhaps be supportive of the Minister of State's party because it gave him the job.</p></speech>

It offered some hope for rural Ireland but nothing was done about it.  There was a big hullabaloo when the thing was launched but now the report sits there and there is no political will to implement it.</p>  <p>  If the Minister of State has any consideration for rural Ireland, he has his chance to show it here when we vote on this Bill.  He can support it or oppose it.  He can table an amendment to try to push it down the road, which is the intention of the Government, in the hope that it will not be implemented but in so doing he will not be doing the service demanded of him by his constituents to try to have it implemented.  I understand Fianna F&aacute;il, the Independents and practically everyone in this House, to my knowledge, will support it.  It is a question of whether the Government will change its position and support it.  It will not be too long before the Minister of State will be walking the boreens of rural Ireland looking for votes.  There are people out there who have concern for rural Ireland and want it to survive and be a vibrant, sustainable economy in which we can build houses and live in our own communities, where we grew up or went to school, without being forced into the cities and major towns.  I hope they remember the Minister of State's decision when that day comes, and I am quite sure it will not be too long.  I also hope the Minister of State will go to that room where the CEDRA report sits on a shelf covered in dust and dust it off and have a look at it.</p></speech>

The Deputy might want to discuss that with him because I would not have him on our list.  It is unfair and wrong to name people in the Chamber and assume what their political persuasions are unless they want to declare them themselves.  Pat Spillane's report fed into the Action Plan for Rural Development implemented by the Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and Ring, and others.  Even today we saw increased funding announced by the Minister, Deputy Ring, which feeds on from some of the work done in Pat Spillane's report, so it is not sitting on anyone's desk gathering dust.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Martin Kenny for introducing the Bill.  While we cannot agree with everything in it, we all support what it seeks to achieve, and I recognise the genuine attempt in the Bill in this regard, as we all do.  I think everyone who spoke tonight is in support of what the Deputy seeks to achieve in the Bill.  To be very clear, however, and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is very clear on this too, we support one-off rural house construction.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is wrong on this.  He said we have halted such construction in Ireland since 2010, which is not true.  A change was brought in in 2010 - I have to laugh because Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was at the Cabinet in 2010 and supported this but seems to have forgotten this - but that does not mean we halted construction in rural Ireland.  It has meant it has become difficult in some areas to get planning permission.  However, it is not true to say this Government or my Department is against one-off housing.  An average of 5,000 or 6,000 one-off houses have been built every year for the past number of years.  I am happy to debate the Bill in factual terms, not made-up terms.</p></speech>

That is not a true statement for anyone to come out with in this House.  Again, I listened to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and the same accusation that we are against one-off houses.  In Galway all the houses built in recent years have been one-off houses, so the Deputy's statement is just not true.  I am happy to debate this.  I know there are problems in certain areas but I ask Deputies to have an honest conversation about what is true and what is not true.  The facts do not back up some of the comments that were made during the debate.  It is not factual to say we as a Government are against one-off housing.  It is not true.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and now I have clarified what is in Project Ireland 2040.  I have debated this in this House, the other House and council chambers all around the country and we have been very clear that there are clear criteria for one-off housing to be allowed in future scenarios under the national planning framework.  I, therefore, ask Deputies to not try to muddy the waters.  That is different from trying to find environmental solutions, and I want to be very clear about that.</p>  <p>  Much of the conversation tonight has been about rural decline.  I live in rural Ireland, Deputy Ferris.  I know all about it.  I am on those laneways and roads every day of the week, so-----</p></speech>

Some parts of rural Ireland has been in decline for many years, although not all parts.  They were let decline and there was no effort to save rural Ireland or to give certain parts of the country a function or a reason to prosper, or the opportunity to prosper.  It is not because of changes to one-off planning.  That has not led to the decline of rural Ireland.  In some areas where we see services being removed, such as a post office, the population has gone up.  People choose not to use the service.  That is different.  Yes, in other areas, it is because of a population decline, but not in all areas.  Deputies are right to do the research and the checking, but there are different reasons for different things.</p><p>Sometimes services closed because either nobody wanted to use them or they were not used enough to make them viable.  That is different to a decline in population.</p> <p> I reiterate what I have stated on previous occasions, namely, that I, as a Deputy from rural Ireland, have no difficulty in declaring that the saving of rural Ireland is in Project Ireland 2040.  It is a thought-out plan on how to make living in rural Ireland sustainable.  It concerns how to give villages, towns and cities a regional presence and build them up in order that they can serve rural Ireland and accommodate one-off housing.  As Deputy Pringle correctly stated - I have also said this previously - not all of those who want to live in rural Ireland want to live in such housing.  Many people want to do so, however, and we have to support them and change what we can in order to make it happen.  Many others want to live in rural Ireland.  They are quite happy to live in towns or villages but not necessarily out in the country.  Deputy Pringle was also correct when he stated that they did not have the option previously because they could not afford to do it.  I fully agree with that we should bring forward proposals to use State-owned land, where possible, and other land in order to make it easy, viable and economical to live in a village or on the edge of it.  That has not happened in the past but it is envisaged in Project Ireland 2040.  I will be happy to support the Deputy in that and do some of the work as well.</p> <p> The other point Deputy Pringle made to the effect that it is often not cost-effective to build a one-off house is also correct.  That fact was lost in the debate on water charges.  It was completely and utterly lost in the context of the cost for a rural dweller of ensuring that his or her house is connected to water and wastewater services.  Deputy Pringle led the charge against water charges, which was an attempt to try to balance matters a little and to fund services.  We can not have it every which way.  I agree that there are high costs to living in rural Ireland.  One of them is putting in treatment facilities.  We agree that it is important that we treat drinking water and wastewater.</p> <p> People are saying that this is a great Bill and that what it proposes has to be done.  It is not the full solution and that is why we have asked for a deferral for a number of months.  The amendment refers to a period of 12 months but the Minister was very clear in stating that we hope to complete our work before that.  There are two pieces of work under way.  Deputy Pringle and many others claim that it will never happen.  However, the work to which I refer is almost finished.  A review group was set up by the Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services.  It is bringing forward a policy change and recommendations.  That process is under way.  The EPA will also to publish a new revised code of practice for wastewater treatment and disposal systems serving single houses for public consultation in early 2019.</p> <p> The 12-month period I mentioned is the worst-case scenario.  We are committed to trying to do it before that.  Work is under way to allow this to happen.  As a result, we are asking for a deferral in order to allow that work to be completed so that we can all come together to bring forward solutions.  The potential licensing arrangement is not the full solution.  It could possibly be part of the solution.  In some cases these licences are already allowed, if they are wanted, and, in other cases, they are not used or the situation is complicated.  I am just saying that it is not the full solution.  What we actually have to devise is a cost-effective solution.  In fairness, I have conversed with councillors from Leitrim - John McCartin, S&eacute;an McDermott, Frank Dolan and others - on numerous occasions.  Deputy McLoughlin has been to meet me and has also put forward solutions.  He had hoped to be here tonight to take part in this debate.</p> <p> I informed to Deputy Martin Kenny that the solution to this is all of us working together.  He understands that but I want to be clear that we support effective solutions.  Leitrim officials in charge of planning, such as Mr. Joseph Gilhooly, have brought forward solutions.  The people in the planning system are happy to try to find solutions, have engaged with our Department and the EPA and have brought in researchers from University College Dublin and elsewhere.  They are trying to find a solution but it has to be cost-effective.  Everyone states that a licence is needed.  That is only part of the solution; we need to find the second part.  That is what the research and the work we are doing involve.  There are many solutions available.  This Bill does not specify a particular solution.  I accept that.  The difficulty with the various solutions is that many of them are expensive.  Others are not.  We have to make sure we get this right and that was what the researchers were trying to do.  We support trying to find a solution.  I have attended meetings of Leitrim County Council and I addressed all of the councillors and different parties there.  I said to them straight up we have to try to find solutions.  We are engaged in a process and in some cases it will work.  We have to make it work because we want it to be viable.</p> <p> In some parts of Leitrim, only 20 or 30 one-off houses were built in many years.  That was even before these changes.  That is an area that can cope with one-off housing, as can other places such as parts of Cavan, Donegal and Sligo.  If we can sort out these environmental issues, Leitrim is a county that can cope.  We can do that and we are committed to doing it.  I wish to make it clear that we want to work to find solutions.  We are asking for a common-sense deferral of the Bill while we await the two pieces of work that have commenced and that are going to be completed.  Then, in a logical way and with the full agreement of this House, we can bring forward solutions.  We all agree we want solutions in Leitrim and other counties.</p> <p> We are supportive and we all recognise the importance of the sustainable development of one-off housing in an appropriate way.  That is what we encourage.  We ask that the Bill be deferred but I guess that is not going to happen.  People have to realise what the conversation is about here but they should not try to state that we are against one-off housing or that it does not happen at all.  That is not factually correct.  It is important that we get that right when we are having the conversation as well.  I understand the intention behind the Bill and I listened to all of the contributions.  I recognise the positive elements to the Bill.  We had some engagement on it and we are hoping to have more as well.</p> <p> Maintaining and developing viable rural communities, and the economy and the environment to allow that to happen, is a key challenge for the State.  We have to have a sympathetic approach to achieving this.  It is a challenge we are up for and it is a challenge that Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework and the investment of taxpayers' money behind that will make happen.  If people want to live in rural Ireland, they need a reason to be there.  They have to have access to jobs and services.  We need to build up the areas that can either attract or create jobs.  None of this is possible without a healthy environment.  Other development efforts will prove futile in the long term if we do not get that right and protect the environment.  There is a growing recognition that water quality is a great asset but also a great challenge and responsibility.  That is why we want to get it right.  I have no problem stating that this is taking longer than anyone thought.  I accept that.  This change was made by previous Governments.  Some people spoke as if they were never in government.  The change was made a long time ago, however.  We have been focusing on solutions for the past year or two.  The Department has engaged with Leitrim County Council and the councillors there across the various parties.  We have made good progress.  The Bill, or one like it with provision for a licensing arrangement, could be part of that but it is not the only solution.  It makes common sense to defer it for a few months as we all try to work on this.  It should be a non-political issue if we all agree.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Martin Kenny on introducing it.  I had many points to but I had the opportunity to sit for a long time and listen to many of the previous speakers.  To be honest, I am a bit confused.  The Minister stated that there would continue to be support for the provision of one-off rural housing where it is needed and wanted and where the protection of our natural environment and water sources can be ensured.  There is agreement on that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny's Bill offers an ecological solution.  It is not an idea, it is an ecological solution.  If we amalgamate what the Minister of State, Deputy English, stated with Deputy Kenny's solution, I think we are in the same boat already.  Why was it necessary for the Government to table an amendment in the first instance?  I do not like the idea of kicking the can down the road.  When we have solutions, why does the Government not back them?  What is proposed would benefit everybody.  We have listened to arguments about rural depopulation and about rural Ireland falling apart.  Rural Ireland is not 60 miles from the nearest town, it could be five minutes down the road.</p></speech>

It was called a common-sense approach.  If a family and some siblings wanted to build on land, they should be facilitated if they work in the locality and are contributing to it.  It was not an issue because there was a common-sense approach.  The Minister of State referred to some of the specific actions to be undertaken.  These could also be undertaken while the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage because it will complement the work.</p>  <p>  This all goes back to ecological solutions - not ideas - to support people by providing grants schemes and assisting them with the costs relating to septic tank remediation.  These are all the positive knock-on effects and building blocks from where sewage leaves the house, goes into the septic tank, passes through a filter unit and heads out into the willow bank.  I cannot understand why, when a Member of this House - regardless of what party he or she belongs to - comes forward with a genuine solution that will benefit people, the intention is to stall the ball.  The reason for such behaviour bemuses me on occasion.</p>  <p>  We have to consider the bigger picture.  People want to live near their parents.  We have an ageing population.  Previous speakers mentioned that we no longer have post offices, meeting places or local pubs.  In some areas, we have nothing.  </p>  <p>  Many of the houses to which the Bill relates are 50 or 60 years old.  The people who live in them are in their 70s.  What is left for them?  Reference was made for the plan up to 2040.  In 40 years' time, there will be no one living in rural Ireland.  The people who live there now will all be dead.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p> <p>We will end up with ruins and people will scratch their heads because there will be another 20,000 ha of pine trees and what will be done with them because there will be nobody to cut them down?  Nobody will do it because everybody will be living in cities or will have emigrated.  There are major implications from this.  Regenerate local areas and bring back local people to live in those areas.  The people with local knowledge will always benefit the local area.</p> <p> This is not an idea but rather a fabulous solution.  If the Government is genuinely interested in doing the right thing, as the Minister indicated in stating we can ensure the protection of the natural environment and water sources and "We will continue to support the provision of one-off rural housing", Deputy Martin Kenny's amending legislation will certainly add clout.  It is an ecological solution that is working, as we have seen with the underground ecosystems involving the burial of a pipe 1.5 m underground.  When it is run into the base of the house, it heats the building during the winter and cools it in summer.  These are solutions rather than ideas, as they work.  Please think about this.  The other matters raised by the Minister can run parallel to this but it will be a year or so before the rest of those investigations are done.  This is certainly something that is extremely positive and beneficial.  It needs the full support of this House because it will benefit everybody in the long run.  There is an ecological benefit.  It is a win-win scenario so I cannot understand why the Government will not support it.</p></speech>

They were mainly in favour of the Bill, although the Labour Party indicated it had some reservations.  It is clear the vast majority of those who live and work with people in rural Ireland understand this problem needs a solution.  In fairness, the Minister of State and many of his colleagues have said that when I mentioned this to them.  They understand this needs a solution, not in a year or two but now.  We must bring it into practice now.</p><p>I thank my colleagues from Leitrim who came here this evening, Mr. Padraig Fallon and Mr. S&eacute;adhna Logan.  I particularly thank Mr. Frank Davitt, a planner in north Leitrim who deals with this all the time.  Earlier this evening we had a little presentation in the audiovisual room.  He displayed a map of the country, indicating the areas where soil was heavier.  Leitrim and the north west was particularly afflicted but we could see the problem in parts of Clare, Cork, Donegal and the Minister of State's own county.  It is most acute in counties where the majority of the land has this problem, which is the case with Leitrim.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned that he spoke with people in Leitrim and many of his party's councillors there, as well as others on the country council, and they have been trying to find a solution.  Some of those solutions are very expensive because the effort has been to try to achieve zero discharge.  When one tries to achieve zero discharge, one ends up with a system that will be extremely expensive as much of the expense goes into checking if there is zero discharge.  We want to get away from zero discharge but allow discharge of a completely treated effluent that is to bathing water standard.  It is clear that a licence can have that as a condition of the granting of the licence.  The wastewater licence can then be a tool the Government can use to guarantee that water will be treated to the highest possible level.</p><p>The Minister went through a lot of stuff earlier and I know from experience that most ministerial speeches are written for and handed to them.  Much of the stuff was irrelevant to what we are dealing with, which is a very specific matter.  It concerns a case where a percolation test is failed and the EPA guidelines stipulate that planning permission cannot be granted.  We want a solution where we can get planning granted where it is appropriate and meets all other conditions.  It is about allowing people to get planning permission in order that they can live in a rural area.  I know the Minister of State understands this but for some reason or another, a couple of officials in some Department or other seem to tell Ministers that we must find a way of blocking this because it will not look good to Europe.  We have sent EPA guidelines to Europe and this does not conflict with those guidelines; it enhances them and provides a solution with which we can all work.</p><p>One-off housing has been mentioned, particularly whether people are for or against it.  We cannot have an <i>Animal Farm</i>attitude to this that all one-off housing is good or bad.  It is about where such housing is appropriate or it works.  Such building must meet environmental needs and the needs of the community and society in general.  It must work that way.  People are blocking it because of an ideological fixation that one-off housing is bad but they must understand that this cannot be the case any more than all rural or urban dwelling is good or bad.  A mix or balance is required and we must restore that balance.</p><p>I will give the Minister of State some examples.  A few years ago, a couple from Dublin inherited a piece of land not that far from me.  They approached me at the time because they inherited the land from a relative and they wanted planning permission to build.  I imagine from speaking with them they were strong supporters of the Green Party as they had a vision of building an ecological house with a grass roof, with an organic garden of vegetables.  They were going to have a magnificent lifestyle.  They went to the council but could not get planning.  They were told to go away as they were not allowed there.  A few years later they had to sell the land and disappear.  Those people were going to enhance the community but they were not granted planning permission.</p></speech>

The refusal came because of the EPA guidelines.  In my parish of Aghavas, there is no town or village.  It is a rural parish with approximately 600 people scattered over 20 sq. km.  There is a three-teacher school but next year it will be a two-teacher school.  The football club is under pressure because we do not have enough children in the parish.  There are at least ten families from the parish who want to move back, build houses and live in the community but they cannot do so because of the percolation test problem.  We need a solution and I want to work with the Minister of State and the Government to produce a solution that works for those families.  There is a similar problem in the neighbouring parish of Drumreilly, a rural parish with no town.  It is the same with Gortletteragh, a rural parish with no town either.  It is the case with many areas across the country.</p>  <p>  The Government has proposed to kick this down the road for a year but if this has to go through Committee and all other Stages, most of the year will probably have passed.  There is no need to kick it down the road.  I appeal to the Minister of State to withdraw the Government's amendment and support the Bill.  It should work with everybody else who is on board with this so we can formulate a solution to this problem for everyone.</p></speech>
