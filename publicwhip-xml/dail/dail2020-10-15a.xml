Will the Government consider the establishment of an Industrial Development Authority or similar body specifically to focus on microbusinesses, workers' co-operatives, and small and medium-sized enterprises?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500003#A00500"><p>The Government values the role of SMEs and microenterprises in our economy and as creators of employment throughout Ireland.  Balancing our enterprise policy between foreign direct investment, FDI, export-only businesses and non-exporting indigenous firms is an important policy consideration and one which was touched upon by the OECD in its 2019 report on entrepreneurship and SME policy in Ireland.  The OECD report refers to 250,000 active enterprises in Ireland, of which 92% are very small businesses with ten employees or fewer.  Such a high number presents challenges in terms of the State&rsquo;s engagement with and support for enterprises.  It also creates challenges in complying with the EU's state aid rules.  In terms of expanding the number of businesses eligible, the local enterprises offices, LEOs, have already started on this road with the productivity fund and business continuity voucher which targeted an expanded cohort of enterprises, namely, firms with up to 50 employees which would not customarily have qualified for funding.  Enterprise Ireland is also working with a broader base of non-exporting SMEs, with the retail online scheme and the Covid-19 sustaining enterprise fund.</p>  <p>  Whatever overarching institutional framework we have for developing microbusinesses and SMEs, it is important that a benign environment is in place for SMEs to start up, scale up, access international markets and enable SMEs to become more productive and ready for the transition to a digital and green economy.  In that context, I have established the SME growth task force as committed to in the programme for Government.  The task force is designing a national SME growth plan that will map out an ambitious long-term strategic blueprint for SMEs and entrepreneurs.  It meets for the second time this Friday, 16 October and the possibility of establishing a new agency for SMEs will be part of its deliberations.  The task force will also examine the recommendations of the 2019 OECD report, including the strategic framework and current delivery system for SME supports and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  This new task force is composed of a broad range of business people with expertise in a range of sectors, as well as SME representative groups and other individuals uniquely positioned to contribute to a long-term vision for the SME sector and how best it can be supported by Government.   I hope to receive recommendations from the task force in November.</p></speech>

As he said himself, almost 70% of people employed in Ireland are employed in small or medium enterprises.  When speaking to those in these businesses, they often say they feel left behind and that successive Governments have preferred to focus on foreign direct investment instead of helping indigenous industry.  Foreign direct investment has been a crucial component of Irish industrial strategy and has been really important for my own area, the mid-west.  Almost 90% of all the State's exports originate from foreign-owned multinational corporations based in Ireland, and this acts as a boost to our GDP as well as being a significant job creator.  SMEs however, are the lifeblood of the Irish economy and cannot be neglected.  This is especially true as we face the twin crises of Brexit and Covid.  There is an opportunity, however, in the midst of these crises for our SMEs and microbusinesses to capture the market share of any available opportunities which may arise due to Brexit in particular, and that is the reason we have put down this question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500003#A00700"><p>The idea of a new agency is certainly something I have an open mind on.  A lot of business people I talk to say they feel there is a gap.  When a business is very small, it can get help from the local enterprise offices and, when it is a bit larger or is an exporter, from Enterprise Ireland, but there is a gap in between.  The question is whether we fill that gap by expanding the role of Enterprise Ireland or the local enterprise offices or whether we set up a new agency to fill the gap.  There is an important constraint we need to bear in mind here. When we are attracting FDI into Ireland, we are competing with Tel Aviv, Amsterdam, London and other places.  When we are helping an exporter to export, it is generally competing with other companies abroad.  An indigenous company, however, is very often competing with a company in the same town, two towns over or in the same county, and we must be very careful to not use taxpayers' money in the form of State aid to help one business to take business off another when both are in the same town or county.  That is why there is often a constraint on what we can or should do.</p></speech>

That is why we see a specific focus being needed on local SMEs and small companies.  We believe the greatest potential for growth in the next few years is within our SME sector.  SMEs are the priority when it comes to fostering indigenous industries and ensuring job creation.  With that in mind, I again ask whether the T&aacute;naiste and his Department will consider the establishment of an Industrial Development Authority, IDA, style agency or similar enterprise agency specifically focused on microbusinesses, workers' co-operatives and small and medium-sized enterprises so they have a body to advise them specifically, help them and advocate for them?  The IDA has done a wonderful job, as has Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland, which is often forgotten.  The latter agency has done really good work in recent years, creating and sustaining and keeping jobs going.</p></speech>

We have provided that agency with extra funding for next year.  I am keen to engage and work closely with my counterpart in the North, the Minister for the Economy, Ms Diane Dodds MLA, with whom I have already met, to see what is possible and what we can do on an all-island economy basis and to use that agency to its full potential as it is one that has more potential.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500003#A01200"><p>I am committed to bringing in a statutory sick pay scheme for Ireland as part of my work programme for next year.</p> <p>Such a scheme would improve workers' terms and conditions, particularly low paid workers, but there are various issues to consider before we establish the scheme.</p> <p> As a starting point, I presented a draft issues paper on statutory sick pay to the labour employer economic forum, LEEF, sub-group on employment legislation and regulation on Wednesday, 30 September, with a view to commencing a consultation process.  We had an initial discussion at the meeting and I asked employers, unions, ICTU and IBEC to consider the range of issues and policy options set out in the paper and submit their views to the Department by this week.  I am not sure whether this has happened but we were due to hear back from them this week.  Their views will be taken on board and a revised paper will then be discussed at a further meeting of the LEEF sub-group in November.  I do not think any stakeholder is rigidly opposed to it.  Certainly ICTU is in favour and the employer groups have pointed out that many employers already offer sick pay schemes.  Of course, many do not.</p> <p> There are cost implications and perhaps staffing and competitiveness implications for some companies, so all of these issues will have to be worked through carefully, thoroughly and quickly.  Any move to introduce a new scheme that will impose further costs on business, particularly small businesses, cannot be done lightly.  It needs to be structured in a way that ensures the benefits to workers, employers and society outweigh any costs involved and that the costs are shared.  Micro and small businesses are particularly vulnerable.  A statutory sick pay scheme must be balanced with the need to ensure the viability of businesses and the enterprise sector, thereby protecting jobs.  Our focus is on getting people back to work as quickly as possible in all regions and all sectors, including the hospitality and retail sectors in particular.</p> <p> I have committed to moving through the process, including a full public consultation, as quickly as possible and to publish the general scheme of a Bill by March 2021, with a view to having the Bill enacted in the second quarter of 2021 and up and running before the end of next year.</p> <p> As an important first step on the road to a statutory sick pay scheme, this week the budget reduced the waiting days for illness benefit from six days to three.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500004#B00200"><p>We saw just how exposed we are due to the absence of sick pay in some sectors.  The meat processing industry is probably the most high profile of these.  It is a wet industry and an environment where colds and flus are very prevalent.  Obviously this has fed into the risk that goes beyond the industry to the individuals themselves and to society generally.  This is unlikely to change before next year.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned sharing the cost and I ask him to expand on this.  Was there anything in the budget about the State side?  Most public servants will be covered but not the totality, particularly people subbing in and possibly people employed on an agency basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500004#B00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I will have to defer to the Minister, Deputy McGrath, on the public sector side.  What was in the budget was the reduction in the number of days to wait for illness benefit from six days to three days.  This benefits employees and employers.  If people are sick for any reason other than Covid they will now qualify for illness benefit on the fourth day rather than the seventh day, which was the case previously.  I intend to bring it back to one or two days next year.  This will benefit employees who are sick for reasons other than Covid.  If they are sick because of Covid they will qualify for the pandemic illness benefit.</p>  <p>  It will also be beneficial to employers who do pay sick pay because it means they can now reclaim more of that sick pay from the Social Insurance Fund.  One of the reasons employers pay PRSI is so they can reclaim from the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  We do need to share the cost.  The Labour Party's Bill is well-intentioned but it puts the entire cost on the employer.  If somebody is out for six weeks the employer would have to pay that person and hire another person to cover the absence.  This could be very expensive for a very small employer.  It is only fair that the costs should be shared.</p></speech>

One of the delights of living in Dublin and in the country is occasionally getting stuck behind a tractor.  My question is fairly straightforward.  It relates to the explosion in the number of people working from home.  Will the Minister consider putting in place recognition for remote working as a protected form of work, with particular safeguards, protections and allowances for these workers?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500004#B00600"><p>Having had the experience of being a member of Fingal County Council and being stuck behind a tractor not too far from Skerries I can understand how sometimes it can delay journeys.</p>  <p>  As our country continues to navigate Covid-19, remote working has become more important than ever before.  This is reflected in the programme for government, which contains commitments aimed at facilitating remote work across Ireland.  The programme for government recognises that remote work can provide benefits in terms of regional development, climate action, work-life balance and female entrepreneurship.</p>  <p>  As a response to Covid-19, my Department launched a new web page dedicated to providing guidance for working remotely.  This web page is a central access point for all of the Government guidance currently available on remote working.  It allows employers and employees to navigate the existing guidance and legislation relevant to remote working and provides information for people working from home during the course of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  In July, the Department launched a public consultation on remote work.  We received 522 submissions from employers, employees, representative bodies and special interest groups.  Based on the analysis of the submissions, my Department is using the insights garnered to enhance and refine further the current remote working guidance and the forthcoming strategy.  The web page will be updated regularly to reflect any changes made in response to the consultation, with the first update before the end of this year.</p>  <p>  My Department will publish a remote working strategy before the end of the year and this work is taking place under the guidance of an interdepartmental group.  The strategy will consider what changes are needed to develop an environment that encourages remote working solutions.</p>  <p>  The programme for government contains a commitment to bring forward proposals on a right to disconnect, with consideration being given to a role for the Workplace Relations Commission in this regard.</p>  <p>  In relation to taxation, there are already arrangements in place that allow remote workers to claim certain allowances to cover costs incurred due to working from home.  As outlined in budget 2021, these arrangements have been extended to include the cost of broadband and claims for any other vouched expenses occurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment.</p></speech>

Technology now allows people to work from home and remotely work in a way that has never been possible before but there are a number of issues, chief among which is one to which the Minister referred.  If people are working at home they are always at work and always at home.  There needs to be a clear definition of remote work as a protected form of work.  We have seen, and it should be encouraged, that people have the right to work from home.  I worked for a union and we often fought for the right for people to be able to work from home and access remote working.  Now we find it is almost an imperative and people are being encouraged to do it.  It requires very specified legislation to ensure these protections are in place.  We also need to be cognisant of the fact that many people live in overcrowded or unsuitable accommodation.  For them, working from home is not necessarily an option but remote working in a hub or similar would be an option.  This is something the Minister should also be looking at.</p></speech>

One of these is how it has turned the world on its head when it comes to remote working and home working.  What has happened over recent months as a consequence of the pandemic probably would have taken us ten years as a planned strategy.  When we were writing the programme for government we were thinking about how we would retain what we have gained in terms of home working and remote working.  Within a few months, we were wondering whether we would ever get people back to the offices because our city centres are in real trouble because of the lack of footfall.</p>  <p>  What we are getting back from staff surveys is that approximately 10% or 15% are dying to get back to the office.  These are often younger people, people working out of a bedroom while somebody else works out of the sitting room and people in apartments.  Another 10% or 15% want to work from home forever and approximately 70% are in between and want blended working.  This is the way to go and what our policy should try to facilitate, whereby people might spend a few days in HQ, a day or two at home and one day perhaps in a remote hub near where they live.</p></speech>

There needs to be a focus on establishing hubs.  I would like to see some in my area, Balbriggan.  There is a small, privately run one in Skerries but there is definitely scope for more in Balbriggan and other areas of north County Dublin, as well as across the board, to ensure that people can have the option.  It needs to be a realistic option.  The response from the Government has to focus on the needs of workers and employers and recognise there will be additional requirements from both parties - workers and employers.  The employer has to ensure that the person will not lose out because he or she is remote working, while the employee has to ensure that he or she is able to perform all his or her duties.  That will require a legislative change and particular protections because remote workers could turn out to be some of the most vulnerable workers as this issue progresses, and now is the time to have that conversation and to learn from the recent experience.</p></speech>

The kinds of legislative change we need to think about include the right to request remote working or homeworking; the right to disconnect, so that the employee is not always at work when at home, which could be oppressive for people; and the risk to the country of losing people who currently live and work in Ireland to remote working from, perhaps, the Canary Islands, Ibiza, Poland or India.  That is a risk to us in terms of losing jobs and revenue, so we need to be wise to it too.</p>  <p>  Access to broadband is improving.  The national broadband plan is happening now and is very much a reality on the ground.  Hopefully, it will take four or five years, not six or seven.  I am glad that as leader of the previous Government, we pressed ahead with it.  We got almost no support from any other party but I do not think anyone would wish to cancel that contract now.</p>  <p>  There is funding, both from my Department and that of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to develop remote hubs over the next couple of years.  I have seen some great ones throughout the country, particularly where an old heritage building, such as an old bank or an old post office, in the middle of a village or town has been brought back to life.  There are great opportunities in that regard.</p></speech>

We recognise that and the budget is an attempt to respond.  Too many businesses have been severely impacted by the restrictions needed to ensure public health safety during the pandemic.  The agenda has to be to protect public health while also trying to ensure we can keep our economy alive and open, keeping people in jobs and businesses open as long as possible.  Our response to Covid-19 will continue to assist those businesses affected.  The budget builds on announcements made in May and in the July stimulus plan.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides a significant additional package of tax and fiscal measures to build the resilience of the economy and help vulnerable but viable businesses in all sectors.  It has been well recognised by the business community that this is what the budget is trying to achieve, that is, to protect and support businesses to keep their doors open, to keep their employees on the books and, at the first available opportunity, to be able to grow that number of employees and regrow their businesses.  The budget comes in addition to the July stimulus plan, a substantial financial package to stimulate our economy worth more than &euro;5 billion, including &euro;2 billion in loan guarantees for the new credit guarantee scheme, the benefits of which will be seen in the months ahead.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 is unprecedented in scale at almost &euro;18 billion.  Its purpose is to protect the lives and livelihoods of everyone in the State, irrespective of age.  In 2021, workers will see no increases to income tax, the universal social charge, USC, or PRSI; a modest increase in the minimum wage, as recommended by the Low Pay Commission; and a reduction from six to three in waiting days for illness benefit, to be paid on day four, which will be of assistance not only to employees but also to businesses because we all recognise that many SMEs have been trying to work with their employees and carry some of the costs of absenteeism and so on.  It will certainly help them and lead to discussion on introducing statutory sick pay, which the T&aacute;naiste mentioned earlier and flagged in recent days.  Further measures include an extension of parental leave benefit by a further three weeks to five weeks, building on the work of the previous Government; an increase in the earned income tax credit for the self-employed; and self-employed workers in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, will now be able earn up to &euro;480 per month.  A strong case was made that some SMEs have begun to get back on their feet and get some work, but they also need the support of the PUP to keep them going.</p>  <p>  There is also a new Covid restrictions support scheme, which has already been beneficial and will continue to be.  The employment wage subsidy scheme will be extended, as will the commercial rates holiday, and there is more that I can outline in my follow-up response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1612" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500005#C00700"><p>I welcome the initiatives in the budget but they will not be enough for certain cohorts of people, particularly the self-employed.  I accept that everybody is affected and we are all in favour of trying to avoid the risks to public health.  As the T&aacute;naiste noted on &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot;, however, we have to balance that with everything else, and we have not been doing so.  The Minister of State referred to the &euro;480 that self-employed people can earn.  I welcome that, not because it is a support but because they want to keep their businesses.  If customers ring them, they want to be allowed to help them out because they do not want some large company taking their work from them.  They value the service of their customers and their customers value the businesses; it is a <i>quid pro quo</i>.</p><p>Self-employed people over the age of 66 have been totally excluded, such as dance teachers, musicians, artists, lorry drivers and many others.  If they do not pay rates, they will not be able to avail of the schemes because they park beside houses, even though they have so many expenses.  They may have built up a wide network of customers and they want to be able to maintain that.  I welcome the &euro;480 a month for those reasons, rather than for the reasons the Minister of State outlined.  It just goes to show that the researchers and the people in the Department do not get it or understand what it is like to be self-employed.  There are not enough of them in the Chamber talking to the Minister, although there are enough of them in the party of the Minister and the Minister of State.</p></speech>

We will look at all ideas and initiatives.  The economic recovery plan will be published in November, for which a &euro;3.4 billion recovery fund has been set aside to fund ideas and new initiatives and to target certain sectors through our agencies.  There is also contingency funding.  More than &euro;5 billion that has been set aside to work with during 2021, to fund ideas and initiatives and to target certain sectors through our agencies, has not been allocated in detail under the budget.  We can fund any ideas the Deputy might bring forward.</p>  <p>  This is very much a budget to support business and the self-employed.  We have been engaging with businesses through representative bodies and individually in recent months to find out what their needs are, the first of which is the wage subsidy scheme.  We have confirmed that the scheme can be extended beyond April next year if necessary, while the restart grant, processed through rates, has been very beneficial.</p>  <p>  Our business supports do not differentiate by age.  The Deputy mentioned people over the age of 66 but our business supports are for all businesses to keep their doors open.  We recognise that at some restriction levels, some companies cannot function as they normally would.  We will support them more greatly in such cases, which is what the Covid restrictions support scheme is for.  The main thing is that we are supporting businesses and we will work with them.  We will introduce sector-specific welfare if needs be.</p></speech>

The over-66s have been excluded.  They did not get even an additional &euro;5 in their pensions.  They got nothing.  They got nothing in the PUP, which they were not eligible for.  It must be increased to &euro;350 for the other self-employed people who need it right now.  Of course I appreciate that the wage subsidy scheme has been extended and that it may be extended past April, and the extension of the PUP, but they need to be increased.  The Government must consider the over-66s, who have been totally abandoned and whose businesses have closed.  Many of them are publicans, taxi drivers, bus drivers for private companies, bus owners or musicians with wonderful talent to share with their communities, who love and miss them dearly.  That whole cohort is being missed.  We cannot just abandon those over the age of 66, some of whom are fitter than we will be at that age, God bless them.</p>  <p>  We must ensure that the hospitality sector is protected too.  The Government must deal with the regulators to ensure that utility providers are not screwing places that have closed, such as hotels and bed and breakfast businesses.  When they have closed, they still must pay significant utility fees and that is totally unacceptable.  The Minister of State is not listening.  The Government is abandoning the over-66s.</p></speech>

We support business and job creation and that is what we are trying to do.  I am happy to say the budget has addressed every issue the Deputy raised.

This was the case generally even before Covid but it is certainly the case in relation to Covid and Brexit, which is coming down the tracks.  We have taken a strong regional approach over the past seven or eight years as Fine Gael has been involved in various Governments.  The statistics show the majority of jobs, more than 65%, are created outside of Dublin and in the regions.  That is a constant aim and something we can never take for granted so we are constantly focused on pushing jobs out to the regions.  Project 2040 and the long-term plans therein are about regional balance and investment for jobs in all sectors and services.</p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies assist enterprises of all types and sizes in Ireland, and of all ages, to return to Deputy Mattie McGrath's point.  This includes access to finance, management development, mentoring, business development programmes, market supports and trade promotion.  In addition to the regional focus of the enterprise agencies and the network of local enterprise offices, LEOs, nine regional enterprise plans for the period to 2020 were launched in early 2019, building on the previous regional plans we had, and they are currently being implemented.  These plans were developed by regional stakeholders and overseen by my Department.  It is a bottom-up approach involving local players in collaboration to bring forward the best ideas and projects we can fund at a national level.</p>  <p>  In preparing for Brexit, the Government has introduced a range of measures to assist businesses and SMEs, including Brexit checklists and advisory tools, direct grants and loans.  For example, Enterprise Ireland are running an online customs insights course and will launch a new Brexit readiness checker, while the new &euro;2 billion credit guarantee scheme is the largest guarantee scheme ever provided for Irish businesses.  These measures ensure there is financial assistance and advice available for Irish businesses as they resume trading and rebuild through Covid and Brexit.  The supports are available through our LEOs, Enterprise Ireland and the other agencies in our Department.</p>  <p>  The regional enterprise development fund is currently funding 68 projects across all regions to a value of &euro;100 million and the Border enterprise development fund is funding 11 projects in the Border region to a value &euro;17 million, trying to target the resources where, as the Deputy rightly says, they are needed.  In addition, 12 projects to the value of &euro;4.6 million have been approved under the regional technology clustering fund.  These projects will enable regions throughout Ireland to build enterprise capability and capacity in a post-Brexit environment.</p></speech>

He said clearly there is a balance of development across the regions but does that explain why the European Commission has downgraded the Border and the northern and western area from a more developed to a transition region?  That happened because the growth is not there, including in jobs.  For example, the growth in high-value jobs in the north and west was 5.4%, whereas in the east and midlands it was 17%.  The average wage is about &euro;7,000 less.  We do not need to hear more of the same.  We need to see new innovations and actions to deliver that balance of development.</p></speech>

The whole design of having the regional enterprise funds and regional plans is to tap in to the entrepreneurial spirit of those regions and get collaboration across State agencies and, more important, across the business community in those sectors.  I have been involved with them in my previous time in the Department.  There is much opportunity in those regions.  It is fair to say that our efforts in the past seven or eight years have tried to redress a regional that happened for many years before that, probably for 30 or 40 years.  Since 2014, 2015 and 2016 the focus has been on the regions and on direct investment there.</p>  <p>  It is having positive results and I will give an example.  In quarter 1 of 2015 in the Border region, unemployment was at 15.9%.  By quarter 2 of this year, it was down to 5%, though it has been affected by Covid since then.  In the midlands region, it was at nearly 15% and it was down to just under 6% earlier this year.  We recognise that the past six or seven months have changed that picture and we have to refocus our minds but there has been a good deal of success.  I said in my opening comments that I would not take that success for granted.  There is much work to do to make sure it is sustainable growth and to create sustainable and high-end jobs in those regions.  We are happy to work with the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

In that context, because we will now be a transition region, we have an opportunity for European structural and investment funds.  That means there can be a better co-financing rate.  Will this Government ensure the highest possible co-financing rate of 60% <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>40% elsewhere?  Will it look at integrated territorial investment?  That has been applied across the EU to EU cohesion funds very successfully.  Will the Minister of State commit to that and ensure the regional assemblies are the vehicle through which this growth can occur?  That will be crucial over the next five years.</p></speech>

We engaged with them quite a lot in the development of Project 2040, the national development plan, and the national planning framework around that to guarantee that those regions have long-term plans.  I have said before in these Houses that if we are to permanently address an imbalance in regional development, it will not happen in one or two years.  It will happen with sustained investment over a 20 or 30-year period but we have to have plans to match that.  That is why, under Project 2040, they are 20-year plans with long-term commitments.  In the budget announced this week, there is a capital spend of more than &euro;10 million with a regional focus.  We are investing the capital to match the plans and ambitions.</p>  <p>  As a Department, we will work with all to maximise the drawdown from European co-funding initiatives.  There is money set aside in our budget plans for more investment in the regions in our baseline funding and in the recovery fund we can draw on next year, with an extra &euro;30 million available there for regional enterprises and supports.  We are committed to doing this and will work with anybody who wants to help in that mission with a positive agenda.  I agree with the Deputy that we should look forwards, not backwards.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500006#D01100"><p>I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this question and always having his finger on the pulse of where events might lead us.  Naturally, we are trying to manage the economy, job creation and sustainability around business and jobs through all levels of this plan.  The T&aacute;naiste has been very clear that it is about getting the balance right.  That is why, at this time, most of the country is operating under level 3.  We will be able to judge in the weeks ahead how that is impacting.</p>  <p>  My Government colleagues and I are focused on preventing any risk of long-term unemployment.  Together we are committed to leveraging the July stimulus and budget 2021 to get people back to work and keep them at work as long as possible and to give companies and businesses a chance to grow.  With many of the business supports announced in the budget this week, we are looking to growth.  It is not just about sustaining what we have, but building on that and making plans for the future as we try to make sure this is a jobs-led recovery over the next two years. </p>  <p>  As the House is aware, unemployment reached an all-time peak of 30.4% in May.  Ireland came through the initial shock with unparalleled levels of State intervention aimed at stabilising the economy and supporting business and incomes.  Taxpayers' money was used wisely to subvent and support the efforts to deal with Covid.  As of September 2020, more than &euro;24.5 billion has been made available in support measures, including the July stimulus package, which in total comes to nearly &euro;7 billion.  The total budget 2021 package of more than &euro;17.75 billion is unprecedented in size and scale in the history of the State, further demonstrating the Government's commitment to leading the country through the Covid crisis and preparing for Brexit.  The extension of the wage subsidy until well into 2021 marks a historic intervention by Government to protect employment and business affected by this pandemic and to keep people as close as possible to work.</p> <p>That is essential as we work through this, certainly when it comes to youth unemployment.  It ensures that the link between the employer and the employee is maintained and assists business to continue to trade in the spirit of reduced demand.  We are also promoting the take-up of available employment by allowing self-employed recipients of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, to take up intermittent or occasional work opportunities without losing their PUP entitlement.  That would apply to a taxi driver who can get some work but not enough to provide for his or her family.  We recognise that a blended approach will work in the months ahead.</p></speech>

Such people may find themselves having a very low payment or no payment at all.</p></speech>

It is important that, in providing supports through the Departments of Education and Skills, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and Business, Enterprise and Innovation, we ensure that nobody falls between the cracks.  The Deputy will have seen in the July stimulus plan that some of the conditions around access to those supports were relaxed so people could avail of supports much quicker to eliminate some of those gaps to which the Deputy referred.  In addition, the Minister with responsibility for further and higher education, research, innovation and science, Deputy Harris, will this week announce an extra 10,000 place on various courses, including skills conversion courses through Springboard and apprenticeships.  All the criteria to get onto those types of courses have been slightly tweaked and changed.</p>  <p>  It is important that our public sector system responds when Deputies bring forward clear examples of failures or gaps.  We must respond and address them quickly.  We have seen some reaction to that.  For example, the criteria for eligibility for the Christmas bonus this year have been changed to include people who have been receiving social welfare payments for four months, down from 15 months.  That recognises that we are in a changing environment.  The system can respond and it is important that we address issues when they are highlighted.  I would ask the Deputy to bring forward examples if he comes across them and the T&aacute;naiste, our colleagues and I will be happy to address them as well as we can.</p></speech>

The payment is for circumstances in which it is deemed necessary to support the family or individual in question, and I would ask if that might be borne in mind in these particular circumstances.</p></speech>

As a young fellow, I spent many days in the car with my father who was a community welfare officer back in the days when such officers could call to a house, get an understanding of what was happening and spend time with a family.  Over the years, the volume of activity increased in an effort to reach people with supports through social protection or essential needs payments and it has become harder to have a connection with families.  That is particularly true during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  I would stress and ask that the system respond.  The system did not respond in an important way to people who had emergency needs during the financial crisis of ten years ago.  The essential needs payment is one of the best ways to close that gap in the short term as someone works through the red tape and forms that are required.  I agree with the Deputy.  Our staff at the front line in Intreo and social welfare offices absolutely try to make those judgment calls.  Sometimes the system prevents those people from making the right call and we need to work with them on that.  The essential needs payment is ideal to cover the cracks in the short term while people address their issues.  We will work with the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

My Department and the enterprise agencies under my remit are doing everything possible to sustain businesses and get our people safely back to work in all parts of our country.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has been working closely with Roche ever since its decision to close the Clarecastle facility in 2015.  I recognise the interest that Deputies Cathal Crowe and Carey have taken in the site since then.  IDA Ireland continues to market the site actively to prospective investors through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas.</p>  <p>  Roche is now focusing on remediation and has commenced works to decommission the site.  The company has also developed digital content of its plans which can be shared with potential investors who may wish to take over the site.</p>  <p>  The Department and IDA Ireland will continue to work hard to drive new investment and job creation for County Clare and the broader mid-west.  There are 67 IDA client companies in County Clare employing more than 7,000 people with in excess of 220 net new jobs added by foreign direct investment, FDI, firms in 2019.</p>  <p>  More broadly, it is clear that FDI will have an important role to play in Clare, the mid-west and throughout Ireland as we seek to recover from the damage caused by Covid-19.  Balanced regional development is a priority for this Government and will be an objective in the IDA's new strategy which I look forward to launching in the coming months.</p></speech>

In 1994, it began trading as a part of the Roche group, but in 2015, having sustained debts and losses of approximately &euro;9 million per annum, it announced its closure.  It was a massive blow to Clare and represented an annual loss of &euro;20 million to the county's economy.  While there have been extensive efforts to find a new buyer, that has not happened and the plant is now being decommissioned at a cost of approximately &euro;4.5 million.</p>  <p>  One Clarecastle resident recently told me that Roche made Clarecastle.  Now, as an accelerated decommissioning of the plant gets under way, I ask the Government and other stakeholders to do everything possible to ensure that the next stages happen in as seamless a fashion as possible.</p></speech>

In November 2015, Roche Holding announced it would close the facility in Clarecastle, following a review of its worldwide manufacturing network for small molecules.  Since then, IDA Ireland has been actively promoting the site to existing clients and potential investors.  As the Deputy knows, the IDA engages regularly with key stakeholders on the ground across County Clare, including local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from its client base.  The July stimulus package, the mid-west regional enterprise plan and the IDA's new strategy will be major policy responses to drive further investment and job creation in County Clare and the mid-west.</p>  <p>  The decision to cease production in Clarecastle was a direct result of the underutilisation in Roche's worldwide manufacturing network for small molecules.  The Clarecastle site was incompatible with that reality as it focused on large-volume production.  It is a site that should be of interest to a new investor at some point.  I was not far away from it when I visited the county with Deputy Carey not long ago.  The Government is determined to find a new operator for the site and put it to good use again.</p></speech>

The repurposing of these facilities should be considered, even at this eleventh hour.  I urge the Minister to ensure that no stone is left unturned in his attempts to attract new industry and employment to Clarecastle.  There is an unprecedented global scramble to produce new pharmaceutical drugs.  I hope IDA Ireland will consider Clare and the mid-west an ideal location for new pharmaceutical industry, given its strong track record, skill set, air connectivity from Shannon Airport and motorway network.</p></speech>

I had the honour of being at Regeneron in Limerick with the Taoiseach only a few weeks ago.  A considerable investment is happening there with the creation of nearly 1,000 jobs.  I can see more investment like that happening in Limerick and Clare.</p>  <p>  Part of what was announced in the July stimulus package was a new state aid funding package for life science investments.  The state aid rules of the European Commission were relaxed in response to the Covid-19 crisis and that allows us to grant aid to companies that invest in Ireland and develop new plants for the production of medicines and medical devices.  We have a fund of tens of millions of euro available which we can use to grant aid to companies to do exactly what we would like them to do in Clarecastle.  We just need to find a company willing to do it.  We can then put the money on the table.</p></speech>

The closure date for receipt of applications has been extended to 31 October.  It is designed to contribute to the cost of reopening or keeping a business operational or reconnecting with employees and customers.  The grant could also be used to defray ongoing fixed costs during closure, such as, for example, utilities, insurance or refurbishment, or for measures to ensure employee and customer safety.  It is one of a package of financial and other supports available to businesses.  As of 9 October, the original restart grant had 45,000 applications with &euro;155 million approved.  The restart grant plus had just under 55,000 applicants with &euro;273 million approved.  </p>  <p>  The restart grant scheme for bed and breakfasts is being run through F&aacute;ilte Ireland in consultation with my Department and the Department of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  The grant allocation will assist bed and breakfast owners with the costs of reopening and operating their businesses.  Applications for bed and breakfasts under the National Quality Assurance Framework, NQAF, through direct approval by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, opened on 14 September and applications will close on 28 October.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will shortly announce details of the application process for bed and breakfasts which are not approved under the NQAF.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said it would announce details shortly, but that is short notice if the deadline date remains 28 October or the end of the month.  If there is a new tranche of bed and breakfasts included in the restart grant plus through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, is there merit in extending that deadline further for businesses that fit into that category?</p>  <p>  While we are on F&aacute;ilte Ireland, there are businesses which have tried to get the same clarification I am now trying to get and are having difficulty in getting through to F&aacute;ilte Ireland by phone or email to get clarity and communication.  I now make a plea for further resources for F&aacute;ilte Ireland so it can cope and deal with the communications that are being sought.</p></speech>

I know this is of significant interest to him, in particular given his constituency of Cork South-West which is, was and should again be a great tourism constituency with many hotels and bed and breakfasts which are now really struggling.</p>  <p>  The restart grant plus is funded through my Department, but we decided when it comes to bed and breakfasts the most sensible thing would be to administer the scheme through F&aacute;ilte Ireland, as that is the Government body that knows bed and breakfasts best.  The detailed administration falls to an agency that is not under my remit.  The reason we set up the grant was to put cash into the hands of the owners of bed and breakfasts so that they can survive to open another day next summer.  I would not have any difficulty in recommending to the Minister, Deputy Martin, that the deadline be extended for unregistered bed and breakfasts.  There is little point in advertising a grant and not giving people enough time to apply for it.</p></speech>

My last question concerns  CRSS.  I thank the Minister for naming it after me.  It is a great name for a scheme.  I welcome the scheme.  It will be fantastic.  It is one of a range of brilliant measures in the budget to support businesses.  I must commend the Minister and the rest of the Cabinet on that.</p>  <p>  I hope there was an error in a couple of printed press articles that stated that the turnover cap for businesses that apply for the scheme was &euro;2 million.  Given that the restart grant figure is &euro;25 million, I presume that was a printing error because it would not make sense for many businesses and would take a lot of businesses out of the scheme.  I would like clarity on that if possible.</p></speech>

I will have to double check the figure.  Quite a few details will need to be ironed out in respect of this particular scheme.  Some 98% of businesses in Ireland have a turnover of less than &euro;1 million.  This scheme is very much aimed at the SME sector.  As I understand it, it involves 10% of the first &euro;1 million and 5% of the second &euro;1 million up to a maximum grant of &euro;5,000 per week.  It applies to companies that have turnovers of &euro;4 million, &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million, but they can only claim for the first &euro;3 million.  I am almost sure of that, but I will double check the figures and confirm with the Deputy later.</p></speech>

My Department is committed to inclusion with equality of opportunity for all, regardless of disability, gender, civil or family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, race or membership of the Traveller community.</p>  <p>  In particular, my Department leads the Government&rsquo;s corporate social responsibility agenda and works with businesses through our national corporate social responsibility action plan.  This was developed through collaboration with major business stakeholders.  The plan seeks to, among other things, encourage business to develop strategies for the employment of people with disabilities. </p>  <p>  While responsibility for policy on disability inclusion lies with the new Department with responsibility for children, disability, equality and integration, this is an area of vital importance to the work of all Departments.  The new Department leads on two whole-of-government national strategies, the first being the national disability inclusion strategy and the second the comprehensive employment strategy for people with a disability.</p>  <p>  My Department is represented on the implementation groups for both of these strategies and has committed to a number of actions to promote the inclusion of people with a disability in the workforce.  For example, Enterprise Ireland is in the process of creating a strategy which will promote and support entrepreneurship and self-employment for people with a disability.  IDA Ireland is developing a pilot initiative in co-operation with other Government bodies and stakeholders aimed at enhancing the ability of job candidates with disabilities to avail of employment opportunities in foreign-owned companies based in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department has also established a disability consultative committee to provide a focus for disability inclusion in respect of our policy work, schemes and initiatives.  Members of the committee include nominated representatives of disability groups, along with Department officials and colleagues from our offices and agencies. </p>  <p>  Our Department has two access officers.  They are specially assigned staff members responsible for co-ordinating assistance and guidance for people with disabilities, helping them to access, to the widest possible extent, the full range of services that we provide, including how best to access our buildings as well as the range of publications in alternate formats that we have available.</p></speech>

He mentioned his Department's ongoing engagement with Enterprise Ireland and entrepreneurs who have disabilities and hope to set up businesses or who have an idea they can develop into a business and career for themselves.  What is the status of that in the Department?  What work has been done in the Department and Enterprise Ireland to bring forward a meaningful scheme?</p>  <p>  It is vitally important that in the process of bringing forward that scheme there is engagement, insofar as is humanly possible, from people who have experienced significant frustration in getting grant aid or people to listen to their ideas and encourage them.  In terms of developing a scheme, the Department should encourage entrepreneurs to reach out to people who have had engagement with the Department and Enterprise Ireland and find out where the stumbling blocks are.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland and the National Disability Authority, NDA, are currently creating a strategy that promotes and supports entrepreneurship and self-employment for people with a disability.  The steps being undertaken are the introduction of a broad-based programme offering basic information and training to a large audience of people with disabilities, the development of an awareness campaign which utilises success stories of self-employed and entrepreneurial models with a variety of disabilities and an assessment of the uptake of the programme.</p> <p>Certainly, if the Deputy has any particular suggestions, ideas or wisdom he would like to share with us, I will be happy to speak to him offline or connect him with the people in Enterprise Ireland who are working on this.</p></speech>

It is of great importance as we go forward to realise that there are various strategies within all Government Departments on inclusion.  This has to be developed to its full extent.  It is also very important that those who have been struggling to get beyond the red tape, for want of a better word, and those who are frustrated by the system are listened to and engaged with.  I will bring the details of all of the correspondence and discussions I have had with people to the table.  I would very much like to engage with the T&aacute;naiste on this issue and to bring forward, insofar as possible, a meaningful scheme that can fully engage people with disabilities who may have an idea that they want to develop into a career and something worthwhile that can benefit them and their communities.  I look forward to working with the T&aacute;naiste on that.</p></speech>

I will be happy to follow up on that.  My people will be in touch with his people.  The pandemic potentially creates an opportunity for people with disabilities, particularly those with a physical disability.  The fact that remote working and homeworking have now become normal creates new opportunities for people with disabilities to be involved in the workplace and to run businesses from home, or from accessible remote hubs, and we should seize that chance now.</p></speech>

The task force will draw up detailed plans to help SMEs to start up, scale up and access foreign markets.  This includes any potential improvements to the scope of firms covered by the existing enterprise agencies, and recommendations as to how these can be broadened.  It will also look at ways to make SMEs more productive and ready for the transition to a digital and green economy.</p>  <p>  We held the first meeting of the SME growth task force on 25 September.  I chaired the meeting, which was attended by the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Troy.   The task force is composed of over 20 entrepreneurs and business leaders, contributing expertise from a broad range of sectors.  It is served by four focused subgroups with the capacity and expertise to develop actions in thematic areas arising from the OECD's recommendations.  The subgroups are focused on entrepreneurship; productivity, digitalisation and competitiveness; internationalisation; and clustering and networks.  These are the areas in which we hope to develop policies and proposals.  The task force will develop an SME growth plan, which will be brought to Government for approval as part of the national economic plan in November.  A comprehensive OECD review, SME and Entrepreneurship Policy in Ireland, which was finalised in October 2019, provides a hugely informative, objective and deeply researched evidence base for this work.  The task force will continue its work over the coming weeks, and I look forward to its proposals.</p></speech>

I hope the blueprint will include transport for the SMEs and businesses that will require it.  The T&aacute;naiste will have seen yesterday that in preparation for Brexit, the UK Government has invested just under &euro;80 million in four European ferry companies to safeguard their trade in products being imported and exported post Brexit.  Particular mention was made of medical products and medicinal appliances.  All medicines may be in short supply due to our inability to prepare a daily direct ferry service.  I have heard from the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State on many occasions that our main task in respect of Brexit and Covid-19 is to prevent mass unemployment.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to set out what preparations are being made for an alternative to the UK land bridge.  Such an alternative should involve having a daily direct ferry service in place post Brexit.</p></speech>

This has come up in my various conversations with business groups.  Responsibility for transport and logistics falls to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  However, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is across this issue because it is essential for business and employment that we have supply chains.  The Department of Transport has advised me that we have a great amount of direct capacity in respect of ro-ro ferries from Ireland directly to France, Spain and even Portugal, as well as to the Netherlands and Belgium.  It has also informed us that there is approximately 40% unused capacity on those shipping lines which can be used as an alternative to the land bridge if there are significant delays in Kent.  This is something that we will have to keep under review in case we need to do more.</p></speech>

According to the IMDO figures, post Brexit we will need 15 services to replace the land bridge traffic.  Some 40% available capacity now does not add up to 15 services a week.  We need to go back.  This matter has been under review for a long time.  We have grown since the report was prepared in 2018.  I am very concerned that the dots are not being joined.  I appreciate the T&aacute;naiste's clarification that this is a matter for the Department of Transport, but his Department is responsible for trade and for business of imports and exports that safeguards jobs.  We definitely need to look at this and prepare, not post Brexit but now.</p></speech>

The figure of 40% capacity comes from a more up-to-date report the Department of Transport has done since then.  It is not our thinking that everyone will stop using the land bridge.  Some hauliers will divert from the British land bridge to direct services.  For others, it will still be quicker to go through the UK even if they are stuck there for a few hours.  That is the nature of the business, depending on where one is going in continental Europe.  That is a decision that will have to be made.  We are doing everything we can to work with authorities in continental Europe, such as the French, Belgian and Dutch ports, and with the British authorities to ensure any delays are minimised.</p></speech>

The Government allocated an extra &euro;4 million for the HSA in this week's budget, but that is a drop in the ocean in the context of what is needed, as we have seen over the course of the last year.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with this?  Given the current pandemic, and in light of what we have seen in meat plants, in particular, but also in other workplaces, does he agree that we need serious investment in workplace inspections?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500009#G01500"><p>I will deal with the issue in the question and bring a focus to the resources from the budget.  The HSA has a broad remit with responsibility for the enforcement of workplace health and safety legislation as well as chemicals safety, market surveillance of certain products and the national accreditation body.  It is vital to prioritise the safety and health of all workers in a way that promotes and facilitates business growth and sustainability, aids competitiveness and protects workers, which is the key part of the Deputy's question.  This is fundamental to a functioning economy and to reducing long-term costs to the State.</p>  <p>  The overall 2021 budget allocation includes an additional &euro;4 million for the HSA.  This will enable it to continue to assist businesses to comply with workplace health and safety obligations as well as dealing with the ongoing challenges of Covid-19.  It will assist businesses to plan for a changed regulatory landscape post Brexit especially in relation to chemical change, product safety, market surveillance and accreditation.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 created unprecedented difficulties for employers and employees across all sectors of the economy and brought public health risks and dangers into workplaces that most of us could never have envisaged.  The majority of employers and employees rose to the challenges and adapted to the new realities.  It is clear that these challenges will remain for some time to come.  The additional &euro;4 million will enable the HSA to set up an occupational health division.</p> <p>The establishment of this occupational health division will ensure that the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, is in a stronger position to meet the demands being placed on it to provide supports to businesses, employers and employees to equip them to deal with the occupational and public health issues arising in workplaces, not just as a result of COVID-19 but as a longer-term investment in the safety, health and well-being of our workforce.  It is accepted that much of the work in the months ahead will be around Covid and, as the lead agency, it is happy to lead in that and in co-ordinating other agencies also.</p> <p> My Department will continue to work closely with the Health and Safety Authority to ensure that it is adequately resourced to fulfil its demanding and important remit.  It is very committed to working across Departments to lead that charge.</p></speech>

There are roughly the same number of workplace inspectors as there are special advisers for the Government.  The HSA is the body tasked with inspecting workplaces.  It was the agency appointed in the pandemic to ensure that workers' lives and health were not being put at risk by penny-pinching bosses but all the indications are that the Government turned a blind eye to the meat factories and to workplaces generally.  That is reflected in the guidelines issued yesterday.  It is issuing a guideline in terms of households but it is not doing anything about workplaces, which is the main place the virus is spreading.  How many new HSA workplace inspectors will be hired?  Will there now be regular, unannounced inspections at the meat plants?  Will there be inspections at offices and other workplaces to ensure that companies that can have their workers working from home are allowing their workers to work from home instead of forcing them to come in?  What sanctions will there be for bosses who break the rules?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="11:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500010#H00300"><p>The HSA has an ongoing skills development programme.  Its inspectors are very highly skilled across a range of functions and it has invested in that ongoing programme and not just for this year.  The extra resources it is allocated builds on extra money, and extra places, that would have been allocated in terms of staff sanctioned during 2020.  It strengthens our team to be able to deal with issues like Covid-19 and Brexit, which is also a major part of the work.  It will be in a very strong position to do that and it is well supported by our Department.  As a Department, we are responsive to needs and we responded to the extra needs the authority had in 2020.  If the same needs arise down the line, we will be in a position to do that again.</p>  <p>  The authority does engage in inspections, many of which are unannounced, in the sectors the Deputy identified and many others.  In most cases, it is finding 92% compliance in workplaces, including in the meat sector.  The Deputy might not agree with that but those are the facts in terms of what they would assess.  It also engages with the sector.  The total number of inspections co-ordinated by the HSA, in conjunction with inspectors from other Departments, is close on 17,000 with regard to compliance with the protocol for this year.  That is a fair number.</p></speech>

That was demonstrated towards the start of last year when the virus was running rampant through meat factories with no inspections for well over a month, after which the point was flagged.  That should have been an extreme warning bell for the Government that there was a problem but we have allocated an extra &euro;4 million.  How many inspectors will that hire?  We know now that there are countless companies bending and breaking the rules.  They are forcing workers to come to work in unsafe conditions or in circumstances where the workers could be working from home.  For the vast majority of workplaces it is statistically the case that there has been and will be no inspections by the HSA.  If the Government is not willing to fund inspections itself, will it at least allow the trade union movement the right to carry out workplace inspections as exists in other countries?  Ultimately, it is only by having a strong and fighting trade union movement that we can ensure workers' rights are protected.</p></speech>

He might also recognise their judgment, their work and their reporting to us.  In most cases, they are coming across very high compliance rates with the Covid-19 protocol and other issues of their work also.  In most cases, 92% are in line with Covid-19 measures.  The Deputy might accept that that is the feedback we are getting from them and that includes quite good compliance in the meat sector also.  There is general information coming back from the highly-skilled staff, which the Deputy has recognised.  Much of the work the HSA does is not just in compliance checks.  It is working with industry across all the sectors, and certainly vulnerable sectors, to make sure that there is compliance and recognition of the culture of health and safety.  It is also driving clear guidelines around occupational health.  The authority will have a strengthened team as a result of the budget, and rightly so, but it works with other sectors and other Departments.  There is a high number of inspections and inspectors and any visit by any arm of the State, even when it comes to farm practices and so on, is an opportunity to reinforce the message around health and safety in general, occupational health but, importantly in these times, Covid-19.</p></speech>

It will be a payment to help cover their fixed costs when they are closed.  It is largely focused at small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and the amount one can claim is based on one's turnover in 2019.

The Minister might also explain to me the position regarding a restart grant and a restart grant plus.  My understanding was that one could get both of those grants.  However, without warning, the restart grant stopped three weeks before the originally announced date.  Is any consideration being given to making the restart grant available to those who would have been eligible if they had applied within that three-week period, which ended suddenly?  As I said, some people got two grants while others only got one.</p></speech>

There was the original restart grant, which was set up by the previous Government, and then the restart grant plus, which was set up by the new Government as part of the July stimulus.  The terms and conditions were different but some businesses were eligible to get both the restart grant and the restart grant plus.  There is a small but substantial enough cohort of businesses that did not apply in time for the first restart grant but did get the restart grant plus.  What we are asking them to do is put in an appeal to their local authorities and we will pay it.  It varies from local authority to local authority.  The original deadline for the restart grant was to be 31 August and when the restart grant plus came in and superseded it, there was a group of companies that did not apply in time for the restart grant but had they applied earlier they would have been entitled to it.  We want to give them the grant and we have the money to do that.  They should appeal to their local authority.  If the local authority refuses the appeal the Deputy should let me know because the intention was that they should get both grants if they were eligible for both.</p></speech>

I suspect that if the Department had persisted in playing this jiggery-pokery of pulling it back without notice three weeks before the originally announced date the Ombudsman would have ruled in favour of those who could have applied by the date set by the Department that was changed suddenly, but I welcome the Minister saving everybody the bother of going round the mountain to vindicate their rights.</p> <p>It is only sensible at this time.</p> <p> Disruptive technology companies are finding it difficult to get money in the markets now because private equity funds are very wary of investing.  Is there any thought being given to allowing Enterprise Ireland to release some funds to the disruptive technology companies for which funding has been approved so they can get on with their business and, when things settle down, get the private equity to meet the requirements of Enterprise Ireland?</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland is working on a solution that will help to provide loans to those companies given what is happening in the markets.  I will send the Deputy more detail in writing.  We are aware of the issue, and Enterprise Ireland is working on a solution to it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy, whose ministerial experience is showing, is quite right that I have no interest whatsoever in having a maladministration finding made against us by the Ombudsman.

I raised this matter at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight but obviously circumstances have changed.  Provisions have been made to support businesses, particularly in the three counties forced to lock down.  There are serious issues arising regarding retail footfall in Dublin city.  In the Convention Centre, I gave the example of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was next door.  It used to have 1,500 desks but only 100 are now in operation.  The guidance is now to work from home where possible.  That is the context of the question.</p></reply>

I appreciate that the context has changed but it will change again.  One of the features of the pandemic we might not have anticipated months ago is the enormous impact it is having on our city centres and some town centres.  The suburbs of Dublin are quite busy but footfall in the city centre is really low.  Businesses with a high-cost model, often involving the payment of high rents, covered their costs through high turnover but they no longer have a high turnover and are really struggling.  Calling into sandwich shops and small businesses around the city centre, I am really struck by how much their turnover is down.  It is down phenomenally and I am very worried about it.  Addressing this involves providing the assistance we are giving the businesses through the various packages with which the Deputies will be familiar.  We will need to have a workable plan for our city centres to get people back to offices in a safe and blended way when we can, to reclaim the streets for a bit more outdoor dining, to have some more space for people to sit outside businesses, and to facilitate cyclists and pedestrians.  The various city councils are wise to this and are working on it.</p></speech>

I acknowledge he is aware of the issue and I welcome his response.  He will be aware that, at the start of the pandemic, remote working was embraced as a new, ground-breaking concept that would change the world.  It is now recognised that employees probably need a blend of remote working and participation in the workplace.  Is there work ongoing in this regard?  Are there any studies or research on how we could safely blend the two approaches?  It is good for people's mental health to socialise and physically meet their colleagues.</p>  <p>  I warmly welcome what the Minister is saying about the city.  I generally come into the city every Sunday.  It is good, a long ramble.  Businesses will provide outdoor opportunities when they are encouraged to do so.  We must be fair to the city council in this regard.  It is a lot safer to dine or have a cup of coffee outdoors.  We could do more in this regard in the cities, including on the side streets.</p>  <p>  Remote working has had an impact on the newsagents, coffee shops and sandwich bars.  We welcomed remote working with open arms at the start.  Will the Minister give the House some idea as to what is going on in the background in regard to remote working in the medium term?</p></speech>

Roughly speaking, approximately 10% to 15% are dying to get back to the office full time.  About 10% to 15% want to work from home permanently.  There is a large majority in the middle, amounting to about 70%, who would like blended working.  I believe that is going to be the future.  It involves people going to headquarters for necessary meetings or training one or two days per week and working from home or a remote hub on the other days.  We need to facilitate that, including through the national broadband plan, investing in remote hubs in rural towns and villages, in particular, and a new legal framework.  We have engaged in public consultation on this.  I have not fully made up my mind on it yet but a framework is probably required on a right to request remote working or home working and a right to switch off so we do not end up at work always when we are at home.  It feels a bit like that already in our line of work but that is not the way it should be.  It is also a matter of ensuring how people can have some of their home and remote working costs covered.  This was partly covered in the budget in that people working from home can defray any vouched expenses, including the cost of broadband.</p></speech>

I am aware of the great lengths people have gone to in recent weeks since the additional restrictions were imposed on those counties.  People have made sacrifices to protect themselves, their families and the wider community.  There is no doubt it has been difficult for people but I believe we can get through this together.  In Donegal, we have seen that the numbers will start to reduce over the coming days.  This provides us with a wee glimmer of hope but it is far too early to suggest this is in any way a trend.  What we all need to do now is dig deeper, work together, follow the public health advice and get the better of this virus.</p>  <p>  I am aware the restrictions imposed on households will cause alarm for many people.  We need to remind people that there are exemptions on compassionate grounds.</p><p><i>12 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>While it is clear that we do not want anybody breaching these restrictions, common sense must prevail.  I am mindful that there are people across the State, young and old alike, who feel isolated and alone, who are very vulnerable, and they should not suffer that.  No one should be left isolated or cut-off from his or her communities.  This needs to be clear.  Further guidance on the compassionate grounds would be welcome.  Caithfidh an Rialtas cinnti&uacute; go dtabharfar taca&iacute;ocht do na daoine sin.  </p> <p> The impact on incomes for workers and families also needs to be considered as level 4 restrictions are severe.  Ten days ago, the Minister for Finance said that the impact of these restrictions would result in hundreds of thousands of job losses.  That is, unfortunately, the reality.  The public health restrictions create huge difficulties for our people.  We can get through this, but only if the support is in place to help people through it.  On 17 September, the Government cut the pandemic unemployment payment, removing vital income support at a time when it was most needed.  On Tuesday, the Government confirmed its commitment to make these cuts permanent, to reduce income support at a time of heightened restrictions and of income loss.  That was a mistake.  Thousands of workers in the three counties that have entered level 4 restrictions will lose their jobs this week.  They will fall back on income supports that have been cut, but they still have to pay rent and to pay mortgages to the banks.  They still have to cover the cost of childcare and to put bread on the table for their families.  For them, this is a time of worry, stress and anxiety and they need support.</p> <p> While we hope this does not come to pass, there is a possibility that other counties may enter level 4 restrictions in the time ahead with further job losses inevitable as a result.  Sinn F&eacute;in warned last month that cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment were premature and short-sighted.  Last night's announcement by Government is proof of that.  We know that the average person in receipt of the upper limit of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, of &euro;300 per week had a pre-Covid income of well above &euro;500 per week.  Level 4 restrictions will result in significant income loss.  Government is determined to cut the PUP by another &euro;50 at the end of January and again by &euro;50 at the beginning of April.</p> <p> The T&aacute;naiste will know that the virus has not gone away and that it will, unfortunately, remain with us for a while.  It will be with us at the end of January and in April.  For as long as that is the case the threat to job losses remains.  It is crucial that workers and families have certainty that their incomes will not fall off a cliff and that they will be supported.  I am calling on the Government to change direction.  I am asking that it put in place an adequate income support for those people who will lose their job and those who have lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic, not least in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  I am asking the Government to reverse the cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment and to bring the top level back to &euro;350.</p></speech>

People living in any other county should not get the wrong impression.  When people hear that three of the Border counties have been moved to level 4 they may get the wrong impression that this is a problem up North or a problem along the Border.  It is not.  People in any part of Ireland should not take any comfort from the fact that the rules are stricter in these three counties.  The virus is circulating in the community in every county in Ireland and we need to understand that that is the case and make sure that we comply with public health advice and change our behaviours.  In all 32 counties, we need to embrace the public health advice.  Whether we are at level 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 26 if people are not doing what they need to do it is not going to work.  We know what we need to do.  People need to keep apart, wash their hands regularly, cough and sneeze into their elbows or a tissue and, if they feel unwell, they need to stay at home, stay away from other people, including other people in their own household, contact their GP seeking a test and, if told to restrict their movements or to self-isolate, they should do exactly that.  It is those behaviours that will get this virus under control because that is what got the virus under control in the spring when we all worked together as a nation to do so.</p>  <p>  In terms of the financial assistance that is being provided to businesses and to individuals in the three counties, the Covid restriction subsidy scheme, CRSS, will kick-in next week.  This will provide a weekly payment for any business that is closed as a result of Government regulations.  We have instructed that the three counties be prioritised in terms of the applications that are made.  Also companies will qualify for the employment wage subsidy scheme.  It applies to any company that has seen its turnover fall by more than 30%.  By virtue of these restrictions, more companies will qualify for that scheme in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan than would have otherwise and commercial rates have been waived across Ireland for the remainder of the year.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the pandemic unemployment payment, it is now based on a person's income prior to losing his or her job.  People who previously earned less than &euro;200 per week will have full income replacement in that they will receive &euro;203 per week.  Those who earned between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per week will receive &euro;250 per week, which, for many, is full income replacement and for others up to 86% and those who earned more than &euro;300 per week will receive &euro;300 per week.  I acknowledge that there are people who were full-time workers and earning more than &euro;300 per week who will see a significant reduction in their income but it is a scheme that has to be affordable and one that compares very favourably, I am sure Deputy Doherty will acknowledge, with the schemes that exist in the UK and in Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  In terms of any further reductions that may occur in January, that is a matter that will be kept under review by Government.  We have set aside contingency funds in the budget announced this week to allow us to extend that January deadline if we are still in the teeth of the pandemic.  The flexibility to extend that deadline is available to us and we will give that consideration.</p></speech>

There is also a role for the State here in terms of the restrictions that have been introduced.  When Donegal was moved to level 3, there was a surge there in claims for the pandemic unemployment payment.  The number of claimants in that county increased by one third.  Level 4 restrictions will result in other people losing their jobs, not only in Donegal but in Cavan and Monaghan.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, this virus is not unique to those counties and others may follow the course of action taken in those three counties.  The average wage for people who are now availing of the pandemic unemployment payment at a rate of &euro;300 per week was &euro;560 per week.  The Government has cut that support.  At a time when restrictions that are being introduced by Government are resulting in people losing their jobs there is a responsibility on Government to support that income.  I accept it cannot support all of it but &euro;350 per week was the appropriate amount in April, May and June and it is the appropriate amount now.  People are facing into winter and Christmas and they do not know how they will get by because the Government has cut their payments by &euro;50, it being a significant amount for many of those who have to, as I said, pay bills, mortgage or rent and put food on the table.  I am asking the Government to do the right thing.  Given the increased level of restrictions Government needs to reverse the cut to the pandemic unemployment payment and to return the top rate to &euro;350 per week.</p></speech>

Obviously, we have learned since then that this pandemic is going to be with us for much longer than we thought.  To make sure that we could extend it well into next year, if we have to, we had to link it to wages.  That was done so that we could continue to support people's incomes.  These are the types of choices Governments must make and they are not easy choices at times.  When I hear the Deputy speak I often feel he speaks as though his party has no experience of government on this island.  There is a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister for Finance North of the Border in the Six Counties, as the Deputy describes it.  There is also a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister with responsibility for welfare.  It is a devolved matter.  The income support being provided to people north of the Border is about &pound;100 sterling per week under universal credit, which is much less than it is here.  Part-time workers, rather than getting full income replacement, get only two thirds of their income.  I appreciate Sinn F&eacute;in does not control the chequebook, but it has autonomy and it could take money from other areas and put it into an increase in the universal credit.</p> <p>However, taking everything into account and operating in the limitations that exist, Sinn F&eacute;in decided not to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500013#L00200"><p>Five months ago, I stood in the House and asked the Minister at the time for a roadmap on testing.  My understanding was that in June, as we began to open up the country, the system of testing, tracing and isolating would begin in earnest and every person who needed to be tested for Covid-19 would be tested.  I understood that was how Government was going to contain the virus while being able to keep the country open.</p>  <p>  To me, test, trace and isolate means that positive test cases would and should be isolated.  Then, their contacts would be traced immediately, tested and isolated and so on.  Where that system is operated effectively, we can contain the virus.  We test, trace and isolate.  Yet, the information I have today is that in three and a half months the Government system has failed miserably.  The virus has spiralled out of control.  If we are to be truthful about the real reason it has spiralled out of control, it is that the Government failed to put a system in place to do contact tracing when the numbers were low.  When we had cases of 70 and 80 per day, there was no effective contact tracing.  As a result, we have seen the numbers spiral to multiples of that in every county.  It has spiralled out of control.  That is why we have a resurgence.  It is a total systems failure in contact tracing.</p>  <p>  The Government's inability to put in place the most basic elementary and logistical solution in contact tracing is the real reason that we are moving to level 4.  Maybe not as many people would need the pandemic unemployment payment if we had an effective contact tracing system in place.  Why has the Government system failed us with regard to contact tracing?</p></speech>

I can even understand, on occasion, the desire to seek to wish to blame someone for the fact that we are now experiencing a second wave of the virus.  However, I do not believe the argument Deputy Murphy is making - that it is down to failures in testing and tracing - really stacks up.  Let us consider Denmark, for example, a country that is doing three times as much testing as us.  Guess what Denmark is experiencing?  A second wave with a similar incidence of the virus to what we have.  Let us take, for example, somewhere like Germany, which handled the first wave really well.  Germany was extraordinarily impressive in terms of its ability to test, trace and isolate people.  It has just recorded a record number of cases, the highest ever.  The number is higher than even during the first wave.  This is something that is happening all across Europe.  All across Europe we are experiencing a second wave and pretty much every country in Europe is now recording record case numbers despite the best efforts of their Governments, populations and health authorities.</p>  <p>  We should avoid the temptation to make it so simplistic that if only X, Y or Z had been done by someone else it would all have been grand, because that is not really what the facts tell us.  I will explain why I believe that is not the case.</p>  <p>  I want to pay tribute in particular to all the people who are involved in testing and tracing across Ireland currently.  We talk a good deal about our hospitals being overwhelmed.  Thankfully, so far, they are not.  We have approximately 30 people in intensive care units and we have capacity for 350 beds.  We have approximately 200 patients out of 11,000 beds.  However, the people who are really overwhelmed at the moment are the wonderful people working in our laboratories who are processing 15,000 tests per day, the medical scientists, the wonderful public health doctors and contact tracers who are now trying to contact trace the contacts of 1,000 people nearly every day.  That is really tough on them.  The best thing we can do for them is to follow the public health advice.  If we are going to have several hundred or 1,000 positives per day, and each of those has six or seven contacts, then that is 7,000 people per day who have to be contact traced.  We would need an army of people, probably an army bigger than our Army, to trace that many people every day.  The best thing we can do to help our laboratories, doctors, contact tracers, medical scientists and all the people who are helping to keep this virus at bay is to follow the public health advice to reduce our contacts.  We should reduce them to the minimum possible while still living a realistic and possible life.  That is how we can help them.</p></speech>

I am not blaming anyone.  I am pointing out an ineffective system of contact tracing.  I am inundated with calls locally.  I will give one serious call as an example.  It is the most harrowing one I have heard to date.  It is about a young man, a GAA player, who tested positive but had not actually been contact traced for six days.  His girlfriend, with whom he lives, works in a nursing home.  That nursing home is now infected.  It took six days to contact trace someone who had played GAA and did all the right things.  He simply played GAA and became infected.  Unfortunately, six days later his girlfriend had not been contact traced to him and she had been working in the nursing home.  There is no point in testing.  We have 100,000 per week being tested.  The T&aacute;naiste says 1,000 per days are being contacted.  We had 60 cases in Wexford on Tuesday.  We would need at least 310 people contact traced immediately.  If we need 310 people traced in Wexford and the T&aacute;naiste says there is only 1,000 per day, that means the system is inefficient and totally ineffective.  That is why we are at level 4 and, most likely, going to level 5.  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste to put an effective contact tracing system in place to go with the testing.</p></speech>

We are now six or seven months into this pandemic.  If a GAA player or a player of anything or anyone tests positive for this virus, the close contacts of that person must restrict their movements.  People should not wait to be called or contact traced.  They do not have to wait to be tested.  I had to do it myself.</p></speech>

A primary medical certificate allows a person with a disability to claim back VAT on a vehicle.  It also allows for tax relief on the purchase and adoption of vehicles.  For the past four years, the Minister for Finance has been embroiled in controversy over the criteria for this scheme.  A case was challenged and went to the Supreme Court, and the Minister lost the case.  Was this case warranted?  How much did this court case cost?  How many adults and children with disabilities could have been helped by the cost of this case?  How can a person with a disability travel to a medical appointment, school, college or travel for their daily needs without this scheme being put in place?  All five supreme judges ruled in favour against the Minister and the driver disability board on 18 June 2020.  Yet, the Minister put nothing in place to substitute for the collapse of the scheme.</p>  <p>  Why are disabled persons still getting replies and being put on a so-called list when the scheme does not even exist?  I rang around the HSE and was told there were numbers in Limerick and Clare.  Waterford had 54 and Kilkenny had 22.  I was informed that in my neighbouring county of Tipperary assessments were being done virtually and Tipperary only has four.  The authorities in other counties throughout the country are saying it is all being delayed over Covid-19 and that people cannot be assessed.</p> <p>In Tipperary, however, they are doing it virtually and their list is down to four people.  Is there a scheme or not?</p></speech>

I am afraid I am at a disadvantage in that I did not know this topic was going to be raised and I do not have a note on it.  I am aware, however, that there are implications from that court case.  The Minister for Finance is across that issue and is working on a solution, if it is possible to come up with one, which I am sure it will be.</p>  <p>  On assessments, my strong view is that if an assessment can be carried out virtually it should be done virtually and if it is being done in some counties I do not see why it should not be done in all counties.  There may be occasions where a physical examination or an inspection of a home needs to be done but where these assessments can be done virtually, that should be done.</p></speech>

That letter was sent by the Minister.  I also have copies of letters, dated 9 October, stating that a person with a disability was on the list.  On 6 October the Minister told the community care centre to stop the assessments and on 9 October someone was being put on the list.  Is this list for a scheme that does not exist?  Where is the joined-up thinking?  In addition, separate from the people who are on the phantom list, I have 170 people who are appealing the judgments.  The Minister said this was to be stopped on 6 October and on 9 October someone was told he or she was on the list.</p></speech>

He stayed in University Hospital Limerick and was accommodated on a trolley in the corridor.  After he passed away, his family were charged &euro;813 per night.  I raised this matter with the Minister for Health, who referred it to the hospital.  The hospital replied to say the inpatient and day case charges are applied based on section 55 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  I looked at that Act and it defines charges in respect of single occupancy rooms, multiple occupancy rooms and where overnight accommodation was not provided.  A corridor is not a room.  I am sure that in his previous time as Taoiseach and in various ministries, the T&aacute;naiste has necessarily had to travel for work and rooms have been booked for him.  I doubt if he was ever offered a corridor to sleep in and if he was, I doubt his officials paid for a room.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm to this House that a corridor is not a room?</p>  <p>  Today is pregnancy and infant loss remembrance day and I refer to the restrictions in place at our maternity hospitals.  Women attending for ultrasounds and antenatal visits cannot attend accompanied by partners.  For anybody to first see the heartbeat of one's child is a profound and moving moment and one which should be made available to them.  I can only imagine what it must be like to be told there is no heartbeat, and to have to go through that alone is inhumane.  I accept this is a time of a pandemic and that restrictions are necessary.  Equally, humanity has to prevail.  Likewise, with regard to visits during birth and, in particular, after the birth of a baby, there is no uniformity of approach across the State.  University Maternity Hospital Limerick does not allow visits and I know the National Maternity Hospital just across Merrion Square is in a position to allow visits.  I ask that some guidance be provided and a uniformity of approach be adopted across the State in that regard.</p></speech>

Patients opting to be treated privately in a public hospital have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital for the services each provides.  The fee is not just for the bed, therefore, it is for the service of the consultant and for other services provided by the hospital.  Under section 55 of the Health Act 1970, the HSE is required to levy statutory private inpatient charges on all patients opting to receive private inpatient services.  The statutory hospital charges that apply for such an episode of care depend on the category of hospital, the duration of stay and whether the accommodation provided was in a single or multiple occupancy room.</p>  <p>  The core purpose of the public hospital system is to provide services to public patients.  Nonetheless, historically and currently, a proportion of activity in public hospitals involves the provision of care to private patients and income generated in this way is a key component of funding the public hospital system.  It is Government policy that users of private services in public hospitals should pay towards the cost of providing those services.  The charges applied in respect of private care in a public hospital relate to costs which include those associated with non-consultant hospital doctors; nursing staff; medicines; blood, medical and surgical supplies; radiology; diagnostics; operating theatres; laboratories; administration; and support staff.</p>  <p>  On visiting maternity hospitals, I know this is an issue that has been spoken about a lot in recent weeks and an issue that is causing a lot of concern and worry for expectant mums and, in particular, dads who want to be able to be there for those important appointments and crucial scans.  It is a difficult situation but we need to bear in mind that so far at least, no pregnant woman has died of Covid-19 in Ireland and we want to keep it that way.  Most women who are pregnant are in good health but sometimes there can be women in a hospital or on a ward who have a complicated high risk pregnancy with underlying medical conditions.  We need to be honest and be wise to the fact that the more people who come into the hospital, whether it is partners or visitors, the higher the risk that Covid-19 could be introduced to the hospital.  Therefore, there would be the risk that somebody who has a high risk pregnancy could get Covid-19, which could possibly result in the loss of the life of both the mother and the child.  That is the risk that has to be assessed by the clinical directors and masters of the maternity hospitals and we need to respect their decisions when it comes to visiting.  I understand what the Deputy is saying and as much as is possible, we should allow partners to attend, particularly at anomaly scans and so on.  That should be done but we have to put our trust in the masters and clinical directors of those hospitals to make the right decision, based on the situation in their hospitals.</p></speech>

It is that simple.</p>  <p>  I want to move on to one other associated area, namely, the latest restrictions which have been announced for not visiting other homes or houses.  I have no doubt the majority or a large number of people will adhere to those restrictions.  However, others will not.  Before this is put on a legislative footing, I ask and urge the Government to look at the potential for unintended consequence.  This has the capability to seriously damage contact tracing because people will simply not give the names of the people with whom they have been in contact.  That is a big problem in Britain, which has put everything on a legislative footing with penal provisions and if this provision is also put on a legislative footing, we risk damaging the ability to contact trace, which is the key weapon the State has at its disposal.</p></speech>

Perhaps the solution for the HSE would be not to charge for the night if the person is in hospital for, let us say, four or five days.  That is the average length of stay in hospital.  Perhaps it would be sensible for the HSE not to charge for the first night if the patient ends up spending that night on a trolley or sitting on a chair, but that is a decision for the HSE to make.  On the positive side, while there are still patients on trolleys every day, a very large number are on trolleys because they are in isolation rooms, so they are on trolleys for clinical reasons rather than reasons of overcrowding.  It is positive to see that the level of overcrowding in our hospitals is at its lowest in many years, if not since records began.</p></speech>

Today we bid farewell to our Captain of the Guard, John Flaherty, who is attending his last sitting of the House before he retires later this month.  John joined the Defence Forces as a cadet in the 51st cadet class on 28 October 1974 and is retiring after 46 years of distinguished public service.  He was commissioned in December 1975 and posted to the fourth field supply and transport company in Mullingar.  He also served on the Border with the 28th infantry battalion.  He served overseas with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the Irish infantry battalion.  UNIFIL, as we know, and all the personnel who had served with it were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.  John also served as a military observer with the UN in Kuwait and Iraq.  On returning home he served as assistant aide-de-camp to Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, Paddy Hillery.  He then joined the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service as Captain of the Guard on 11 November 2002.  During his time as Captain of the Guard he has seen the election of five taoisigh.  He has welcomed esteemed visitors to the Houses of the Oireachtas such as the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the President of Germany, Joachim Gauck.  He also played a central role in the success of our most recent centenary events, V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 and D&aacute;il 100.  I think we can all agree that he was always on hand to advise and support Members of the Houses and staff and to keep a close eye to ensure that decorum throughout the corridors of Leinster House always prevailed.  His military bearing and his calm presence led to a real sense of security in Leinster House.  On behalf of all of us here and the Members who cannot be here today, I wish John all the very best in this new and what I am sure will be an exciting chapter of his life with his beloved wife, Mary, his daughters, Ciara and Laoise, and his son, Patrick.  Could we give him a round of applause?</p></speech>

KPMG broke that undertaking in the middle of the night in the Henry Street store.  Mandate has responded to KPMG and is seeking that it will proactively re-engage.  The workers in Debenhams have been given tea and sympathy and pats on the back.  We all agree they have been treated disgracefully, but they are six months out, and now we find that KPMG has gone into the stores and broken an undertaking it gave to the workers.  Will the T&aacute;naiste join me in condemning the actions of KPMG?  Will he pick up the phone to the trade union, the workers and KPMG and convene a meeting?  That is what is needed at this stage.  This will not be resolved until such stage as the parties meet, but there were developments overnight that require the T&aacute;naiste's urgent attention.</p></speech>

It is vital now that the T&aacute;naiste steps in to convene a meeting with KPMG and the workers and their unions to resolve this matter.  It has been going on for six months.  We need the Government to step in now because my worry is that this could escalate next week.  We need it resolved now.</p></speech>

The Government has said it has sympathy for the workers.  I remind the T&aacute;naiste that the Taoiseach said he did not believe there should be strike-breaking in respect of Debenhams.  The T&aacute;naiste should therefore condemn what KPMG has done.  He should call on anybody who has any respect for these workers not to cross the picket line and not to put them in the position of facing possible jailing.  He should immediately convene a meeting with the shop stewards and other union representatives and KPMG, chaired by the Government, in order to prevent these workers from ending up in jail.</p></speech>

The Government should stand up.  I have asked it before, and I am asking it again, to stand up and protect the workers.  They are not looking for a massive payout; they are just looking for what they are entitled to.  KPMG is disgracing the Government.  Our Government must stand up and send a clear message to KPMG.  Our workers - the ones we are here to protect and the ones who have paid taxes for years in this country - are now turning to our Government to stand up for them.  Many people in this House are standing up for them.  Why can our Government not do so?</p></speech>

It has been great to have him looking after us and watching out for us ever since I have been a Teachta D&aacute;la.  We wish him and his family the very best in his retirement and thank him so much.</p>  <p>  The Debenhams issue is a matter before the courts.  Of course I would condemn any breach of any court order or written assurance.  I have not seen such a written assurance - I have to add that caveat - but if one has been broken, any right-thinking person would condemn the breach of a court order or a written assurance offered in good faith.  There is regular engagement with the unions, with Mandate, as recently as Monday, I think.  Ministers have met the union, and I have been in direct contact with Debenhams UK, which, as the House will be aware, was the parent company but which has largely walked away at this stage.  As for any engagement between the Government and KPMG, it should be borne in mind that this is a liquidation process, a court-sponsored process, and there are limitations to the extent to which the Government can intervene in a court process.</p></speech>

I hope there will be a day when I will meet him once more at the Kilmacud sevens, when Portroe wins it once more.</p><p>I wish to raise the issue of rapid testing.</p> <p>I raised the issue of masks versus visors before and, in fairness, the Taoiseach last night outlined how there is now going to be a communication strategy as to why visors are, effectively, a waste of time compared face masks.</p> <p> What is the Government's strategy as regards rapid testing?  I hold in my hand a rapid test I have taken.  It took ten minutes.  These are cheap, by all accounts, costing approximately &euro;5.  Why has it taken so long for the expert advisory group to sign off on these?  They are not a panacea but they are part of a mix as regards population testing to help organisations and to help with travel.  They can form a process by which people can have a passport for a number of days or weeks.  What is holding it up?  The Taoiseach told us during the week that a massive document was done.  Where is the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC?  Where is HIQA?  Where is the advisory group chaired by Dr. Cillian De Gascun?  Why is it taking so long unlike every other country?</p></speech>

There are certain circumstances when people genuinely cannot wear a face mask or face covering.  They are few, however, and in all other instances we advise people to use a face mask and not a visor which is not particularly effective.</p></speech>

There are particular exception and circumstances.</p>  <p>  With regard to rapid testing, I share the Deputy Kelly's view.  Rapid testing, antigen testing, has a role to play in getting on top of this virus.  Unlike polymerase chain reaction, PCR, which costs nearly &euro;150 to &euro;200 per go, rapid testing is approximately &euro;5 to &euro;10 and one gets a result quickly.  It could be helpful in screening visitors to nursing homes, people in hospitals, hospital staff, and potentially, for travel.  The Deputy and I probably see the potential for and agree on this and know other countries are using this, including countries such as Germany, for example, that are good at managing the pandemic.</p>  <p>  As things stand, HIQA has done a health technology assessment on this.  I have not had sight of it yet.  I understand NPHET and the advisory committee are giving it consideration and have yet to come a decision as to whether they believe antigen testing has a role to play in Ireland.  I will, however, encourage them to make that decision as quickly as possible.  Decisions were made slowly on face coverings.  They should not be made slowly on this.</p></speech>

I am aware, however, that many parents were disappointed that it will only apply from April.  As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, parents with children under the age of one are finding it particularly difficult to find childcare and there are many constraints on them at the moment.  Will the Government consider applying that benefit from January rather than waiting until April?</p></speech>

There are administrative issues every time one changes a social welfare scheme such as this.  However, the sooner it can be introduced, the better.  I hear what the Deputy is saying in that regard.  I will speak to the Minister about it and see if that is possible.  There may be good reasons, other than money, that it cannot be done before that.  Obviously, we need legislation.

Imagine the optics of this for the hundreds and thousands of victims and their families that legislation is to be amended by Members of this House before 2 o'clock tomorrow when it has not even passed through the Seanad.  This is utterly disrespectful to the Senators.  The T&aacute;naiste ticked me off some time ago about disrespecting Senators.  He is disrespecting the Seanad and, indeed, this House by pushing through this legislation in a hurried manner.  More important, however, it shows utter disrespect to the victims and their families.  Whatever the rights and wrongs about way the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs wants to archive these files, we have not been given the time to look at it, talk about it and amend it properly.  He is breaking all the rules of the Houses by rushing it through.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste please ensure that a minimum level of proper legislative scrutiny is given to this?  I do not mean pre-legislative scrutiny but enough time for us to be able to amend it having been amended by the Senators.  It is, to say the least, unseemly to the victims and their families and the T&aacute;naiste, like all of us, has been inundated with emails.  Imagine the panic and the disrespect they feel.

We welcome the publication of the report of the mother and baby homes commission.  I have spoken to many of the survivors and their families who are hurt that there is a risk their records will be locked away for 30 years.  The survivors of these homes deserve to know the full truth of what went on and deserve to have an input on how their records are dealt with.</p>  <p>  Members may remember last year dealing with the contentious Retention of Records Bill regarding the Ryan commission records.  The Oireachtas education committee recommended that survivors who engaged and submitted their testimonies should have access to their own records.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to listen to the thousands of survivors and their families who have contacted us over the past few days.  Do not add further insult to what they have suffered by locking away their records for another 30 years.  Change the legislation.  Help those who are hurt, such as those who were in Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea in my country of Tipperary and in other homes throughout the country who suffered horribly.

Preparations largely led by my Department are being made to prepare businesses for the changes that will take place no matter what on 1 January when the UK leaves the Single Market and the customs union.  I wrote to every business - all one quarter of a million of them - personally last week setting out exactly what they need to do to prepare for the changes and how they can get advice and financial support from Government to do so.</p>  <p>  No preparations are being made for a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland because there will not be one.  No preparations are being made in that regard.

I wish him a happy and successful retirement.</p>  <p>  I have a constituent who, like many others, took his driving test last January and unfortunately failed it.  He was due to retake it in February but could not due to the pandemic.  Now he cannot get a test and many other people cannot get licences.  His father has to drive him to Waterford every day for college and now they are being stopped at checkpoints.  His father has gone back to work now as he is a m&uacute;inteoir scoile.  There are many elderly people and ordinary people who are driving but their licences cannot be renewed now.  There was a chance given in March for people to get a waiver until the end of August but that has ended.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ask the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, to extend the timeframe again for people because of the huge backlog?  I am not blaming the people in the National Driver Licence Service.  I also ask the T&aacute;naiste if he will ask the Minister for Transport to look at giving young drivers who have done the required number of lessons and can get a sign-off from their instructor a chance to drive unaccompanied in this time of serious pandemic when there are not supposed to be two or more people in a car.  It is a very serious situation for people who cannot go to college or to work.  They are advised not to take public transport but there are many others as well who cannot get the licence for work or have grandchildren to take to school.

There was also an announcement that it will be extended to those on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and those on jobseeker's allowance but there is an added qualification in that a person will need to have been on the payment for four months.  Does that mean that people in Dublin who may have lost their jobs on 18 or 19 September when level 3 restrictions were imposed will not get the payment?  Does that mean that people in County Donegal who may have lost their jobs and gone on the PUP on 25 September will not get the bonus payment?  Will the same be true for people in counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan where level 4 restrictions will be in place from tonight?

In the budget we changed this so that the Christmas bonus will now be available to anyone who has been on the PUP or jobseeker's allowance for four of the last nine months.  As such it is being opened up to many hundreds of thousands of people who would not have received it previously.</p></speech>

Last week the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, spoke about HIQA operating a number of pilot schemes for antigen testing running in parallel with polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing.  He answered this question when people raised the traffic light system we have signed up to.  I assume it is absolutely vital we get this sorted from the point of view of travel but also to ensure we have capacity.  We have already heard about the difficulties with testing, tracing and isolating.</p></speech>

It relates to Cork Airport and the loss of Ryanair jobs there.  There is a call from the airport stakeholders that the EU's traffic light system for international travel be adopted because that would give a fighting chance to airports like those at Cork and Shannon.  I raised this issue last week and ask again that the Cabinet give the green light to this system as soon as possible to give airports like Cork Airport a fighting chance so we can grow the routes again.  I express my solidarity with the Ryanair workers at Cork Airport and Shannon Airport who are now in a very precarious postilion, as are workers in other airlines.  While the package of measures - some &euro;10 million for the two regional airports - announced by the Government is welcome, I ask the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet to look at this again.  It is vital that a decision on the implementation of the EU traffic light system for international travel be made as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

On the matter raised by Deputy Sherlock, the news that Ryanair is closing its bases at Cork Airport and Shannon Airport for the winter comes as a huge blow to Cork and Shannon, to both regions and particularly to staff in the airports and the Ryanair staff affected.  It is happening as a consequence of the fact that so few people are travelling now due to the pandemic and also in part because of the very strict travel rules we have put in place.  These rules have been put in place for good reason, for reasons of public health.  We want to get flying again, we want our airports to be busy again and we want all of these people to get back to work as soon as possible.  For that reason the Government will next week consider whether we opt into the new EU traffic light system which was agreed at a European level only this week.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, attended those meetings and it was adopted at European level.  We will decide next week whether we formally opt into it.  While that is not going to get planes flying again over the winter period - they probably should not be - it at least means that if the pandemic goes back into retreat we will have a safe system in place for the summer period.  No system will be 100% safe but there are systems which can be much safer.</p>  <p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s question, when it comes to rapid testing, be it loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP, or antigen testing, it is acknowledged that they are not as sensitive or specific as PCR testing which is the gold standard.  However HIQA has done a health technology assessment on it and that will help us to determine what role rapid testing may have to play in our fight against the virus.  That is being considered by NPHET at the moment and I look forward to an early consideration of it and decision on it because it is important.</p></speech>

Following an alleged bad batch of the swine flu vaccine a decade ago, over 90 people have taken claims against the HSE.  They claim this bad batch resulted in them developing narcolepsy.  Four of them are from my own County Tipperary.  Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder which impairs the brain's ability to regulate its sleep-wake cycle normally.  The State brought the first claim to court before settling.  This cost the State approximately &euro;10 million, which was a multiple of the award to the claimant.  Now there are over 90 cases of people taking similar claims that the State is refusing to settle.  These people's way of life has been drastically altered as a result of developing narcolepsy.  The State needs to stop dragging its heels on this and making life even more difficult for these people than it already is.  They are entitled to compensation without the hassle and anxiety of High Court proceedings.</p></speech>

The case mentioned by the Deputy was settled without admission of liability.  The person taking the case withdrew most of her claims and it was settled on that basis, unfortunately with the vast majority of the money going to legal people rather than the person who was affected.  However, perhaps it sets a template by which the State Claims Agency can settle the other cases quickly and I certainly encourage the agency to settle cases as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

What are the Government's plans to prevent further post office closures?  Post offices are essential services in our rural towns and villages.  I recently found out from helping a constituent that just three post offices in County Kildare and one in County Laois provide the free address service to homeless people.  Will this service be expanded to more post offices to make it easier to access?</p></speech>

An Post has transformed as a company in recent years.  A few years ago, it was losing a lot of money but it has really transformed its business and its service since then.  The whole parcel delivery service has become very lucrative for it and of course it is getting back into financial services and banking.  As such I am very encouraged by the transformation and changes that have happened in An Post in recent years.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I totally agree that our network of local and rural post offices is an important part of our community fabric and we want to retain as many as are viable.  In terms of the details of future plans, it would probably be best if I were to ask the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to come back to the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

We all know that the shock and pain of losing any family member is one of the worst of life's experiences but there really are few traumas or sadnesses like the loss of an infant.  What compounds it is that it happens so often in private and in secret and without the usual recognition we get for losing family members.  I want to highlight it today.</p>  <p>  It was very heartening to see so much being made available for the national maternity strategy in the budget and I thank the T&aacute;naiste for this.  Will he highlight within it the importance of sensitivity in communication by doctors?  As a medical professional, he knows how important this is.  I have spoken to many women who have gone through this without the sensitivity of medical professionals or public health nurses and without follow-up mental health supports.</p></speech>

I know it is a deeply traumatic experience for so many people whom we know.  When I was the Minister for Health, I had the privilege of producing Ireland's first national maternity strategy, which is being implemented and there is funding for it in the budget, which I am delighted to see.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, managed to secure more funding for it than I did and I welcome the fact this is happening.  Part of the strategy involves improving the responsiveness of our health service in these situations and training doctors, midwives and health professionals on how better to break bad news and deal with bad news such as this.  It involves the appointment of bereavement midwives who specialise in this.  A number of them exist already and we need more.  As well as this there are small things that matter, such as the right room.  It can be very difficult for somebody to find out the baby she is carrying has died or will not survive in a ward where she can hear the sound of newborn babies.  All of these little things can really make a difference.  We have a pathway to really improve how we treat people in these scenarios.</p></speech>

The disabled persons improvement grant announced on 9 September was &euro;260,363 and last year it was &euro;269,500.  It is a very small grant given the amount of housing stock Meath County Council is dealing with.  Can it be increased?  Local authorities must come up with 20% matched funding for grants with regard to older people and people with disabilities.  This is an awful drain on resources and is crippling local authorities.  Last year, Meath County Council received an additional &euro;200,000 for windows and doors.  This year it received no additional money.  The local authority did not look for it because it was not able to match 20% of the funding because it would have been an awful drain on resources.  The T&aacute;naiste knows, and if he does not another Minister will, that Meath County Council is the lowest funded local authority in Ireland from central government funding.

He has suffered many personal difficulties and has now been told he has reached the end of the road with regard to local authority services for one reason or another.  This situation is leaving someone in a wheelchair homeless.  His only bit of luck was to get a room in a hotel fairly cheaply because of Covid.

I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that the power and funding of the Department of Education and Skills would be best channelled to infants in disadvantaged schools.  The anomaly we have now is that no disadvantaged primary school with infants will benefit from the change in the pupil-teacher ratio because the staffing schedule for DEIS schools is different from that for mainstream schools.  I ask for a change to be made as soon as possible.  I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that if mainstream schools can benefit from a change in the pupil-teacher ratio from 26:1 to 25:1 it would be rather remarkable that disadvantaged schools dealing with infants only or vertical schools with infants in them would not benefit from the same change in class sizes or the pupil-teacher ratio.  It is an anomaly and I am sure it is an oversight but it is deeply unfair.  Will the Government correct this anomaly and ensure every school benefits from the change in the pupil-teacher ratio?</p></speech>

I do not have detailed knowledge of exactly how the staffing schedule works.  I will certainly let the Minister know the Deputy has raised it and ask her to come back to him on it.  I understand the point he is making but it is equally worth pointing out that most disadvantaged children do not attend DEIS schools.  DEIS schools are disadvantaged but many disadvantaged children do not attend DEIS schools and we need to bear this in mind also.</p></speech>

It is something that everybody thought was a wonderful idea but, unfortunately, the experience of many people called up has been very negative.  A healthcare professional in my constituency signed a contract for a number of months but received only intermittent work and since October has had no work.  She has had to go onto jobseeker's allowance, which means she must send a letter to the company with the details of the odd day she works.  She gets one or two days' work a week.  Recently, she was offered two days' work in Donegal, which would have involved a 150 km round trip but she would have received no money for travel expenses.  It has been a very negative experience and has created a lot of cynicism among many people who went forward for it.  This is very regrettable.  This issue needs to be dealt with and affirmative action needs to be taken to reassure these people they are valued by the health service and that they will be given proper contracts of employment.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding this, more than 5,000 people were recruited to our public health service this year, including 800 doctors, 800 nurses and 1,600 therapists, healthcare professionals and healthcare workers.  A lot of direct recruitment has happened in the past eight or nine months.  In the budget announced this week, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, secured funding to recruit and hire directly, and not through an agency, 15,000 additional staff for the health service, which is huge.  It will increase our public health workforce by more than 10% in one year.  It is a phenomenal amount of money.  It could really result in a step change in staffing levels throughout the health service in hospitals and in the community.</p></speech>

It is about allowing the Government to respond to the challenges and opportunities we face both at home and abroad.  In budget 2021, I have worked with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and my colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs to secure funding that will help those suffering from the effects of conflict, poverty, climate change and now a pandemic.</p>  <p>  We will allocate an additional &euro;30 million in overseas development aid funding next year.  This increase underlines the priority that the Government and I attach to meeting our aid targets.  The budget allocation will stand at &euro;868 million and bring us a further step towards achieving our UN target of 0.7% of GNI* to overseas development aid by 2030.  Specifically, this will enable us to respond to the needs of those most affected by Covid-19, to contribute to global efforts not just to develop a vaccine but also to ensure it will be available to people irrespective of income or where they are from.  We will continue to invest in global public health because, as the World Health Organization's Dr. Mike Ryan continually reminds us, no one is safe until everyone is safe.  Given the scale of the crisis, a coherent, system-wide international response is necessary.  The leadership of the United Nations, and in particular of the World Health Organization, has never been more necessary.  I will continue to encourage the multinational system to deliver as one and work with our EU partners to maximise the co-ordination, coherence, effectiveness and visibility of our European Union response.</p>  <p>  The increased budget allocation for Irish Aid will allow us to step up our work on climate action, to continue to help those most vulnerable to adapt to the effects of climate change.  I am very conscious that many of those on the front line of climate change have done the least to contribute to the problem, which is why I have established a dedicated climate unit within Irish Aid, as provided for in the programme for Government.  I have asked it to develop a strategy for climate finance and to build on Ireland's emerging climate diplomacy, including as we prepare for the COP26 summit in Glasgow next year.  Our climate diplomacy has an explicit focus on least developed countries and the small island developing states, strengthening their capacity to plan and budget for the impacts of climate change, including their ability to access international finance.  I anticipate that the links between climate and security will resonate throughout Ireland's work once we take our seat on the Security Council in January.</p>  <p>  On the other side of my junior ministerial responsibility, Ireland's global diaspora, I will publish in the coming weeks a new diaspora strategy in line with our commitments under the programme for Government.  This will ensure that the welfare of the most vulnerable members of our diaspora will remain at the heart of our policy.  The new strategy will also recognise the diversity of the contemporary diaspora and reflect the values of modern Ireland.  I very much welcome in budget 2021 the increased funding for the emigrant support programme, bringing the annual allocation to more than &euro;13 million.  The programme and a new targeted Covid-19 response fund have supported Irish communities and organisations throughout the world during these difficult times and will continue to do so.  The emigrant support programme will always prioritise the welfare of our people abroad.</p>  <p>  On a personal level, I have been struck by the dedication and determination of the volunteers within the Irish diaspora communities as they have tackled the challenges of Covid-19 head on and are a great source pride for this country.  They have worked quietly and effectively, with the support of our embassy network and through the emigrant support programme we have provided, to have a real impact on people's lives.  This vital work will continue in the coming weeks, months and years.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the issue, I will support Irish efforts to develop new markets and increase Ireland's worldwide engagement to position Ireland for economic recovery.  We are well on our way to achieving our goal of doubling Ireland's global footprint by 2025 but, in these complicated times, we must be equipped to respond to global developments.  Budget 2021 will ensure we continue to provide essential services to those most in need throughout the world, whatever the scenario.</p></speech>

The budget of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for 2021 will be &euro;25.1 billion.  This is the largest ever annual allocation and is more than &euro;4 billion larger than the Department's allocation in last year's budget.  Much of that spending will be required to meet the ongoing costs of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and an increased volume of jobseeker's payments.</p>  <p>  I am pleased, however, even in difficult times, to have been able to secure almost &euro;300 million for a series of targeted measures that will protect some of the most vulnerable groups in our society.  We have helped our most vulnerable older people with a &euro;5 increase in the living alone allowance, a &euro;3.50 increase in the fuel allowance and a 100% Christmas bonus for all pensioners, while the eligible age for the State pension will remain at 66 years, at a cost of &euro;220 million.  We have supported low-income families with a &euro;5 increase in the qualified child payment for over-12s and a &euro;2 increase for under-12s, benefiting some 420,000 children.  There will be an additional &euro;5.5 million for the hot school meals programme and we have made positive changes to income thresholds for the one-parent family payment and the working family payment.</p>  <p>  We are supporting people with a disability with an increase in the earnings disregard on disability allowance from &euro;120 per week to &euro;140 per week.  In addition, I am extending the training support grant of &euro;1,000 to jobseekers with disabilities who are supported through the employability service.  We have also increased the carer's support grant to &euro;1,850, the highest ever rate, benefiting more than 130,000 carers throughout the country.</p>  <p>  We have made changes to the PUP so that the self-employed can earn up to &euro;480 per month without it impacting that payment.  That change is effective immediately, so people on the PUP can avail of it today.  I can confirm that the &euro;480 relates to income from self-employment before tax but after business expenses have been deducted.  We are also providing an additional &euro;12 million for the &euro;1,000 enterprise support grant for the self-employed.  My Department is here to support and assist anybody who has lost his or her job.  We have secured an additional &euro;10 million on top of the &euro;112 million secured as part of the July stimulus package to extend and enhance our suite of employment support measures and I will work alongside the Minister with responsibility for further and higher education, Deputy Harris, in that regard.</p> <p> The Christmas bonus recognises the need of people who are long-term financially dependent on their social welfare payment.  Jobseekers have to be on a payment for 15 months or longer before qualifying for the Christmas bonus.  In recognition of these unprecedented times, I am reducing the eligibility period to four months for people on the PUP and jobseeker's payments.  The total cost of the Christmas bonus this year is expected to be &euro;350 million, which is far in excess of the &euro;279 million paid last year.</p> <p> As Minister for Rural and Community Development, I am pleased to have secured a record budget allocation of &euro;341 million.  This represents a &euro;23 million or 7% increase in funding year-on-year.  Funding has been increased for all our rural schemes across the board.  I am particularly pleased to have secured an additional &euro;5 million in funding for an enhanced town and village renewal scheme in 2021, which will see a major focus on the development of remote working facilities in our rural towns and villages.</p> <p> We have much to do across Government and society in building our economy back up and providing people, businesses and communities across the country with the support they need to get through this pandemic.  I believe the unprecedented scale of the budget package announced by Government this week is a strong statement of our intent in that regard.</p></speech>

There is a number of issues I would like to raise.</p><p>On the agricultural side, the long-promised food ombudsman was a commitment going back many years but we particularly zoned in on this over recent years to try and resolve issues in relation to food, especially what the food processor and producer get for their product and what is paid by the consumer for the end product.  There has always been a major debate about it and the food ombudsman will bring clarity to that.  It is important that we accept there is an issue there in relation to farming.  Satire sometimes reflects what is happening in society and the cartoon in the<i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>depicted very well how the beef price is going up but not the price being paid to the primary producer.  That caption alone shows what work needs to be done by the food ombudsman.  I welcome that initiative and I welcome the initiative to ensure there is a targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, programme for 2021 and a number of other agricultural schemes that are there between the end of this year and the commencement of the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, programme in 2022.</p><p>In the Department of Education and Skills, the pupil-teacher ratio has long been debated by all sides of the House but it is a welcome development that we reduce that ratio this year.  It is vitally important that we give as many resources as possible to the early years of education, particularly primary schools right across the board, because the international evidence and research has shown that when somebody is given a good start in education, it is the foundation from which he or she continues and goes forward.  I welcome that initiative.</p><p>There is something we have to look at carefully as we go forward.  There is a commitment to special needs assistants and there needs to be a discussion on that issue.  The scheme has evolved over the past 20 years or so and there needs to be thought given to how we are going to implement that to make sure it is fit for purpose as we go into the next decade.</p><p>On disability, &euro;100 million has been given to that area.  I hope this will be directed to opening the day services, tackling the waiting lists for needs assessments and occupational and speech therapy, and ending the practice within the HSE currently so that people with huge training, such as occupational and speech therapists, are taken away from contact tracing and put back into the jobs that are needed in the disability sector.</p><p>Following the court decision in June on the primary medical certificates, it is vitally important we get clarification from the Department of Finance and the Department of Health to get that scheme up and running.  There will be a backlog created in terms of this primary medical certificate and I have been arguing for years that there is a need to broaden the scope of the certificate.  While it was brought in in good faith back in the day, it needs to be looked at in terms of the challenges in society at the moment and where it needs to be tailored.  I will be talking to Government at all times to make sure there is clarity on that.</p><p>An extra &euro;20 million was brought in for the section 39 organisations, which are predominantly providing services on behalf of the State.  We need to have a proper discussion about them, especially on the health and education side but right across such organisations.  A section was put into the Act that has allowed many organisations to be categorised under it, but it has always been the ammunition of Government to be able to say they are not State organisations but rather organisations providing services for the State by grant aid.  We need to look at some of the organisations under section 39 that are providing State services exclusively and the insurance costs they have.  We should be looking at bringing them under the State Claims Agency because there is only one underwriter providing insurance for those, particularly on the health side, and there have been rising costs over the years.</p><p>The Minister spoke about CL&Aacute;R, and the CL&Aacute;R funding needs to be expanded and brought forward.  We also need to ensure there is CL&Aacute;R funding available going forward.</p><p>As the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is here, I will speak on forestry and the wonderful initiative there, the NeighbourWood Scheme.  There should be a real target in that scheme, and community groups as well as farmers and others should be targeted to make sure it brings a benefit to the whole community as we go forward.  That needs to be looked at and enhanced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="13:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500020#U00300"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Kerrane.  The crisis in health at the moment is a battle on a number of different fronts: dealing with Covid care, non-Covid care and all the missed care across a whole range of specialties.  This has resulted in 613,000 patients today in this State waiting to see a hospital consultant and 850,000 patients waiting either to see a consultant or for an inpatient procedure or medical support.  As context or background, we also have a decade of underinvestment from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il.  What we needed in the budget was a response and action on all fronts.  If I was Minister for Health, I would have made sure we had at least 100 additional ICU beds and at least 1,100 new inpatient beds.</p>  <p>  As always with the Government's budget, the devil is in the detail.  Going under the bonnet of what it says in the budget and the reality of the ground, it is very different.  Regarding the 1,100 acute beds that we were told are additional, in fact they are not.  It is 1,100 additional beds over two years, and not one year.  It is only 500 additional beds on top of what was there at the end of last year and, in fact, it will only be 197 additional beds on top of what would have been there at the end of this year compared with what will be there at the end of next year.  That falls far short of what is required and will not enable our healthcare system to deal with the real challenges that it faces.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health and the Government made great play about the fact that this is a spectacular health budget of &euro;4 billion.  It is a lot of money, of course, but it has to be pointed out that most of this money is one-off funding to deal with Covid.</p> <p>Some of it is to deal with demographics and pay but an enormous amount of that money is to deal with personal protective equipment, testing and tracing and infection control measures.  All of that must happen and we provided for it in our budget.  When one looks at the core additional supports, services, staff and beds, the budget is less ambitious than the headline figures would have one believe.</p> <p> It is also the case that there is double counting and smoke and mirrors applied to the deliverables and what has been said.  I spoke to a number of hospital managers over the course of the past few days who told me that the 1,100 magic beds that the Minister has talked about cannot come unless there is capital funding and additional physical space.  The additional capital funding for health in the budget was &euro;25 million.  It is not possible to deliver all the beds that the Minister says he wants to deliver.  The plan is even less ambitious than he was trying to portray in the Budget Statement.  This budget will fall short of what is needed to make sure that our front-line staff and health services are equipped to deal with the battle on all fronts about which I spoke earlier.</p> <p> There are some welcome investments in health that I acknowledge, some of which relates to national strategies.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will remember that we had a Private Members' motion in this House on cancer care.  I worked closely with the Minister for Health and others to ensure that we secured additional funding for cancer services.  I am pleased that &euro;32 million of additional funding has been given to the area, &euro;20 million of which will go to support the national cancer strategy with the remaining &euro;12 million to kick-start cancer services.  It is short of what we in Sinn F&eacute;in proposed, but it is a significant increase.  There was also additional funding for the national maternity strategy and other national strategies.  That can and should be supported.</p> <p> I must also point out that there was some cut-and-paste and copy-and-paste in the Government's plan, based on last year's budget.  The Government again wants to take credit this year for reducing prescription charges and expanding the medical card for the over-70s.  Those measures were in last year's budget, were funded and not delivered.  The exact same measures were in this year's budget.  They have been funded this time but let us see if they are delivered.</p> <p> What we got from the Minister for Health is not a plan that is detailed, worked out and shows that he knows where the beds are and where the additional staff are going to come from.  This is a plan to develop a plan and that is not what a budget should be.  A budget should be a plan that will deliver.</p> <p> At the heart of all of this are patients and people.  The reality is that 613,000 people are waiting to see a consultant.  Some 850,000 people are waiting either to see a consultant or to get a hospital procedure.  Those are the facts and realities of a decade of underinvestment by previous Governments.  The three-card trick that the Government has played here by putting all of the Covid expenditure into the Department of Health and claiming it is all new money in the health service when, in fact, most of it is one-off funding will be rapidly exposed for what it is.  If I were the Minister for Health, I would have made sure that the 100 intensive care unit, ICU, beds that are needed would be there.  The Minister knows that there are fewer ICU beds in our acute hospitals today than there were ten years ago.  We are in the middle of a pandemic where the virus attacks people's respiratory systems and they need to be treated in an ICU.  That has happened on the watch of Fine Gael, Deputy Varadkar and the Taoiseach.  They allowed that to happen and have not put enough beds into the system.</p> <p> I am not interested in wish lists, magic numbers or the smoke and mirrors we have got in this budget.  I am interested in real plans and strategies that work and deliver for patients and front-line staff.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500021#V00200"><p>Earlier today, I re-read more than 300 comments left by almost 500 people who participated in my online survey on household debt last month.  One of those who left a comment was a mother who has been crying herself to sleep so her husband and son do not see her.  Another was a person who is living alone and in constant pain but cannot afford to go to the dentist for the major dental work she needs.  There was also a father who has contemplated suicide and picked a spot in the house to do it but who has been kept going by his son.  Those are the real life experiences of the impact of Covid on workers and families across the State.  Many have lost their jobs and others are on reduced incomes even though their outgoings remain unchanged.  In many cases, people's outgoings have increased because they are spending more time at home.  That means higher electricity bills, more groceries and higher heating bills while rents and mortgages still must be paid.  The basic protections, including bans on disconnections and evictions, and mortgage breaks, are all gone.  The Government stood idly by and allowed those protections to be taken away even though people continue to lose their jobs and businesses continue to close, as is happening even today.</p>  <p>  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, has warned of the tsunami of household debt that is coming, to which there is not even a reference in this budget.  This budget should have reversed the cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and reinstated the higher rate of &euro;350.  It could have sent a message to workers who have lost their jobs, through no fault of their own, that their income supports should not have been cut and that they would be protected.  Instead, those workers have to continue to live on less and not only that, but they will also face further cuts to come next year.</p>  <p>  For the second year in a row, core weekly social welfare payments remain unchanged.  This is a time when the current rates are already set below the poverty line and far below any minimum basic standard of living.  This budget shows no weekly increase for carers, older people, people living with a disability, jobseekers, including those aged 18 to 24 who are expected to live on &euro;112 a week, or the majority of lone parents at a time when, only last month, we had yet another report from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, showing that half of lone-parent families are experiencing enforced deprivation.  Enforced deprivation levels in Ireland increased in 2019 before we ever heard of Covid.</p>  <p>  The Minister made reference to the removal of the 15-month rule for jobseekers and those on the PUP to allow them to qualify for the Christmas bonus and that is welcome, but the same 15-month rule applies for jobseekers when it comes to qualifying for the fuel allowance.  That means that anyone who has lost their job and are now on jobseeker's allowance cannot and will not be able to get assistance with their fuel allowance this winter.  The fuel allowance increase of &euro;3.50 per week would be welcome if it did not pale in comparison with increases in costs, the public service obligation levy, PSO, and Electric Ireland rates this month.  There has also been yet another increase in the carbon tax, a measure that shows this Government's indifference to people who live in rural Ireland where alternatives simply are not there.  This Government has put this charge on the backs of people knowing they can neither afford it nor avoid it.  The report on the impact of these carbon tax increases on low-income households still has not been published.</p>  <p>  The deferral of the increase of the pension age to 67 is welcome and is something for which Sinn F&eacute;in has long campaigned.  We need to see the legislation quickly.  We also need to see the make-up of the pension commission.</p>  <p>  The three-week increase to parents' benefit has led to utter confusion and we need clarity from the Department on what those three weeks mean and when parents will be able to take them because they need them now.</p></speech>

I want to appeal to the Minister with responsibility for children, disability, equality and integration, Deputy O'Gorman, particularly as a member of the Green Party, to deal with one issue in the budget that needs to be rectified.</p>  <p>  We are living through a great sense of hopelessness at the moment but if anyone ever wants to get a sense of hope, they should walk into an average disadvantaged DEIS school and look at what those schools are achieving with infants.  The average three-year-old in a DEIS school has one third the oral language capacity of an average mainstream three-year-old.  The former has 400 words while the latter has 1,200.  The gap in oral language is significant, even at the age of three.  What disadvantaged schools are achieving with infants, young boys and girls, is huge and transformational, as the Minister knows because the Green Party is committed to education.  The Labour Party has advocated for increased capitation for disadvantaged schools etc.  The Government announced a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, from 26:1 to 25:1, which was welcome.  That was something for which we advocated.  DEIS schools are on a different staffing schedule and will not automatically get that PTR reduction.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The situation now is that the only schools that will not benefit from the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios are disadvantaged schools that have infants.  Every other primary school in the country is getting a reduction in pupil-teacher ratios.  That is justifiable and welcome, and I am not suggesting it should not happen.  In a pandemic it is important that we reduce what are the largest class sizes in Europe.  I think the Minister of State will agree with me that it is utterly unfair that the only schools that will not receive a reduction in pupil-teacher ratios are those disadvantaged schools that have infants.</p> <p> I can make speeches about all that is wrong with the budget, rehearse all of the lines and do mock anger like anybody else can.  This is something that is within the gift of the Government to fix with the stroke of a pen.  I will not say it will cost nothing, but it will not cost an awful lot considering the Department of Education and Skills has a budget of &euro;10 billion.  There is a list of hurt, disappointment and point-scoring opportunities that I am foregoing.  I ask that disadvantaged schools with infant classes be included.</p> <p> I got a kind of "Let them eat cake" response from the Minister of State's Cabinet colleague earlier today.  I was told by the T&aacute;naiste that most disadvantaged students do not attend disadvantaged schools, and that is fine.  I felt that comment utterly missed the point because most people would understand that the vast majority of children who attend disadvantaged schools are acutely disadvantaged.  Education is their one chance to get out of poverty.  In many instances, it is their only chance to get out of grinding and spirit-crushing poverty.  Education is the great liberator.  If the Department of Education and Skills is making the gesture of reducing class sizes and pupil-teacher ratios, one would have thought it would have front-loaded that for infants in disadvantaged schools.  Yet, it is infants in disadvantaged schools who will not benefit from this at all.</p> <p> After all of the discussion and debate from Ministers who sat where the Minister of State is now sitting, it would be gratifying if my simple five-minute contribution was to lead to this one change so that every school in the country and, in particular, infants in disadvantaged schools would benefit from the reduction in pupil-teacher ratios.  The announcement could be made at any stage over the next period of time and would be graciously received by me, my party and those who are teaching and whose children attend schools in the system.  It is my one ask.  I am not trying to score political points, but I think the Minister of State will agree that it is a valid point and should be recognised.</p></speech>

Instead, it put developers, vulture funds, landlords and big businesses before our older people, carers, the working poor and those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  I am not against big business, but if workers must pay their fair share, that burden should be spread among employers.  I received a message from a constituent yesterday which read, "This must have been the most honest budget ever.  At least they had the decency to wear masks when they were robbing us".</p>  <p>  As the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson for older people, I am looking at the budget from their point of view.  I will not give the usual Opposition speech which tells the Government how bad the budget is.  I will leave that up to the impartial bodies advocating for our older people.  I will outline a flavour of their opinion.</p>  <p>  Se&aacute;n Moynihan, CEO of ALONE, has, welcomed as I did, the increased investment in home care supports and support hours, something it and other organisations have advocated for over recent years.  However, he expressed his concern that older people are not mentioned enough in this budget and said the measures did not adequately reflect the pre-existing and exasperating challenges faced by older people in today's world.  He was also disheartened to see that the Government had failed to set the State pension at the average weekly wage agreed in the Government's roadmap for pensions reform.  He was not alone in that.  I, too, share his sentiments.</p>  <p>  Maureen Kavanagh, CEO of Active Retirement Ireland, said Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party committed in the programme for Government to build a society that properly values older people and one in which older people can live full and active lives in their communities. However, in her opinion budget 2021 falls short of delivering that society.  She went on to say that the budget was an opportunity to ensure the supports older people need are properly resourced.  She is disappointed in the Government and thinks it is a missed opportunity.  She is especially disappointed that the Government did not increase the State pension.  Older people are spending more time at home as a result of the pandemic, which is leading to an increase in heating bills.  An increase in the State pension would have helped older people to deal with the rise in the cost of living.</p>  <p>  Age Action Ireland said budget 2021 did not offer the majority of older people the support they need to meet the rising cost of living.  Covid-19, the carbon tax and Brexit will have an impact, but the budget did not contain adequate measures to support older people.</p>  <p>  The top rate of all current State pension contributions remains substantially below the at risk of poverty rate.  Budget 2021 saw no increase in the core State pension rate.  It did not allow for any increase in the cost of living nor did it support people who have to withstand economic shocks.  Incomes for those who are living with others have stood still since 2019.  This is totally and wholly unacceptable and should be changed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500022#W00300"><p>I welcome some of the positive announcements in the budget in the areas of climate action and transport.  Investing in our public transport system, active travel options and improving the quality of our roads and rail lines are all vitally important in addressing our emissions obligations and improving the quality of life of our citizens.  Unsurprisingly, I also want to address a number of the areas where we believe the Government has failed and set out why we believe these issues should be approached differently.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's position on a carbon tax is well known.  It is not that we do not want to address the use of fossil fuels in our homes and cars, but we believe targeting people with a punitive tax is not a fair or just approach and it will not actually help.  In fact, it will do the opposite.  The carbon tax applies to all the things people cannot do without, such as petrol to get them to work, gas to cook their dinner and home heating oil to keep them warm.</p>  <p>  The 29% increase announced is inherently unfair as the richer a person is, the easier this tax is to avoid.  Those who have the money can buy electric cars, install a fleet of solar panels on their roofs and retrofit their homes, thereby avoiding the tax increase in all of these areas.  Most people simply cannot do this.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said the carbon tax will help people to choose the right thing.  The Labour Party said the carbon tax is the litmus test of our commitment to our climate obligations.  That reflects the starting position for individuals.  I was genuinely astonished by those statements.</p>  <p>  Many people would love to choose an electric car and have their homes retrofitted so their heating bills would not be sky high.  They would love to choose to have solar panels on their roofs or take a train or a dependable bus instead of sitting for hours in traffic.  Most people do not have a spare &euro;50,000 to buy a larger vehicle or retrofit their home and get a heat pump.</p> <p>By pushing up their bills through a carbon tax, they will have less money tomorrow to do all these things.  The Government is punishing people for not being able to afford the cost of upgrading to greener alternatives.  That is a punitive and brutal approach that will hamper our transition to a low carbon society and will really hurt people in the process.  The people who are being targeted are the most vulnerable and will bear the most significant burden.</p> <p> The carbon tax increase is already going to impact some of the industries already on the floor due to Covid-19.  Taxi drivers and bus operators are going to be hit with significant additional fuel costs all while their businesses have been decimated.  Again, these industries want to transition to cleaner and greener alternatives but affordable, realistic alternatives are simply not there yet.  Punishing them with higher bills now will make their precarious financial situation worse and will not actually help the environment.  As my time is limited I will conclude on that point.</p> <p> I look forward to the Government and the Ministers publishing more details on their budget proposals, particularly in the area of retrofitting which was light on detail.  We know that there are very significant delays and waiting lists and the figures in the budget need significantly more scrutiny which I look forward to giving.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.242" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Senator Pippa Hackett)" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500023#X00300"><p>This year&rsquo;s budget comes at a difficult time for us all.  As we cope with Covid-19 and face the possibility of a hard Brexit, we must ensure that our recovery, when it comes, focuses on sustainability and on the environmental commitments contained within the programme for Government.  The EU Green Deal and its recent strategies on farm to fork and biodiversity copperfasten this resolve.  As Minister of State with responsibility for land use and biodiversity, I am particularly proud to see that so many important measures provided for in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s budgetary allocation will stimulate nature-friendly farming practices and will encourage and incentivise farmers to do what they can to enhance their land while also producing high quality food.</p>  <p>  Farmers know more than anyone that climate change and biodiversity loss have a direct impact on their farms' viability.  They know that the future of food production depends on having a healthy environment in which to farm.  I am delighted that the ring-fenced &euro;23 million from the carbon tax along with additional funding which has been announced by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, will be allocated to a range of new pilot environmental measures which will include aspects such as habitat creation, pasture management for biodiversity, and re-wetting.  This funding will contribute to the development of a pilot scheme to encourage environmental action from farmers who are not currently part of GLAS and to a number of pilot environmental actions that will be available to farmers on a broader basis.  Importantly, these pilot actions will inform the development of a major new flagship environmental scheme for agriculture following on from the GLAS scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have secured more than &euro;100 million for forestry.  This is a sector we simply must get moving again.  I know that 2020 has been a disappointing year in reaching our afforestation targets.  Much of this was related to delays in issuing licences which we are addressing.  I am conscious that the Department has invested heavily in additional resources to work systematically through the backlog of forestry applications.  We are now well-placed to accept new applications.</p>  <p>  This budget also provides funding for a range of other actions which will mobilise the private timber resource, promote timber products, and support the role of Teagasc in advising forest owners.  However, I want to emphasise that I am ambitious for forestry and for a new and better way of doing it.  I want to see many more farmers getting involved and thinking &ldquo;tree&rdquo; and I intend that the transitional measures which we will roll out in advance of a new forestry programme will encourage them to do so.  My vision is for a forestry programme which will encourage planting diversity, action on climate, and improvements in environmental and biodiversity outcomes while also supporting a healthy industry.  I intend that the funding in this budget will support the schemes and incentives which put us on that path.</p>  <p>  It is also significant to see progress in funding for horticulture which has seen an increase of 50% to &euro;9 million.  The potential in this sector from import substitution and exploring new markets is immense.  This allocation will support current producers and I hope will attract many more new growers.</p>  <p>  I am also delighted to announce a 33% increase in the budget for the organic farming scheme.  Funding for this scheme has been increased to almost &euro;16 million, up from &euro;12 million last year.  Other supports for the organic sector include &euro;1.2 million provided for investment in organic processing and a &euro;1 million development fund for the organic sector itself, bringing the overall investment in the budget for the sector to &euro;18.2 million.  This funding will allow us to reopen the organic farming scheme which will increase the number of organic farmers in Ireland by more than 30% by the end of next year.  This is a major milestone and a real vote of confidence by this Government in the implementation of our national organic strategy.  It is also a significant first step in our commitment to increase the area of land under organic production.</p>  <p>  European innovation partnership, EIP, schemes have been a great success and I want to see some smaller scaled versions focusing largely on biodiversity.  As such, I am pleased to announce &euro;1.25 million for initiatives where land is managed or farmed using nature-based processes.  I am also very happy with the &euro;14 million allocation for biodiversity training along with the health and safety training for farmers.  </p>  <p>  Finally, if we are going to make real progress, farmers and policymakers will need a full understanding of what we have to work with and of what is possible.  That is why the &euro;10 million funding for a national soil-sampling programme and the &euro;5 million for a study on farm biodiversity are so important.  As important are the allocations for a national land use review and a feasibility study on the markets for wool products.  All of these measures are programme for Government commitments and I look forward to engaging with farmers, NGOs, environmentalists and with communities as through them we will design a better, nature-friendly future for farming.</p>  <p>  Finally, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, for his work in securing this budgetary allocation for 2021 and I am confident that together with Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, we can deliver a programme of activities in 2021 which will meet our commitments.  We look forward to utilising this funding to its fullest potential.  I commend this budget to the House.</p></speech>

Of these services, most people were waiting for 12 months or more prior to the pandemic and it has exacerbated the whole situation.  Even before Covid-19 we had many debates in this House about people with disabilities who faced great challenges around poverty, discrimination and low unemployment levels.  Historically, the State has always underfunded disability services.</p>  <p>  The evidence of that is that over the past number of weeks St. John of God, a voluntary organisation that I used to work for, will cease its disability services activities in the next 12 months.  That is very worrying for that sector.  </p>  <p>  To put this in context, the &euro;150 increase in the respite grant will equate to &euro;2.80 per week.  That is a very small amount for a person dependent on that.  The &euro;100 million announced for the disability-related Covid-19 costs is welcome without doubt, but this will only keep existing services, which are under serious pressure, up and running.</p> <p> Another factor in all the grimness of Covid-19 is to do with fundraising for voluntary bodies, which is down at least by 80%.  That is having a detrimental effect on revenue for disability services.  This will be the second year running where there has not been an increase in the disability allowance.  All of that points to funding and resources for the disability sector.  Many people, who do an incredible job, rely on those services.  Service users and their families who have that outlet that is disability services have been under huge pressure, particularly in the past six months, and the stress and anxiety that brings is incalculable.  I am not trying to underplay that but there is a great deal of anxiety about the next six months and where all of this will go, especially for families with challenging needs both in respect of the service and in the home environment.  We need to ensure that the people who rely on services such as these are funded, whether it is the voluntary or non-voluntary sector.  That should be done with a view to providing more resources to disability services in the coming six months and over the next five years.  That is very important for everybody who uses the services in the State.</p></speech>

I welcome the allocation of an additional &euro;50 million for mental health services in this year's budget, which comprises &euro;38 million for policy and operational development and &euro;12 million to underpin the cost of existing services.  This brings the total HSE mental health allocation to &euro;1.076 billion, which is the biggest ever mental health budget.</p>  <p>  The challenges facing our mental health services are well documented.  Even prior to this year, demand for services was increasing while the turbulence of 2020 has added to that.  I acknowledge that extra funding alone will not solve all problems.  With that in mind, we recently launched the new mental health policy, Sharing the Vision: A Mental Health Policy for Everyone.  This plots a new way forward with an increased emphasis on community and primary care services to complement the work already being done in our specialist services.  I would also like to inform the House that last Saturday, which was World Mental Health Day, I launched the implementation and monitoring committee to oversee A Vision for Change.</p>  <p>  As we move forward with implementation the new policy will enable us to deal with mental health issues at an early stage, which is very important for each person, and we all know that early intervention is key, thus reducing the pressure on the specialist services such as child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  I am pleased to announce that &euro;5 million of the spend has been allocated to CAMHS, which will result in 29 whole-time equivalent staff members.  I am acutely aware of the waiting list currently for CAMHS.</p>  <p>  The policy also places a greater focus on mental health promotion and the prevention of mental health difficulties, which is of critical importance in the context of the new challenges posed by Covid-19.  Some &euro;23 million of this new funding will enable us to commence the implementation of a number of short-term recommendations contained in the policy.  These include the expansion of clinical programmes, adult crisis resolution services, increased supports in employment, additional peer support workers, bereavement co-ordinators, dialectical behaviour therapy, and additional mental health beds.  Enhanced mental health community teams will also be delivered and developed.  That will amount to 34 or 35 additional mental health beds next year.</p>  <p>  The additional &euro;15 million will reinforce our response to the additional challenges set by Covid-19.  As part of this response, we will make use of more step-down beds and extra community mental health teams.  The former will help to free up space in our acute mental health system while the latter will provide supports to those outside the acute system.  The remaining &euro;12 million will help to cover the rising cost of existing service provision, including placements for those patients whose needs cannot be met within the mental health public system.</p>  <p>  The substantial funding increase in this year's budget will help us to ensure that our mental health services can meet the challenges of these extraordinary times.  A range of HSE-funded psychosocial supports are already in place, mostly through NGO providers such as Jigsaw, MyMind, SpunOut, Pieta House and many more.  They are providing online and telephone supports for those most directly affected by the personal challenges being experienced during the pandemic.  I thank all of those organisations that have worked with the HSE and the Department of Health in the past seven months.  Ninety per cent of all mental health supports were retained during the Covid lockdown.  That is hugely important.  Many of the groups moved very quickly towards a blended approach that included telephone, video and e-conference.  That has worked very well.  In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, I am wholly committed to enhancing mental health services to ensure that all individuals living in Ireland can get the support they need when they need it.  </p>  <p>  Moving on to my remit as Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I welcome the ambitious budget announced today, which includes unparalleled investment to support and enable older people to continue to live in their own homes and in their communities for as long as possible.  The budget extra allocation was &euro;367 million, which was a phenomenal amount.  Central to this budget is a considerable investment in the enhancement of home care to deliver 5 million additional hours in 2021 while building the HSE's capacity to deliver its share of those services.</p></speech>

There will also be significant investment in community beds, which will provide intermediate care, including more than 600 new rehabilitation beds.</p>  <p>  We are bringing a renewed focus on dementia care in this budget to address the challenges faced by people living with this condition and for those who care for them.  I am pleased to announce that &euro;12.9 million has been allocated across the 2021 budget to improve the quality of life for people living with dementia and their families to assist them to live well in their communities.  This includes 11 new dementia advisers to ensure a full team of 30 advisers are in place throughout the country by the end of 2021.</p></speech>

Deputy Hourigan will not lose time.  There has been some confusion among parties as to who is speaking.  Perhaps the Whips could get together on that.  I want to clarify for the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that there is a slot available.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, has already spoken so there will be a slot available in 20 minutes.  The Minister is part of a group of three people for 15 minutes.  I hope that clarifies things for the Minister.</p></speech>

Is it clear what each Department is trying to accomplish with the taxpayers' money and is the Department achieving those goals?  In the ten days before the budget, both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure gave a little information to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight on the measures that would be contained in budget 2021, and the spending overall seems to have been underestimated by a few billion euro.</p>  <p>  The level of oversight being afforded to each Member of this House on decision-making, metrics and results in the budget is somewhat lacking.  I will look at three areas in the housing budget as an example.  Between the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the long-term leasing of houses, we are now spending &euro;941 million, which is 30% of the housing budget, with regard to private landlords.  That is current, not capital, expenditure that the taxpayer will need to fund every year.  While there may always be a need for the State to rent housing privately, the rationale for such a large percentage of the budget going on rent as opposed to a greater investment in publicly delivered social housing is not presented.</p>  <p>  Similarly, we have spent &euro;310 million on the help to buy schemes since July 2016.  Is that actually helping or are we simply pushing up property prices and putting this money into the pockets of property developers?</p>  <p>  I would like more clarity on where the &euro;218 million allocated to the delivery of homeless services is actually going.  That money is very welcome and very much needed in my constituency but how many organisations are in receipt of this funding and what services are covered?  How many of those organisations are for profit, which is a worrying development we are now beginning to see?</p> <p>Housing is just one example.  Presenting a budget just with high-level numbers that obscure the detail and year-on-year spending trends is not good enough in terms of a thorough evaluation of the budget's effectiveness.</p></speech>

I appreciate the additional details the Minister of State announced in the speech today.  I will examine them when I get a chance.  Of the &euro;50 million she tweeted about on Tuesday, &euro;12 million is for the continuation and management of existing services.  My understanding is that the HSE may need much more for the continuation of these services.</p>  <p>  I have a couple of questions, although I acknowledge the Minister of State cannot answer them now.  If she does, it will be fantastic.  Is the &euro;12 million new money or is it money that was previously allocated for mental health services?  Can the Minister of State guarantee that if the &euro;12 million is not sufficient to continue to resource existing mental health services, she will not dip into the remaining &euro;38 million set aside for the new initiatives she mentioned, such as funding the implementation of Sharing the Vision and providing resources for a Covid response?  If this happens, it will have been a Department decision and not a HSE decision.  The buck stops with the Minister of State.</p>  <p>  I welcome the announcement of the setting up of the independent monitoring committee to oversee the implementation of Sharing the Vision.  This is paramount if Sharing the Vision is to be successful.  The committee needs to be able to engage in budgetary oversight and report, even on a quarterly basis, on the progress or lack thereof.  It needs to ensure that the &euro;20 million set aside to implement the first aspect of Sharing the Vision achieves exactly that and does not go elsewhere to shore up the systemic shortfalls in mental health services.  This needs to happen now.  The short-term goals in Sharing the Vision are the foundation blocks on which the mental health policy is built.  If the foundations are weak, the whole policy could collapse.</p>  <p>  This budget will have a genuine impact if waiting lists are reduced.  I heard the Minister of State mention a couple of measures in this regard.  Years of underinvestment have resulted in 10,000 people waiting for primary care psychological treatment.  That number needs to be reduced.</p>  <p>  Could the Minister of State guarantee that the mental health budget will be released to services by the Department of Health in January 2021 and not released in a piecemeal way throughout the year?  The moneys should be available at the start of the year and services should not be playing catch-up in seeking to spend them.  For example, &euro;12 million was withheld from the HSE by the Department of Health in 2019.</p>  <p>  If Sinn F&eacute;in were in government, it would have recognised that mental health issues do not just arise between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., nor do they take the weekend off.  We would have increased investment in 24-7 crisis mental health services.  Our alternative budget would introduce free counselling on GP referral.  This would break down barriers that exist in accessing health services when and where needed.</p>  <p>  Mental health issues do not take a break during a pandemic.  The new restrictions imposed last night have added to anxiety and stress, particularly among those who live alone and who are now not permitted to visit other households or to allow members of other households to visit them.  This measure could lead to isolation and worsen the impact on people's mental health.  In the North of this island, the authorities have introduced a support bubble, which is a close support network involving a household with one adult in the home, known as a single-adult household, and other households of any size.  Isolation does not just affect older people; it also affects single parents, other single people, parents with children, and adult children with disabilities, among others.  Will the Government consider a measure similar to the support bubble measure in this part of the island over the coming weeks?  It would help to meet the objective of an all-island approach to this pandemic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1576" speakername="Noel Grealish" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500025#Z00400"><p>I welcome many of the extensive measures announced in the budget on Tuesday, especially those aimed at helping SMEs that have suffered from the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.  However, there are some aspects that I found lacking.  Maybe these could be addressed before the publication of the finance Bill, which will give legal effect to most of the measures announced.  When a vaccine against the virus arrives - I hope it will be sooner rather than later - we will need our airlines up and running without delay and ready to facilitate an influx of foreign visitors.  This is an economic imperative.</p>  <p>  This country is greatly dependent on international tourism.  No increase in the domestic holidaymaker market will go anywhere near filling the gap left by the absence of overseas visitors.  I hope many of the measures to support businesses in trouble that were announced on Tuesday will help many of those in the tourism and hospitality sectors to become fully operational when a time of new hope arrives, hopefully early in the new year.</p>  <p>  The &euro;10 million allocation to be shared by Cork and Shannon airports is obviously welcome but, with the decision this morning by Ryanair to close its bases at these airports for the winter, it will not be enough.  Both airports were already struggling before this hammer blow.  Shannon Airport, for instance, is losing millions of euro because of the pandemic.  It is extremely important to the economy of the west but there is a major worry over its future and the future of the businesses and families that depend on it.  Last summer, an average of almost 6,000 passengers flew in and out of Shannon Airport every day.  One day this summer, just 65 passengers went through the very same airport.  On Tuesday, the day the budget was announced, there were just two flights in and out of the airport, both operated by Ryanair.  Today, there is just one flight, and now Ryanair is pulling out for the winter.  There have been no transatlantic services operating out of Shannon Airport since March, and both United Airlines and Delta have said they will not resume these services until 2022, at the earliest.  Aer Lingus has also suspended its transatlantic and Heathrow services.  It will be 2024 before the airport can get back to the passenger levels of the past year.  It urgently needs help to keep afloat during the difficult period until then.</p>  <p>  The big fear among the people in Shannon now is that everything might end up moving to Dublin.  While Shannon Airport is a major contributor to the economy of the west, having had a throughput of almost 1.9 million passengers last year, Knock Airport also plays a major role, having handled more than 800,000 passengers in 2019.  It, too, has suffered a devastating slump in activity, with September seeing just one tenth of the usual passenger volumes to and from the United Kingdom.  The numbers to and from other European airports had decreased by 98%.  I am disappointed that Knock Airport, considering its critical importance to the west in providing connectivity to global markets for the region's businesses and in attracting so many thousands of visitors from abroad, has not got a special injection of aid.</p>  <p>  With regard to the new Covid restrictions support scheme for SMEs that must close as a result of the restrictions imposed under level 3, I would like the Government to clarify that travel agencies will be included.  One could say they have effectively been under level 5 for the past seven months, having had to close their doors in mid-March due to the Government's advice on travel.  It is unlikely that they will be reopening until well into the new year, at best.  It would be extremely unfair if an industry that has played its part in bringing tourists to our country and that will be needed when times are better were to be shut out of this most welcome scheme.</p>  <p>  The chauffeur industry does not feel it has been helped by the supports announced in the July stimulus package.  Chauffeurs play an important role in ferrying tourists around the country.  The budget has dealt chauffeurs a severe blow, with increases in fuel costs and vehicle registration tax.  Since the chauffeur business is largely seasonal, and since the work season of many of the drivers had not resumed by March, they have not been able to avail of the pandemic unemployment payment.  I urge the Government to make amends for this sector.</p>  <p>  I spoke in this House last week about the plight of those in the arts and entertainment community, and I am pleased some steps have been taken to address their concerns.  I am delighted that the Minister for Finance announced in his budget speech the maintenance of the section 481 regional uplift for the film industry at its peak rate, 5%, for another year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500025#Z00500"><p>When my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, addressed the House yesterday, he outlined the planned investment of &euro;3.5 billion to fund projects and programmes under the Department's transport remit in 2021.  An increase of &euro;617 million, or 33%, in capital will allow the Department to continue with its investment in capital expenditure under the national development plan, despite the major challenges created by Covid-19.  Today, I wish to outline in more detail how this investment will impact the road, maritime and aviation sectors.  The impact of Covid-19 is still evident on our road network.  Road traffic volumes fell dramatically in spring due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.  The volumes fell to around one third of the 2019 levels during April.  The volumes recovered significantly as restrictions eased and appear to have plateaued recently at around 80% of 2019 levels.</p> <p> Road construction works were also suspended during the peak Covid-19 restrictions before recommencing in May.  Despite the above Covid-19 impacts, I am pleased to inform the House that there have been no significant delays to investment in the roads programme arising from Covid-19.  In 2021, we will invest &euro;1.3 billion in our road network, with a national roads budget of &euro;799 million.  We will continue the extensive roads programme, with the following projects all at construction stage: the N4 Collooney to Castlebaldwin in Sligo; the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom upgrade scheme; the N5 Westport to Turlough Road; the N56 Dungloe to Glenties; M8-N40-N25 Dunkettle interchange upgrade; and the M50 enhancing motorway operations by introducing variable speed limits.</p> <p> To ensure that our road network is of the highest standard, an additional &euro;15 million has been provided towards the maintenance of the regional and local roads network.  This will assist in progressing towards a steady state level of investment in the network to ensure that the necessary expenditure required to hold the network in its existing condition and avoid further deterioration is provided.  This brings the total maintenance and investment budget for regional and local roads to &euro;555 million.  Construction work on a number of important regional local road projects will be progressed, including the Sallins bypass; Bettystown to Laytown link road; Coonagh to Knockalisheen distributor road; and the Tralee northern relief road.</p> <p> In 2021, allocation includes funding to re-seal and strengthen roads across the network.  Funding will also be provided for safety improvement works, bridge rehabilitation works, maintenance of former national roads and community involvement schemes.  This will assist in the sustainable use of our roads by the wider community for walking, cycling, as well as cars, buses and road haulage.  The Department appreciates that within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this.  Apart from a requirement that a minimum of 15% of the restoration and improvement grant is spent on the more heavily trafficked regional roads, each local authority has the discretion to decide on allocations to other categories of road.  It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas.  </p> <p> One key area that I wish to progress is improving safety for children and families who wish to cycle to school.  A few weeks ago, I met the National Transport Authority to discuss how best to deliver on the programme for Government commitment in this area.  I am delighted that budget 2021 provides the funding required to allow us to develop a safe routes to school programme and see it commenced next year.  Budget 2021 provides for a spend of approximately &euro;1 million per day to support walking and cycling infrastructure.  Those allocations can deliver real change in terms of how our children get to and from their schools.  As part of this change, safe routes to school will see enhancements and improvements to the front of school environments to better promote sustainable and safe entry to and exit from school grounds, expanded provision for bicycle parking at all schools across the country and delivery of improved walking and cycling infrastructure to schools.  The benefits of this investment will not only improve facilities for walking and cycling, it will mean better physical health, improved air quality, less congestion and betters places to live.</p> <p> The sum of &euro;108 million has been allocated to ensure the safety and competitiveness of maritime transport services and the productive and safe use of our seas.  My Department is responsible for the survey, certification, licensing and inspection of vessels, certification of seafarers and also the inspection and approval of ports and port facilities.  This also includes an additional &euro;2.8 million in capital funding for the Irish Coast Guard and Commissioner of Irish Lights, which will also ensure that the provision of an effective emergency response service for marine search and rescue through the Irish Coast Guard.</p> <p> There is also funding of &euro;31.3 million for the aviation sector, &euro;21.3 million for the regional airports programme and an additional &euro;10 million in capital support for Cork and Shannon Airports.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and, in particular, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, on the excellent work they did in presenting the budget.  As a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy it was a great honour for me to see the Minister, Deputy McGrath, present what was a very expansionist budget.  It is what the country requires at this time.  We are going through a period of significant economic turbulence and uncertainty.  The appropriate way to respond to that economically is through borrowing.  I thank and commend the Minister, Deputy McGrath, on his contribution to that budgetary policy that I believe everyone in this House recognises is correct.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out that the budget does provide supports for businesses, companies and individuals who are experiencing significant financial distress as a result of this extraordinary pandemic going through all of our lives.  It is important to also point out that Government can control issues pertaining to economics and financial responses to these events but it cannot provide a response to every issue.  As politicians, and as a House, we need to recognise our limitations, particularly when it comes to naturally occurring events.  If a hurricane or a major weather event occurs, all we can do is try to put in place measures to protect citizens from the severity of that natural weather event.  Similarly, when it comes to a pandemic, it is such an unusual event all we can do in terms of trying to protect the public is to try to suppress the impact of the pandemic on the Irish public.  We are never, I regret to say, going to be able to control this event, in the same way as we cannot control another natural event such as a hurricane.</p>  <p>  I have previously spoken in this House, as far back as 6 May last, about my concern regarding the impact of the pandemic and the restrictions being imposed on young people, in particular people between the age of 16 and 25.  I am more concerned today about this.  As a political system, we must try to develop some policies to protect young people and to enable them to try to live their lives in as normal a way as possible.  It is regrettably the case that the restrictions that we are imposing, and that have to be imposed, are having an extremely negative impact on young people.  They have interfered with their education, employment, entertainment, past-times and relationships.  As a body, we need to come up with some policies and proposals to protect them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.259" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500026#AA00300"><p>Two days ago, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, published its first medium-term forecast since the onset of the coronavirus in which it states that the pandemic will leave significant scars on the global economy and that in the short-term countries able to borrow, such as Ireland, should borrow as much as needed to protect the public from the impact of the virus and limit the extent of the financial contractions.  It also mentions that in the longer term we need to look at our debt burdens and states that the focus now must be on mitigating the impact of Covid-19.  That is the context of budget 2021.  While there are many positives in the budget, and I am happy to acknowledge that, I believe Government should have been more ambitious, in particular in two areas.  First, we needed a more ambitious investment programme, especially in the regions, to act as a catalyst for a balance of development between the regions.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, mentioned the N4.  We have been hearing about that for about five years.  It is welcome.  The Collooney-Castlebaldwin road is, thankfully, almost finished.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said this morning that rural broadband will be delivered in five years rather than in six or seven years.  That is too long because the digital economy will move on and the regions will be left behind.  We need more urgency here.  There are areas where I believe Government should have been a little more ambitious.  I am speaking not of multiple billions of euro investment but of a modest investment in a few key areas which would have made a difference in terms of the safety net that a number of sectors need.  The Government provides a safety net in budget 2021 but there are a few holes in it.  In regard to early childcare, the budget did nothing to address the chronic capital under-funding and the low salaries that are prevalent in this industry.  It is a front-line service but it was not treated it as such in the budget.</p> <p> I also believe we should have maintained the tiered pandemic unemployment payment with &euro;350 as the highest payment.  The arguments in favour are overwhelming.  The truth is that &euro;50 per week could mean the difference between a family simply existing and falling through the cracks.</p> <p> As for falling through the cracks, I had a look at the defence budget.  It is the case that moneys are available, mainly for buying new equipment, but my question is: who will operate this new equipment?  Many people are leaving the Defence Forces.  We have several ships in Haulbowline in Cork.  I know some of them are in for renovation but we do not have the trained staff to operate some of our naval vessels.  Members of the Defence Forces are on family income supplement and others are not much above the minimum wage.  We should have looked at that on Tuesday.</p> <p> Finally, I want to speak about carers.  I am heartbroken to say they are worse off after Tuesday's budget.  The carer's allowance was greater in 2009 than it is today.  I realise most people will not believe that but they should check the figures because it is true.  The income disregard for carer's allowance was cut in 2007 and in 13 years it has never been increased.  Many of us are, rightly, getting pay restoration but carers are not.  There was a &euro;150 increase in the annual carer's support grant.  That is an extra &euro;3 per week to cover the worst effects of the pandemic.  In all honesty, &euro;3 per week will do little and it will not be in place until June 2021, when most of us expect that we will be well on the way out of this pandemic.  The fuel allowance increased by &euro;3.50.  Yet, carer's allowance is not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance and most carers will not get it.  The living alone allowance does not apply because carers, by definition, do not live alone.  They will be unable to access this allowance.  While there are 5 million additional home care hours, and these are welcome, nonetheless they will not even cover the shortfall in adult day care services.  What carers are asking in respect of their need for support is, if not now, then when?</p></speech>

It is welcome.  We need to keep people employed in this country.  However, I hope it is not cumbersome.  That is the one thing I hope for, because if we make it cumbersome the reality is that we will lose many jobs.</p><p>I love the way figures are done.  I have just come from the agriculture committee.  Voted expenditure last year was &euro;1.76 billion.  We were told the other day that some &euro;179 million extra would be provided for agriculture.  Funnily enough, &euro;1.8 billion is what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, read out in his D&aacute;il speech.  The figure was &euro;1.76 billion the year before.  That means &euro;40 million extra even though &euro;30 million will go to Bord B&iacute;a and &euro;4 million extra will go for infrastructure for Brexit.</p><p>The reality is that figures can look good at times but the agricultural sector has not got anything extra.  We need to put things in place for Brexit and ensure there is an easy passage for our meat in the ports.  If there is a tariff, who will pay it?  Are we going to see farmers face what they faced in 1974, when cattle were left on the side of the road?  Are we going to put something in place to ensure these farmers can continue to supply meat?</p><p>Ironically enough, it is unusual to see that before we got protected geographical indication status for beef, they were promoting our grass-fed beef in England, the same as we are doing under the PGI scheme.  I imagine a horse dealer would get PGI status up and running and then promote his produce to try to get it to a higher level.  Ironically enough, we are not doing that at the moment.</p><p>The one thing that will cripple the people in rural Ireland is the carbon tax.  Many here come from a farming background.  Whether it is making silage or topping, no matter what the farmer is doing on the farm, he needs a tractor.  We will hear the story traipsed out by many a Minister telling us that there is double taxation for the farmer, and they are right to say it.  However, the reality is that 90% of the work is done.  I read an article in <i>AgriLand</i>.  One contractor who cuts silage said that over the next ten years, the cost would be &euro;130,000 or &euro;150,000 extra.  I know Tesla is talking about something that is electric, but no alternative is available.  The Government has decided, because it is playing ball with the Green Party and licking up to that party, we are going to cripple those in the farming community with this carbon tax.  This applies not only to them but to every young couple.  Show me a politician who can say that if a person gets over &euro;25,000, he or she will get something.  What do they get in this country?  What do they get when they fill in any form?  Unfortunately, they will be told in counties Galway or Roscommon that if they earn more than &euro;25,500 they are above the social housing threshold and they will be sent away.  If parents have children going to school, they will be sent away without a back-to-school allowance.  Let us suppose a husband and wife are working, have a mortgage and children going to college and they are on &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 each.  It is over the threshold and they do not get anything.  These are the people who are paying everything and getting nothing.  No one seems to be bothered about them, only they get more medicine and hardship.  These are the people who have brought the country right up to where it is today since 2010.  These are the people who have worked hard.  What do we do?  What do we do with their home heating oil, which might keep them warm when they get home at night?  We take another &euro;100 off them this year.  What do we do with their cars?  We knock another &euro;90 or &euro;100 in carbon tax from them.  For good measure, we make them pay more tax on the car.  That is more tax on the car from the same people who were in government - those in the Green Party - when Mr. Gormley was in office in 2009 or 2010.  Back then he decided to bring in these bands of tax.  He told everyone to go and buy diesel.  Now, at the press of a button or the stroke of a pen, it has changed.  To make it even smarter and more cunning, the Government has put into legislation that people are shafted forever and a day.  The rural Deputies will not have the embarrassment of voting with their Government to shaft the people in middle Ireland.  If that is justice, then I do not know what politics is about.  We are supposed to try to look after people.</p><p>I have no wish to be critical.  There are good things in the budget.  There are things that will help business.  Yet, my God, we have an agricultural sector worth &euro;14 billion that exports.  We have 300,000 people directly or indirectly employed in it and we have decided to kick them in the goolies.  We have also decided to knock some more money from the people in middle Ireland, the people who get up early in the morning and go out to work, as a Taoiseach once said.  Show me what people earning more than &euro;25,000 will get?  They will not get retrofitting.  They may if they have &euro;30,000 more to match it, but this is living in reality and not the cuckoo world that some of the Green Party decide to live in, where they have buses and Luas vehicles and all these other things up their asses in Dublin.  When a person goes down the country, he almost has to take a photo of a bus to see one.  It is not what is in Dublin.</p></speech>

As Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with responsibility for new market development, farm safety and research and innovation I welcome the measures that have come about this week in budget 2021.</p>  <p>  Given that fatal incidents on farms account for almost 50% of all workplace fatal incidents every year but agriculture accounts for only 6% of the overall workforce, it is simply not good enough to carry on as we have done to now.  As the first Minister of State with specific responsibility for farm safety I want to put safety at the heart of our farms and I want farmers to be centrally involved in how we do that.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Specific provision within the 2021 budgetary allocation for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will allow me to launch a call under the locally led European innovation partnership model that will be dedicated to farm safety.  This will see the provision of &euro;1 million in funding supports in a competitive locally led call for farm safety initiatives.  I see this as a significant step to driving a cultural change among farmers and I look forward to seeing the positive proposals that will drive that cultural change.  I am delighted with a &euro;14 million allocation for this project and to be able to announce that farm safety training will be an integral part of it.  The project will reach up to 50,000 farmers in the coming years.  The training will cover farm safety initiatives as well as the area of biodiversity.  This programme will be of a great benefit and will build on the 14,600 farmers who have already received significant farm safety training as part of their applications for support under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.</p> <p> I also particularly welcome the provision of &euro;18 million for TAMS, which will allow the delivery of commitments made under the scheme, including for specific farm safety measures such as: external agitation points for slurry tanks, sliding doors, handling equipment, rewiring and safety cages.  It should be remembered that the construction of new farm buildings also leads to improvements in farm safety in the farmyard as a wide range of safety measures must be incorporated while building a new animal house.  These include individual access to pens, securing pens and good ventilation and lighting, to name but a few.  Our farms and farmyards are working environments and we must continue to work together to make them safer.  Reductions in the rates of fatal and serious incidents on farms will only happen through changing behaviours, increasing awareness, training and investment in key farm safety measures.</p> <p> In addition, I welcome the increased budget allocation for the continued operation of the Department's competitive research funding programmes.  This will help to build and maintain research capacity and capability in research performing institutions, thereby enabling them to marshal the multidisciplinary expertise needed to undertake collaborative projects aimed at generating technology to tackle the climate, biodiversity and other challenges facing the agrifood and fisheries sector at this time.  The Department's research funding programme also plays a vital role in mobilising the expertise and skills needed to build Ireland's emerging bioeconomy to develop innovative bio-based alternatives to fossil derived products, often from waste products and by-products from conventional agriculture.  We will hear much more about that next week during Bioeconomy Ireland Week, in which I intend to play a central part because this is such a critical area which has major opportunities for the economy and the agriculture sector.</p> <p> I am announcing an increased allocation to Teagasc, the State agency providing research, advisory services and education on agriculture, horticulture, food and rural development.  The extra &euro;4 million for Teagasc will enable it to develop and roll out research to ensure our farmers are ready to answer the challenges of tomorrow's food markets.  That brings the total supports for Teagasc to &euro;147 million in 2021.  These increases bring the combined investment in research and innovation by the Department, Teagasc and the Marine Institute to over &euro;60 million annually, underlining the investment this Government is making in the future of the agrifood industry.</p> <p> I also highlight the provisions that have been made to tackle the challenges of Brexit, climate change and farm safety.  With the threat of Brexit hanging over everything, this budget provides the funding to enable us to further invest in the State agencies which support our agrifood industry, while also delivering for farm safety and allowing for extensive research into how we can best meet the challenges of biodiversity and the farm to fork strategy.  Food and beverage exports are worth &euro;14.5 billion annually to our economy.  They are a key driver of our agriculture sector and underpin our wider rural community and economy.  However, further and future success will depend on delivering premium markets in which we can build on our reputation for innovation, food safety and sustainability measures.  I am announcing an additional &euro;4 million for Bord Bia, which will bring its total grant to &euro;52.25 million.  We must continue to invest in establishing a premium position for our food and beverages in all markets across the world, as well as in the UK and Europe.  My ministerial colleagues and I are only too aware that we cannot currently travel to meet potential buyers but that extra allocation to Bord Bia will ensure we can continue to focus on gaining new market access for our key exports, as well as enhancing and retaining access to existing international markets.</p> <p> I will touch on the broad section of the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, for which my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, have fought.  In particular, I mention the &euro;96 million allocation for Horse Racing Ireland and R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, driving badly needed investment into key employers throughout rural Ireland.  There will also be significant welfare measures, and the funding will address the significant impact that Covid-19 and Brexit have had on the horse and greyhound sectors.  I welcome the &euro;1.5 million for the Irish Equine Centre, which badly needs an upgrade.  This was a commitment in the programme for Government.  I welcome the 25% increase in funding for Horse Sport Ireland, bringing the total allocation to &euro;5 million.</p> <p> I join my colleague, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in congratulating the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, on budgetary allocation secured for 2021.  Together, we will tackle the challenges that we expect 2021 will bring by investing in our future and in ourselves and by strengthening our export markets, all while preparing for a new Common Agricultural Policy and a greener future.  I commend this budget to the House.</p></speech>

It is the largest health budget increase in the history of the State and a clear signal of how seriously this Government takes public healthcare.  My three main priorities are improving access for patients, improving the healthcare experience for patients, and improving outcomes for patients.  The budget delivers on all three of those priorities.</p>  <p>  I will start with patient access.  I am allocating &euro;467 million to fund new hospital and community beds.  This includes increasing permanent critical care beds by 25% next year.  In our hospitals, I am allocating funding for an additional 1,146 acute and 135 sub-acute beds.  I am allocating funding for an additional 1,250 community care beds.  These are the biggest increases in modern times in critical care beds, acute beds and community care beds in one year.  Funding is being provided for an additional 16,000 healthcare workers.  This includes making permanent several thousand staff who were hired in response to Covid-19.  It also funds 7,000 staff in community settings and 4,000 staff in acute hospitals.  Acute beds will be staffed in accordance with the agreed safe staffing framework for nursing.</p>  <p>  The impact of this pandemic on levels of unmet need is a major concern for me.  For this reason, I have established an access to care fund of &euro;240 million.  Together with the funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, this will mean total funding of &euro;340 million will be available to tackle waiting lists next year.  Other funding includes access to diagnostics for GPs and I have allocated &euro;50 million for access to new drugs for patients.</p>  <p>  What of the patient experience?  I am allocating &euro;425 million for enhanced community and social care services.  The funding includes provision for a number of community care initiatives.  There will be an additional 5 million hours of home support next year to support hospital avoidance services and delayed discharges.  I am allocating an additional &euro;100 million to disability services.  This is the biggest single increase in allocation to the disability sector ever.  It is much needed and deserved and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be leading this work.  We are investing heavily in public health.  I have allocated funding to double the public health workforce, with an additional &euro;20 million for Healthy Ireland and &euro;15 million for the national drugs strategy, including homelessness.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, will be leading the work in these critical areas.</p>  <p>  My third priority is improving patient outcomes.  I have allocated &euro;159 million for nearly 2,000 additional staff to work directly in cancer services; maternity services; trauma care; paediatrics; ambulance services; fertility services; dementia care; and organ donation.  This includes advancing the national strategies in these areas.  We have fantastic clinical services and our clinicians have plans to make them even better.  This requires funding.  Cancer services will receive an additional &euro;32 million, including &euro;20 million for the national cancer strategy and &euro;12 million to help restart cancer services.  There is an allocation of &euro;6 million for trauma care, which will ensure that phase 1 of the development of a major trauma care centre in Dublin will commence.</p>  <p>  Women&rsquo;s health and our maternity services must get more attention.  In that context, I am delighted to announce an investment of &euro;12 million in our maternity strategy for next year.  This will be used to fund community-based midwifery services, specialist services and better access to allied health professional services and supports.  We will also open two new regional fertility hubs in Galway and Cork.  In addition, &euro;5 million is being allocated to the women&rsquo;s health task force.  I have also allocated &euro;50 million in funding to mental health services.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, will lead this vital work.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 also responds to Covid-19.  Some &euro;1.3 billion has been allocated to ensure personal protective equipment is available for those working across the health system and to continue to operate a comprehensive and nationwide testing and tracing system.  A further &euro;409 million is being provided for the extension of ongoing Covid-19 supports through next year.</p>  <p>  This year has been difficult, trying and, at times, heartbreaking for every individual and family in this country, none more so than for our healthcare workers, those working on the front line and those working behind the front line supporting what front-line workers do every day.</p> <p>Our doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, porters, cooks and everybody else working right across the system have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic.  While Covid-19 has highlighted major challenges in our health service, it has also highlighted our strengths, including the resilience, professionalism, courage and innovative spirit of our healthcare workers.  It has fast-tracked innovation across the system.  E-prescribing was rolled out in a few weeks.  Community assessment hubs were established.  The use of telemedicine has soared.  Times of huge challenge can also be times of opportunity.  While not the same issue and certainly not of the same scale, let us not forget that Britain's National Health Service was born out of the ashes of the Second World War.  Budget 2021 funds our Covid response.  It is also about building capacity, hiring staff and bringing positive, permanent change to our health service.  The investments made will mean that when the pandemic ends, Ireland will have a better and more resilient public healthcare system.  Budget 2021 is a big step on the road to universal healthcare, to our Sl&aacute;intecare vision, an Ireland where everyone can get the care they need when they need it.  I commend the budget to the House.</p></speech>

Business was thriving, caf&eacute;s were full and a ticket for a concert or a GAA final could not be got for love nor money.  What a difference a year makes.  Today there are no concerts, no bustling caf&eacute;s and in mid-October we still have not had a 2020 all-Ireland final.</p>  <p>  There is hope, however, and this budget provides hope, security and stability for those who need it.  The wage subsidy scheme has been extended throughout 2021, giving people the comfort of knowing there is no cliff edge looming on the horizon.  The &euro;222 million rescue package for arts, tourism and sports means that our musicians, artists and sports clubs will be able to weather this storm.  The new reduced VAT rate will help stimulate spending in pubs and restaurants such as Kenny's and the Lord Lucan, which I know have been feeling the full impact of Covid-19.  This budget delivers more jobs and better services, more healthcare workers, garda&iacute; and SNAs.</p>  <p>  The focus on climate change is a response to the reality of this grave threat ahead of us.  It is also a response to how people voted in the general election earlier this year.  The focus on housing is a response to the reality in which many families find themselves, and I am so pleased to see such a strong emphasis on delivering housing.  I welcome the historic investment in our healthcare service and am particularly pleased that new funding is not just in respect of Covid-19 but will deliver long-term change.  It means more hospital beds, healthcare workers and supports for carers, a groundbreaking &euro;100 million for disability services and an historic &euro;38 million investment in our mental health services at a time when we need it most.</p>  <p>  In just 77 days, the UK will leave the EU Single Market and customs union, and this budget prepares us for that.  Brexit supports worth &euro;350 million show how forward-thinking we have been in Brexit-proofing Ireland.  The budget protects lives and livelihoods.  However, last night's announcement of further restrictions for the country has come as a shock to many, and in light of that news we need to remain positive and have hope that the outcome will far outweigh our struggles.  We need hope that one day we will be back inside a bustling caf&eacute;, we will get to go to another music festival and we Dubliners will get to hear the roar on Hill 16 again.  Without hope we have nothing, and this budget gives us that hope.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-10-15a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020101500029#DD00300"><p>What we have witnessed in the budget is an attempt to pay lip service to the effort that is required to address the single biggest issue affecting the Defence Forces, that is, the retention of personnel, many of whom have been subjected to intensive and expensive training programmes to high levels of skill.  The loss of even one of these skilled personnel can have a significant effect.  Witness the recent inability of the <i>L&Eacute; Eithne</i>to conduct a patrol due to the illness of one single communications officer.  Amid the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, when we will rightly applaud the service, sacrifice and selflessness of our front-line heroes, let us not forget that the rank and file of our Defence Forces will be on that front line, primed, ready and willing, like all our front-line staff, to serve in the interests of the citizens of the State.</p><p>The Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, has previously indicated in the House that he is open-minded on the issue of association with ICTU.  I ask and encourage him to proceed to lay the groundwork for that to occur and to offer the members of our Defence Forces a meaningful gesture to show that gratitude can mean more than platitude.  The pay and allowances outlined in Tuesday's budget were scheduled increases under existing agreements.  While I welcome the extension and increase of the seagoing naval personnel tax credit from &euro;1,270 to &euro;1,500, this goes nowhere near the need that must be met in order to retain personnel.</p><p>Although the extra funding for capital spending is inadequate to meet the totality of the needs of the Defence Forces, I welcome the increase in capital spending.  It is fair to say there are some types of military equipment more in need of repair and replacement than others.  The citizens of this country have enough to cope with at the minute without having to dodge falling helicopter doors.  We are left with the inescapable feeling in the aftermath of this budget that the Government concerns itself more with the durability of military equipment than with the welfare of the men and women who make up the ranks of the Defence Forces.</p><p>Again the Government has completely failed to live up to its responsibilities to members of the Defence Forces on the issue of exposure to dangerous chemicals, including Lariam.  The continuing failure of the Department to furnish former members of the Defence Forces with documentation relating to the issue, which it has been ordered to do by the courts, raises serious questions.  I put the Minister for Defence on notice that I will make sure that this issue is not allowed to be swept under the carpet.</p><p>I welcome the additional &euro;30 million being allocated in the budget to overseas development aid.  The work to bring our ODA budget towards the target of 0.7% of gross national income by 2030 must continue and that target must be met.  A combination of Covid-19, the continuing effects of climate change and political instability has disproportionately impacted many poorer nations.  Ireland's upcoming role on the UN Security Council behoves our nation to provide an example of moral leadership in the world.  The Government must back its financial commitment to ODA with the kind of political action the global stage demands of it.</p><p>The Government must recognise the State of Palestine.</p><p>I call on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy O'Gorman, to outline the detail of how he will proceed to utilise the extra funding he has received in the budget to fulfil Ireland's moral obligation to offer assistance to the victims of the fire at the Moria refugee camp.  Up until this point we have failed to live up to our obligations and commitments, particularly in bringing over unaccompanied minors.  In 2015, we committed to bring over 36 unaccompanied minors and to date we have brought over a mere nine.  This funding is therefore welcome but, more important, it must be spent to ensure that those vulnerable citizens who are caught in refugee camps like Moria are brought here, something to which we have already committed.</p></speech>

We face the double whammy, indeed we are in the middle of it, of Covid-19 and Brexit, possibly a no-deal Brexit, but the budget falls short of what is needed to respond to this double whammy.</p> <p>While there are some positive measures which Sinn F&eacute;in has looked for over the years, such as the equalisation of tax measures for the self-employed, funding for deep retrofitting of homes and extra money for health, it simply did not address many key areas sufficiently.</p> <p> A massive increase in the capacity of our health services was needed.  The big spend on it is welcome but health services and hospitals are under capacity, not just to deal with the pandemic but also to improve non-Covid services.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in put forward the case for a minimum of 100 extra ICU beds and &euro;38 million for extra home care hours.  Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise has two permanent ICU beds.  Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore has six beds for a population of 200,000.  That just does not do it.  We have only half of the EU average across the State and in that part of the country we have approximately one sixth of the EU average.  Only 60 extra ICU beds are promised.</p> <p> Critically, we set out to improve mental health services at this time and looked for an additional &euro;49 million.  Only &euro;38 million, however, was allocated.  If I heard him correctly, the Minister of State with responsibility for agriculture said more than &euro;90 million has been allocated for racehorse owners but &euro;38 million was allocated for mental health.</p> <p> Sustaining businesses and workers during the crisis and expanding employment as we emerge from it is crucial.  Many workers, however, face income cuts and hardship and reduced rates of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and wage subsidy scheme.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in want restoration of the top rate of that payment for those earning over &euro;300.  That is absolutely crucial.</p> <p> We also wanted special measures to tackle youth unemployment, including an additional &euro;74 million to expand the national apprenticeship training scheme, which we welcome is there.  Over one third of our young people are unemployed.  We also need to develop their skills for rebuilding the economy as we emerge from this.  It is very important and I urge the Minister of State to bring this back to Government.  We need to ramp up the number of apprentices we have so that we can build that economic recovery.</p> <p> The rates waiver for businesses should have been extended until next June.  Instead, it ends on 31 December.  We need significant grants for SMEs.  Radical measures are also needed to support the hospitality sector and we proposed a straightforward voucher scheme of &euro;200 for every adult and &euro;100 for children.  This has worked well in some other jurisdictions and we should learn from the best practice in those.</p> <p> The Government failed to grasp the housing crisis.  It is with regret I say this to the Minister of State.  The Government allocated only &euro;110 million in total for affordable housing to rent and buy.  We put forward a package for &euro;1.1 billion to provide 4,000 affordable homes and 4,000 cost rental homes.  In Laois-Offaly and its outlier, for example, a couple or family who earn more than &euro;500 cannot get on the housing waiting list, and if they earn less than &euro;800 or &euro;850, they cannot get a mortgage.  These people are trapped in private rented accommodation until thy kingdom come.  Approximately 140 years after the Land League, these people have no security of tenure and no security on rent.  People have not got fixed rent, no security of tenure and no hope of ever owning.  Those were the three demands of Michael Davitt and the Land League 140 years ago, yet here we are today, in what is supposed to be the national Parliament, and I am saying this to the Minister of State.  The situation as it is only suits big landlords.  This is very important.  We need cost rentals in south Kildare and the Minister of State knows this.  He should try to rent in Monasterevin.  We need cost rentals in Laois, Mountmellick, Rathdowney and Portlaoise and in towns like Tullamore, Birr, Edenderry and Clara.  We need those cost rentals because a whole cohort of families are absolutely nailed to the cross trying to meet the cost of private rented accommodation out of one weeks' wages every week.  These people have no security of tenure and no security on rent.  This has been raised consistently here over the past five years and we cannot continue ignoring it.</p> <p> We welcome some of the positive measures in the budget.  Overall, however, it was a missed opportunity by the Government to sustain workers and families in employment and address those crucial issues in housing but also to address the issue of ICU beds.  I fear for this going into the winter.  We simply do not have enough of them.  We welcome the 60 extra beds but that will not do it.  We need more than that.  We also need to address the areas of childcare and disability.</p></speech>

Many things were said and some of us are still poring over what it all means.  It means finally, we as a Government are making policies which strengthen businesses, encourage personal climate action and safeguard the status of the most vulnerable.  After years of austerity, it is heartening to see budget 2021 become the largest investment in the history of the State.  It might have surprised people but it is the right thing to do.  We need to make sure we can face the challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit by giving people hope based on realism and a plan.  I am heartened to see massive investment in health, housing and education.</p>  <p>  The 9% VAT rate will help hotels, pubs, restaurants and other businesses in the entertainment, tourism and hospitality sectors.  That was something I actively lobbied for and am delighted to see in County Carlow.  I have brought it up several times with Ministers.  I received hundreds of representations on it and I am delighted to see this now has been committed to and done.  We are delighted that commitment has been given.</p>  <p>  The extension of the commercial rates will help reduce the fixed cost of doing business.  It was an issue I also brought to Ministers running up to the budget.  I especially welcome the &euro;10 million set aside for the IDA to develop advance factories in industrial estates for companies seeking to invest in Ireland, especially outside of Dublin, and the &euro;30 million ring-fenced for a call to regional enterprise centres for initiatives to create jobs in every region in the country.  This is important for me and for counties Carlow and Kilkenny.  I always said as a councillor and a Senator that I believe rural Ireland and the smaller towns like Carlow need visits from the IDA.  We now have a chance.  We can now bring investment to the rural towns such as Carlow and Kilkenny.  We can now give people jobs they really want.  I will work on this for my constituents and the people I represent to do my best to ensure I create jobs in my area.</p>  <p>  The news that &euro;38 million will be allocated under Sharing the Vision, our national mental health strategy, is important.  I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, spoke earlier.  Mental health, now more than ever, is important and we need to make sure we deliver on and increase the existing services.  We also want to make sure they are easier to access and that families who need them can do so.</p>  <p>  This budget is the definition of housing for all.  With a &euro;3.3 billion spend on housing, it is the highest investment in housing by any Government in a single year.  The &euro;65 million to facilitate energy efficient improvements to social housing homes and the &euro;60 million to adapt the homes of up to 10,700 older people and people with a disability are important.  I face these issues every day with people coming into my offices or ringing.  People are living longer.  We need to make sure they get these grants quickly, that they are not waiting for a long time and that there is no red tape, as I would say.</p>  <p>  The main thing about this budget and the one I must focus on is that all this money we have, which is great to see, is easily accessible.  Therefore, no matter what area a person is in, he or she should be able to access this money for whatever reason, be it for housing, a business or through the HSE.  If people are looking for funding in whatever areas we work on, we need to make sure we can get the money to those areas as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Another area that has been spoken about, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, is domestic abuse.  I welcome &euro;400,000 extra funding for organisations and groups responding to the increased service and demand.  Again, getting the money into these areas quickly is important.</p>  <p>  I welcome preserving the qualifying age of 66 for the State pension with the legislation that will be implemented in January.  I have been contacted by and spoken to many pensioners who have expressed disappointment that they did not get an increase.  We need to look at that going forward as they felt they had been forgotten in this budget.  I also welcome the &euro;5 increase in the living alone allowance, which I feel is a great help.</p>  <p>  The &euro;50 million in the live entertainment supports and the Arts Council funding, an increase of up to &euro;130 million, again, is important.</p>  <p>  I am aware previous contributors have spoken about farmers.  They are a priority and we must always remember that during recessions, farmers play a huge role in keeping our country going.</p> <p>They play a massive part in getting us through recessions and it is so important now that we look after our farmers.  I welcome the creation of the role of food ombudsman.  We need to ensure we look after those who have looked after us, our farming sector in particular.  We need to ensure funding gets to all of the different areas.</p> <p> Another area on which I spoke to people was the childcare sector.  Again, there was a little bit of disappointment on their part because they felt they had been forgotten.  We need to ensure we look at our childcare sector and see what we can do to help those involved in it.  With Covid-19 it is a different time, so all of us working together need to ensure we support our childcare sector and I have said that to them.</p> <p> I have spoken to some third level students.  They are absolutely delighted with the &euro;250 once-off payment.  That is important because students have not been able to work during the summer and they have not had any work.  This gives them a little boost and it is a boost for their families.  I will have to get the times when they are going to get their payment.  Working with the Minister, Deputy Harris, I will make sure I do that.</p> <p> In the health sector, I compliment NPHET, the Ministers and everyone who has played a great part.  Covid-19 has been exceptional for all of us.  We are all listening to the news and the figures are rising and we are all concerned.  Today there are more restrictions.  It is a case of all of us working together.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, spoke about testing.  Testing and tracing and the quickness of it is so important.  All of us need to play our part and work together.  With this exceptional budget we can make a change to people's lives.  All of us working together, no matter what parties we are in, can ensure that in the next few months we will, we hope, be back to what we call normality and our normal lives as soon as possible.</p> <p> A lady who rang me today about a grant said that, since Covid, she has seen that families have grown closer together.  Things are changing and life is changing.  No one could ever have thought Covid was coming and none of us was ready for it, but a lot of us have seen changes in some ways.  We can see the good in the Irish people coming out.  It is great that we are all trying to play our part and this budget will make huge changes to people's lives, and that is what we need to do.  We need to ensure we give everyone we can the best quality of life they deserve.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in would have done it differently and we set out how last Friday when we published our alternative budget ahead of the Government's budget.  We would have built up greater capacity in our health services and, critically, we would have started to work to rebuild our country in a better, stronger and fairer way.  Budget day saw no relief for people who saw their PUP cut.  It saw no relief for renters and nothing delivered for families paying the highest childcare costs in Europe.  In fact, for motorists who cannot afford to go green, we saw increased costs by means of the increased carbon tax the Government announced.</p>  <p>  There was a much-trumpeted increase in the arts budget, but is it a once-off, a Covid contingency?  If it is, then that is welcome, but that also means that it will evaporate this time next year and we will be back to a much-underfunded arts budget once again.  The &euro;50 million for the live events sector depends mainly on restrictions being lifted to allow live events to go ahead again and would mainly benefit the very large companies capable of carrying out large, socially distanced Covid-ready events.  It is a welcome boost for those who work in that sector and who were facing going to the wall without some support.  I am not denying that.</p>  <p>  However, there is nothing in this budget to help the thousands of artists and live entertainment workers whose PUP remains cut and who are dependent on the original temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, which was also cut.  These are workers whose mortgage arrears are building, whose utility bills are piling up unpaid and who have no work and none likely in the near future.  They are not allowed to work and the Government reduced the supports for them at that very time.  What does that say?  Many of these workers will find themselves even worse off than they were on Monday, possibly even cut off from the tax warehousing and Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which were announced, putting them even more on the back foot.  Clarity is needed for those workers and an emergency hardship fund needs to be established to ensure funding and supports get to where they are needed and needed most.</p>  <p>  I leith na Gaeilge, n&iacute; bheadh m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilgeoir&iacute; ag gear&aacute;n faoi airgead breise a bheith caite ar an nGaeilge n&oacute; ar an nGaeltacht.

The total budgetary package announced this week came to in excess of &euro;17.75 billion.  Budget 2021 represents the largest investment in the history of the State.  The budget deficit for 2020 will be around &euro;21.5 billion and next year it will be about &euro;20.5 billion.  The national debt level for 2020 will be around &euro;219 billion.  The words "shock and awe" come to mind, but this unprecedented budget is absolutely the right one for these unprecedented times.  Covid-19 and Brexit, be it deal or no deal, pose a real threat to livelihoods and to our economy generally.  The budget is rightly based on the assumptions of there being no EU-UK trade deal and that the virus will be around for all of next year.  For the first time in many years, the budget has been broadly welcomed by a wide range of interest groups, and that is noteworthy.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;4 billion extra has been made to the Department of Health.  The budget provides for an additional 1,146 acute beds.  Currently, there are around 11,000 acute beds in place.  In addition, a permanent increase in adult critical care beds, from 255 pre-Covid to 321 by the end of 2021, will be delivered.  As the second wave of Covid-19 gets under way, it is vitally important we have enough capacity in our ICUs.</p> <p>People are genuinely concerned about the situation and want to be assured there will be an ICU bed for them if they need it.  The progress made in the budget is most welcome but this investment needs to continue in future budgets.  Currently, Ireland has fewer than six ICU beds per 1,000 population; the European average is 11.5.  The Irish Medical Organisation is calling for 550 intensive care and critical care beds to be provided.  Some reports have indicated that approximately 580 permanent ICU beds are needed.  ICU beds are expensive.  They must be accompanied by highly specialised staff, including anaesthetists and critical care nurses.  I am pleased that approximately &euro;1.8 million has been provided for the training and education of the staff who are needed.</p> <p> I understand negotiations are taking place with private hospitals for an additional 130 ICU beds to increase our surge capacity.  This is the correct approach.  The wholesale takeover of the private hospitals earlier this year was, in hindsight, a mistake and caused a lot of problems throughout the health service generally.  In the weeks and months ahead, we need to continue with non-Covid procedures and have ICU capacity to facilitate this.  ICU capacity in the acute hospital system must be increased for the long term.</p> <p> I refer to foreign direct investment, FDI, and multinational companies.  We hear talk of a K-shaped economic recovery whereby the multinationals continue to grow while the domestic economy has collapsed.  FDI is an essential component of the Irish economic model and it has worked very well for us since the 1960s.  Multinationals employ approximately 250,000 people and they pay 79% of all corporation tax.  Multinational employees pay 45% of all income tax receipts.  We are very fortunate that income tax and corporation tax have held up well despite Covid-19.  In 2020, just under &euro;7.5 billion was received in corporation tax receipts.  This revenue has been vital in paying for the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in in its alternative budget proposed to take &euro;720 million in corporation taxes from multinational companies.  This is a most unwise proposal.  These companies do not have to locate in Ireland and instead they must be encouraged and supported.  The OECD recently proposed a new global maximum tax rate for multinational companies.  This is the so-called pillar 2 reform.  Reform of corporation tax is needed and the OECD is the place to deal with this at a global level.  No doubt this process will pose problems for Ireland but we can respond to these challenges in a pragmatic way as the situation unfolds.</p> <p> I welcome the proposals brought forward in the budget on education.  There will be a further reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level by one point, providing from more than 390 mainstream teaching posts in addition to the more than 265 posts being recruited for to meet pressures throughout primary and post-primary levels.  This is most welcome.  The allocation for education in 2021 is an unprecedented &euro;8.9 billion.</p> <p> I also want to refer to the housing budget outlined earlier this week.  An additional &euro;500 million is being directed towards capital expenditure.  This will facilitate the construction of 9,500 new social housing units in 2021.  A total of 12,750 units will be added to the social housing stock, including leased units.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, well in his endeavours.  As I have said previously, he has hit the ground running.  There are concerns about how long it takes for proposals to be sanctioned by the Department and I know he is dealing with this issue.  I also welcome the fact that a practical affordable housing scheme, whereby people can fill out their application forms and apply for specific housing units, will be announced in the coming weeks.  Certainly during the recent general election the big issues were housing, health and education.  These three areas have been given significant attention in the budget and I have no doubt progress will be made as a result of the allocations made in budget 2021.</p></speech>

This is where we are at present.  The one thing we need to ensure is that we have the capacity to deal with the problems we are about to face.  We have all had many discussions on ICU capacity.  I have a fear the budget just does not give what is absolutely necessary.  I accept we are not starting in a good place.  We are actually starting from behind.  This is something that will have to be addressed soon.</p>  <p>  We have also had multiple conversations about test, trace and isolate.  Even today, we have an issue with air travel.  It is necessary that we put in place the capacity at test, trace and isolate level and that we look into various means of rapid testing being part of the system alongside PCR testing to deal with some of the shortfalls.  We have all heard many anecdotal stories about people not being contacted for six days, during which time they did not realise they had been in contact with somebody with Covid-19.  The impact of this is that we are dealing with the large numbers of cases we have throughout the island.  We need to put a structure together that can attack this problem.  It is as simple as that.</p>  <p>  I also call on the Government moves not only to deal with the traffic light system for air travel but also, alongside the airport and even the airlines, though some of them have their own sins at this point in time, to come up with systems that do not impact on our community testing regime.  We need this connectivity as an island nation.  It is as simple as that.</p>  <p>  With regard to housing and the budget, the truth will be in the telling, which will simply be when there is a reduction in council housing waiting lists and people being able to get an adequate supply of affordable mortgages or affordable cost rentals.  We have to look at all of this.  It is as simple as that.  We have stated we believe the proposals are insufficient but it is all about building houses.  We are talking about council-led house building..</p>  <p>  I have talked about the necessity for capacity across the board in the health sector.  There are difficulties in nursing homes.  I will use this opportunity to ask once again that the Minister and the Government consider the point of view of the families who during the pandemic lost 22 people in Dealgan House in Dundalk.  A recent freedom of information request revealed damning stories.  A document stated the situation was critical with 71 residents completely dehydrated and that there was a risk of renal failure after one or two days of dehydration.</p> <p>It went on to state that on 17 April, Dealgan House could not deal with the basic care of patients.  Something dreadful happened here and we need to ensure it will not happen again.  We need answers for the families.</p></speech>

I will speak particularly about three different groups of workers in a struggle, the first of whom are the Debenhams workers.  They have now been involved in a dispute with their former employer for more than six months, since they were thrown on the scrapheap in a tactical insolvency.  Incidentally, it was a tactical insolvency that the company was able to carry out because of the failure of the previous Government to implement the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report.</p>  <p>  Since then, the workers have mounted effective pickets and protests, fighting for what they are owed and for what had previously been agreed with Debenhams, namely, a redundancy package of two weeks per year of service on top of the statutory requirement of two weeks.  There is more than enough stock to pay for that redundancy with a substantial amount left over but KPMG, the liquidator, refuses to pay that and, instead, made an offer that was extremely insulting for the workers a month ago.  That offer was rejected by all the shop stewards, and KPMG then withdrew it but refused to come back to the negotiating table.  Incredibly, KPMG brought the workers to court on Tuesday, where it was awarded an injunction against effective picketing by them.</p>  <p>  The Debenhams dispute has always been a struggle for all workers, because it is about how workers are treated, the ability of companies to get away without paying their debts to workers and who will pay the price for the coronavirus crisis.  That is even more the case now because the dispute is about the right of workers to wage and engage in effective picketing.  The workers have, in effect, been told they cannot engage in effective picketing.  The problems with the Industrial Relations Acts, which need to be repealed, are being exposed in this dispute.  It is vital, therefore, that the entire trade movement and workers in general stand behind the Debenhams workers, continue to engage in effective picketing and refuse to allow the stock to leave the stores because it is simply the only leverage they have.</p>  <p>  I have a warning for the Government.  If KPMG follows through and attempts to use that injunction to prevent effective picketing, workers - most likely mothers and grandmothers - will be sent to prison, probably in the next week or two, because they refuse to be treated this way by KPMG and Debenhams.  The Taoiseach has stated repeatedly that Debenhams, as a company, has treated its workers shoddily.  If the workers end up in jail because of the Government's refusal to put any pressure on KPMG to come back to the negotiating table and to make a serious offer, the workers who are put in prison will feel themselves treated very shoddily by the Government, and there will be a substantial political price to pay.</p>  <p>  The second group of workers is those at DAA, formerly Dublin Airport Authority.  The 130 craft workers rejected overwhelmingly, by more than 85%, a proposal for supposedly new ways of working.  These "new ways of working" are a euphemism for getting rid of demarcation and dramatically changing the workers' rosters, which would effectively double the numbers of weekends and overnights they have to work without getting any allowances for any of that work, such as for being on call or for overtime.  The workers were correct to reject this proposal but the response of this semi-State company was outrageous.  It put the workers on 60% time, not even over three days a week but spread over five days so that the workers cannot claim unemployment benefit for the days they do not work.  I praise the workers for rejecting that deal and standing up to a bullying campaign by management.  I support them in their struggle to refuse to accept this or to allow the company, in the words of one of the managers, "to end the unions at Dublin Airport", because I think that is the intention.</p>  <p>  Finally, I express my support for school secretaries.  They are vital at any time for the running of our schools but at this time, in particular, their importance is being demonstrated.  The discrimination against the vast majority of school secretaries who are not directly employed by the Department of Education and Skills is quite outrageous.  The workers earn &euro;12,700 per year and have to sign on for the summer.  It is simply unacceptable and all of them should be directly employed by the Department.</p></speech>

Testing has been an absolute dog's dinner and the State needs a plan for aviation for many reasons, including connectivity, regional balance, employment and climate.  There are huge groups of workers and areas affected.  The airlines themselves, maintenance and repair, leasing and tourism are all dependent on our aviation sector and our connectivity.  The sector has been failed by this Government at the July stimulus and at budget 2021.  I call on the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to get testing and tracing right at our airports immediately and to include the aviation sector in a meaningful way in the national economic plan.</p></speech>

It will affect 155 staff at Shannon and Cork airports.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection must ensure these workers are assisted promptly so they are not waiting weeks if they have to sign on as a result of the announcement.  As the Minister is aware, the mid-west region and my constituency of Limerick City are hugely dependent economically on the connectivity afforded by Shannon Airport.  Over 55,000 jobs are dependent on a viable airport in the region.  While the Ryanair decision is a blow, it is not unpredicted.  Dr. Catriona Cahill, chief economist with Limerick Chamber, said on "Morning Ireland" this morning that the Government must intervene now to provide supports and guidance.  The Government has committed &euro;5 million to the airport.  Does the Minister not realise it is far too little and far too late?  The ship sailed months ago.  We need proactive and prompt action from the Government, but instead we are getting a reactive response that merely applies a plaster to a gaping wound.</p></speech>

Cork Airport is Ireland's second busiest and best connected international airport, which resulted in it being the fastest growing airport in Ireland in 2019.  Why has this Government not stepped in before the situation was left to fester?  What is the Government's plan to rescue Cork Airport, its employees and Cork's economy?</p></speech>

It is a huge blow for workers, for the airports themselves and for the mid-west and southern regions.  It is a massive blow for business and for tourism connectivity.  The Government has signed up to the EU traffic light system for a safe return to air travel but we must now formally adopt this policy and, more importantly, implement it in full.  It is abundantly clear we need to introduce pre-departure testing and rapid testing at our airports and ports.  After all, we are an island nation and 140,000 people work in the aviation sector.  Therefore, we must follow the lead of other European countries and introduce a pre-departure testing regime.  Representatives of Shannon Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, told the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks last week that they are in a position to bring about these testing facilities at our airports and it will be done with a private contractor.</p></speech>

Before Covid-19, Cork Airport was Ireland's fastest growing airport and in the face of Brexit and the Covid-19 crisis, now is the time to build Cork Airport up and position Cork as a counterbalance to Dublin.  Without an airport, this is impossible so we need the Minister's support.  The spin about this week's budget was focused on pro-jobs and pro-business but today we heard that 70 people directly employed by Ryanair, 1,900 directly employed by the airport and over 10,000 employed in the wider area will be affected by this closure.  It is devastating news.  What will the Government do to step in and support Cork and Shannon airports?</p></speech>

So far we have relied on polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing.  It is the gold standard but the WHO accepts antigen testing can be used when PCR testing cannot be used.  Will the Government look at rapid testing and will that be antigen testing or PCR testing?  In any event, will the Minister outline what steps are being taken to ensure there is a protocol agreed across the EU on testing so Irish passengers who have been tested are accepted in the country they arrive in?</p></speech>

There are over 10,000 people whose employment relies either directly or indirectly on it and I have been contacted by many of those people, including people working as baggage handlers, for shops and for different businesses connected to the airport.  They are very worried.</p>  <p>  For the region as a whole, if we are serious about Cork being the fastest growing city in the State and the island over the next 20 or 30 years, we need to have a viable international airport with serious international connectivity.  There are serious concerns for the future and the connectivity of the airport off the back of this.  It is clear the testing regime is a big problem here.  We have not been able to get a handle on it.  A lot of time was lost over the summer and we need to get this right now and to ensure these airports get back on an even keel as soon as possible because they are crucial for regional development and for all the jobs that rely upon them.</p></speech>

I have raised the issue with him on numerous occasions but every time I come back into this House on this matter it is with further bad news.  This is seen as being directly down to the apathy from the Minister and his Department.  On Tuesday, there was a commitment to additional capital funding for Shannon and Cork airports and a commitment to sign up to the EU traffic light system and here we are, just 48 hours later, waking up to this bad news.  We cannot continue to allow our international airport in Shannon to be failed time and again.  We need action from the Government to address the issues in Shannon and ensure we have an airport on the other side of the pandemic and we need such action now.  The workers and staff at Shannon Airport need certainty and assurances for there to be any kind of confidence at this time.</p></speech>

I will set out what I want from the Minister.  First, in terms of the Limerick and Shannon region, Shannon Airport is vital to connectivity.  We accept that we are going through a pandemic.  When will the Government bring in the new traffic light system that has been passed by the European Commission?  We want to see that implemented in full.  When will it be implemented?  Second, testing is coming front and centre in terms of the way airlines and airports operate.  Where do we stand on a proper rapid testing system for airports in Ireland?  We all accept we are in a pandemic.  However, the airline business employs 140,000 people.  We are an island nation and we need connectivity.</p> <p>We must think outside the box.  I will conclude by asking a question about the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, which does fantastic work.  Have we now reached the point where its remit needs to be broadened and do we need to bring in experts in testing?  The Minister might reply to those matters.</p></speech>

We need international connectivity and our aviation sector so I thank the Deputies for raising the issue.</p>  <p>  Ryanair's decision to close its bases at Cork and Shannon airports for the winter is very disappointing.  Unfortunately, the closure of these bases is part of a wider decision by Ryanair to cut capacity on its flights right across Europe.  We should note today that Ryanair is also closing its Toulouse base for the winter and making significant base aircraft cuts in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Portugal and Vienna.  Indeed, given the low forward booking rates to the end of this year being experienced by airlines right across Europe, this development is not entirely unexpected.  According to the latest Eurocontrol data, these reductions in services are consistent with trends across Europe as we head into the winter season.  In the circumstances, most airlines are now reducing capacity and Ryanair is no different, although it remains the busiest carrier.</p>  <p>  This is, of course, a commercial decision for Ryanair and it is understood that the airline will continue to serve Cork and Shannon airports, although with fewer destinations served and reduced frequencies.  The Government recognises that today's news will be a blow to staff at Cork and Shannon airports, Ryanair staff and other affected workers, and the wider regions involved.  Cork and Shannon airports have excellent management teams in place and are doing all that is possible in difficult circumstances.  The efforts made by staff and management to date are acknowledged and fully appreciated by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Government is fully alert to the devastating impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on international travel and appreciates and acknowledges the important role of Ryanair and Shannon and Cork airports to the economies of the mid-west and south regions, respectively.  While it is often said, it is worth repeating that as an island nation Ireland is particularly dependent on air connectivity, both socially and economically.  Aviation plays a critical role in our economy.  Cork and Shannon airports are key players in delivering high-quality international connectivity in their respective regions.  The Government fully recognises this and is committed to ensuring that both airports are well positioned to aid our recovery and continue to play their parts in maintaining Ireland's core strategic connectivity into the future.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is expected that it will be some time before it is possible to permit a large-scale return to air travel.  The Government is committed to ensuring appropriate supports are in place to allow the aviation sector to maintain the necessary core capability to maintain strategic connectivity and respond quickly when circumstances allow.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 included a provision of &euro;10 million to help to address the challenges facing Cork and Shannon airports.  This is in addition to the &euro;6.1 million in emergency funding provided to Shannon Airport in June this year to complete a safety and security project.</p>  <p>  Airports generally, as well as the airlines, will continue to benefit from the economy-wide support measures that the Government put in place at the beginning of the pandemic for companies of all sizes, including those in the aviation sector.  Companies can avail of grants, low-cost loans, waivers of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.  Larger companies, including those in the aviation sector, can apply for liquidity support through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund.  Ryanair and airports around the country, including those at Cork and Shannon, have been able to avail of some of those measures, in particular the Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, the Covid-19 unemployment payment, the commercial rates waiver and deferred tax liabilities.</p>  <p>  The Government has agreed to adopt the EU traffic light system for international travel and a decision on how we are going to implement this new system is expected to be taken at a Cabinet meeting next Tuesday.  As it has in the past, the Government will seek to ensure an appropriate balance between allowing travel and protecting public health.  The goal is to give airlines and the travelling public certainty as to what they need to do to be able to travel.</p>  <p>  While the decision by Ryanair to close its bases at Cork and Shannon airports for the winter is a commercial decision, it is hoped that the measures already put in place by the Government, from which Ryanair has benefited, and the further measures being considered as part of our response to the coronavirus pandemic will help all players in the aviation sector to return to growth in the not too distant future.</p></speech>

We have for months been listening to a debate about what are false negative and false positive Covid-19 tests and the performance of different diagnostic assays.  There are international examples.  The DAA is ready to go with 15,000 tests a day.  What are the Minister and the Government doing in that regard?</p>  <p>  The game has changed around aviation.  There is an opportunity for the State to step in and deliver a strategic future for the sector which would make a significant difference to tourism, connectivity and the climate.

With almost 90% of routes going to Dublin Airport, would he not accept that Shannon Airport, as a stand-alone airport, is one of those strategic issues that needs to be addressed?</p>  <p>  The return of Shannon Airport to the DAA umbrella needs to happen and while it will not be a panacea for all the airport's problems, and nobody has ever said that, it would be a first step in addressing some of the issues at the airport.  The wrong political decision was taken in 2012 and I call again on the Minister to reverse the decision.  The ball is in his court and it is time to get into the game on this issue.</p></speech>

I welcome the traffic light system.  In my opening contribution, I did not mention any airline but did mention Cork Airport three times.  It has 12,000 employees and Cork's economy is worth &euro;900 million.  The Minister mentioned Cork Airport in his reply but I am disappointed that he did not address those other issues.  What do we go back and tell the 12,000 people affected about what will happen to their jobs next week?  What do we do with Cork city and county councils?  Where are they going to find the &euro;900 million they have lost this year?  What will the Government do to replace that money?</p></speech>

Shannon Airport sustains 46,000 jobs, directly and indirectly.  It is more than just an airport.  We need to rebuild confidence in air travel, as we are doing by signing up to the EU traffic light system.  We need to implement that system in full.  I want to hear what the Minister has to say about introducing a testing system at Shannon Airport and our other airports because until we do that, we will not rebuild that confidence.</p></speech>

The airport is vital for the region and the economies of Cork and the wider region.  Will the Minister and the Government consider measures to support Cork and Shannon airports?

If not, when will he do so?  I welcome the fact that the Minister will bring in the European traffic light system.  When will it be implemented?  Will the Minister be looking at providing State support for strategic routes?  There is no Aer Lingus route from Shannon to Heathrow at the moment.  To reiterate, has the Minister met representatives of Ryanair and Aer Lingus?  If not, when will he do so?  Will he put in place State supports for strategic routes?</p></speech>

It seemed as if the Minister was asking, "What can we do?".  That is not good enough.  An awful lot of jobs are relying on the industry.  Entire regions look to these airports as crucial to their futures.</p>  <p>  Aviation is not like other businesses.  We are not talking about a factory in Cork or Shannon that might be difficult to relocate.  Once those aeroplanes are gone, there is no guarantee that they will ever come back to Cork or Shannon.  There is no guarantee that these routes will ever be based out of these airports.  We need to hear a vision from the Minister.  We need a vision for the future of aviation and testing is at the heart of it.</p></speech>

It is an important part of the solution.  It is what we need to do and I hope we get agreement in Cabinet next week.  Agreement was reached on Tuesday in the European General Affairs Council on the European approach.  As we discussed at the committee last week, it left it to national governments to decide what approach they would take.</p><p>I will seek support from the Government for the introduction of a testing regime which will allow passengers coming into this country to waive the restriction of movements rules that apply at the current time.  Currently people flying in from countries on the red or amber list are subject to a two-week restriction of movements.  That is a real impediment and difficulty for a lot of the airlines and others, including people travelling.  Having a testing regime will address a lot of those difficulties and will, it is to be hoped, give people confidence to be able to fly and know it is safe.  </p><p>In respect of the debate here with the public health authorities, I have said this will give us better public health outcomes.  Currently, approximately 15,000 people a day are travelling in and out of our airports.  We are supposedly monitoring their restriction of movements, but it is not possible to do that.  Therefore, we do not have as much control in the current system as we would have if we had a proper testing system.  </p><p>I would like to see a range of different testing systems.  To be honest, we will have to be cognisant of the WHO, ECDC and the European Union, which is working on this as we speak, in terms of which testing systems will be validated.  Our intention is to introduce a similar validation system to that in other countries which will allow us to achieve better public health outcomes so passengers do not have to restrict their movements for two weeks on arrival in Ireland. </p><p>In answer to Deputy O'Rourke, testing could be done at the airports or in other locations in advance of people flying into Ireland.  The current PCR system used in Germany, for example, allows a test to be carried out 72 hours in advance of travelling and has a certification system which allows it to accept passengers into the country. </p><p>As Deputies have said, the DAA has done significant work in that regard to try to make sure it would have the capacity for testing in a way that would not impede or affect the national capacity for testing for coronavirus.  This is a screening rather than a diagnostic system.  There are different testing regimes. </p><p>In regard to Deputy Quinlivan, the issue of whether Shannon returns to the DAA is a separate issue to the immediate problem we have in respect of Ryanair in Shannon and Cork.  The Seanad debated the issue and our reply to that is not ruling out certain measures.  There are difficulties.  Such a move will not address the strategic issues we have to address in Shannon.  It is not something the Government is saying &quot;No&quot; to explicitly.  Rather, it is separate to the issue we are facing today.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Buckley that the airport is important for the region.  The reason for concern is because this decision affects people directly involved in the industry, tourism and connected industries, such as the industrial estates around the airport, and the possible impact on foreign direct investment in the future.  It is a critical issue for the Government and all concerned because of the implications for Cork and Shannon.</p><p>Deputy Gould referred to keeping Cork open.  Cork Airport will stay open.  There will still be Ryanair flights in and out of the airport.  The number of flights will be a fraction of the previous number.  The pandemic is causing the current difficulty.  Even if all flights were open to all destinations, over 80% of the journeys that typically come into the country at this time of year would, if they were happening, come from countries which are currently red listed because of the high number of coronavirus cases.  That is one of the fundamental problems in terms of restricting people from travelling.  We need a testing system to overcome that difficulty.  Cork Airport is remaining open.</p><p>To go back to what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, I hope it is not too late.  There may be a possibility that if we get a system in place some confidence will return.  One would imagine that would happen within the next month or two.  It will not be easy because we are at a high level of alert in terms of coronavirus, not just here but across Europe.  We need a six to nine month plan to try to create the conditions which can see the return of flights to Cork Airport.</p><p>I will write to Deputy Wynne directly, as she requested, in terms of the review of Shannon Group.  The same issue affects it.  The Shannon industrial estate around the airport is very much connected to the aviation sector.  The aviation industry is a large part of that industrial base in that area.  Shannon faces a real challenge.</p><p>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned other supports.  We are considering other supports.

The testing issue is critical because in the absence of that the passenger numbers would stay very low and any supports would be marginal as a result.  We will seek to introduce a more holistic package next week.</p></speech>

A significant number of people are now working from home and have adapted enormously in that regard.  Students, from primary school children to university students, have worked from home.  Those working in State jobs, multinationals, local and indigenous companies and manufacturing and everything else have adapted.  Society has changed.</p>  <p>  The great enabler of that has been the Internet and a good and positive connection to it.  Therein lies the challenge for rural and urban Ireland.  Parts of Ireland are classified as urban, but do not have great connectivity to the Internet.  One of the great enablers of work is a connection to the Internet.  Each and every day people from across my constituency contact me to ask when there will be an upgrade and what they can do to ensure they can continue to work from home and be engaged in education and society.</p>  <p>  This is not just about work or education; there is a purely social aspect.  With further restrictions added today, many people are keeping in contact through Zoom and every other mechanism available to them to try to maintain connectivity.  The previous Topical Issue was about the connectivity of people.  This is about connectivity to keep all communities going.  </p>  <p>  What are the plans to ensure there is a proper roll-out of broadband in the short term?</p> <p>As we head into the winter of this pandemic, who knows where we are going to be in the weeks and months ahead.  We want to ensure connectivity right across the country.  The great enabler to ensure that there is balanced regional development is broadband.</p></speech>

The national broadband plan, NBP, contract was signed with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, in November last to roll out a high speed and future-proofed broadband network within the intervention area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 540,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms, along with 695 schools.  The NBP will ensure that citizens throughout the country have access to high-speed broadband and nobody is left without this vital service. The NBP network will offer users a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset.  I should point out that this represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the contract.</p><p>The current deployment plan forecasts that premises will be passed in all counties within the first two years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high-speed broadband within the next four years.  The high-speed broadband map, which is available at<i></i><i></i>shows the areas in Cork which will be included in the national broadband plan State-led intervention as well as areas targeted by commercial operators.  There are 273,548 premises in Cork, of which 79,424 will be provided with high-speed broadband through the State-led Intervention.  A further 194,124 premises are areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high-speed services.  Government investment in County Cork in the national broadband plan will be &euro;314 million.  </p><p>As of 13 October, over 103,000 premises across 24 counties have been surveyed by NBI.  Of this figure, some 13,000 premises have been surveyed to date in Carrigaline and Midleton, and network designs have been completed to deliver the new fibre to the home network there.  NBI crews have started initial works for the build covering approximately 4,000 houses in the Carrigaline area, including Cullen, Templebreedy, Carrigaline, Ballyfoyle, Douglas, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, Mahon and Kilpatrick.  Laying of fibre should start shortly with the first fibre-to-home connection expected around December this year. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website .  Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the NBP, providing high-speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre to the home network.  As of 13 October, 166 sites have been installed by NBI and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The 51 BCPs have now been connected with high-speed broadband in places around Ireland.  The following BCPs in County Cork are now connected and the public can avail of public Wi-Fi at the following locations: Ballindangan Community Centre, Lissvard Community Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre and the T.O. Park Labbamollaga Community facility.  Bere Island Heritage Centre has been installed by NBI and is awaiting connectivity.  Further BCPs are due for installation by NBI in the coming months at locations including Aubane, Mealagh Valley, Glash, Courtbrack and Sherkin Island.  Further details can be found at . </p><p>Clogagh and Ballycroneen National School will also be connected for educational access as part of this initiative.  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise other schools with no high-speed broadband within the intervention area in Cork for connection over the term of the NBP.  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network.  The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.</p></speech>

The private operators, wireless etc. have moved in to fill a vacuum that is there because people want to get connectivity immediately.  They are talking to their bosses and to their schools during this pandemic and asking how they are going to get broadband.  There are places that are not getting broadband.  The plan for the areas that would find it difficult to get connection may take three to four years.  Is there a seriousness at Government level to try to move it more quickly because society has moved way beyond the political scene in the past number of months with working from home and so forth.  It has made that leap.  The State is duty bound to ensure that we have a proper roll-out of fibre broadband.  I appeal to the Minister to see how we can move this more quickly.  Can the intervention that is needed by the State be delivered through the various stages as fast as is humanly possible to empower all of the citizens of the island, whether they are from Kiskeam, Newmarket, Knocknagree or anywhere in between, to ensure this happens?  Everybody has the experience of people who are working from home in various Departments and in various positions.  We should be looking at everything to empower that to continue into the future.

If I can take Kiskeam as an example, my understanding is that one of the proposals there is that the post office may become the local connection point, where one could have a working hub for remote working in a social community-centred sort of way.  As it happens, I met the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, coming in here this evening and one of the items in her budget that I was very pleased to see agreed on Tuesday was &euro;5 million for the provision of remote working centres within the centres of community where we could do exactly what the Deputy is suggesting, which is to try to create these working hub centres.  I will follow up with An Post and with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to see if this is such a suitable venue.</p>  <p>  Taking this as an example, we should use this moment right across this country to change and transform from a position of real difficulty and to accelerate positive things, particularly in rural Ireland.  The remote working approach is very real and is happening now with hundreds of thousands of people.  It will work best where there is a social aspect to it and has an enterprising crossover aspect that will come when one gets people working together and using community facilities.  This will bring life back into the centre of villages and towns.  Critical for that is the provision of broadband infrastructure.  Without that nothing can happen.  The national broadband plan will be transformative and will be seen in the end as being of historic consequence for this country because it provides the infrastructure of the future.  It will be rolled out in the next four years and by definition has to go to every area and cover every single house.  Beyond that we should be looking at how we can build up communities and that is what I sense from Deputy Moynihan and I fully support that.</p></speech>

This sector makes a major contribution to the Irish economy.</p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>There are 6,600 people directly employed in this industry and a further 11,000 in indirect employment.  Many of those jobs are in the midlands, which have been particularly hard hit by industry closures and growing unemployment.<br/><br/>In 2018, the horticulture industry had a farm gate value of &euro;437 million.  It had exports valued at &euro;229 million.  Its employment value was just shy of &euro;500 million at &euro;497 million.  Sectors directly supported by this industry include mushroom growing, vegetables, protected fruits, nursery stock and tree saplings.  Its cost base would be greatly impacted by the proposed changes and it would put all those businesses under significant pressure.<br/><br/>The work this industry does has very little environmental impact in the grand scheme of things.  Only 24%  of total peatlands are used for horticulture peat harvesting.  The CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from horticulture peat harvesting are a mere 0.52% of potential Irish emissions for 2020.<br/><br/>Current legislation prohibits all peatland owners, including Bord na M&oacute;na, from carrying out any work whatsoever on bogs until planning permission is granted and a valid EP licence is received.  As a result of that, Growing Media Ireland, GMI, and Bord na M&oacute;na ceased all peat harvesting on 16 June 2020.  GMI and the industry are now in a legal limbo as to whether they can harvest peat moss for the industry.  Failure to do so will result in this industry collapsing in the very near future, resulting in major job losses and economic output.<br/><br/>If this issue is not addressed by the relevant Department, this industry is facing the reality that it will run out of peat moss supply in Ireland by July 2021.  If the industry is not permitted to harvest peat for horticulture, it will be imported from other parts of the EU.  That does not make any sense, either economically or environmentally.  As we speak, peat is being imported into this country.  It is laughable in the extreme that we would import peat.  How does it make sense to say we cannot have peat moss for the sector for environmental reasons but we can afford to ship it from other countries, which results in even more emissions and environmental impact?  I call on the Minister of State to take a common sense approach.  She should sit down with the industry, sort out these issues and save jobs.  <br/><br/>I would like to quote from one paragraph in the report of the Just Transition Commissioner.  It states:</p><blockquote>	... some fast-track, 'one-stop-shop' arrangement needs to be considered for planning, licensing and regulatory compliance.  Greater cohesion and co-ordination needs to be developed.  [He recommended] that this issue be addressed as a matter of urgency. </blockquote> <p>He stated that this will ensure a just transition that does not result in the destruction of local communities and will also ensure that measures are put in place to secure appropriate aftercare, including the rehabilitation of very valuable post-harvesting peatland habitats.  I stress that the habitats that will exist after harvesting can also be greatly beneficial to the environment.  <br/><br/>We are talking about a small proportion of Irish bogs but a vitally important industry to the country.  If we do not allow harvesting in this country, we will completely undermine the cost base of the mushroom and the vegetable growing industries.  They have enough problems with Brexit and trying to maintain access to the UK market but if we destroy their cost base in this fashion, they will find it virtually impossible to survive.</p></speech>

Approximately 60% of the value of Irish horticulture is dependent on peat as a growth medium, with the mushroom amenity and soft fruit sectors most reliant on peat.  As the Deputy stated, the horticulture sector is a large agrifood sector.  It is the fourth largest agrifood sector in this country behind dairy, beef and pigmeat.  The industry continues to progress and develop.  Of the peat that is extracted for horticultural purposes only 10% is used here in Ireland and 90% is exported.</p>  <p>  My Department is not involved in the regulation of peat extraction as this is a planning process under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  In this context, as an action under the national peatland strategy, the Department published a consultation document entitled A Review of the Use of Peat in the Horticultural Industry.  That consultation invited written submissions from stakeholders across the sector.  On 7 September 2020, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, published a report on the review of the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  The report was prepared by an inter-agency working group following on from the submissions from stakeholders.  Following the publication of the report, the Minister of State will set up an independent working group to consider the impacts on the sector.  It is proposed that this working group will represent Departments, including my own, and there will be representation from State agencies, environmental NGOs and industry stakeholders.  The working group will address the key issues raised in the report including the future use of peat by the horticulture sector.</p>  <p>  The position of chair for this independent working group has been advertised and the closing date for receipt of applications is 23 November.  Once the chair is in place, the selection of working group members is expected to take place.</p></speech>

I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his latitude in this matter.</p>  <p>  I raised this matter previously with the Minister of State's party leader, the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his answer in respect of the job losses that would be caused to the Monaghan mushroom industry and the associated peat extraction industry was that they will need to diversify.  He spoke about solar panels as being one option.  The difficulty with solar panels, and there are prospects for that sector, is that we cannot eat them.  This is about food production.  The truth of the matter is that people will eat the same volume of mushrooms, for example, as they currently do.  The question is where those mushrooms will be produced.  They will be produced using peat.  I fully endorse Deputy Cahill's proposition that the Government needs to consider a mechanism by which peat extraction can be used for essential food production services in this State and I encourage the Minister of State to pursue that matter with full vigour.</p></speech>

I welcome the formation of the working group and I hope a common sense solution can be found.  It would not make sense from either an economic or environmental perspective to import peat into this country.</p></speech>

The bottom line, however, is that the sector will have to transition away from peat.  We will not have an endless supply of peat even if we wanted to continue with extraction.  In the interim, as part of that, there may well be scope to facilitate that by focusing on the domestic demand for horticultural peat rather than exporting.  Regarding the 10% that stays here as opposed to the 90% we export, there may be scope there, which would seem to me to be a reasonable approach in that we would put our growers ahead of those abroad.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the industry, is actively looking at alternatives to peat.  While there are not yet any suitable or viable alternatives for mushroom casing, my Department is currently funding two research projects that have been commissioned by Ireland's mushroom producer organisation, CMP.  In terms of the two elements to that, there is one on a spent mushroom stabilisation project.  The objective of that project is to develop a rapid aerobic process to stabilise spent mushroom compost and create a by-product that could be used as a growing substrate within the sector.  That work is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The second alternative being looked into is a peat casing reduction project.  The objective of this project is to examine the impacts of reducing the quantity of peat used as a casing material in mushroom production.  A number of alternative substrates can be used but they have issues in terms of sustainability and their location.</p>  <p>  This is an issue but I believe it is something the sector can embrace with proper support from my Department and others.  I look forward to a healthy and vibrant horticulture sector moving forward.</p></speech>
