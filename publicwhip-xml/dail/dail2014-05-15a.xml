    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500003#A00500"><p>I am seeking the Minister's intervention in the ongoing industrial unrest at Aer Lingus.  The Minister, like everybody else, is acutely aware of the damage that the threat of strike action can do to the image of a country, especially at this time of year.  It has a negative impact on the sentiment expressed towards that country and, in particular, on the potential actions of a person who might want to visit it.  I appeal to the Minister to address this matter in the most urgent manner possible.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500003#A00600"><p>Efforts to address the future funding of the Irish airlines superannuation scheme date back many years and span the terms of several Governments.  As it is not a public sector pension scheme, I do not have the authority to prescribe or impose a solution.  While I want to help, this is primarily a matter for the trustees, the members of the scheme, the companies participating in the scheme and the Pensions Authority, which is the regulator of such pension schemes.</p><p>  Following consultations between my Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, an initiative was taken to establish an expert panel in an effort to broker a compromise.  The panel was asked to carry out an investigation into how the industrial relations issues relating to the scheme might be resolved.  It has given an update to the Department on its progress and is continuing to work intensively on the matter.  I have emphasised the need for the parties to put all their efforts into engaging with the expert panel.  It is important for the panel's work to be allowed to continue without interference.</p><p>  The outcome of the recent ballots by IMPACT cabin crew at Aer Lingus was very disappointing.  IMPACT's decision to serve strike notice on the company for action on Friday, 30 May next, which relates to rostering issues rather than the pension scheme itself, was also disappointing.  It follows the most recent threatened strike action over St. Patrick's weekend, which means there have been three threatened strikes this year.  Industrial action and the threat of industrial action are highly disruptive for passengers and are damaging to the company's position.  As Minister with responsibility for transport and tourism, I encourage all the parties to work to find a resolution without repeated threats of industrial action.  The Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court are available to Aer Lingus and IMPACT.  I encourage both parties to make full use of the State industrial relations machinery that is available to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500003#A00700"><p>The State industrial relations machinery is just not working for the aviation sector, unfortunately, particularly when it comes to the ongoing dispute about the pension scheme for the airports and the former State airline.  The unions, for their own reasons, believe they have no choice other than to engage in the kind of stand-off in which we now find ourselves.  While I accept that the current threat of strike action for later this month does not relate to the issue of pensions, it is part of a bigger industrial relations issue.  It does not seem possible to resolve this dispute in the normal way.  It is incumbent on the Minister to involve himself more fully in this crisis, perhaps by putting in place and developing a more comprehensive framework for its resolution.  He pointed out in his response that he is not the trustee.  He indicated in the not too distant past that if he were the trustee, or if the resolution of this matter fell within his remit, he would have brought forward a solution that would have resolved the issue by now.  I appeal to the Minister now, as I did then, to publish his views and ideas.  Perhaps they could act as a template or a basic discussion document for those who are seeking to find a resolution to this issue.  I should also mention in this context that section 33 of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014 creates further issues with regard to pension entitlements.  We will discuss that legislation when it is brought before the House.  It is adding to the concerns of workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500003#A00800"><p>There is no point in publishing a draft solution if it is not going to get the support of parties.  The whole point of a negotiation like this is to try to identify the gaps between the various parties - a number of gaps exist in this case - and come to a solution step by step.  That is what the expert panel is doing.  The panel will report to us again at the end of the month.  I hope that in time, it will be able to propose a solution that is acceptable not just to the members of the scheme - the pensioners and the airport workers who are covered by it - but also to the shareholders in the companies involved.  It will have to be acceptable to the Government, which is the shareholder in the Dublin Airport Authority and a minority shareholder in Aer Lingus, and to the other shareholders in Aer Lingus.  I remind the House that the Government was on the losing side when the remuneration of the CEO was voted on a few weeks ago.  Pensioners and members of the scheme need to bear in mind that any money injected into the scheme by Aer Lingus will need the support of the institutional shareholders in Aer Lingus.  I do not think the penny has quite dropped in that respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500003#A00900"><p>While I accept that is the case, I emphasise that we have a crisis on our hands.  Tourism is an important part of our economy.  The regrowth of the tourism industry and the focus on Ireland as a destination have the potential to ignite a level of activity within our retail and hospitality sectors.  The Minister is well aware from his work in the Department that people in the United States, in particular, have a relatively short window in which to take their vacations.  They plan on the basis of certainty.  If there is any uncertainty regarding a specific destination, travel agents will advise people to consider some other location.  If that were to happen in the case of Ireland, it would be hugely damaging to our tourism industry.  I do not think the Minister can argue that even though he is a significant shareholder in Aer Lingus and a total shareholder in the airports, this matter does not fall within his remit.</p><p>The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, must do a great deal more to seek to put in place a framework for resolving this issue once and for all, which may require looking beyond the standard industrial machinery.  The one-size-fits-all approach at the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission is not working in this instance and has not worked for some time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500004#B00200"><p>I appreciate and share the Deputy's concern for tourism.  I am delighted to report that since the Government made up of Fianna F&aacute;il, the Green Party and Independents was replaced by this Administration, the number of international visitors to Ireland has increased by 1 million, with further increases expected.  There has been a great deal of traffic at Dublin and Shannon airports in particular, as well as Knock, in recent months.  Passenger numbers at Shannon, for example, are up by more than 6% this year, which is very positive.</p><p>  There is currently no threat of strike action in regard to the pensions dispute.  A strike is threatened, however, in respect of rostering arrangements at Aer Lingus, which, if it occurs, will be particular to that company.  The level of competition that exists among airlines means that most passengers will have other options.  The threat of strike action at Aer Lingus is being used to put pressure on the company to find a resolution to the rostering issue.  I encourage Aer Lingus management and IMPACT to make full use of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court to come to an agreement.  I am sure it can be done.</p></speech>

We are great in this country at having tribunals after the event.  My concern is to ensure there are adequate planning and preventative measures in place in the event of a major catastrophe in the Dublin Port tunnel.  We saw yesterday the extent of the tragedy in Turkey, where a mining explosion occurred on Tuesday.  I take this opportunity to convey my sympathy to all of the families concerned and the Turkish people in the aftermath of this horrific accident.  Can the Minister offer an assurance that we are adequately prepared for the eventuality of some type of accident occurring in the Dublin Port tunnel?</p></reply>

As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in regard to the national roads programme.  The Dublin Port tunnel is the responsibility of the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007.  Safety is, of course, of paramount importance in the management and operation of the tunnel.  I understand from the NRA that the tunnel is fully compliant with European Directive 2004/54/EC on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the trans-European road network.   </p><p>  Among the obligations set down in the directive is the organisation of safety exercises which are to be carried out at regular intervals.  In the Dublin Port tunnel, safety drills are undertaken by the tunnel operator at three-monthly intervals to test the efficiency of the technical systems, the reactions of staff who control and manage equipment, and the co-ordination of intervention by the Dublin fire brigade, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the ambulance service.  I am happy to arrange a site visit for the Deputy to the tunnel control centre and a detailed briefing from the NRA on the fire and safety plans that are in place.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500004#B00700"><p>I thank the Minister for his response and his invitation to visit the tunnel control centre.  He may recall the terrible tragedy that occurred on 24 March 1999 in the Mont Blanc tunnel, where 39 people died when a Belgian transport truck carrying flour and margarine caught fire.  At 10.53 a.m. on that day, the driver of the vehicle stopped in the middle of the tunnel in an attempt to fight the fire, but he was forced back by the flames from the cab.  At 10.55 a.m., tunnel employees triggered the fire alarm and prevented any further traffic from entering.  However, 18 trucks and ten vans were trapped in the tunnel.  Most of the drivers rolled up their windows and waited for rescue, but the ventilation system drove toxic smoke back down the tunnel faster than anybody could run for safety.  Drivers near the blaze who attempted to leave their vehicles and seek refuge points were quickly overcome by the fumes.  Fifteen firefighters were also trapped in the tunnel, all of whom were admitted to hospital in serious condition and one of whom subsequently died.</p><p>  That tragedy highlights the need to have a safety plan for the Dublin Port tunnel.  The Minister referred to safety drills taking place every three months.  That frequency is not sufficient and should be tightened.  Human error is difficult to plan for, but we must have measures in place to deal with all eventualities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500004#B00800"><p>The key issue when it comes to safety in transport, whether in respect of roads, aviation or the railways, is the need to be always vigilant and never complacent.  The NRA has detailed to me the safety measures are in place in the Dublin Port tunnel, which I am pleased to outline to the Deputy.  The tunnel is equipped with an extensive range of safety features, including mechanical and electrical systems as well as optical and gas-monitoring equipment, in order to ensure a safe environment at all times for users.  The tunnel control centre, which is managed and operated by specialist staff, monitors the tunnel 24-7, 365 days per year, through a network of CCTV cameras which covers the entire length of both tunnel bores.  The control centre is in charge of all activities relating to traffic control and safety maintenance, both under normal conditions and in the event of an incident.  Procedures are in place to cater for all aspects of tunnel safety, including the safety of users, operative staff and subcontractors, under normal operating conditions and in emergency situations, in order to ensure that any issues which arise in regard to the tunnel's operation, maintenance and safety are responded to promptly and efficiently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500004#B00900"><p>The buck stops with the Minister on this issue, notwithstanding his reference to the individuals who bear responsibility on a daily basis.  Following the Mont Blanc tunnel fire, 16 people and companies were tried on 31 January 2000, five of them for manslaughter.  An Italian company had to pay out &euro;13.5 million in compensation.  The head of security was given a six-month sentence, the former president of the French company operating the tunnel was given a two-year suspended sentence, the driver of the truck was given a four-month suspended sentence, and seven other people, including the tunnel's Italian security chief, were handed suspended terms and fines.  We must be vigilant to ensure something similar does not happen here in the event of a fire in the Dublin Port tunnel.</p></speech>

When it comes to air traffic control and tunnel safety, the authorities look at what has gone wrong in other locations and the lessons that can be learned from that.  I have visited the Dublin Port tunnel control centre myself and, as I said, the Deputy is welcome to do the same and receive a briefing from staff.</p></speech>

Furthermore, in lieu of a personal assistant, I appointed a policy adviser, Mr. John Carroll, whose terms and conditions are at the personal assistant grade.   </p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, is aided by Mr. Jim McGrath, who advises him in regard to his departmental functions and media matters and is employed at the personal assistant grade.  For the Deputy's information, the personal assistant grade is the equivalent of the parliamentary assistant grade in Leinster House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, is advised by Mr. Paul McGrath on departmental matters.  Mr. McGrath provides his services free of charge.   </p><p>  In regard to the remaining non-Civil Service members of staff in my office, there is one personal secretary who works on constituency matters.  There are two members of staff, a personal secretary and a clerical equivalent, in the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly.  In the case of the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, he is aided in constituency matters by one personal secretary and one personal assistant.  In addition, each of us has two civilian drivers.  As the Deputy is aware, the practice of the last Government was to have all members of Government driven by full-time Garda drivers.  This was an expensive practice that diverted garda&iacute; away from front-line duties.  We also provide our own cars.   </p><p>  All of these staff are employed in line with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on the staffing of the offices of Ministers and Ministers of State.  By way of comparison with the above, my predecessor in this Department, Noel Dempsey, had, in November 2008, three politically appointed members of staff employed at the special adviser pay grade or similar as well as a personal assistant and a personal secretary.  At the same time, there were ten civil servants employed in Mr. Dempsey's private and constituency offices, as well as five in the Minister of State's.  There are eight civil servants between my private and constituency office, and four in each of the offices of my Ministers of State.</p><p>  The Deputy will no doubt agree that we are doing more work than the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party-Independents Government with fewer staff and other supports.</p></reply>

However, his tone appears to indicate a belief on his part that I am somehow trying to ascertain the costs relating to the operation of his office.  That is not the case.  I am trying to understand the relationship between external staff and civil servants.  The Minister stated that one individual advises the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, on departmental matters.  The Minister also outlined the position regarding his advisers - which seems to be quite straightforward - and those of the other Minister of State, Deputy Kelly.  The job descriptions to which he referred all seem normal.  I just wonder why someone from outside the Civil Service is advising the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, on departmental matters.  Would that not be a function of members of the permanent staff?  The Minister indicated that the individual in question is not paid in respect of the work he carries out.  If he is not in a position to do so now, will the Minister at some stage provide information regarding the actual role this individual plays?  Is he involved in any way in advising the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, on the allocation of funding under the sports capital programme?</p></speech>

The person to whom Deputy Dooley is referring is former Deputy Paul McGrath.  It is important that Ministers have advisory staff.  The key difference between such staff and civil servants is that they must leave their employment when one loses one's job.  They operate on a different basis to civil servants, who are always in Departments regardless of the identity of the Minister of the day and who work on longer-term contracts.  One of the sad aspects of the departure of the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was that three other people also lost their jobs on the day he lost his and they have been obliged to seek work elsewhere as a result.  We often forget that side of politics.  Essentially, the Minister of State does not have an adviser.  However, he felt he needed some advice from someone with political experience and knowledge and that person is Mr. Paul McGrath.  The latter does not receive any remuneration for the work he does.  Mr. Paul McGrath does not do any work in respect of constituency matters but he does advise the Minister of State on any matters relating to sports and tourism, including the sports capital programme.</p></speech>

In that context, our decisions are informed by advice provided by officials in the Department's sports division.  The role occupied by Mr. Paul McGrath does not involve decision making, rather it involves providing advice on tourism and sport and all matters relating thereto.  The setting of the criteria for the sports capital programme is very much a policy matter and not a party political one.  Mr. Paul McGrath is not an employee of the Department and he does not receive any remuneration for the work he does.  He offers advice to the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, on a <i>pro-bono</i>basis.

Has an evidence-based audit been carried out in respect of the system?  Many citizens are concerned that the penalty points system no longer relates to road safety and that it is being used as a way of raising revenue.  They are of the view that they have been hammered as a result of the introduction of various charges and that their pockets are again being picked because they are being obliged to pay &euro;80 fines on a regular basis in respect of incidents which would not really be that serious in the context of public safety.  Has an audit such as that to which I refer been carried out?</p></reply>

The system is also widely accepted by the general public, as evidenced by the fact that over 70% of those served with a fixed charge notice pay the stipulated fine without recourse to the courts.    From 411 deaths on our roads in 2001, there was a dramatic reduction to 190 in 2013.  As of 12 May last, 67 people had lost their lives on Irish roads this year.  That is the same number which obtained as of the same date last year.  We are determined to maintain focus on reducing the number further.  As of today and although it is not of any statistical significance, there has been one less death on the roads this year.</p><p>  The main goal of the penalty point system is not to penalise people but to make them more aware of unsafe driving behaviour, to improve driver behaviour and to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on Irish roads.  A comprehensive review of the system took place in 2012.  Recommendations made in the review, namely, the introduction of new penalty point offences and changes to the number of penalty points to be applied in respect of certain offences, were reflected in the new Road Traffic Act 2014, which was signed into law on 25 February last.  I will continue to monitor the operation of the system to ensure that it contributes in the most effective way possible to the enhancement of safety on our roads.</p></speech>

He indicated that to date this year, some 67 people have lost their lives, which is horrific.  We must ensure that all relevant safety measures, including improving our roads and erecting proper speed limit signs in very dangerous locations, are put in place.  I have been approached by citizens who informed me that they have encountered either GoSafe or Garda vans on empty straight roads.  Basically, those in the vans who are shooting fish in a barrel and their actions lead to every person detected speeding being obliged to pay &euro;80 per head.  In one recent incident of which I was made aware, a family with a very disabled child driving down Griffith Avenue were caught doing 60 km/h in a 50 km/h zone.  The road was completely devoid of other traffic but there was still a van there to monitor people's speed.  On another occasion, people who exited Parnell Park after a St. Vincent's GAA match came across garda&iacute; nicking people for speeding on the Malahide Road.</p><p>  Does that to which I refer really constitute good and effective policing?  Is it what we want in terms of ensuring road safety?  The Minister must listen to the view of the people and I am aware of some individuals who believe the penalty points system to be just another revenue-raising mechanism?  We all want to improve road safety and I have no difficulty which GoSafe and Garda vans monitoring people's speed on very dangerous routes.  I welcome that the Minister is going to monitor what is happening.  I hope that will lead to his spotting the fact that there is a little scam going on.</p></speech>

Clearly, however, I pay attention to such matters in the context of how they relate to road safety.  I do not believe that what the Deputy says reflects the actual position.  Similar remarks are also often made in respect of safety cameras and GoSafe vans.</p><p>People often tell me they are just a revenue-raising measure and are just shooting fish in a barrel.  However, when one actually looks at the facts, one realises that, in almost all cases, the cameras are located where there have been accidents or incidents.  The amount of money that is generated by them is less than the cost of running them.  Therefore, the allegation just does not add up.  The best way to avoid getting a fine is to obey the road traffic laws and comply with the Road Traffic Act.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to obeying the rules of the road but in some places there is no sign warning motorists that the speed limit is 50 km/h.  Motorists who are dawdling along, perhaps at 58 km/h or 60 km/h in a 50 km/h zone, are caught all of a sudden by a van and are awarded two penalty points and a fine of &euro;80 euro.  These are the cases I am talking about.  Of course, we all want safe and effective measures at very dangerous bends and on rural roads.  However, Griffith Avenue is deserted at 8 p.m.  To nab a disabled motorist who is minding his own business and driving at 60 km/h in a 50 km/h zone with no signs is unacceptable.  I have asked the council and the Garda about this issue.  The Minister can say all he wants and talk about effectiveness but the bottom line is that he is hitting soft targets.  I refer to the people who are being hammered regularly.  They are innocent, pay their taxes and are law abiding.  They are being hammered regularly and now the Minister is going after them again.</p></speech>

I am aware that it is in some ways beyond the Minister's power given that the UK authorities are allowed to do what they are doing.  I realise the matter was debated recently in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  It was stated that Secretary of State Theresa Villiers can exclude roads from the levy through an affirmative order.  Therefore, if there is a will, there is a way.  While the UK authorities can say what they are doing is within their rights under EU regulations, they could take a more friendly approach considering the strong relationship between our two countries.</p></reply>

This issue has been raised by the Taoiseach with Prime Minister David Cameron and it has also been discussed by the North-South Ministerial Council.</p><p>  As the Deputies know, this is a decision that rests with central government in London in the United Kingdom.  Arising from the representations and discussions to date, approximately 7 km of roads that criss-cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic have been exempted from the levy.  However, recent correspondence from the UK Minister has indicated that he is not inclined to make provision for the exemption of further Northern Ireland roads from the levy.</p><p>  While it is accepted that the UK Government is within its rights under EU legislation to introduce the levy, the Irish Government is unhappy with the UK authorities' position on the exemption of the A5.  I will request that they reconsider this decision.  For a successful resolution to this issue, we need unity of purpose between the Irish Government and the Northern Irish Executive.  In that regard, I am supported by my colleague in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister Mark Durkan.  However, I was disappointed by the partisan approach taken by some other parties in the Northern Irish Assembly when this was debated there on Monday.  As a result of that, the Northern Ireland Assembly voted against our desired position on this matter.  The contributions in the debate would drive one to distraction in many ways.  The speakers were more concerned with the forthcoming elections than ensuring all-party support to get the A5 exempted.</p><p>  A working group has been established to examine the feasibility of introducing a similar pay-as-you-go road tax scheme for HGVs in Ireland.  There is precedence in Europe with the Eurovignette for a common road charging regime to be established, where only one charge is applied but where payers can use a number of different countries' roads.  We should look to this example and seek to establish a common regime between Britain and Ireland.  While there are a large number of issues surrounding this and while it requires the support of the British Government, a common regime may have merit given our circumstances.  Therefore, my officials have begun tentative discussions with their British counterparts on this potential long-term solution.  A common regime would be of benefit to hauliers in the North and South, and it would also result in benefits between Britain and Ireland, as opposed to two different regimes that would impose significant regulatory burdens on hauliers.</p></reply>

I realise he is trying to improve matters.  Many industries in this State, including the haulage industry, are experiencing difficult times.  When the hotels and restaurants were in real trouble, the Government's initiative on VAT was strong, good and very helpful.  It was economically beneficial in both directions.</p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for the vehicle road tax.  Given that the rate of road tax for hauliers in Ireland is probably one of the highest in Europe and that the industry is in a difficult position, has there been any correspondence between the Minister and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the issue?</p></speech>

There is now a working group including the two Departments and the Department of Finance.  As the Deputy rightly says, road tax for hauliers in Ireland is very high.  On the flipside, however, diesel prices are lower than in the North and Britain.  In addition, there is a fuel rebate here.  All these factors need to be taken in the round.  Essentially, that is what we are trying to do through the initiatives of my Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Finance and others.  We are trying to examine the whole suite of charges that affect hauliers, including road tax, fuel levies, fuel rebates and road charging, with a view to determining what we can do to make sense of it all so we will not end up with a tax regime that disadvantages Irish-based hauliers.  We have been very successful in making Ireland tax competitive, particularly for multinationals and others.  We want to do something similar when it comes to haulage but it has to add up, obviously.</p></speech>

From speaking to many of the hauliers within the industry, I understand they will be examining these matters very closely in the context of the next budget.  Taxation presents a challenge we need to address</p><p>  I thank the Minister for the update on the recent North-South Ministerial Council meeting.  I was monitoring the debate in Stormont closely.  Unfortunately, political footballs are being thrown all over Stormont on this issue.  It is a travesty, to say the least, because this issue has been very much to the fore in the minds of hauliers in my county for a long period.  In fairness to the hauliers, they have been trying to work with Stormont and Dublin.  Their representatives had a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, which they found very helpful.  They are aware of the work the Minister is doing.</p><p>  I cannot understand why Sinn F&eacute;in, which is in government in Northern Ireland, has not been more proactive on this issue.  It affects so many people, including hauliers, and the industry.  The legislation at issue is UK legislation, from Westminster.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, he has been proactive and has been working with his counterparts in the North, but I believe we need serious engagement on the part of Sinn F&eacute;in in government in Northern Ireland.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has ultimate responsibility because it is the secondary legislation that will ultimately be enforced.  As has been pointed out by the Minister, Mark H. Durkan, that subordinate legislation is being not being enforced these days because the subordinate legislation is not in place.  I ask Sinn F&eacute;in to be more proactive in government in Northern Ireland on this matter.  </p></speech>

We would like to see Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland taking the same view on this.  It would be very helpful for me if the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly went to London and said that they want the A5 to be exempted, that the taxpayers are going to pay for a chunk and that they want trade between Donegal and the Border counties in Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, the Assembly voted against that.  The reason given by many Unionist members was that they felt that Sinn F&eacute;in in particular played a very partisan role in this.  I will quote one of the people involved in the debate, Mrs. Pam Cameron MLA, who is a DUP representative.  She said: "I am glad to be able to speak on this issue this afternoon.  I was initially broadly in support of the motion, but given the proposer's remarks I am afraid that I simply cannot support it."  The entire approach taken by Mr. Phil Flanagan MLA, who is the Sinn F&eacute;in proposer of the motion, put off many people in Northern Ireland who might have supported it.  This has really harmed Irish hauliers.</p></speech>

We have certainly been fighting this corner, have made representations and have brought this motion before the Assembly.  We have made representations directly to Westminster on a number of occasions.</p><p>  One of the major problems we have is that with this in place, many road hauliers will take their business North.  Are we able to calculate the damage that will be done?  Damage will certainly be done because of the tax here which ranges from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,000.  In comparison, the tax in the North is &pound;640.  This area must be looked at.  We must look at a broad range of areas in terms of taxes.  The Minister mentioned that he might look at this area.</p></speech>

We have 7 km.  Why can we not go the extra mile and put on extra pressure?  If Secretary of State Villiers can make decisions like this, surely we can keep putting more pressure on and making representations.  This is going against the Good Friday Agreement in terms of co-operation and we should keep putting pressure on and go to Europe.</p></speech>

One of the solutions may involve adopting the same system as that in the UK.  I do not think there is anything ironic about it.  In fairness, Deputy Ellis is not the worst of them but this is just a classic example of the two Sinn F&eacute;ins.  If ever there was a party of partition, it is Sinn F&eacute;in, which takes different positions north and south of the Border.  I will give five other simple examples.  The local property tax, which Sinn F&eacute;in opposes down here, is three times higher in the North and Sinn F&eacute;in in government has increased it for four years in a row.  Water charges are already part of domestic rates bills in Northern Ireland and Sinn F&eacute;in has only deferred direct charges in the North until 2016.  Sinn F&eacute;in imposed a two-year pay freeze on public servants earning over &pound;25,000.  In respect of public expenditure, Sinn F&eacute;in signed up to a four-year budget slashing spending in Northern Ireland by 8%.  The Minister for Education in Northern Ireland, who is a member of Sinn F&eacute;in, has closed 30 schools and will close more.  If ever there was a partitionist party in this country, it is Sinn F&eacute;in.</p></speech>

In the process, he chose to misrepresent my position on a number of counts.  He misrepresented me on discretion, as the former Minister repeatedly did for over a year.  The Minister made out that I was portraying myself as a victim, which I never did.  The kernel of the problem was that the former Minister abused his office.  The Minister literally tried to de-legitimise my challenge to the former Minister for Justice and Equality by saying that the former Minister should be forgiven because it is over a year ago and by choosing to bring up the fact that my former company could not meet a VAT liability five years ago.  The Minister used that to defend the former Minister for Justice and Equality.  That said more about the Minister than it did about me.  I was really disappointed in him because I have always respected him.</p></speech>

In fairness, Deputy Ellis is not the worst of them.  The economic philosophy of money growing on trees is certainly not one with which I am familiar.  In respect of what is not being done, I called on Martin McGuinness six weeks ago.  He is Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland.  I have asked him before and will ask him again publicly to proactively engage with his British counterparts in respect of this issue.  I do not think that is being done.  It is not being pushed hard enough.  One can say that pressure is being put on but I do not think it is happening because the proof is in the pudding.  Lorry drivers, hauliers and companies in Donegal who are driving through the North are being told, wink and nod, that the levy is not being enforced.  It is law in the UK.  The secondary legislation is not in place yet and Minister Mark H. Durkan says that it is not being enforced, but it is still law.  It creates a massive grey area of confusion for many hauliers.  I commend the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on his suggestion of a joint delegation from North and South.  They should leave the political hats outside the room and go to Westminster.  That is a good suggestion but it will need proactivity from the Northern end.</p></speech>

The Minister never stops talking about Sinn F&eacute;in.  The Minister knows well that a large number of different things, be they education, school meals or household charges, are included in one single charge.  We do not have a myriad of extra taxes that this Government has introduced.  Unfortunately, this is what has happened.  The Minister mentioned water charges.  There are no water charges in the North.  Perhaps he needs to read up on it.  It is this Government that is introducing water charges.</p></speech>

Once again, I am telling the Minister that these charges involving &euro;12 per trip are costing the industry a huge amount.  We must look at helping the industry.

I was asked a question by a journalist and I am not sure exactly which sections of that were played on the radio and which were not.  However, I have on a number of occasions expressed my respect for Deputy Wallace in the stance he has taken in pursuing on the floor of this House the issue around penalty points.  I believe he has done a good day's work and a good service in that regard, and I am going to repeat that again because I believe it is true.  I am glad the Deputy agrees he is not a victim, which is important.  In addition, I believe what Deputy Shatter did on "Prime Time" was wrong but I also believe that his apology should be accepted.  I am not sure if Deputy Wallace has done that yet but I think he should.  In regard to companies, I believe companies should pay their taxes and that directors and owners of companies have a responsibility in that regard.  I cannot say otherwise.</p><p>  On the substantive issue of hauliers, which is what this is supposed to be about, we are going to keep working on it.  There are a number of different options for a solution but the shared objective of everyone in government is to make sure that we have a fair playing field for Irish hauliers when it comes to taxes and charges across the island and between Britain and Ireland.</p></speech>

The first is a 4.5 km single carriageway off-road, greenfield bypass of Moycullen and the second is the online realignment and upgrading of 900 m of the existing N59 on the Galway road into Moycullen.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la approved the environmental impact statement and the compulsory purchase order for the scheme in 2012, and the project is now at design stage.</p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, the scale of the reductions in the NRA under the infrastructure and capital investment framework 2012-2016 has meant that it has not been possible to progress a range of road development projects.  The key priority has to be the protection of the existing investment in road infrastructure.  In that regard, it is not possible to advance the off-road, greenfield bypass aspect of this project at the moment.  However, on Tuesday, the Government approved &euro;43 million in additional funding for roads and, as part of that, &euro;3.5 million has been allocated to carry out the online realignment and upgrade part of the project.</p><p>  Having visited Moycullen with Deputy Kyne last year, I appreciate the importance of this aspect of the bypass works.  I would, of course, like to be in a position to announce funding for the overall project but, unfortunately, that is not possible for the time being.  However, real benefit will accrue to the people of Moycullen from a quality of life and road safety perspective as a result of progressing this particularly important aspect of the scheme.</p></speech>

This is the best local news I have received in my ten years in politics.  In fact, when I was elected to Galway County Council, the first delegation I met a few days after being elected was from local residents regarding this road.  I am delighted and I would like to thank the Minister for his support on this.  As he said, he travelled to Moycullen last August and had a meeting with local residents about the condition of that road, a meeting which was hot and heavy at times.  We further discussed this matter with the CEO and chairman of the National Roads Authority last Friday at the turning of the sod for the M17-M18 motorway.  I commend the Minister on his intervention.</p><p>  This project is part of a 40 year campaign, believe it or not.  It will include the widening of the very narrow Clydagh bridge and the provision of footpaths, cycle lanes and lighting on that section of road.  I understand the tenders are near completion.  Again, I thank the Minister for his support.  I am sure the National Roads Authority will be advancing this very soon, possibly with work to start in the autumn.  I am sure the Minister will be in contact with the NRA on that.</p></speech>

Between Galway city and the west of Moycullen, the existing N59 primarily serves as a commuter route, while further west it is more accurately described as a rural-tourist route.  It forms the main street through the village of Moycullen, and traffic projections for the opening year of the project predict a traffic flow of some 11,000 to 13,000, which is very significant.  Having visited Moycullen and discussed this with Deputy Kyne and the NRA, I do not believe anyone can argue about the merits of this project.  We would love to be able to go ahead with the main bypass but we just cannot afford to do so.  However, this will result in a major improvement for people trying to get to and from Connemara, and, in addition, for the people of Moycullen, who will be able to walk around the town and village in a way they cannot at present.</p></speech>

Many elderly residents have lived along that road for more than 40 years.  Indeed, some individuals got planning permission up to 45 years ago and were told at the time not to put in a permanent boundary wall on the front of their site because there were plans to widen the road.  This is wonderful news, on which I commend the Minister.  It will also improve the very dangerous Kylebroghlan junction, where drivers cannot see properly when turning right.  I again thank the Minister for his support on this project.</p></speech>

Historically, for example, we have seen that a constituency where a Minister comes from is where the lion's share of sports grants have gone.  It is very important that people understand the methodology if there is going to be confidence that the money is spent in the places where it is most needed and that demographic trends and deficits are part of that.</p></reply>

These criteria are designed to give higher scores to applications that will increase participation, where facilities will be shared, that are from designated disadvantaged areas, that have not received substantial funding in the past and that are ready to be progressed as soon as possible.</p><p>  In 2008, local authorities were requested to carry out an audit of local sports facilities.  Many of these local authorities and local sports partnerships around the country have published online directories or databases of the sports and recreational facilities in their areas.</p><p>  In deciding the final allocations within each county, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and I may have regard to other criteria such as population, performance during the assessment process, and ensuring a geographic spread of rural and urban projects and of projects among different sports.</p></speech>

When the Minister of State goes to announce the grants, will there be checks and balances to make sure that is how it is applied?  Given the new politics that has been talked about, this is one of the areas where people will look very critically if there is a deviation from that.</p><p>I have raised with the Minister of State on numerous occasions, albeit not in the context of sports capital grants, the significant deficit in respect of sports facilities in north County Kildare.  Despite having a population of 60,000, not one town in the area has a swimming pool.  When people ask me why their town does not have a swimming pool I tell them it is in County Kerry because that is where the Minister with responsibility for sports when money was available for new swimming pool projects was from.  People want a return on the money being spent on sports facilities because that money belongs to them. </p><p> Encouraging people to live in towns rather than the countryside requires making towns attractive places to live and sports and leisure facilities are a vital part of that. </p></speech>

I have asked my officials to review the position regarding swimming pool projects and discuss the matter with local authorities.  I asked a representative of the County and City Managers' Association what local authorities require to advance swimming pool projects.  The enhancement programme for swimming pools worked well and saved a number of pools from closure.  However, Deputy Murphy is correct that a small number of areas, including Leixlip, do not have a swimming pool.  Local authorities are no longer interested in operating swimming pools because they are too costly.  I am considering the possibility of opening a limited scheme to enable a number of counties to make an application for funding for a new swimming pool.  I will review the matter.</p><p>The Deputy will have to admit that the most recent round of funding under the sports capital programme was the fairest ever allocation and the first that did not give rise to media controversy.  I allocated funding on a <i>pro rata</i>basis to ensure every county received a fair share of the overall allocation.  When I reviewed the allocations for the past ten years, I noted which counties had done very well, reduced funding to such counties and increased funding to counties that had not done so well.  For example, the figures indicated that, on a <i>per capita</i>basis, funding to counties Carlow and Wicklow amounted to &euro;1 or &euro;2, whereas the equivalent figure for counties Donegal and Kerry was as high as &euro;195 <i>per capita</i>.  I wonder why that was the case.  I decided not to provide further funding to these counties and instead increase funding to counties that had done badly in previous funding rounds.  </p><p>When the most recent round of funding under the sports capital programme was announced, journalists immediately tried to find out if County Mayo received a greater allocation than other counties.  The county was allocated, <i>pro rata</i>, the funding to which it was entitled, as were all other counties.  I did what Dr. John Considine wanted to me to do and when he found no reason to criticise local schemes, he examined the regional schemes.  Not every county had a regional scheme, however.</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State have figures on the number of invalid applications?  Given that this is the second scheme over which he has presided, can anything be done for clubs which have had two applications rejected?  Clubs that have missed out on two funding opportunities may not have access to a new source of Government funding for a number of years.</p></speech>

I must give my officials full credit for making the application process easier and allowing online applications to be submitted.  The three main reasons for declaring applications invalid were the absence of own funding by the applicant, a failure to have the property in question registered and the absence of a planning approval for the proposed works.  While I made my officials available before the process commenced, they will not speak to applicants while the process is ongoing.  Officials assisted applicants in every way during the initial process.</p><p>  Deputy Eoghan Murphy is correct that some of the invalid applications were received from organisations which submitted an invalid application in the previous round of sports capital funding.  Despite writing to the organisations in question following the previous process to indicate the reasons their applications were invalid, some of them submitted further invalid applications.  I want this process to be fair and, as such, I will not consider any invalid applications.  Under the most recent round of the programme and unlike in previous rounds, not one invalid application was considered.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State noted, County Carlow was discriminated against for many years.  It is interesting to hear Deputy Catherine Murphy refer to County Kildare.  I am aware of one club in County Kildare which received more in sports capital funding than County Carlow secured over the years.  Fortunately, this type of discrimination was addressed in the previous round of funding.</p><p>  On invalid applications, will the relevant clubs and organisations be notified in advance of the next announcement on funding that their applications were invalid and the reasons therefor?  Will they also be informed of the steps they can take to rectify the position in future applications?  When will the funding allocation be announced and will the announcement specify a timeframe within which it must be spent?</p></speech>

On this occasion, I hope a letter will issue to every unsuccessful applicant on the day the announcement is made.  Every club will receive a letter, as they did on the previous occasion, setting out the reasons their application was invalid.  This should make matters easier.</p><p>  On the timeframe for the announcement, more than 2,000 applications for funding have been received and are being processed.  The announcement will not be made before the local elections.  </p><p>  I cannot understand the reason that clubs and organisations which received a letter explaining the reasons their applications were invalid have submitted further invalid applications in this round.  It does not make sense.  My officials made the process easier by providing a template to be filled in by a solicitor in which registration could be taken against a property.  We did our best to make it as easy as possible for clubs to make applications for funding.  We do not want to penalise clubs and while we not be able to fund every club, I want all of them to have a fair crack of the whip.  The law of the land is that invalid applications cannot be considered and that will remain the case.</p></speech>

Rather than completing this template, some applicants submitted letters with incorrect information.  My officials did their best to make the process as easy as possible.  Applications proceeded to the next stage because the letters that were received had to be checked.  When this was done it was found that many of them were invalid.  Registration of property is a major problem in this country.  I respect the fact that those involved in sporting organisations act in a voluntary capacity.  I feel sorry for the secretary or chairman of a club in the sense that applying for funding places a major onus and responsibility on them.  While we try to be as lenient and fair as possible, invalid applications will not be considered.  Having made the application process easier, I cannot do more.  However, the number of invalid applications has declined from 48% to 38%.</p><p>  Approximately &euro;58 million of funding remains outstanding from previous rounds.  In the previous round, successful applicants were given a two year period to spend the funding. </p><p>I see it happening again.  More than a year and a half after the moneys were allocated, organisations are coming back looking for the second round when they did not even spend the first round.  They will not be considered too seriously.</p></speech>

Heretofore, many councillors were not aware of their powers.  I would like to see more powers devolved to councillors for roads programmes.  When I was a councillor in the late 1990s, there was a three year roads programme which councillors could debate.  Nowadays, it seems to be cloak-and-dagger type stuff with engineers, who mostly are inside an office looking at Google Maps, deciding roads programmes with no input from councillors who are on the ground.  Will the Minister indicate if there will be increased powers for local authority councillors with regard to decisions on roads programmes?</p></reply>

He deserves great credit for this and I am keen to support his agenda of devolving functions to local authorities where it is appropriate to do so.  The impact of his work is that the councillors who will be elected next week will have significantly more power and influence on local matters.</p><p>  My Department's principal engagement with local authorities is on roads matters.  This year I have given local authorities increased flexibility in the use of grants for regional and local roads.  I am supportive of giving further discretion in that area to local authorities in the future.  This may be to the extent of allocating a single block roads grant to each local authority or indeed including it in a single overall grant from central government.  The merit in such a move would be to give local authorities real choice in deciding what they wanted prioritise in their own county, rather than such decisions being made by me or my successors in the Department's offices in Kildare Street.</p><p>  In the maritime sector, I have already transferred five harbour authorities to local authorities.  The national ports policy recommends that control of the State ports of Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Galway, New Ross and Wicklow also be devolved from central to local government led structures.  This reflects the regional nature of those bodies and their move in tourism and leisure amenity.  I expect to bring proposals to the Government in the coming weeks for legislation to give effect to these recommendations.</p><p>  Proposals for the rural transport programme will see local authorities having a role for the first time in transport planning.  They will carry out strategic transport needs assessment in respect of their functional areas and develop annual transport plans for submission to the National Transport Authority, NTA.</p><p>  The local area hackney licence, introduced by the NTA in December 2013, is designed to facilitate low-cost entry to the hackney market for transport in rural areas.  In applying for a licence, the applicant must submit an analysis of the need for the proposed service carried out by or on behalf of the relevant local authority and confirmation of the need for the services by the relevant local authority.</p><p>  The role of local authorities in tourism development will be reflected in my forthcoming tourism policy statement.  The policy will recognise the roles of local authorities in engaging communities, local enterprise support, providing tourism infrastructure and ensuring an attractive environment.  Their role in community engagement underpins the community tourism initiative announced in April.  This partnership between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited and the 34 local authorities, will provide an annual fund of &euro;1 million over the next three years to support up to 700 local community-based events and festivals each year.</p><p>  I have identified responsibility for local sports partnerships as a function for consideration for devolution to local authorities.  Proposals will be submitted to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in the context of establishing Sport Ireland.</p></reply>

I regret that this was not done on this occasion as a result of a decision of Fingal County Council.</p><p>  I have a mixed view of the outsourcing of public service functions.  Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes, it does not.  Sometimes outsourcing does not always work and is not always better.  Sometimes, it is and can work very well.  Across the public service, even in agencies under my Department&rsquo;s remit, because they are so constrained by the employment control framework and cannot take on additional staff, they have no other option but to outsource.  This is regrettable because outsourcing should happen because it makes sense and there is a strong business case for doing so, not just because they have to as they are not allowed to take on additional staff.  That is a matter the Government as a whole can consider in the coming months and the next year, now that it appears the budgetary situation is starting to improve.</p></speech>

Housing provision is an issue that has required attention for some several years.</p><p> Public housing is within the remit of the local authorities.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.  Unfortunately, over the years there has been a gradual off-loading, outsourcing and avoiding of the responsibilities in that area and it was agreed in policies pursued over ten or 15 years.  While I do not wish to go into the history, we now must deal with the inherited difficulties arising from a failure to provide a proper public housing programme over at least 15 years.  There is one commentator in the public area who might admit that I reminded him at least 15 years ago that the biggest issue to face this country in the years to come would be the lack of public housing.</p><p> There is an unfortunate situation where people can no longer go to access the workforce because they are dependent on rent support which is conditional on them being unemployed.  The situation is intolerable.  We cannot go on indefinitely chasing the rising rents and at the same time trying to pretend that the issue will go away or will resolve itself as nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p> At last, this Government has recognised that there is a need to reintroduce the public housing programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and I know full well that the situation is dire.  We have discussed this on many occasions and I am sure everybody else in this House has discussed it with her as well.  The problem is so vast now that, without anything else happening at all, we would need at least 20,000 houses in each of the next four years in order to come to grips with it, but it would be a great help if we had even half of that number, and we are not going to have that.</p><p> There are a number of things that need to be done as a matter of urgency.  First, we must discover how it is proposed to fund any major housing project.  There are a number of ways.  Of course, because of the troika, we cannot allow these issues to emerge on the Government's balance sheet, and that creates a problem.  There are other ways, which I have submitted already to various Ministers.  I believe that a Government bond should be launched to deal with specific infrastructural deficits of which this is one.  I believe such a bond could attract funds from private pension funds and savings which currently fall within the remit of DIRT.  The loss in interest to the Exchequer would be very small but a significant positive impact would accrue on two levels, the social housing issue and the employment generated by a serious housing programme.</p><p> In my county, for example, we had a similar situation in the late 1980s.  In the 1980s, we had a large number of people on housing lists which were inherited from another problem of economic downturn.  At that time, the local authority had two systems.  One was direct build of local authority houses, of which they built between 300 and 400 every year and which had the effect of stabilising the housing market.  In addition, the local authority loan system also awarded between 400 and 500 loans each year.  The odd aspect about that was the variety of persons who qualified under those headings.  Young nurses, young garda&iacute; and young public services, to a significant extent, were able to qualify.  In fact, I was in this House for several years and still would have qualified for a local authority loan such was the extent to which that funding was made available at that time.  Wisdom, or what went for it at the time, prevailed in some quarters and it was all changed, there were no, or only a few, local authority houses built, and responsibility was handed over to voluntary housing agencies, all of which are good in their own way and meet a certain part of the market, but are not the answer and do not have the statutory responsibility.  Unfortunately, as a result of these failed policies, we have an intolerable situation.</p><p> As for what we do about it and how quickly, I think the Minister of State is going the right way about it, but this is only the initial stages.  As she will be aware, I would plead that at the earliest opportunity something be done by way of launching a bond, encouraging the launching of a bond or creating a situation whereby funding could be made available from a source that will not be reflected on the Government's balance sheet which we know cannot happen, but will make a serious impact on the number of people currently on local authority housing lists.</p><p> The number on the waiting list is difficult from another perspective as well.  In years gone by, it was a regular occurrence that a mobile home was pulled into somebody's garden at the side of their house and families lived there in those kind of conditions.  That is no longer acceptable.  For a start, it was dangerous.  Many lost their lives or their health because of fire hazards etc.  Most importantly, it was not a resolution to the problem.  The only resolution to the problem at that time was to build the houses or provide loans to people to build them themselves.</p><p> Now we have another problem, that of available land on which to build houses.  We must use legislation that is in place.  I refer to infrastructural deficit legislation which deals with situations where in an emergency - this is an emergency - it can be possible to purchase serviceable land and provide blocks of houses on a planned basis over a four or five year period which would have a sufficient impact on the housing market to achieve two aims - meet the housing needs of those on the housing list and be a stabiliser for house prices.  As long as the considerable numbers - there are approximately 100,000 families - remain on those housing lists, they are in the market seeking accommodation from the private sector, which is fine for the investors.</p><p> Incidentally, I could not help an inward smile in recent weeks when I heard rent prices have gone up by 8%, 10% or whatever when, in fact, they have gone up by 40% in the places that I represent over the past six to eight months.  Unfortunately, that is the way it is.  The reason for the increase is the investors are caught between the lender and their own interests and must jack up rents in order to show the lending institutions they are making a serious effort to repay their borrowings, and as a result the tenants get squeezed.</p><p> In that regard, there are many decent landlords throughout the length and breadth of this country who look after their tenants as if they were their own family and whose only wish is that the property is kept in a good state of repair and that they get a reasonable rent.  They do not hustle tenants around.  They do not target them on a regular basis to increase the rent.  Such landlords are in the minority.  Unfortunately, a trend has developed, in particular over the past 12 months, whereby tenants get notice of the intention of the landlord to recover the property, for instance, to put it on the market, and then the property is re-advertised at, in some cases, double the rent previously being paid.  That is how serious it is.  If that kind of trend continues, it will end in disaster because property prices will go back the way they were previously and we will find ourselves in a situation whereby the lending institutions will continue to lend to fund properties that are already inflated in price.  I totally disagree with the notion put about in some quarters.  It was not 100% mortgages that caused the problem.  It was 100% inflated valuations on properties that caused the problem that we saw emerge over the past number of years.</p><p> What I want to see happen in the shortest possible time is the formulation of a plan to target the numbers on the housing lists in each local authority.  There is quite a variation.  In some parts of the country, the lists are not long.  In Kildare County Council, there are 8,500 at present, and addressing it will take a lot of overhauling.  It is all fine to say there is private property that they can rent or they can go elsewhere.</p><p>It is not so easy for parents with children to go elsewhere.  They generally like to remain within a reasonable distance of their family supports, as they should.  That is particularly so for those who might rely on child-minding facilities from parents or in-laws.  It is obviously a major advantage for them to be able to rely on child-minding facilities from a grandparent, aunt, uncle or other relatives.  Many such issues need to be addressed in the context of housing generally.</p><p> From time to time, we hear criticism that people on local authority lists are in some way a burden on the State, but nothing could be further from the truth.  All those on housing lists want is to be able to have a home of their own.  In years gone by, there are those who suggested that we should be like the rest of Europe, content to live in apartments.  There are a number of reasons that would not work, including the culture of this country and the quality of housing involved.  We have seen numerous instances where the quality of housing deteriorated and did not meet householders' social or economic needs.  In addition, in many instances the space available was so restrictive as to make it virtually impossible to rear a family in such box-type accommodation.</p><p> We need to revert to traditional accommodation, such as an ordinary house that is sufficient to meet people's needs for whatever length of time they wish to remain in it.  A notion has developed over the years that people should be moved regularly from one quality of house to another, but that is absolute nonsense.  Every time one intervenes administratively in anything of that nature, it costs money and causes delays.</p><p> I am sure both the Minister of State and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle can remember a time when a family was reared in their original house.  They were quite happy to upgrade it as time went on and buy out the house themselves, which then became their home.  They were committed to it, invested in it and were proud of it.  They still are, to this day.  Unfortunately, however, the practice of providing homes of that nature is no longer in operation.</p><p> People may say we are living in different times now and cannot do it the way we used to, but that is not true.  If we do not provide an adequate amount of accommodation of sufficient quality to meet the needs of our growing population, we will have a dissatisfied community which is not a good way to proceed.  Therefore, the sooner we recognise that we must revert to traditional means of meeting the housing needs of our population, the better.</p><p> I congratulate the Minister of State on recognising that and doing it.  I regret that the proposed numbers are not higher, although I know the reasons for that.  That is why I have suggested we should examine the possibility of a bond, which is the answer.  It has been used in the past as a way of doing something about the housing issue.</p><p> There were glitches in the past that could have been resolved but were not.  For example, the shared ownership loan scheme is a disaster because the rules were changed halfway through.  Initially, the scheme was designed so that a person could borrow part of the equity of the house and have the remainder of it repaid on the basis of rent with a local authority.  The condition was that the remaining rental part could be repaid within a 25 year period.  However, the rules were changed and some genius came up with the idea that they should buy out the second part of the equity within 25 years.  That is not what was originally proposed, as everybody in this House knows, but some clever genius decided to slip that into the mix along the way.  It had the result of penalising people in that income category.  They have been the worst hit group in society for the past ten years because they have had to pay more interest and ever-increasing repayments but got little in return.  It was a disgraceful way to treat people who followed the rules as best they could.  They set about purchasing their homes but were frustrated at every turn.</p><p> I hope the Minister of State will keep this in mind in dealing with the current situation.  The problem now is bigger than it ever was before.  It will fall to the Minister of State to deal with it because nobody else will do so.  That will be her legacy when she goes before the people in a few years time, as I and every other Deputy must do.  The greatest accolade for the Minister of State would be if she could say she tackled and resolved the housing crisis.</p><p> There are those who say they would do it differently, but I would like to hear what they are going to do and when they propose to do it.  It should be remembered that there are 100,000 people with no long-term accommodation prospects.  That has a disruptive potential for society.  We cannot go on that way, so we must accept responsibility that those families are in need of rehousing now.  It is a bit like someone in severe pain being put on a waiting list for an operation.  Who wants to be on a waiting list when suffering severe pain?  Similarly, who wants to be on a housing waiting list for five, seven or ten years?  Many people have been on local authority housing lists for up to ten years.</p><p> Every day in my constituency a number of families become homeless and have nowhere to go.  It is an appalling legacy of the people who planned housing.  I will not name names but we all know who they are.  There have been reports on housing in this country to beat the band and we know where they went.  I am amazed that nobody has come forward to say they were wrong and it did not work.  Everything they said was wrong and the expert opinion was rubbish.  The fact is, however, that people are on waiting lists with very little prospect of being accommodated.  The only prospect is what the Minister of State can do now to resolve the matter.</p><p> I have listened to some of those who spoke in this debate and were critical of the Minister of State, but it is grossly unfair.  She inherited something she did not create.  Some may say she is in Government now and should deal with it, but that is utter hypocrisy.  The Minister of State was not handed funding by anybody when she took office.  Nobody said: &quot;Here's a cheque.  This is how we're going to solve the housing problem that you inherited.&quot;</p><p> A fair amount of soul-searching has to be undertaken with a view to setting down markers, outlining a programme, dealing with the issue by setting annual targets, and achieving them.  We must not avoid the issue, which has happened for the past 12 years at least.  The previous administration avoided the issue, pretended it was not there and hoped the private sector would deal with it.  It was handed over to the private sector which depended on the markets.  They did all the things that did not work.</p><p> I am trying to be as constructive as I can.  The Minister of State inherited an appalling situation for which she bears no responsibility.  I am glad she is making this foray in trying to deal with the situation.  All the support and help that should be available to her will be forthcoming from Members of this House.</p></speech>

We have had Leaders' Questions, Topical Issues, Other Questions and much media attention.  The one thing on which we can agree is that there is a crisis which requires prompt attention so people feel a resolution is coming.  Although the housing needed cannot be built overnight, if people see steps being taken and can feel confident there is a resolution, it would go a long way.</p><p> The facts, figures and statistics on the extent of homelessness are staggering.  The picture of homelessness is changing from the sad, stereotypical minority of single men with mental health or addiction issues who have fallen on hard times.  The homeless are very different now and include people and families who in other times would never have been in a crisis situation.  It results from unemployment, negative equity and insufficient funding to the local authorities and housing agencies to answer those needs.</p><p> I have spoken on this before and identified that local authorities do not have enough housing to meet demand.  Movement on the number of voids in my constituency is not prompt enough.  I see it constantly in Dublin Central.  There was insufficient funding for social housing and some of those contracted to build housing did not fulfil the regulations on social housing.  In the private rental market rents are rising and there are other factors which cause landlords to issue notices to quit, which is putting further pressure on the housing services.  Organisations do their best to source emergency accommodation so at least people are safe, warm and have a roof over their heads, but it is often unsuitable for families.</p><p> One solution is to give local authorities enough funding to make a difference, which means funding for those voids, and it must happen now.  Some money is available, but this must move very quickly because of the extent of the problem.  I see perfectly good accommodation boarded up.  It is costly to board a house up and the longer it is left, the more it costs to renovate it.  We have the workforce with the skills and we need to use them before they have all emigrated.  We may have a problem in the future because we have insufficient training for young apprentices in construction skills.  When I spoke on the Private Members' business I said rent supplement should never have been reduced without limiting the rents landlords can impose.  Some landlords do not want rent allowance and that is discriminatory.</p><p> I note the three key elements of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, namely, a legislative basis for the new housing assistance payment, HAP; the new tenant purchase scheme for local authority tenants; and the reform of the process for terminating tenancies.  In her speech, the Minister of State said she believed this would bring about the most radical reform of public housing support, but, unfortunately, it does not get to the crux of the most serious problem, namely, the lack of housing stock and opening up those voids.</p><p> The Minister of State has listed anti-social behaviours that merit terminations of tenancies and repossessions, namely, vacancy, squatting, anti-social behaviour, the death of a tenant or consistent failure to pay rents.  I am in frequent contact with Dublin City Council's housing service.  I acknowledge its flexibility in working out suitable and sustainable payment agreements with tenants who get into arrears.  I was part of the Dublin City Council group that examined anti-social behaviour and put together the protocol.  It was difficult because we all have different ideas of what anti-social behaviour is, and it can depend on one's age.  We strove for a prompt and fair system where communities have been devastated by anti-social behaviour, particularly drug dealing and drug pushing.  I have seen too much of the devastation it has caused where it is not addressed as soon as it is brought to the attention of the authorities.</p><p> The local authority has a process, albeit a slow one, for dealing with tenants who engage in anti-social behaviour.  In the north inner city there is a very effective community policing forum which works directly between the community, local authority and garda&iacute; in a confidential way and it has been very proactive in preventing issues from escalating.  This aspect of the Bill does not address the private rental sector.  In my constituency there are landlords who do not care what type of tenant they take and will not address other residents' issues about the behaviour of those tenants.</p><p> There are cases in which grandparents have brought up grandchildren for a variety of reasons, and when the grandparents die, those children, now adults, are moved from what was their home due to their changing needs and circumstances.  There should be some flexibility on that.  If a local authority tenant is evicted, the local authority is still responsible for housing him or her, and that creates a need for accommodation.  The Bill addresses landlord compliance on accommodation standards and taxation.  We are told that the housing authority will inspect the accommodation before or after the tenancy commences.  That could be problematic and the inspection should occur before the tenant moves in.  There must be a robust system to ensure tenants go into accommodation that is up to standard.  Tenants have gone into appalling accommodation, and, equally, some have left what was perfectly good accommodation in an appalling state.  We must examine the responsibilities of both tenants and landlords.  We do not want to return to last year's figures which showed that over 90% of rented accommodation in Dublin did not meet basic standards and that 75% of landlords were splitting their houses into flats illegally.  There must be provision for subletting by tenants, which is leading to overcrowding and health and safety issues.</p><p> We need a system in place with equal regard for the rights and responsibilities of both tenant and landlord.  How will landlords be encouraged to join the scheme when they are doing their best to get out of schemes and are not accepting rent allowance or RAS payments?  How can we ensure landlords will continue their discrimination and not get involved in the HAP?  The Department of Social Protection asked Daft.ie to remove its rent allowance filter but the company made the point that when the prospective tenant talks to the landlord he or she must answer whether rent allowance is acceptable.  There is a need to incentivise landlords to participate in the scheme and accept the housing assistance payment.</p><p> The Bill is very positive in facilitating tenants who can sustain a mortgage payment to become home owners.  The new scheme factors in the length of the tenancy, and that is positive.  The HAP does not specify rent limits, which could be problematic, and there is a need for a review process to allow for changes in the rental market.  Limits on the rent allowance or the HAP are acceptable only if rents are also limited.  Although the Minister of State said the HAP will be better for tenants, landlords and local authorities, there is a significant question around the resources and the extra work expected of the local authorities.  Given that they have been subject to cuts and have lost staff, I question how they will be able to cope with this in their understaffed and underresourced state.</p><p> While there are many positive aspects to the Bill, the essential problems of rising rents and accommodation unfit for habitation will continue.  We need more robust legislation on that.  Demand for housing will remain unmet.  There is concern for the housing charities regarding financing and the change from the 100% capital grant scheme to a loan regime.  I was a member of the Constitutional Convention, which recommended the Constitution be amended to include economic, social and cultural rights encompassing a specific right to housing.  If that were moved and the Government took it on board it would be an achievement on paper.  However we still need the resources to back up that right.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill, as it deals with certain issues that must be tackled.  I have spoken to the Minister of State about these on many occasions, as well as her predecessor as Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose.</p><p>  The first matter is the termination of local authority tenancies where tenants have been extremely difficult.  I support this provision, albeit reluctantly, as I do not like the idea of anybody being thrown out of a house.  Nevertheless, I have witnessed the hell which neighbours of really difficult tenants have gone through.  Night after night they are unable to sleep and they can be threatened and subject to all kinds of abuse.  Termination of a tenancy should be and is a last resort but it is important that the option is there for the good of the neighbours, who may be decent tenants or home owners.  It is important that we have such a provision, although I know it has had to be revisited because of the difficulties which certain county councils - including the council where I live - have had.</p></speech>

I will terminate my comments sooner because Deputy Penrose is a much greater expert in this area than I am.  I hope these provisions will stand up when challenged, as it is important for the sake of those who live around such extremely difficult tenants.  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider if it is possible to have a similar provision where people in private rented accommodation on the housing list are causing hell for people in private estates.  That issue also must be tackled as it is a problem in certain estates.</p><p>  I have very mixed views about the tenant purchase process.  On one level it is a very good idea because it encourages a tenant to take a greater interest in a house and surroundings etc. but we must tread carefully.  I would be a full supporter of the scheme if for every tenant who purchased a house there would be a new dwelling built for others who needed to rent from a local authority.  The reality is that has not always been the case.  I ask the Minister of State to consider carefully how things are going in that regard.</p><p>  I am pleased the housing assistance payment, HAP, is being brought under local authority control.  It is good that direct payment to landlords is to be introduced, whether they are a county council or a private landlord.  I am aware of people who get into financial difficulty and are then left in a position where they could face eviction.  It is far better that people would not be allowed get into that position.  We need to consider carefully what will happen to anybody who is evicted as I presume they would have to be housed again.  It is important such people are not housed in an immediate neighbourhood where they would have caused great problems.  It is a tricky matter and we must consider how it can be dealt with.  It is important that people on the housing list and in private housing are not effectively excluded from taking up employment, and I am glad the Minister of State is addressing this issue, which has led to a poverty trap for people over the years.</p><p>  I shall make a couple of general comments on housing before handing over to my much more distinguished colleague, Deputy Penrose.  I sat in this Chamber the other day when the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson replied to the Minister of State, and I was absolutely staggered by his attack as, in many ways, the policy that party introduced after 1997 is one of the problems which led us to where we are today, with an insufficient supply of council housing.  In effect, Fianna F&aacute;il left it to private landlords - who are mainly amateur landlords - to house people.  It will take us quite some time to achieve the goal but it is important we move away from that process, as it puts people in a very vulnerable position.  We can see to a major extent how many people are now losing their accommodation because a landlord is in trouble with a mortgage, for example, and is obliged to sell the property.  Through no fault of their own, the tenants would be obliged to move in such cases.  We should try to move away from amateur landlords to a much more satisfactory process.</p><p>  I welcome the Government's initiative with the construction programme, and the faster this gets under way, the better.  This applies both to private and social housing.  As we know, there are people homeless or living in hotels today who should not be.  We are in the midst of an emergency so I ask the Minister of State to consider temporary emergency accommodation while we wait for long-term accommodation to come on stream.  It takes approximately three years from the time plans are initiated to get to when houses can be occupied, and there is a need to consider exactly how much temporary emergency accommodation must be provided.  That should be brought about as rapidly as possible.</p></speech>

With well over 100,000 of our fellow citizens languishing on housing lists across the country, it is incumbent on us all, in a non-partisan way, to set out in a focused and detailed manner how to tackle this important issue.</p><p>  This is one of the key commitments to reform and it was announced by me in June 2011 with a policy statement prepared at the time.  I salute the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, for bringing forward this legislation at this juncture, as it is critical in the context of the current housing position.  I benefitted when my late parents were allocated a local authority house in 1960 and value the role of local authorities in ensuring the provision of proper and affordable housing to many thousands of families across the Irish landscape.  Until the late 1970s we not only had to pay a rent, collected on a biweekly basis, but also had to twice yearly pay rates levied in July and December.  I recall my late parents rearing two pigs to sell at the end of June through the late Matt Slevin, a pig dealer, with the money paid over in rates.  For Christmas my late mother would rear turkeys, which were sold at the turkey show in Ballinacarriga.  That was the second moiety, and Santa did not come into the equation because the rates had to be paid directly to the local authority.</p><p>That was for a rented house.  We were not protesting about those charges.  We were glad to have a roof over our heads, provided by the State and we acknowledged and valued it as such.  We had to hand dig a trench 500 m to 600 m long in 1970 to bring down the water from the village as the house did not have a running water supply at the time.  We harvested roof water prior to that for washing and carried water for domestic consumption from a private well situated across a neighbour&rsquo;s field.</p><p>I am glad to have seen over the past 20 years the huge improvements in the provision and standard of local authority housing.  It galled me that at a time of apparent plenty in the Celtic tiger years there was an effort to privatise or outsource the provision of accommodation for those on council housing lists.  At a time when we should have launched a big programme of house building for local authorities we took it away from local authorities as if it was anathema to them to do that.  This was done by way of various schemes.  We spend over &euro;500 million a year on rent supplement which creates its own problems.  It made the private sector the <i>de facto</i>solution to the housing crisis.  It was the antithesis of proper strategic planning by the State, which allowed a black hole open up and swallow a lot of money that could more profitably have been put into house-building.  If even &euro;1 billion a year had been spent on house building, it would have made a significant impact.</p><p>The policy of using the private sector must be reversed and the State should return to what is fundamental Labour Party policy, the construction of thousands of houses across the country, to replenish the housing stock and provide much needed employment in rural areas.  This must be a central tenet of the review of social policy later this year.  We are constrained by economic parameters and the need to achieve a debt-GDP ratio of 3% which circumscribes our ability to raise the necessary finance to undertake a significant house-building programme at this juncture.  To get around this we must be innovative.  We must reach out and encourage local authorities to set up companies, to make off balance sheet provision of financing.  This must be explored seriously and new models of creative funding have to be considered to put this urgent house-building programme in place.  Let us leave a real Labour Party legacy and policy mark on this pivotal role in the Department, by helping people who are unable to provide housing or accommodation from their own resources to do so.  </p><p>I had also focused on housing supports, in particular the rent supplement scheme which was operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Many organisations involved in social policy indicated this was contributing to a poverty or social welfare trap.  It started out as a short-term support mechanism but is now a long-term one.  People who took up work immediately lost the rent supplement.  I was of the view that should not happen.  I think the Minister of State is of the same view.  To encourage people to take up work, one must not put obstacles or impediments in their way but instead facilitate that transition by continuing the payment for two or three years on a declining basis, much like the back-to-work allowance.  That would encourage people to take up work.  If people find their weekly calculations are in the negative, that would be an impediment on ordinary economic grounds.</p><p>I commenced a review of the rent support among other issues.  I want to see local authorities become the repository for the administration of the rent supplement system.  This is the thrust of the housing assistance payment proposal.  It will be more equitable and efficient if it encourages that.  I envisage landlords will receive their rent supplement directly from local authorities on condition they are tax compliant.  This would eliminate the problem identified by many landlords whose tenants failed to hand over the rent supplement payment and fallen into arrears.  In the past two weeks a landlord came to me because a tenant on rent supplement was in arrears for thousands of euro.  That is not fair to the landlords, many of whom provide very important accommodation.  We would be in an awful state if we did not have this level of accommodation available.  I envisage that every three months the local authorities will send details of rent supplement they pay to landlords to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is how it would work.  They also have to protect tenants.  It is a two-way street.  Rent supplement should only be paid in respect of accommodation that is suitable and in a full and proper state of repair.  This will create a more equal and fair social housing system.  The local authority will be the overarching supervisor.  Why have bits and pieces of housing provision all over the place?  One had to go to the community welfare office to get one form stamped then back to the local authority to get another one stamped.  One would want to be a lamplighter to keep that up. </p><p>There will also be a direct deduction of rental contributions due to local authorities from the welfare payments of HAP recipients and local authority tenants.  This will help eliminate the build-up of rent arrears.  The local authorities were resolute in their view that this would have to be central to the administration system and I note it has been included in the Bill. </p><p>The Bill also deals with several other areas in need of reform.  Section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 was the legal mechanism by which local authorities repossessed houses from tenants fell foul of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 where factual disputes arose concerning the reason for the evictions as sought.  Part 2 of the Bill sets out new procedures for repossessing local authority dwellings where serious breaches of tenancy occur, which I am glad to say includes anti-social behaviour.  Regrettably, this has become a very serious issue and has caused great misery and wrought great havoc for many people who have lived for years as part of a community in a housing estate and want peaceful and quiet enjoyment of their buildings without let or hinder or interruption.  It is important to protect people who are law-abiding.  There should be a remedy for people who do not obey the law to ensure the protection of the majority who pay their rent and are glad to have the house and a roof over their heads. </p><p>The new tenant purchase scheme was long awaited and Part 3 provides for an incremental purchase scheme for existing houses which covers local authority homes, apart from those captured by the Housing Act 2009.  The Minister of State will deal with discounts, method of determining the purchase price and the period of the charging order.  What other criteria for discounts does the Minister of State have in mind?  The charge will be made in equal annual portions over the charge period.  If the house is to be sold during the charge period by the tenant purchaser, the local authority will have first option to buy it back at the then prevailing market value, less what is owed in the incremental purchase scheme.  It is important that the local authority has that opportunity.</p><p>A couple in Longford have contacted me frequently about a problem in the tenant purchase scheme.  They have lived for 25 or 30 years in their house and want to buy but cannot get a loan from the local authority because they receive an invalidity pension.  The purchase charge they would have to pay is less than their rent.  The local authority is fully conversant with their situation and is aware of their ability to discharge the rent over the years and would readily facilitate them with a loan if it could do so, it is not permitted to do so.  It goes to the Housing Agency for evaluation but the minute it sees that a person is in receipt of social welfare, it rejects the loan application.</p><p>The housing agencies are examining this problem.  We cannot preclude people who live in a house from the possibility of buying it.  It ignores people&rsquo;s equity in the house when, after being tenants for 15 or 20 years, they would qualify for substantial discounts.  It makes no sense and is discriminatory, especially when the tenants have a clean record for payment of rent over many years, without arrears or default.  Surely all factors should be taken into account and evaluated in the assessment and determination process.</p><p>I could not believe what I read in a recent report that some local authority houses were vacant for a year or 14 months.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s recent announcement of additional funding which has been allocated to address the problem of council houses which have been vacant for a long time.  This process must be speeded up because so many are languishing on the waiting lists.  It also makes for good estate management and gets the stock back into operation and generates rental income for local authorities.  There must be a streamlined approach to tackling the voids in each local authority.  Very often, however, local authorities go overboard and do not allocate a house even when it is in substantially good repair.  It might need painting or something else that a tenant will do.  The local authorities want everything to be in pristine condition.  It should be allocated if a tenant takes on the responsibility of painting it.  If it is boarded up it stays that way for a long time and becomes a focus of anti-social behaviour.  The faster it is turned around the better.</p><p>The level of rents, about which the Acting Chairman spoke eloquently and with more knowledge than I have, and the pace of the increases in recent times is causing significant problems.  Notwithstanding legal issues which surround rent control, there must be a review of this issue, and at least the possibility of the linking of rents to the consumer price index would ensure that rents cannot be increased by more than the cost of living increases.  Perhaps in this context we could examine what prevails in other European countries.</p><p> On the question of the housing adaptation grants, the funding for which is &euro;35 million or thereabouts, I remember fighting tooth and nail to protect that when the troika appeared with all kinds of proposals to slash spending.  This is something that is germane and is in my DNA.  It is probably the most cost effective, efficient grant scheme operated by the Minister of State's Department.  It represents outstanding  value for money, has a very positive cost benefit analysis ratio and the impact upon the morale of the recipients who get an opportunity to stay within their own home and environment is incalculable.  It saves a great deal of money for the State, considering the cost that would be incurred if somebody had to have recourse to a nursing home place, which would necessitate significant payments each week under the fair deal scheme.  I urge that additional money be sought for this scheme as it plays a very important role in helping people stay in their own homes.</p><p> I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing forward the Bill and I look forward to seeing further improvements by way of Committee Stage amendments.  The Minister of State should be open to considering various amendments because this is an issue that transcends politics.  It is one in respect of which each and every one of us has a role to play in ensuring that our people are housed.  It is something I feel we would almost elevate to a legal right, that of having a proper house and accommodation.</p></speech>

He has spoken a great deal of sense in regard to this legislation and I cannot disagree with any of the points he made.  All of us who are dealing with housing issues on a day-to-day basis would echo what he said.  He has a clear understanding of the issues.</p><p>  I welcome this Bill.  It is a positive development and it contains many positive aspects.  In particular, I want to select one issue, the mandatory payment of rents through social welfare.  It is a positive development in that it will ensure hopefully that people will not fall into substantial arrears.  There are cases where families have fallen into arrears running to thousands of euro.  They have difficulties managing funds and many of those households are probably also dealing with many other social issues.  In tandem with that, we must radically overhaul the rent supplement system and ensure that moneys are paid directly to the landlord.  This will ensure that the money is paid to the landlord and if an overpayment is made, it will be far easier to recoup it from a landlord than it would be from a tenant.  The process that will apply will be similar to the scheme in respect of social welfare.  The balance of the payment that will be made by the tenant to the landlord will be paid directly to the local authority and the local authority will then pay it on to the landlord, which is the process that applies to the rental accommodation scheme.</p><p>  I wish to touch on the rental accommodation scheme which, in principle, is a good scheme but there are problems with it.  I know of a case where a young family was approved by a local authority - not my local authority - for  the rental accommodation scheme in a property.  Families have to source the properties now rather than the local authorities.  The previous tenant had been rehoused by the local authority because it was felt that the house was unfit for human habitation.  That should not happen under any circumstances and it should not be facilitated by a local authority.  We need to get back to a situation where there is proper monitoring of these properties prior to the tenant going into a property in the first place.  It needs to be made clear that the lease is a long-term one and not only for summer months and that account must be taken of the winter months.  It should be explained to tenants the downfalls in regard to a particular type of heating system and the impact of the lack of insulation, if a house is not insulated, during the winter months.  It is too late when a family is in a house for six months and finds out that there is a problem with the house.</p><p>  Another problem with the rental accommodation scheme, which discourages people from taking it up, is that people are taken off the housing list.  They cannot get a long-term local authority house if they are on the rental accommodation scheme.  That is a disincentive and it needs to be examined. </p><p>  I want to pick up on the issue of anti-social behaviour which has been raised and provision in this respect has been made in the legislation, for which I commend the Minister of State.  However, it does not address the issue in regard to rent supplement scheme.  As far as the Department is concerned, this is an issue for the Department of Social Protection and even thought that Department is paying more than &euro;400 million a year in rent supplement for 86,000 houses, it is saying that the issue of anti-social behaviour is not an issue for it, rather it a matter for the landlord.  There are communities who are being terrorised because of one delinquent tenant in a private housing estate or in a private accommodation in a public estate as the landlord is not prepared to take action in regard to one tenant.  Even though the State is bankrolling that tenancy it is not prepared to intervene.  That must stop.  People cannot be left in a situation where families are allowed to run riot purely because they are being funded by the State, yet the State is not prepared to intervene and tell them that they will be out on their ear unless they behave in a normal manner.</p><p>  Another issue I wish to raise in regard to the rent supplement scheme is the fact that the thresholds have not been revised.  We have huge problems because of that in parts of the country and it is not isolated to the east coast.  It is a  problem in my constituency where families cannot get accommodation because of the rent thresholds that are in place.   It is not only an issue in County Roscommon, it is also is an issue across the border in County Westmeath.  It is forcing families out of private rented accommodation into emergency accommodation.  I do not believe in the current economic circumstances there is any justification for our spending &euro;2,740 every day on bed and breakfasts and hotels to provide accommodation for families.  It is not good enough for the Minister for Social Protection to say that we will review the rent supplement thresholds and we will have a decision by the end of the year.  Those families need to get stable accommodation now.  They should not be housed in bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation and we should not be paying &euro;2,740 every day to pick up the tab for those bed and breakfasts and hotels.  There is no justification for that and it needs to stop now.</p><p>   Another issue associated with an overhaul of the rent supplement scheme that needs to be addressed relates to the county boundaries.  I am not the only one proposing this in that the Minister's officials have recommended that changes need to take place in regard to county boundaries.  I will give the example of the community of Monksland on the edge of Athlone is in County Roscommon.  The rent threshold for a couple with two children is &euro;410 but if they go over the white line on the middle of the road the rent threshold is &euro;110 a month higher on the other side of the white line.  As bad all that is, if one travels 14 miles up the road from there to Ballinasloe, the differential between getting accommodation on either side of the white line in the middle of the road is &euro;315 a month of a difference.  That is causing geographical discrimination for people in County Roscommon who cannot access accommodation in their own county.  It has an impact in regard to schools, shops, community services, communities, local sports clubs and the GAA in that children cannot attend their local school or live in their community where there parents come from because of a discrepancy of &euro;315 or because there happens to be a white dividing line in the middle of road, with the requisite extra being made available for accommodation on one side of the white line.  The Minister's officials have written to her asking her to deal with this anomaly and to date she has not been prepared to do so.  The failure to revise the rent allowance system is causing unnecessary hardship, causing homelessness and forcing families on to the road.</p><p>There is no justification for that.</p><p> Based on the local government report for 2012 which is the most up-to-date available to me, one in 18 local authority houses was vacant.  Four of every ten of those houses require major refurbishment.  All of us are knocking on doors around the country at the moment.  It is soul destroying to go into local authority estates and see vacant houses that are perfectly suitable to accommodate people and do not require major refurbishment.  However, it is completely devastating, as the Minister of State will know better than anyone, to see houses left to rack and ruin in local authority estates.  They bring down the estate and demoralise the whole community.  Given the housing crisis this issue needs to be addressed.  We have more vacant houses than we had in 2008 and yet far more people are on the housing lists today than in 2008.</p><p> I will make a suggestion to the Minister of State.  In numerous cases families are allocated a house but the local authority does not have the resources to employ the painter or carpenter to carry out minor repairs to the houses.  Many local authority houses fall into that category.  If the incoming tenant is a qualified painter or carpenter or has a next of kin who is a qualified painter or carpenter we could come to some kind of arrangement for minor works.  I accept that for electrical works etc. we need to have a certified competent contractor who is recognised by the local authority.  However, with minor works surely we could have some mechanism where there would be a discount on the rent over a period of time and the tenant could then go in and carry out those minor repairs and have that property occupied rather than having it left idle resulting in windows being broken and eventually it being boarded up for months or years and families being left in private rented accommodation.  There are plenty of tradesmen available who even on a voluntary basis would be willing to help out in that regard.  Surely we could have some kind of joined-up thinking in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500017#P00200"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  I commend the Minister of State on the work she has done and the huge amount of work that has gone on behind the scenes in bringing it before the House.</p><p>  A number of elements of the Bill will have a very significant impact, including the new tenant purchase scheme, the housing assistance payment scheme, provision for direct deductions of rent contributions from social welfare payments, and the strengthened local authority powers to deal with individuals engaged in anti-social behaviour in local authority housing estates.  These elements are all crucial and long overdue.  The Bill's early enactment is essential to provide a procedure for housing authorities to recover possession of a dwelling where there has been a serious breach of the tenancy agreement, to restore to local authority tenants the opportunity to purchase their homes at a substantial discount on an incremental basis, and to enable the housing assistance scheme to be rolled out across the country without delay.</p><p>  Based on the latest figures, 6,144 people are on the Kildare County Council housing list, which we can all agree is too many.  Most of these people are on rent allowance.  The rent allowance caps, which were mentioned earlier, represent a very significant issue in a number of the cases I deal with.  In my area the cap for a couple with no children is &euro;500 a month, for a couple with one child it is &euro;650 and parents with two children it is &euro;700.  Neither love not money would get a family two or three-bed accommodation in the Newbridge area for less than &euro;900, if they can find a landlord willing to let to rent-allowance tenants.</p><p>  The other very significant difficulty is that many landlords for one reason or another would prefer not to deal with rent allowance.  In my experience the vast majority of people in receipt of rent allowance have been excellent tenants - perhaps even better than some tenants who were not on rent allowance.  However, a small minority have given the scheme a bad name.  The scheme facilitated that by having the rent paid directly to the tenant.  I have come across cases where landlords have not received rent for a few months and when they checked up discovered that the tenant was in receipt of the rent allowance but was pocketing the money.  So not only was the landlord at a loss in not getting it and might have to spend months going through the very expensive process of getting the tenant evicted, during that time the tenant was not only availing of free accommodation but was also pocketing State money, which is unbelievably frustrating.</p><p>  We need serious reform of the PRTB.  On the one hand people are saying landlords do not want to take in tenants, but landlords are not getting the cover from the PRTB, which is very much tenant focused.  There is a lack of balance and landlords have the sense that they are wasting their time going to the PRTB.  While I know that matter is not one for this Bill, it is a very significant issue.</p><p>  I welcome the changes regarding the payment of rent allowance directly to landlords.  It is just as important that the pendulum does not swing too far the other way.  The landlords need to be tax compliant, need to have everything done right and need to be good landlords, and they need to be punished if not.  I believe the balance went too far the other way.</p><p>  Linked to that is the mandatory deduction of rent from social welfare payments.  It has been crazy that where for social or other reasons tenants may have allowed significant rent arrears to build up, on the one hand the local authority is paying considerable money in pursuing these individuals for the rent arrears and on the other hand from the same coffers the State is paying them social welfare, with one not being able to talk to the other.  This is a common-sense practical approach.</p><p>  I welcome the changes to deal with anti-social behaviour.  In my experience some of the worst cases of anti-social behaviour have happened in private rented dwellings where a landlord who may not live in the estate or the area has turned a blind eye and taken in tenants whom most of the neighbours would not want, as they know there may be a difficulty with them.</p><p>  I know of people living in a private estate in south Kildare with a very large mortgage and in negative equity.  They cannot let their children out to play because of anti-social behaviour.  They are almost like prisoners in their own home.  I know that on the Minister of State's visit to south Kildare some of the cases were highlighted to her.  I have sympathy for the Garda which is very restricted in what it can do.  As was highlighted during the Minister of State's visit to the constituency, we need a multi-agency approach, involving social workers, garda&iacute; and others.  The garda&iacute; alone cannot deal with it and they are at the end of the problem in trying to deal with it in many cases.</p><p>  The previous tenant purchase scheme closed in December 2012.  It is very important for the many people who have had a local authority house for some time and would like to buy it out.  I very much welcome that.  With 6,144 people on the Kildare County Council housing list we cannot afford to lose stock.  A reduction in our overall stock would not be good and we would pay a price for that.</p><p>  I know we are moving much more local authorities towards long-term leasing, which concerns me somewhat because we may be storing up problems when in 15 or 20 years' time these houses need to be turned around and restored to the condition they were at the start.  I would like to see much more social housing built.  As a part of any stimulus it would definitely impact on our construction industry in a positive and measured manner in an area where we have a very significant need.  At the heart of this is that housing is the most basic essential thing we do.  Back to the time of the tenements and the establishment of the State, housing has always been a very basic social need and it remains critical.</p><p>  I commend the Bill and I commend the work the Minister of State has done to get it to this point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500018#Q00600"><p>I have no doubt the staff there work exceptionally hard and diligently but the difficulty is that they are doing the Government's bidding in regard to the removal of discretionary medical cards.  A Private Members' motion this week and one last year highlighted, and advocacy groups continually highlight, the fact discretionary medical cards are being removed and yet the Government denies there has been any change in policy.  Even as late as last year, it was in the HSE service plan that there would be a removal of discretionary medical cards.</p><p>  The reason I raise it today is that we have raised it with the Taoiseach and on Private Members' business and the T&aacute;naiste is our last chance to get this Government to accept there has been a change and to reverse that change.  Children with Down's syndrome have been asked whether their condition has improved, as have people with motor neurone disease.  Let us be very clear - Down's syndrome is with one for life and motor neurone disease takes one's life and yet people are being asked these questions on a continual basis.  In the House yesterday, in response to a question by Deputy Martin, the Taoiseach stated, &quot;there is not an attempt here to show lack of understanding, compassion or consideration for people who have these challenges&quot; and that it was a question of being fair.  What is unfair is asking the oldest and the sickest to pay free GP care for those under the age of six which will, in many cases, be given to healthy and wealthy people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500018#Q00700"><p>I accept there is a problem with the way in which the review of discretionary medical cards is being carried out.  The number of medical cards which is in circulation now is significantly higher than it was a number of years ago.  There has been a 46% increase in the total number of medical cards.  Almost 600,000 additional medical cards are available now than in 2008, for example.  As I understand it, and I have spoken to the Minister about this, 96% of those reviewed to date have retained their medical card.</p><p>  There are a number of problems, as I see it.  The first problem is that when a letter comes in the door stating that the medical card will be reviewed, it causes worry and upset and a better way has to be found of conducting the actual review.  The second problem arising is that people who are reviewed once are very often reviewed again a number of times.  In particular for older people, it constitutes a degree of harassment where somebody receives letters again and again within a very short period of time essentially asking the same questions.  There is no justification whatever for somebody getting a letter asking if his or her child still has Down's syndrome or somebody getting a letter asking if he or she still has motor neurone disease.  That type of approach must be dealt with.</p><p>  In terms of solutions, a number of things can be done.  Where a review takes place, there should be a freeze on that person being reviewed again for a period of time.  Where it is proposed to withdraw a medical card, a reasonable period of time should be given to that person to enable them to appeal the decision and to make a case, if there are exceptional circumstances in the household or exceptional medical circumstances, for example.  Perhaps a small additional inquiry should be made.  I know of a case, for example, where a medical card was withdrawn where the person had moved to a nursing home.  Clearly, that could be established by a small additional inquiry.</p><p>  Where the medical card is being withdrawn and where issues arise in regard to access to services, which is an issue for people, the Minister has committed himself to ensuring that access to services is made available.  Again, a period of time should be allowed for that.</p><p>  I am very glad the Joint Committee on Health and Children is in Finglas today talking with the staff dealing with the review of the medical cards.  I hope that arising from that visit, it will be possible to progress a number of practical recommendations which can address the kind of problems we all see arise from the review.</p></speech>

That is a central tenet of Government policy in regard to health delivery.  Fairness should be at the heart of any policy.  The Irish people are very fair when it comes to deciding whether free GP care for all those under six should be funded by taking discretionary medical cards from the oldest and the sickest society, which is stated in the HSE service plan and is stated Government policy, namely, that it will reduce the number of discretionary medical cards while announcing that &euro;35 million will be ring-fenced for GP care for those under six.  By ring-fencing that money for GP services, the Government is taking it from those who are the sickest and the oldest in our society who need it most.</p><p>  Even at this late stage, would the Government not revisit that policy where it is taking cards from children with Down's syndrome, who are over six, elderly people who have life-limiting illnesses and conditions, people with motor neurone disease and people who have had double mastectomies?  What is happening is criminal and yet the Government is saying that the under six policy is one for delivering health care.  It is not, it is the opposite.  </p></speech>

Would the T&aacute;naiste not agree that if the Government is genuinely interested in social solidarity that it should revisit this and ensure there is funding in place for those who need it most?  We can address the issue of universality when conditions improve but in the meantime, we should not ask the old and the sick to pay for this particular policy.</p></speech>

I do not think anyone would justify a situation where, for example, payment is made for medical cards that are either no longer in use or where a person has passed on.  I acknowledge that the way in which the review of medical cards has been conducted has caused and is causing a lot of distress, in particular to elderly people.  I have talked with the Minister about it and the approach I outlined about additional care being taken in terms of the way in which reviews are conducted, and additional time being made available to people where there is a proposal to withdraw a medical card, is the route to go.</p></speech>

However, I wish to step back a couple of weeks to revisit the account of events given by An Taoiseach in respect of his knowledge of the revelations of the practice of taping phone calls to and from Garda stations.  Those matters are the subject of a separate commission of investigation led by Mr. Justice Fennelly.</p><p>  An Taoiseach has stated on the public record that he was first informed of the taping practice on Sunday evening, 23 March, when during a phone conversation with the Attorney General on an unrelated matter, she raised the issue.  The Taoiseach then said that on Monday 24 March he met the Minister for Justice and Equality and Brian Purcell, Secretary General at the Department of Justice and Equality, and that he asked Mr. Purcell to go to see the Garda Commissioner at his home.  We all know that this meeting resulted directly in the subsequent resignation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>  It strikes me that the T&aacute;naiste was left out of the loop in that sequence of events, and that was confirmed again by the subsequent developments around the resignation of the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  I will say no more about that.</p><p>  I have obtained, through a freedom of information request, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s diary from the week in question.  It does indeed refer to a meeting or conversation with the Attorney General on Sunday evening, 23 March, at 5.30 p.m. to be precise.  However, it also contains a reference to an earlier meeting on that Sunday and it reflects that at 7.30 a.m. the Taoiseach met the Minister for Justice and Equality and his officials.  The Taoiseach has made no reference whatsoever to that meeting in his public account of the events or in his account to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I do not keep the Taoiseach&rsquo;s diary.  I do not know what meetings he did or did not have on Sunday 23 March.  With the greatest respect, Deputy McDonald should ask him directly about those issues.</p><p>  What I do know is that the Government took the question of the taping of conversations in Garda stations very seriously.  I had an opportunity to address questions on the issue previously.  I made the point that it is very serious from the point of view of people whose conversations were taped and of garda&iacute; whose conversations might have been taped without their knowledge.  From what we were told at the time, there were a number of taped conversations.  What we have done in respect of that is to establish a formal commission of investigation which is chaired by Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly.  It was established very quickly by the Government on 1 April, very shortly after the information came to light.  The commission has been asked to report back by the end of the year.  A Supplementary Estimate to ensure the commission is able to do its work was passed by this House, and I have no doubt the commission will in any event examine some of the various issues raised by Deputy McDonald this morning.</p></speech>

I am sure he will agree with me that it is very important for the purpose of public confidence, but also for the purpose of the confidence of Members of the D&aacute;il, that we are sure a full account of events as they transpired is given in the House.  People watching as the sequence of events unfolded remarked at the fact that there were information gaps.  The view was that things that were wildly implausible were placed on the record of the House and insisted upon as a full account of events.</p><p>  I have the diary and it says that at 7.30 a.m. on the Sunday the Taoiseach met the Minister for Justice and Equality, who was just back from Mexico, and his officials.  I assume that Brian Purcell, being the most senior official, was present at the meeting.  The T&aacute;naiste clearly had no notice and no knowledge of the meeting.  That is an issue of concern for him.  Given the seriousness of those matters, I would have thought he would have forensically trawled through the sequence of events, and who met who and when, with the Taoiseach.  That is what I would have done if I were in his position.</p><p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste establish for us the following facts?  Why was the meeting scheduled so early on a Sunday morning?  It is not part of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s routine to meet officials at 7.30 a.m. on a Sunday.  We know that because we have his diary.  Did the meeting take place?  It is in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s diary so we presume it did.  Who was at the meeting?  What was discussed at the meeting?  Was the taping of phone calls discussed?  Were issues relating to Commissioner Callinan discussed?  Crucially, why is it that in all the Taoiseach has had to say on these matters to &ldquo;put Paddy in the picture&rdquo;, as he would put it, this particular meeting has been edited out of his script?  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree it is a matter of concern for Members of the D&aacute;il and for the T&aacute;naiste if a meeting at that level was held at the time and he knew nothing about it and neither did we and the D&aacute;il was not informed of it?</p></speech>

Having listened to his response to Deputy McDonald the idea that he is almost taking pride in his total lack of involvement or supposed knowledge of one of the biggest crises in the history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is, to me, absolutely astounding, but we will deal with this later when discussing the Guerin report.</p><p>  I wish to raise an issue which affects every citizen in the State, and one on which the T&aacute;naiste made his political name through his opposition to water charges.  The T&aacute;naiste is no doubt aware that last week Irish Water issued an instruction to all of its contractors to withdraw from the installation of water meters in working class estates and to retreat to the more affluent suburbs where they were less likely to meet resistance, a resistance which was growing and active in Cork and Dublin, no doubt in a vain hope the electorate would forget about this issue.  When the canvassers are gone, the posters are taken down and the recycling bins have been emptied of all of the leaflets homeowners will be faced with another bill when they cannot even meet the ones they have in the first place.  Not just this, but they face the obscenity of footpaths continuing to be dug up to install water meters against the backdrop of a 40% reduction and leakage of expensive treated water, when the same crews, with extra people, could dig up the same streets to repair the network.  This is nothing short of high order environmental vandalism.</p><p>  When the T&aacute;naiste's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was Minister with responsibility for the environment in the 1990s he brought out a KPMG report on the financing of local government in Ireland.  It is a good read and I have it here.  It made the point that domestic water metering was an uneconomic proposition and that water should be funded from central taxation, and so it was decided that local authorities could keep the funds from the motor tax, a source of revenue which has increased four times.  We kept paying it but the Government decided to pilfer the account to pay the national debt.  To add insult to injury this is being dressed up as a conservation measure.  Is it not the case that water charges have nothing to do with the funding of water services but are in fact another tollbooth on public services to pay for the national debt?</p></speech>

The establishment of an independent Garda authority which will be drawn from a broad swathe Irish society, the extension of the whistleblowers legislation to include garda&iacute; and the ability of garda&iacute; to go directly to GSOC if they have complaints are major reforms in the way in which garda&iacute; are managed.  When all of this episode is over these reforms will certainly stand the test of time.</p><p>  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, charging for water is precisely to fund water services and ensure funding is available to deal with the problem of leakages, as we have approximately 40% leakage from the system, the difficulties of boil water notices and the danger that major urban areas including Dublin will find themselves without an adequate supply of water because of the lack of investment in the water system over many years.</p><p>  In introducing the charges we were very mindful to introduce them in a way that is fair and reasonable.  There will be no fixed charge.  There will be no standing charge.  There will be a free household water allowance and an additional allowance of 38,000 litres for each child.  There will also be a household package available to pensioners, carers, those with disabilities and those who qualify for the household benefit package, which will be &euro;100 a year.  There will be a cap on the payment for people who have medical conditions and require the use of additional water.  Charging for water will be on a metered basis, so it will be on a usage basis, which has the double advantage of encouraging conservation of water in the first instance and enabling households to reduce their water bill.</p><p>  Those households which are not metered by the time the charging system comes into effect will have the opportunity of getting a rebate of the charges paid if they are over the amount they have used once the metering system has come into effect.  The charges concerned will be used to provide the funding that Irish water needs to ensure the people of this country have an adequate and safe supply of water for the years ahead.  In addition to this the Government is providing a subsidy to Irish Water of &euro;537 million.</p></speech>

The Government pilfered this account and took money, which we as car owners have continued to pay, from the local authority budgets to pay the national debt.  Now it is looking for it again.  To listen to the T&aacute;naiste one would think the local authorities never fixed a water main or brought in any programmes to remediate.  Is it not the case that under the Government not a single kilometre of water mains has been repaired?  Is it not the case that within a kilometre of this building are massive public buildings where not one measure such as rainwater harvesting or other conservation measures has been imposed?  The local authorities in the greater Dublin area were working on a geographic information system project involving mapping, leakage and telemetry of our water system.  This project cost the taxpayers millions and has involved tens of thousands of staff hours.  It was almost at completion, which would have been brilliant to secure our understanding of our water supply, but Irish Water has axed it.  It will not go ahead because somebody in Irish Water's friend, who works in Bord G&aacute;is, has a different computer system.  What is unfolding in Irish Water will make the HSE look like an efficient fit for purpose organisation.  It is nothing more than a quango lining up our water services to be privatised to Denis O'Brien, who has done the Government some nice favours through his ownership of Independent News and Media.</p></speech>

The engineers and staff of the local authorities who have worked on water down through the years certainly have done a creditable job.  However, there were 34 different water authorities nationwide and just as one would not, these days, have 34 different local distributors of electricity or gas, as was the case in the past when there were local generators and distributors of electricity, it does not make sense in the modern world to have such a multiplicity of deliverers of any utility, including, in this case, water.</p><p>  There are a number of issues pertaining to water that must be addressed, the first of which is the adequacy of the supply.  We have been fortunate and it has been a credit to the local authorities in Dublin that we have not ended up with a water crisis in Dublin.  Over the greater Dublin area, not just the city itself but the greater Dublin catchment area, as the development of the city continued and as it grew, there was insufficient investment in the delivery of water to supply the people adequately.  Consequently, we have been fortunate to avoid a crisis in that regard.  Irish Water will be investing in the delivery to ensure there is an adequate supply of water.  We have not been so fortunate in other cities.  In Galway, for example, people ended up with a serious problem some years ago.  Similar problems exist in other parts of the country, where the quality of water is substandard and this requires investment.  This is why there must be a fund to underpin the spending that must take place to ensure the continuation of an adequate supply of clean water.  The system of charging for water that the Government has brought in, which is based on usage, which takes account of family size and medical conditions as well as people who have problems with ability to pay, is a reasonable arrangement.  Instead of some of the scare stories that are being told to people in this regard, Members need to provide people with the facts.</p></speech>

This is to enable all Members of the House to participate in the election.  As Members are aware, after Easter the D&aacute;il returned one week earlier than was originally scheduled.  The number of days on which the D&aacute;il sits has increased.  The D&aacute;il is scheduled to sit up to the middle of July and I think 16 July is the date that was pencilled in on the document that was circulated.  However, if Members find there is unfinished business at that stage, consideration can be given to perhaps extending the sitting of the D&aacute;il up to the end of July or indeed into August, if necessary.</p></speech>

I now introduce the Bill again.  While it may not have been a road to Damascus change, I think people accept at this stage that there a need for serious reform and the Government has agreed to introduce certain reforms.  It is unfortunate that there was such denial for so long, despite all the evidence that things were not well and that there were many problems.  Sadly, Deputy after Deputy spoke last July to defend the indefensible and claim that everything was great and how dare anyone challenge An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p>I was glad to hear the T&aacute;naiste's strong support for some serious reforms when he stated:<blockquote>It is with some satisfaction that we welcome the decision of Government to set up an authority.  It is a pity that it has taken so long.  It is a pity that the decision was resisted by others for so long but better late than not at all.</blockquote>I realise that his party was in favour of reform in years past but his party's decision to vote against the Bill last July was very disappointing.  However, it is hoped we are heading in the right direction now.  </p><p>I will outline a brief summary of the Bill's intentions.  The Bill provides for the reform of GSOC, an new independent police board and the de-politicisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It will provide for the amendment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to strengthen the independence and impartiality of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in the performance of its functions, recognising that its remit was always intended to be investigatory rather than one of review and oversight.  The admissibility criteria of complaints is widened in regard to time limits and subject matter by the introduction of a third ground of admissibility breach of the newly created code of service.  Members of the commission would be appointed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na independent board rather than the Government.  Section 106 is amended to allow the commission to initiate its own investigations of policies and procedures of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where it sees fit to do so.  Serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may no longer form part of the staff.  There will be mandatory supervision of all investigations arising from complaints.</p><p>The independent police board will have monitoring supervisory and oversight functions over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is hoped that both the composition of the board, the strong functions relating to community engagement and joint policing committees and the reporting obligations of the board to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, will help to strengthen the democratic accountability of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The board aims to promote public confidence and trust in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to re-invigorate the legitimacy of policing by consent in Ireland.  Most people realise at this stage that the root cause of many of the problems that have come light in the past 18 months was the relationship between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner and the lack of a buffer in order to provide an element of accountability, which the Bill will address.</p><p>Professor Dermot Walsh is an expert on policing.  He emphasised that many of the issues we have raised over the past 18 months demonstrate the lack of consistency and fairness in the application of the rule of law in the State by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He also emphasised the lack of Garda management structures and training.  These are much the same criticisms as raised in the Morris tribunal report which showed patterns of failings in Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management.  We hope the Bill will address these issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500022#U02800"><p>I welcome the opportunity to give my response to the report by Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin of his review of the action taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na pertaining to certain allegations.  The report contains deeply disturbing findings.  It raises fundamental issues about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, its investigation of criminal cases and the responses to serious concerns raised about it, Garda management and oversight, basic policing procedures and the role of bodies such as GSOC and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Significant steps must be taken to deal with these issues.  All of the issues which Mr Guerin has found warrant further inquiry, including the individual allegations which have not been properly investigated.  These must be examined by the commission of investigation which he has recommended.</p><p>However, the wider systemic and historical problems revealed must also be tackled by a programme of significant reform, by which I mean that the oversight and governance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be transformed with the establishment of an independent Garda authority; the highest levels of legal support and protection will be given to Garda whistleblowers; the remit, strength and capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission will be enhanced to enable the effective and independent examination of complaints; the filling of the post of Garda Commissioner will be by way of open competition; and a wide range of Garda management, operational and procedural issues will be examined by the independent and expert Garda Inspectorate.</p><p> Allow me to briefly recall how the allegations which led to the report by Mr. Guerin came to be made.  In doing so, I will touch on some of the main points.  The full details of what is a complex history are set out in the report.  In late 2007 and into 2008, Sergeant Maurice McCabe made allegations of Garda misconduct, first to the Garda authorities and then to the Garda Confidential Recipient.  Additional complaints were subsequently made through the Garda Confidential Recipient, many of which involved an alleged lack of supervision, management and oversight by a specific superintendent.  These allegations were investigated by an assistant Garda Commissioner and a chief superintendent.</p><p> In 2009, Sergeant McCabe communicated with the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, expressing concerns about the conduct of the Garda investigation and asking for independent oversight of it.  He was advised then that the conduct of the investigation was a matter for the Garda Commissioner in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Minister had no role in directing the Commissioner in such operational matters.</p><p> In January 2012, the then Minister for Justice and Equality received a letter via the Garda Confidential Recipient containing broadly the same allegations as those covered by the Garda investigation, with additional complaints against the assistant Garda Commissioner who carried out the investigation and the Garda Commissioner for permitting the superintendent at the centre of the allegations to be on a promotion panel.  The Minister sought a report from the Garda Commissioner who advised the Minister that the assistant Commissioner had found the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe were not substantiated.  No adverse findings were made against the superintendent involved, who had secured his place on the promotion panel following an independent competitive process.  The Commissioner also advised that the investigation by the assistant Garda Commissioner had been reviewed by a deputy Garda Commissioner who found that it had been properly conducted.</p><p> In February 2012, the Minister advised the Garda Confidential Recipient of the advice of the Garda Commissioner and concluded that there was no evidence to support further action by him.  Later in 2012, the Minister also received additional documentation from Sergeant McCabe's solicitors which was the subject of correspondence with them.  Mr. Guerin, in sharp contrast, has found cause for concern in ten of the individual allegations by Sergeant McCabe and cause for concern as to the adequacy of the investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While he makes the point that he has not made any findings of fact or come to any determination on any of the matters he examined, Mr. Guerin has indicated the need for further inquiry by way of a commission of investigation.  The commission will have the powers and the remit to thoroughly investigate all of the relevant issues and hear the evidence of everyone concerned.</p><p> I acknowledge the very difficult experience Sergeant McCabe has had and the critical role he played in bringing these issues forward.  I fully support the remarks made by the Taoiseach yesterday about how Sergeant McCabe's complaints were handled.  I also recall the Taoiseach's earlier response on how seriously he regarded the allegations when he was given documentation by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.</p><p> The individual allegations which the report recommends should be examined by a commission of investigation relate to serious matters such as the granting of bail to an offender who ultimately committed murder, an assault on a 17 year old girl, dangerous driving causing injuries and the investigation of sexual offences.  The precise terms of reference of the commission of investigation will be decided shortly and will include all of the issues recommended by Mr. Guerin for examination.  The commission will, therefore, examine a wide range of issues, including the individual and serious cases described and systemic policing issues, general policing issues in the Bailieboro Garda district at the time, the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in this matter and the role of the Department of Justice and Equality and Minister in responding to the allegations.</p><p> What is now imperative is to grasp this opportunity to comprehensively address all of the complex and deep-rooted issues raised not only in the report by Mr. Guerin, but more widely those that relate to matters such as Garda oversight and management, policing practice, whistleblowing and relationships between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and key stakeholders.  Many of these issues were raised, in one form or another, in the reports of the Morris tribunal.  Action was taken on foot of the findings of that tribunal and changes were made.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and Garda Inspectorate were established, the legal relationship between the Garda Commissioner and Minister was clarified and new discipline and promotion procedures were introduced.  However, time passed and systems failed.  That is the truth of the matter and it is a truth that should inform our thinking from now on.</p><p> We must never be seduced into believing that a once in a lifetime radical reform is enough.  More to the point, we must understand that major reforms carry their own in-built danger, namely, the assumption that, because of the scale of change, we will not need to be vigilant from that point on.  If there is a single overarching lesson that we and all the organs of State related to justice must learn, it is that major reform never removes the need for constant questioning, attention to detail, reaching for what is better and review, rather than what will &quot;just do.&quot;</p><p> We must now acknowledge the need for much more than reform arising from the Guerin report or the commission of investigation.  Fundamental reform is needed not only of legal provisions, although that is certainly needed, but of institutional relationships, culture and attitudes.  The reforms I envisage will be systematic and comprehensive and will use what has taken place as a catalyst.  This is an historic opportunity to give Ireland a justice system of which we can be proud.  We have an opportunity to introduce real and lasting change that makes a genuine difference in order that we will not be here again in ten years' time.  We must put in place this time a comprehensive set of reforms to make sure nothing like this can happen again.</p><p> Members of the public rightly expect to be able to rely on the policing service and criminal justice system.  They must be able to trust that crimes they report will be fully and properly investigated.  It is also vital for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the overwhelming majority of whom joined the Garda to give public service and of their best, that they work in a system where detecting failings is regarded as professional and praiseworthy, rather than disloyal.  It is important to recognise that garda&iacute; around the country who understand this are hurt and upset at the failures which have been exposed.</p><p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides a vital public service, preventing and investigating crime, tackling anti-social behaviour, keeping our streets safe for law-abiding citizens, and, of course, protecting national security, especially through combating subversion and terrorism.  Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na routinely find themselves, and sometimes have to put themselves, in harm's way so the public is protected.  Many have suffered hardship and injury doing so while some have made the ultimate sacrifice.  This Saturday, I will be attending the annual Garda memorial day in the Dublin Gardens at Dublin Castle to honour the memory of the force&rsquo;s members who were killed in the line of duty.  We owe it to them, as well as to the public they serve, to put matters right once and for all.</p><p> The Government has, therefore, decided to amend the Protected Disclosures Bill, currently before this House, to enable Garda whistleblowers to report their concerns directly to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, for independent investigation.  As Deputies know, this Bill, brought forward by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will provide a robust and supportive environment for all whistleblowers in both the public and private sectors in line with the very best international standards.  This will mean that Garda whistleblowers will from now on have a strong legal framework in which to report concerns, strong legal protection against penalisation and the opportunity of a fully independent examination of their concerns.  This historic move will mean the situation faced by Sergeant McCabe can never happen again.  The structures will be in place.</p><p> The Government has also announced it will bring forward urgent proposals to strengthen GSOC's powers and remit.  Yesterday, I listened to presentations made at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, under the chairmanship of Deputy David Stanton, on these matters which is hearing submissions from interested parties, including GSOC.  I look forward to the committee&rsquo;s recommendations and will take them into account in developing proposals for legislative change.  My intention is to finalise these proposals in the form of a draft Bill for consideration by the Government as a top priority.  I will not anticipate the detailed content of those proposals.  However, some of the key issues which must be considered are the potential inclusion of the Garda Commissioner within the remit of GSOC; the desirability of permitting GSOC to initiate reviews of Garda practices, policies or procedures without requiring the consent of the Minister; whether GSOC needs any extension of the police powers available to it; the threshold for the referral of cases to GSOC by the Minister; and the extent to which complaints to GSOC are referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  In listing these issues, I am not being prescriptive or restrictive.  All good ideas will be constructively considered.</p><p> The Government has already announced that an independent Garda authority will be established by the end of the year.  This is a significant development, surely the most important single change in the governance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its history.  The end-of-year deadline is challenging, particularly as legislation will be needed.  I am determined, however, to do everything possible to achieve it and look forward to the co-operation of the House in that regard.</p><p> Yet another reform announced by the Government is that the vacancy in the office of Garda Commissioner will be filled by open competition.  Like the idea of an independent Garda authority, an open competition has been proposed before including in a 2007 report by an advisory group on Garda management and leadership development chaired by former Senator Maurice Hayes.  We must move on this now.  As that report noted, &quot;This does not in any way predicate the appointment of an external candidate but it does ensure that the successful candidate would have been tested against international standards in police leadership&quot;.</p><p> The Guerin report also identifies a range of legal and procedural issues which warrant further review.  These relate to matters such as the continuity of tenure of district officers; aspects of the supervision of probationer garda&iacute;; the securing of CCTV, closed-circuit television footage, in criminal investigations, commented on several times in the Guerin report; the operation of station bail and the use of the Bail Act 1997; the taking of victim impact statements; the taking of contemporaneous notes; and the integrity of PULSE records.</p><p> In some instances these issues will require consideration by the Garda Commissioner, but I will also be asking the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to carry out a comprehensive inquiry into serious crime investigation, as well as the management, operational and procedural issues arising from the findings of the report.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate has already made recommendations in some of these areas.  We must examine how many of these have been implemented to date.  The inspectorate also has important work under way which will, of course, be taken into account.  All of this reform work is being overseen by the new Cabinet committee on justice reform, chaired by the Taoiseach and including the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and myself.  The Attorney General also attends the committee.  A review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also under way under the Haddington Road agreement which is being conducted by the Garda Inspectorate and Ray McGee, a former deputy chair of the Labour Court.  It too has the potential to contribute to the wider Garda reform programme.</p><p> I have already noted the recommendation in the report that the commission of investigation should look at the role of the Minister, which, of course, includes the Department of Justice and Equality, in responding to Sergeant McCabe's allegations.  In addition, the Government has also agreed to my proposals on the establishment of an external expert review of the performance, management and administration of the Department to be completed before the summer recess.  I am on record as stating I have been very impressed at the range and extent of the Department's legislative output.  I acknowledge the extensive and reforming contribution of the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, to that programme which has been achieved despite the extraordinary breadth of policy and operational areas in the Department.  These cover not just policing and legislation, but prisons and probation, extradition, domestic violence, international child abduction, family law, charities, insolvency, data protection and many other areas.  Every one of these difficult and complex areas is directly relevant to the citizen - all the more reason to learn wider lessons and put the right structures in place.</p><p> All of this means tackling a significant and challenging programme of review and reform with the establishment of an independent Garda authority, strong protection for Garda whistleblowers, an enhanced GSOC and an independent review of a range of policing issues by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.  These are far-reaching changes.  We must be prepared, as we are, to respond to any further findings or recommendations which may emerge from either the commission of investigation to be chaired by Mr. Justice Nial Fennelly or the commission of investigation to be established on foot of the report by Mr. Guerin.  We will also have to consider the upcoming report of Mr. Justice John Cooke on concerns about surveillance of GSOC.  This report was commissioned on 20 February 2014 and Mr. Justice Cooke was asked to report within eight weeks.  The report should be available in the near future.  Its implications will also need to be considered in the House.  The terms of reference should also take account of this report.</p><p> I am committed to implementing this reform agenda.  I believe in doing so, I will have the support of Members in this House, as well as the support of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, many of whom are concerned about recent events.</p><p>They want to see leadership and change, their morale clearly needs to be improved and they need to be supported.  I believe there will be widespread support in the criminal justice system and support from the public, whom we all serve.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the views of Members on all sides on these issues and to engaging with Members over the coming months on the many varied and distinct responses which are needed to deal with the issues we are discussing.</p></speech>

Hers is an onerous task.  It is one of the most daunting challenges facing any Minister.  Personally and publicly, I wish her well.  We on this side of the House will do what we have always strived to do, which is to give constructive opposition to the Government and seek to serve the public interest in the best way possible.  I also publicly acknowledge that the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, has departed and, on a personal level, wish him well in the new phase of his career where he finds himself.</p><p>  The Guerin report is a comprehensive report.  It stretches to more than 300 pages.  I compliment Mr. Guerin SC on producing the report in such a timely manner.  It is quite detailed and extensive and he consulted over an extended period, particularly with Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  There are many issues flowing from it which I hope to address in this contribution.</p><p>  The Guerin report has shown that Sergeant Maurice McCabe was correct in his actions to highlight the failure to administer justice in the Bailieborough Garda district.  Its findings are an embarrassment for the Government, which denied that there was ever any issue in the justice area and defended the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, month after month.  The former Minister dismissed and belittled the whistleblowers and was supported by the Taoiseach while doing so.</p><p>  The failure of Garda management and the Department of Justice and Equality to respond in an effective manner to the concerns raised by the Sergeant McCabe is a clear indication that there needs to be a dramatic culture shift in order that there can be more openness and accountability.  There needs be a root and branch reform in the Department of Justice and Equality and in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  The inactivity and defiance of the former Minister for Justice and Equality compounded the issues of considerable concern raised.  Mr. Guerin SC has recommended that a full commission of investigation should be set up as soon as possible.  That is something I and my party have called for and we welcome that recommendation.  In the meantime, changes within the administrative systems should start immediately.  Morale in the Garda force needs to be improved while confidence in the justice system is reinstated.</p><p>  The Guerin report was established to review the allegations made by Sergeant Maurice McCabe and the actions taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in response to those allegations.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Guerin SC was asked to conduct this report by the Taoiseach after the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Martin, furnished the Taoiseach with a dossier of documents given to him by Sergeant McCabe.  This dossier included reports of crimes that were mismanaged or ignored.</p><p>  The report reviews the alleged malpractice within the Bailieborough Garda district, reviewing ten incidents as well as an overview of the Garda investigations into complaints by Sergeant McCabe, the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the role of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It states: &quot;The deficiencies identified in the investigations considered in this review, if they were widely replicated, would be a challenge to public confidence in the criminal justice system itself.&quot;</p><p>  The report's conclusions confirm that there was no malice on the part of Sergeant McCabe in making his various complaints.  It is a fact that Sergeant McCabe was entirely vindicated.  The report's conclusions also state that the former Minister for Justice and Equality was not, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently is not, willing to heed the voice of an ordinary member in raising complaints, and that it is desirable that a comprehensive commission of investigation be established under the Commission of Investigation Act 2004 to investigate the issues that remain unresolved arising from the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe.</p><p>  The report also states that a review must be carried out on a number of procedural matters of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including: procedures for taking of a statement amounting to a withdrawal of a complaint of a criminal nature; where disciplinary proceedings are taken against a probationary garda, a report should be conducted on the adequacy and effectiveness of the supervision of that garda; the procedures ensuring CCTV footage is obtained; a review of the operation of the PULSE system; the operation of station bail; the use of section 2A of the Bail Act 1997; and the direction and guidance to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on victim impact statements, psychiatric reports, the procedure for dealing with complaints, the making of contemporaneous notes, the taking of statements of evidence and the updating of those statements.  It also states that the Department of Justice and Equality should review its procedures for the assessment of complaints made by the Minister on any aspect of the administration, operation, practice or procedure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the conduct of its members for the determination by the Minister of applications for the exercise of the specific and regulatory functions available to the Minister in that regard.</p><p>  The report states that the former Minister for Justice and Equality could have utilised two legislative provisions in addressing concerns raised by Sergeant McCabe.  These are the power to establish a special inquiry pursuant to section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, and the function provided for in regulation 8(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007, SI 168 of 2007.  These available ministerial functions would have enabled the former Minister to ensure an investigation, independent in the true sense of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, could have been conducted into matters that may have been the subject of a complaint made to him, and Deputy Shatter failed to use these statutory provisions.</p><p>  There is also no evidence of any detailed assessment within the Department of any of the allegations made by Sergeant McCabe or of the responses received from the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan.  It appears the former Minister accepted the former Commissioner's word without any questioning whatsoever.  The advice received from the former Commissioner was acted on by the former Minister &quot;without that advice being questioned or analysed&quot;.  The report reads &quot;there is cause for concern&quot; as to the former Minister's approach to the complaints made and the lack of action taken.  It appears the former Minister gifted his duties in this regard to the former Commissioner.</p><p> In chapter 19, Mr. Guerin mentions that Sergeant McCabe sent an e-mail in 2009 to the former Minister, Dermot Ahern, confirming that the complaint he made in regard to malpractice and corruption in Baileboro Garda District, Cavan-Monaghan was being investigated.  The private secretary replied to say that the investigation should be allowed take its course.  The report states that a commission of investigation into the matters outlined must be established in order to understand why the malpractice in Bailieboro Garda district was allowed to continue indefinitely despite the issue being raised at the highest level of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il fully supports the call for a commission of investigation and believes this commission should be kept separate to any other commission which has been already established by the Government investigating matters relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> The alleged malpractice in Bailieboro undermines the foundations of our criminal justice system.  It also undermines the morale of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In order for public confidence to be restored in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it is necessary to establish fully and frankly how the situation surrounding the malpractice in Cavan was allowed to occur, continue and be covered up over such a long period of time.</p><p> It is clear that the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the disciplinary and complaints procedures present need to be reformed.  The introduction of an independent policing authority is central to ensuring that the matters raised by Sergeant Maurice McCabe do not happen again.  The management of the Garda force must also be reviewed in light of the failure of the former Commissioner, an assistant commissioner and a number of other senior officers to deal with the complaints made by Sergeant McCabe in an effective and reasonable way.  The lack of appropriate supervision and management guidance by senior Garda officers in Cavan is a striking finding in the report.</p><p> In her opening statement, the Minister said the Government has decided to fill the position of Garda Commissioner subject to an open competition.  That is a good decision.  Questions have been asked as to whether that position will be filled prior to the establishment of the new authority.  There needs to be a degree of transparency around the procedure and process for filling that vacancy.  Who will do the interviewing and how will we go about advertising the vacancy on a worldwide basis?  If we are opening it up to competition, it must obviously be done internationally.  I do not have any preference.  The best person may be an internal candidate within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or it may not be.  I do not have a fixed view on that.  However, consideration needs to be given as to whether that post will be filled on a permanent basis before the establishment of the new policing authority.</p><p> A number of other questions follow on from that.  The former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callanan, had engaged in a series of interview processes to fill vacancies at the rank of deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner.  I understand that was a top-level appointments committee or TLAC-style  competition, though not formally run through the TLAC process.  Do those interviews stand?  Will the people who were successful, or potentially successful, still stand, given that the person who would have been central and very much a key stakeholder or player in that process, the former Garda Commissioner, has now departed the stage?  Or will that interview process be negated and, if so, will it start all over again, similar to the vacant Garda Commissioner post, with the advent of the new policing authority?</p><p> The structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be part of the ongoing reform.  The Minister rightly mentioned a review process under the Haddington Road agreement.  This was discussed at yesterday's hearings of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  There has been some commentary on the fact that the last extensive review of the structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was held in the 1970s by the Conroy Commission.  </p><p> Some people feel the organisation is too flat, while others feel it may be top-heavy at some levels.  Is it intended to review the structure of different grades and ranks within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  We can argue indefinitely about the strength of the force and whether it should be 13,000, 14,000 or 15,000 but it is a debate for another day.</p><p> In her speech, the Minister acknowledged that the follow-on from the Morris tribunal culminated in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  While it did not get everything right, most of the recommendations were taken on board.  GSOC was established, as was the Garda inspectorate.  In addition, the professional standards unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was also established.  The Garda inspectorate has made a huge impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of the workings of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At yesterday's committee meeting, the inspectorate's representatives were able to demonstrate coherently how they were concerned with systems within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p><p> It is good to have the benefit of the experience of people like Mr. Olson and his colleagues who have international expertise.  Will the new Garda inspectorate form part of the new policing authority or will it be kept separate?  Various views were expressed at the committee yesterday as to whether that entity is really under the remit or control of the Minister, or if it is a separate and stand-alone body.</p><p> The proposed policing authority must be truly independent.  Members of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality intend travelling to the North of Ireland and Scotland to look at their models.  Obviously, there must be a board.  My own view, which was echoed by many civil society groups at the committee yesterday, is that the new policing authority's members should not be appointed by the Government.  They should be appointed by a process that could be overseen, for example, by the Public Appointments Commission.  </p><p> It was also said yesterday, and I agree, that there should be some public representatives on the board of the new policing authority.  We can debate how one goes about that.  At the end of the day, however, public representatives are the people's representatives.  In addition, members of the public and representatives of civil society groups will also form part of the board.</p><p> The Minister also referred to the expert review of her new Department's workings, which is being undertaken.  It is felt that is necessary and it will be quite an interesting exercise.  She did not say, however, who is conducting the review.  She may have said so previously but, if so, I am not aware of it.  Has it been decided who will conduct the review?  I have heard it mentioned that it will be conducted by retired former civil servants, but is the Minister saying that is not the case?</p></speech>

Otherwise it would effectively be a case of the guards investigating the guards, or a form of peer review which would not be acceptable.</p><p>We have the Fennelly commission of investigation and we are told the Cooke review into the allegations of bugging at GSOC is imminent and may be published tomorrow.  We will deal with it whenever it is published.  As stated, the terms of reference flowing from the Guerin report will have to examine the ten cases which were the subject of the dossier.  We must consider other cases which may be as serious or more serious but which are not in the public domain and have not had the same oxygen of publicity as some of the ten cases in the dossier.  Will the terms of reference provide for cases which anybody in the House or elsewhere seeks to communicate with the Minister directly?  There should be some channel whereby those cases can be considered for inclusion under the commission of investigation based on their merits.  I ask the Minister to seriously take it on board.</p><p> As part of the Fennelly commission of investigation we suggested the modular form be considered as part of the terms of reference.  We suggested the premature departure of the former Garda Commissioner be examined up front with a shorter timescale than the year-end reporting requirement which was placed on Fennelly.  Serious thought should be given to establishing modular reporting through the terms of reference.</p><p> When we speak in the D&aacute;il on matters such as this we must extensively thank the men and women of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the work they do because the vast majority of them go above and beyond the call of duty.  Many members of the Garda have told me they were not happy about being at the centre of political discourse and I explained that it had to be so because the issues were of public interest and warranted political debate.  Garda morale is an issue, which Deputy Mac Lochlainn and I, along with others, have been raising for some time.  It must be addressed.  The relationship between the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, and the Garda Representative Association, GRA, was broken and I expect the Minister to make every effort to repair it.  It is important we have a well-motivated force and we will leave no stone unturned in trying to resurrect it.  This week an off-duty garda foiled an attempted raid on a cash-in-transit delivery, in another example of how many garda&iacute; go above and beyond the call of duty.</p><p> I welcome the commission of investigation and thank Sergeant Maurice McCabe and Mr. John Wilson.  Sergeant McCabe ploughed a lonely furrow for a long time and was subjected to a campaign of bullying, innuendo, undermining and threats.  Any time I have engaged with Sergeant McCabe I have found him to be a man of the utmost humility.  He did what he did for the right reasons, as acknowledged in the Guerin report.  One of the striking points in the Guerin report is the positive testimony some of his colleagues gave as part of the internal reports compiled over the years since he first started to make his complaints.  There is testimony in those reports which we never heard before from Sergeant McCabe's colleagues who said he was a very good guy.  Unfortunately, this was not what was presented to the public for a long time.  That was regrettable and we must learn from it.</p></speech>

I will recount all the mistakes made by the Government so all of us can reflect on the lessons that must be learned.  As Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on justice I will give the Minister a fair wind.  Although I am happy with the announcements she has made so far in response to some of these crises, I will detail, with the Minister present, what has gone wrong.</p><p>  The Morris tribunal in my home county, Donegal, revealed an appalling abuse of power by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at every level throughout the county that shocked people throughout the State.  It was not isolated and is not unique to Ireland but happens in police forces throughout the world.  It was a challenge for us to change the culture and systems that allowed those abuses to happen.  It led to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, which established the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, the Garda Inspectorate and a codified system, and made other welcome changes.  However, from the beginning my party said it did not go far enough.</p><p>  We strongly felt the powers of GSOC were insufficient in that the Garda Commissioner was not accountable to it and it could not initiate investigations.  We also felt it did not have enough resources and the system of lease out, as it is known, whereby garda&iacute; investigated garda&iacute; was poor practice, and we criticised it repeatedly.  We also talked about an independent policing authority.  We saw the new beginning in policing in the North.  While I am not comparing the old RUC with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there are models there from which we could learn and benefit.  Some of the findings of the Patten commission were there to be learned from.  We, like others, said there needed to be an independent policing authority in the State.</p><p>  From the beginning of the Government's term there was a lack of emphasis on the challenges.  For example, the programme for Government did not mention an independent policing authority.  When various Opposition Deputies repeatedly called for it, such as Deputy Wallace who brought forward a Bill on it last year, the Government rejected it.  In February, I tabled a question to the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, and he robustly rejected the suggestion of an independent policing authority.  Up to very recently the Government was not entertaining the idea and was not learning the lessons that were becoming apparent.</p><p>  The decision to amalgamate defence and policing under one Minister was a mistake.  It was too much for one Minister to deal with and was disrespectful to the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces and I welcome the fact that it has ended.  The warning signs were there for a long time and were repeatedly ignored.</p><p>I will comment towards the end of the contribution on what I hope will be a new beginning.</p><p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission initiated a public interest investigation a number of years ago into what is known as the Kieran Boylan affair, which involved serious allegations that a major convicted drug dealer had operated as an informer, leading to the alleged entrapment and imprisonment of other drug dealers of lesser threat.  He got off with &euro;1.4 million of heroin and cocaine, without any explanation, which was a serious matter.  GSOC conducted an investigation and submitted a report to the previous Minister but there has been no response to it.  GSOC complained bitterly about the appalling lack of co-operation from the former Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management in that investigation over four years, which delayed the investigation considerably.  The seven page summary is in the public domain and it indicated there was a failure to learn the lessons of the Morris tribunal, particularly with regard to the retention of contemporaneous notes.  It is a very basic necessity to keep notes and record decisions.  The issue of handling informers is a similar issue.</p><p> These matters were not responded to by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, for months.  He stayed schtum and did not say a word about the very severe criticism in the public domain.  I chair the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, and it brought in representatives of GSOC, as was its responsibility, to hear its concerns.  The episode dragged on for months but it was not isolated.  In 2013, Mr. Ian Bailey's legal representatives wrote to the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, on three separate occasions expressing concern about the failure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to co-operate with a GSOC investigation initiated on the basis of complaints from them.  The Minister of the time did not deal with those issues and he recently responded to correspondence from my party leader, Deputy Adams, by indicating it was not his responsibility.  Deputy Shatter eventually stood over a meeting between the former Garda Commissioner and GSOC to agree protocols of co-operation, so it was his responsibility.  There was a failure to deal with the systemic failures which were emerging all the time.</p><p> There is also the issue of the Supreme Court decision not to extradite Mr. Bailey to France, as part of a French investigation, for questioning on the murder of Ms Sophie Toscan du Plantier.  The Department of Justice and Equality and the former Minister would have been well aware that this Supreme Court decision was very heavily influenced by the emergence of a 2001 Director of Public Prosecutions report which found no evidence connecting Mr. Bailey to the murder.  Moreover, it rubbished the Garda investigation of the time.  Unfortunately, it took the former DPP, Mr. Eamonn Barnes, to intervene, after the High Court agreed to extradite Mr. Bailey, by e-mailing his former colleagues with very grave concerns.  That forced the Department to hand over the document, which had been in its possession for all those years, to Mr. Bailey's legal team.  It is quite clear that is what led to the Supreme Court decision.  Despite this and reassurance from the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, that he would enter into dialogue with the Attorney General, nothing has happened since.  Nothing has been done to reverse the injustice from all these years.  As we assemble here today, the Department of Justice and Equality, on behalf of the State, continues to defend a civil case taken by Mr. Bailey and his partner, Ms Jules Thomas.  This is more ongoing evidence of systemic failure and a lack of leadership as the issue drags on.</p><p> Our party has been critical of the unhealthy relationship between the offices of the Garda Commissioner and the Minister responsible for justice.  It is not just about this Government as it affected previous Governments because of the system we have in place.  In this Government's term the former Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, argued that the closure of 140 Garda stations and cuts of over 10% in Garda numbers, which take them below the dangerous threshold of 13,000, as well as decreases in the numbers of Garda vehicles amounted to efficiency, modernisation and smart policing.  That was the language used by Mr. Callinan to defend the Government's approach to the outrage of his own members as expressed through the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  On the other hand, the Minister of the day defended the Garda Commissioner from all attacks, as we saw with the penalty points issue.</p><p> The former Minister for Justice and Equality extended the former Garda Commissioner's term in office as a form of gratitude for the role he played in overseeing cutbacks in the period of transition.  We should consider how the former Minister for Justice and Equality on national television used information given to him confidentially by the Garda Commissioner to do down a political opponent, Deputy Mick Wallace.  When the inevitable vote of confidence before the House was called, the Government stood full square behind the Minister of the day, despite the fact that the same people had led the charge to remove a Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, when he did exactly the same thing.</p><p> We all know what happened with the penalty points issue.  The former Minister's approach was of circling the wagons around the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management and attempting to discredit the credibility of the whistleblowers by robustly challenging them on the plinth when the O'Mahony report was published.  The Comptroller and Auditor General pretty much vindicated the allegations by former Garda John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe, and there was an infamous appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts by the former Garda Commissioner when he described the actions of the two whistleblowers as &quot;disgusting&quot;.  We also had a Garda Inspectorate report, and after two years of procrastination, the matters were referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p><p> We have also seen what happened to the confidential recipient when a transcript was released of the advice given to Sergeant Maurice McCabe.  The confidential recipient was sacked as a result.  There were allegations that the GSOC offices were bugged and the Taoiseach was advised clearly by the Department of Justice and Equality to wrongly quote the legislation which put the ombudsman under pressure rather than asking whether the offices were bugged.  I hope Mr. Justice Cooke will get to the bottom of that issue.  At the end of this debacle we witnessed the resignation of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p> There have been repeated crises and all this reflects the culture of politics in the Department of Justice and Equality and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that must change.  I have recited these events to remind us of the challenges we face and of why public confidence has been shattered in the administration of justice.  The Guerin report makes for devastating reading for the senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality, with chapter 19 a damning indictment of the practices in the Department.  There is an indication of an unhealthy practice of circling the wagons in order that objectives can be fulfilled.  There is evidence of indiscipline and incompetence, which is a reflection of the appalling management which must be dealt with.  I hope the Garda Inspectorate and this panel of experts will be able to deal with the issue.  We will give the process a fair wind but the matter must be dealt with.  It is once again a vindication of Sergeant Maurice McCabe.</p><p> The Opposition will give the Minister a fair wind and she has started with encouraging words.  We must see firm actions and a new, independent policing authority.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality yesterday heard excellent contributions and questions on the issue and I ask the Minister and her officials to look through all the statements.  Perhaps they have already done so.</p><p>We learned a lot and will make recommendations to the Minister.</p><p> We need a freshly empowered ombudsman and Garda Inspectorate.  The Garda Inspectorate is looking for powers of initiation and we will support it in that.  The inspectorate, led by three senior personnel, who have outstanding international experience, has a role to play but it needs to be free from the shackles of ministerial control.  It needs to be independent and to have powers of initiation to fulfil its important responsibilities. </p><p> We need to ensure that lessons are learned from all the mistakes that have happened over the past three years.  There must be a fresh start involving a clear-out of people who want to protect the bad old day while reformers who want real change and to vigorously restore confidence in the administration of justice should be promoted.  I wish the Minister well in her work.  As long as she moves in that direction, she will have my support and that of my party.</p></speech>

It would be hard to overstate the gravity of Mr. Guerin's findings on the handling of the evidence of Garda whistleblower, Sergeant Maurice McCabe.</p><p>  In sum, Mr. Guerin found that Garda management, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the officials in his Department all failed to properly investigate the credible and detailed allegations of Garda corruption and misconduct that Sergeant McCabe provided to them on matters including the most serious crimes in our society.  He found, in short, that this whistleblower was not alone ignored by those ultimately responsible for oversight, but was made to suffer for his actions in the public interest, in defence of the integrity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the rights of his fellow citizens.  I welcome the fact that Mr. Guerin's report fully vindicates the actions and intentions of Sergeant McCabe.  It is appropriate to commend him again and to pay tribute to his family who undoubtedly suffered as he did.  The Taoiseach's apology to Sergeant McCabe is welcome.  He apologised for the delay and inaction around the allegations the sergeant brought forward.  He might also have apologised for the unjustifiable and malicious treatment Sergeant McCabe received for doing the right thing.  I welcome the move to restore Sergeant McCabe's access to the Police Using Leading Systems Effectively, PULSE, system and his ability to go about his duties as an upstanding member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>  What deeply concerns me, separate and apart from the report's findings with regard to the handling of Sergeant McCabe's evidence internally within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management structures, is that the Guerin report has also exposed what appears to be a culture of concealment and cover-up of wrongdoing within the Department of Justice and Equality.  Among other things, Mr. Guerin's findings concern what he calls &quot;profound systems failures&quot; that go beyond those within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This aspect of the report's findings deserves dedicated attention and concerted action and must not be glossed over by the Taoiseach or by the incoming Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.  Their credibility and that of the Government depends on dealing with these matters.  I recognise and welcome the Minister's proposal for a review of her Department.</p><p>  This state of affairs, as assessed by Mr. Guerin, has contributed to a growing crisis in public confidence in policing and in the administration of justice.  This is, I submit, one result of a toxic political legacy involving successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael-led Administrations, whose actions and inaction permitted and possibly accelerated the rot that has become increasingly apparent in revelation after revelation and scandal after scandal over recent days, weeks and months.</p><p>  It is very difficult to imagine a good reason or an innocent reason that could explain why Department officials and a Minister could receive detailed complaints of the nature of those raised by Sergeant Maurice McCabe regarding Garda misconduct and not initiate an independent investigation.  The report reveals this is precisely what happened, but this is not all.  According to paragraph 19.100, there was actually no evidence of any detailed assessment within the Department.  Instead, according to paragraph 19.101, the Minister took the word of the Garda Commissioner without question or further analysis.  This was despite the fact that the Minister had been asked to exercise two specific statutory functions: to initiate a special inquiry under section 42 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, and to direct an investigation pursuant to the confidential reporting of corruption or malpractice under regulation 8(2) of the Garda Regulations 2007.  That is astonishing.</p><p>  Even after the publication of the Guerin report, we still do not know what happened, or why.  That this is through no fault or failure of Mr. Guerin is made clear in paragraph 19.101, which states there is a near total absence of written records of any submissions made or advice given to the Minister by his officials, in particular at the times when the exercise of specific statutory functions by the Minister arose, and no written internal records of decisions made by the Minister.</p><p>  The Guerin review was therefore unable to shed any light on the reasons for the approach adopted by the Minister to the exercise of those functions.  That is extremely worrying, not least I imagine for the new Minister.  These findings bring into question not only the competence of the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, and that of the Secretary General, Brian Purcell and the Department they led.  There is no doubt about the necessity for full disclosure, and the need for Mr. Purcell's attendance before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence to answer its questions.  We need the full facts of the practice in the Department, and the judgments made by the Minister and his officials, that led to this series of debacles.  We also need the truth of the circumstances behind the Garda Commissioner's resignation, or &quot;retirement&quot; to use the word he prefers.  There are at least four people in a position to provide this information: the former Commissioner, Martin Callinan; the Secretary General of the Department, Brian Purcell; the Secretary General to the Department of An Taoiseach, Martin Fraser, and the Taoiseach, yet none of these individuals has come forward yet to give full clarity and detail..</p><p>  More broadly, Mr. Guerin's findings bring into question the competence not only of former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, but the succession of Ministers who preceded him, Michael McDowell, the late Brian Lenihan, Dermot Ahern and Brendan Smith.  All of these former Ministers presided over the Department of Justice since the 2006 recommendations of Mr. Justice Morris, without implementing them.  It would appear that for whatever reason, despite their seriousness, they were just not taken seriously.  We need to know why.</p><p>  Public interest demands that the commission of investigation to be established on foot of the Guerin report should have comprehensive terms of reference to examine the systems of management and accountability not only within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but also, notwithstanding the Minister's panel and review, the commission could usefully examine those management and accountability structures within the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Minister should consider that.</p><p>Moreover, the commission should forensically examine the decisions and practices of the succession of Ministers in receipt of Mr. Justice Morris's recommendations and their senior officials.  The public has a right to know the reason for ministerial and departmental inaction on these recommendations over more than six years and two Administrations.</p><p> The lessons need to be learned.  They clearly were not learned on foot of the Morris tribunal report.  There has been a good deal of talk quite correctly around the need for not only structural and oversight change within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but a cultural shift, and I believe that is true.  My colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn referred to the need for a leadership that is open to and capable of delivering a new beginning to policing but there also needs to be a cultural shift within the Department and Government and among senior officials and Ministers who are charged to guard, protect and oversee the administration of justice and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

I subsequently met with this garda and have had a number of telephone conversations with him since.  On the day that the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, resigned, that garda called me and told me that as a result of that resignation he now had more faith in the confidential recipient process and was going to arrange a meeting.  That meeting took place today.  </p><p>Garda Keith Harrison claims that as a result of arresting a member of the drugs unit in Athlone for drunk driving, that Garda management maliciously set out targeting him while the arrested garda was afforded protection by Garda management.  He claims that a managerial review of his high work returns and practices was instigated and persons who had past interactions with him in the execution of his duties were invited by the Garda to make complaints against him.  He claims that during this period from September 2009 until March 2011, he was office-bound while the garda he arrested, who had been found with a high concentration of alcohol, was still driving official vehicles and carrying an official firearm.  Garda Harrison makes serious claims about how the drunk driving case was struck out of court on dubious rulings and how evidence relating to the case was stolen by a member of the Garda.  He also claims that a member of the Garda of officer rank stationed in the Westmeath division prevented successful prosecution of individuals in a number of cases.  </p><p>On Monday, I met with Garda Harrison again.  At that meeting there was also Garda Nicky Kehoe, who is another serving Garda whistleblower, and who has made serious claims in regard to the connection of a major heroin dealer in the midlands and a senior member of the drugs unit.  Both those serving garda&iacute; at that meeting were joined by former garda and prominent whistleblower, John Wilson, who is advising both men.  I also invited our justice spokesperson, Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn, to attend which he did.  At that meeting copies of sworn affidavits were given to me from both garda&iacute;.  Garda Harrison claims that he had suspicions about a member of the Garda who was working within the drugs unit who may have been knowingly allowing the sale and supply of drugs within the Athlone district and that he had raised this with management, but he claims that it fell on deaf ears.  At that meeting I was also presented with a written record of a meeting between Garda Nicky Kehoe and a civilian who has come forward in recent days who corroborates the claims that have been made by Garda Kehoe in regard to heroin dealing and a member of the Garda.  </p><p>It is not for me to investigate these claims.  It is not for me to pass judgment on the members of the Garda whom I have spoken of today, but it is my duty to ask for reassurance on their behalf that they will not suffer any backlash from senior management while these claims are being investigated because some of these claims are against the most senior ranks within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have nothing but respect for the rank and file members of the Garda who are carrying out their duties in very difficult circumstances but where there is wrong it must be rooted out, where there is cover-up, the truth must come to the surface, and where whistleblowers come forward, they must be protected.</p><p>Garda Harrison - who in 2007 was invited to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in to receive from President McAleese his award for bravery for his second life-saving incident - in his own words sums up the fear of those who have come forward and those who are thinking of coming forward.  In his sworn affidavit he said:<blockquote>I was once a well-respected, ambitious and unblemished member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Through systematic and relentless bullying and intimidation and unmerited scrutiny, I have, in my view, been totally undermined and destroyed.  My good name and that of my family has also been tarnished and I now feel I have no option but to take this action.  I feel I could not address this prior to now as who was I to turn and have faith in them to do the right thing?  Who would believe me over Garda management?  Would I make an unbearable situation worse for myself, by turning on the wolves that preyed on me?  Never in my life have I felt so alone, tortured and disappointed.  I have huge concerns about my future in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how much more is going to be thrown my way.</blockquote>It is important that if we are to learn the lessons of the Guerin report that we make sure that any garda who comes forward with whatever claims is not subject to the bullying, harassment and intimidation to which those who went before them were subject.  I praise anybody who comes forward.  I hope that those claims will be investigated thoroughly in a manner that was not done previously in regard to the claims we are dealing with today in terms of the Guerin report.</p></speech>

The challenges did not begin on his watch.  Several who held the office before him ignored the obvious.  For 18 months at least the former Minister refused to deal fairly and openly with the different issues brought to his attention. Instead he chose to minimise and dismiss and to stand solid with the former Garda Commissioner long after he was exposed.  Gradually, the Minister's position became indefensible, which led to us calling for his resignation repeatedly since last December.  I was very surprised that the Government of the day stood so solid with him despite the glaring evidence that he was not doing his job properly.</p><p>  The Guerin report, from our point of view, is not anything new because we heard most of these stories back in 2012 and raised some of them in this Chamber and at a press conference in December 2012 but nobody really wanted to know.  Garda Sergeant Maurice McCabe had outlined how practices, procedures and cover up was the order of the day and nobody seemed to want to face up to the truth about that.  It is good that Mr. Guerin has called a spade a spade because it helps to move matters forward in a positive way.</p><p>  Since then our offices have been snowed under with stories and reports from different people and I do not know how it will all be dealt with.  There are hundreds of them and they are very sad to listen to.  I do not know how this should be handled but something will have to be done.  One such story comes from a former garda called Jack Doyle.  His story gained some attention around 2000.  He revealed some serious drug involvement by garda&iacute; in the Cork area and at the time the Garda authorities confirmed that undercover garda&iacute; had been involved in the importation of illegal drugs into the State in what they described as controlled operations.  However, a spokesman said that these operations were necessary in order to bring the leaders of criminal drug gangs to justice.  Garda management rejected calls for an inquiry into claims made by Jack Doyle, saying nothing inappropriate had occurred.</p><p>We got a 27 page report from Jack Doyle into the background to what went on.  I will read less than a page of it.  He was speaking with one of the drug runners with whom he had become acquainted:<blockquote>He recounted to me how they had many opportunities to arrest the boss of the criminal gang but failed to do so.  When asked why, he replied, &quot;They have a senior garda in their pocket.&quot;  He then recounted an incident in Rosslare when he was returning with a shipment of drugs.  A customs officer stopped him and was about to search his jeep when two plain-clothes garda&iacute; commandeered the jeep and drove out of the terminal at speed, being pursued by customs officers.  A high-speed chase ensued and the garda&iacute; lost their pursuers.  As a result of this incident he said he would never personally bring drugs in again.<br /><br />He then proceeded to tell me about the many runs he had done, bringing in cocaine, ecstasy, cannabis and firearms.  Massive amounts of drugs were coming in and quantities were allowed to get into the hands of the criminal gang.  He told me how he was being well looked after financially by both the criminal gang and the garda&iacute;.<br /><br />He then went on to tell me where he had left a handgun in a wooden area in Cork.  He contacted a particular detective sergeant and told him of the location, and drawing a map in the area pinpointed it.  On finding the location, two garda&iacute; threw in a number of firearms to beef up the find.  He explained that the press reported it as a subversive arms find.  When I asked him why they would do this, he replied, &quot;To further their careers in the force.&quot;</blockquote>Their careers have progressed and one of them is now an assistant commissioner.  He was appointed by the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, and this same individual was involved in the Boylan case which entails a very similar story to Jack Doyle's.  Jack Doyle's career did not progress.  He turned up at his place of work one day and was told, &quot;Jack, you're not coming in here.  You'd better go home.  You're finished, Jack.  But, listen, you'll be grand; we'll look after your pension.&quot;  He was forcibly retired.  That one of the garda&iacute; involved is now an assistant commissioner - he could actually be the next Commissioner - emphasises how important it is that the new Commissioner should come from outside the State with a new hierarchy built around him or her as otherwise problems will not go away.</p><p>There is no point in us kicking the former Minister anymore given that he is gone.  However, I was really surprised that the Government chose to ignore so much evidence brought to its attention over the past 18 months.  It started with the penalty points and the internal inquiry.  At that time a confidential Garda memo was sent to all members of the force warning them to stay silent and nobody in the Government seemed to be worried about that.  The O'Mahony report was a whitewash and has long been discredited.  It offended the rule against bias because it had members of the Garda investigating itself.  The constitutional rule of hearing the other side, of course, was not adhered to because the whistleblowers were not interviewed.</p><p>The Garda Inspectorate only got the reports under political pressure two months after the Minister got them and it was really just putting a sheen of legitimacy on the whole affair.  I spoke about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill earlier today.  The Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna F&aacute;il parties all voted against it and Deputies queued up in here to tell us how wonderful everything was in the force even though the dogs in the street knew otherwise.  They also knew, but there is no culture of holding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account because there are no votes in it.</p><p>The GSOC Boylan report was damning and its annual report, giving out about the lack of co-operation from garda&iacute;, is really serious.  However, sadly, members of the Government actually challenged the credibility of GSOC on a repeated basis during this period.  When GSOC asked for access to PULSE in September 2013, it was refused.  However, under political pressure at a later stage, in February, it was given access.</p><p>It was outrageous that GSOC was not allowed to use section 106 to investigate the Roma children affair.  Nor was it allowed to use the racial profiling charge to be part of the terms of reference.  Once the former Garda Commissioner said it did not happen, the former Minister said that was okay with him.  The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance report of February 2013 stated otherwise and found that garda&iacute; engage in racial profiling, but the Government also ignored that and did not want to know.</p><p>The GSOC bugging allegation is one of the most serious of all.  It was frightening how poorly GSOC was treated at that time.  I also find it frightening that Mr. Simon O'Brien of GSOC would come out and say that he had 100% confidence in the then Commissioner and the then Minister for Justice and Equality when I know that he did not.  I wonder if he went over to the dark side.  Was this an effort to stop rocking the boat?</p><p>Terrible things happened at the Corrib gas protests and the previous Government refused to allow GSOC to use section 106 to investigate them.  When we asked the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, he also refused to allow it to look at practices, policies and procedures used by the force at the Corrib gas protests.  There is no point investigating individual complaints about individual garda&iacute; because all they would catch would be the foot soldiers and not the people who made the decisions.</p><p>So many efforts have been made to bring the truth out and it just beggars belief that the Government has had no appetite for it.  Even the former Minister's apology to the whistleblowers had the caveat that the whistleblowers had not been proved right in all their allegations, which was really disappointing.  They were never examined, except by Assistant Commissioner O'Mahony who gave no evidence for any of his findings.</p><p>Throughout this affair, like the former Minister for Justice and Equality who was reactive rather than proactive, the Government has been reactive and not proactive, reactionary and not reforming.  If the Government wants to restore the people's confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in policing, and if it wants the people to believe that justice is fairly administered in this country, there is a lot of work to do.  Serious questions need to be asked in many areas.  We do not do transparency and accountability very well in Ireland, but it is so important that we do it now for policing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500031#DD00200"><p>The Minister referred to the report's findings as being deeply disturbing and went on to talk about the wider systemic and historical problems in the force.  That is the context of this discussion because, as Deputy Wallace has said, for us the Guerin report revealed nothing new.  It was just an absolute and utter vindication of the stories we have heard and the experiences we have had over the past two years or do.  Most striking was how similar Mr. Guerin's conclusions were to the points we have been making repeatedly in this House, in many instances to ridicule from the Government benches and indeed from some members of the Opposition.</p><p>  In the main the Guerin report deals with instances in great detail, including the accounts of injustices and insufficient investigations in a number of serious incidents in the Bailieboro area which have had tragic consequences for all of the participants.  It then goes on to deal with the issue of the Garda itself.  What is striking is the pattern of not properly investigating things, the pattern of investigations being heard.  In many instances internally, the complaints of Sergeant Maurice McCabe were actually upheld, but no action was subsequently taken.  Mr. Guerin referred to insubordination, a certain lawlessness and so on.  We have to be mindful that the people in these stories were people who in many instances had become the victims of crime and had turned to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for help, which rather than helping actually compounded the difficulty.  That is the legacy we are dealing with.</p><p> The Guerin report deals with the former Minister for Justice and Equality's absolute abdication of his statutory role in dealing with these matters and the higher echelons of the Department of Justice and Equality.  What screamed out at one was the point we made that none of this could have happened without the special relationship that existed both in law and personally between the former Minister for Justice and Equality and the former Garda Commissioner.  That relationship led to all of this because, as I said before, the Minister did not do nothing; he went to the Garda Commissioner and asked him about these things, was told a version of events and he just blindly accepted that without even seeing the reports to back that up.</p><p> Policing problems are not new.  There have been horrific cases over the decades - well in advance of this Government's lifetime - including the 1984 murder of Patrick Nugent in Bunratty, believed to have been at the hands of garda&iacute; and staged as a car accident, the brutal death of 14 year old Brian Rossiter in a Garda station in Tipperary, the fitting up of Nicky Kelly for the train robbery, the Kerry babies case, Abbeylara, Donegal, the repeated United Nations reports on the appalling policing scenario in Corrib and so on.  Who is the Government trying to con by saying we did not know about these things?  We knew about these things.  What made it absolutely worse, and this is the legacy with which the Minister has to deal, is that all of the people, or most of them, who were involved in the heavy gang in the Nicky Kelly case were promoted, as were all of those involved in the Kerry babies case.  In the midst of the Guerin report, we saw that the initial investigation and complaint with which Sergeant Maurice McCabe went to the confidential recipient was about the promotion, or putting on a panel for promotion, of somebody who had stood over other lawlessness.  What really struck me was the correspondence in the report from the confidential recipient who spelled out to the Minister that, in his opinion, it would undermine decent garda&iacute; and send a wrong signal to promote somebody like that and yet the complaint was not upheld.  For us, probably what was really sickening in reading the report - apart from the fact everybody listened to Mr. Guerin but nobody seemed to care that much when we said it - was the level of correspondence that existed in the Department from Sergeant Maurice McCabe and his solicitors, about which we had no knowledge, and stuff we did not know, which it knew.  We made points in the House about which we were being rubbished and yet the Department had information which absolutely backed up what we were saying.  </p><p> This is important because, like the case referred to by Deputy Wallace about former Garda Jack Doyle and the way he was forced out, the Kieran Boylan case shocked the nation.  GSOC put its colours to the mast on that one but, in essence, Jack Doyle's story was a forerunner to that where the garda&iacute; basically ran a drug runner and were playing both sides of the camp.  The allegation is that somebody in the very high ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently was involved in the Boylan case and in that case decades before.  I mention the points made by Deputy Doherty, which were previously made by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan during Leaders' Questions, about the number of sitting garda&iacute; who are reporting instances of garda&iacute; being involved in drug running and so on.  We certainly have cases of that.  This is a systemic problem.  </p><p> Now we will have one commission, or two, three or four commissions.  We need more than that.  The Government has said we need to look at this in a bigger way, with an independent police authority.  Professor Dermot Walsh, who is an expert in policing, put this very much in the best way when he said it is less than ten years since the Morris tribunal and all of the reforms promised since then have not worked and asked what is to say that these commissions will yield anything better.  They will not yield anything better, although I am not saying we should not have them, but we need something bigger.  We need a Patten-style commission where we step out from the ranks of what is there and say what we want in a modern police force in Ireland.  The first thing is that we do not want a police force but a police service which is held accountable to the population.  The problem with the commission of investigation is that it will deal with specific allegations in Bailieboro.  We know of other instances around the country.  There are uninvestigated deaths in Tullamore, the pain of the Touhey family and of the Goonan family, incidents in Limerick and malpractice in Cork.  I know that Ian Bailey's solicitors were in correspondence with the Taoiseach this week.  His legal team put the cost to the State and the taxpayer over the 18 years of the Garda efforts to frame him as being roughly between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million in Garda overtime and resources.  Meanwhile, the murderer of Sophie Toscan du Plantier is still out there and Ian Bailey and his partner have been vindicated, but they have had a horrendous time.  </p><p> As Deputy Wallace said, there is so much hurt out there as well as cases and we are absolutely snowed under.  Citizens and garda&iacute; are coming forward now.  It is a good thing that there is an openness developing.  I do not know how the Minister will deal with that but there has to be some form of a truth and reconciliation forum because these instances are opening up the hurt many people have experienced.  Over the past week, many people have got in touch with us.  An event happened to them in their lives before where they were not treated fairly by the garda&iacute; and they suffered other consequences after that and they have not been able to get over it.  We need to acknowledge that and deal with it in some way by an apology or whatever.</p><p> We need to look at the role of whistleblowers.  Sergeant Maurice McCabe and former Garda John Wilson have done the State an enormous service.  The Minister should be aware that when the Acting Commissioner acted on her instructions and gave Sergeant Maurice McCabe back access to PULSE, the letter he got was a two-page epistle, four paragraphs of which screamed about his data protection responsibilities as if he, in some way, again had done something wrong when he followed the letter of the law all the way.  One has to ask if anything has changed.  </p><p> I have made the point before that I am aware the former Garda Commissioner requested that the four Garda representative organisations issue a public statement of no confidence in GSOC at the time of the bugging affair.  That is absolutely scandalous because GSOC is not fit for office as an institution and, in fairness, the GSCOC commissioners were the first people to flag that and say that the way in which that organisation has been constituted means that it is toothless.  We need to look at that.  The Garda putting out statements to undermine it, bad and all as it is, is not good enough.  </p><p> The former Minister failed in his statutory duty and diminished and downplayed these concerns and left us with an appalling mess which, unfortunately, the Minister has to clean up.  I know the other Deputies congratulated her and I wish her well but I was nearly going to commiserate with her given the scale of the task.  The Taoiseach has reinvented himself as being a champion of these issues.  There is a long list of correspondence from Sergeant Maurice McCabe with the Taoiseach on these issues but he did not want to know.  In fairness, Deputy Wallace said before that his support for the Minister would go from 100% to 0% overnight and that is, in essence, what happened.  The T&aacute;naiste has been gormlessly wandering around, seemingly oblivious to all of what is going on.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is hearing submissions from organisations which have already put them on the public record years ago in terms of what needs to be done.  </p><p> We need to move on the new police board as soon as possible.  We need something bigger than that - a root and branch review, a Patten-style commission on what we want in policing and some form of reconciliation for all of the damaged garda&iacute; and citizens.</p></speech>

It is very honourable position but a very difficult one to have.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this urgent and important report which led to the resignation of the former Minister for Justice and Equality.  I thank and commend Mr. Guerin on his work.  I also thank, commend and pay tribute to Sergeant Maurice McCabe and former Garda John Wilson.  They have done the State a great service and it is important we all acknowledge that in this debate.  It is also important to learn from the huge mistakes and major acts carried out against citizens.  Let us not forget about the real victims of this affair.</p><p>We must also learn, move on and build a more modern and inclusive police service.  The stress should be on it being a policing service.  The Guerin report is about reform, accountability and building a good policing service.  That is what we in this House all want.  That is the only way forward for all of the victims, garda&iacute; and the wider community.  Nobody is excluded from that type of reform and accountability.</p><p> I welcome that the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality has agreed to come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  There can be no preconditions.  All questions have to be answered properly and thoroughly.  That is what public servants should do.  Public servants equal public service.  There are no ifs or buts, just clear answers and accountability.  The same applies to Ministers, Deputies, Senators, garda&iacute;, teachers, nurses and other public servants.  Their role is to serve the public.  It is stated very clearly in section 93 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act.  I look forward to the debate in two weeks time.</p><p> The details and conclusions of the Guerin report are shocking and damning.  They make for sad reading, in particular chapter 19.32 which lists a number of incidents: the three incidents involving Gerry McGrath, outlined in chapter 6 of the report; the assault and false imprisonment of the girl in Cootehill on 2 September 2007, outlined in chapter 8; the public order incident on the bus at Kingscourt on 25 February 2007; the alleged concealment of the document compiled by Inspector Delta outlining problems at the Bailieboro station, which is covered in chapter 16; the dangerous driving incident at Lakeside Manor on St. Stephen&rsquo;s night in 2007; the loss of a computer seized in an investigation; the assault in a public house in Bailieboro on 23 May 2007, which is covered in chapter 10; the harassment and sexual harassment of a female probationer garda, which is covered in chapter 14; and the public order incident in Bailieboro on 5 August 2007.  They are some of the many incidents mentioned in the report.</p><p> Chapter 19.33 reads: &ldquo;It has sent out a message to the force that if you ignore your duty, are grossly negligent, hide and cover up, you will be deemed suitable for promotions.&rdquo;  That is a very important statement in the report.  I talk to members of the Garda regularly.  Family members serve in the force.  They talk about the need for a meritocracy within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Once one gets above the rank of sergeant, promotion seems to be based on political decisions.  We need to depoliticise promotion.  A garda who is good at dealing with the drugs issue locally or who is good at dealing with Travellers is the kind of person we need to promote in the force.  Such people must be brought to the top.</p><p> Colleagues mentioned many cases that have been brought to their attention.  I, too, wish to mention a number of cases.  The first is the horrific death of Shane Tuohey from Tullamore, County Offaly.  I was contacted by his sister, Gemma Tuohey Guinan.  She asked us all to fight for justice for her brother, Shane.  She attached a breakdown list of numerous problems which arose from Shane&rsquo;s death which clearly showed that Garda corruption played a huge role in the cover-up of what took place that fateful night.  She also said her father, Eamonn, had a meeting some time ago with Marie Cassidy who kindly showed him Dr. Harbison&rsquo;s notes.  The notes clearly stated that Dr. Harbison was called to do the autopsy on Shane as a special request from the then assistant commissioner.  It is clear as time goes by that the case gets worse.  The family feel they are a lot closer to getting answers.  Gemma says they will keep fighting for justice for Shane regardless of how long it takes.  That is one case which I raised a couple of years ago when I got my slot on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</p><p> Another case that needs to be examined is that of Shane O&rsquo;Farrell.  I accept that some work has begun on it.  On 2 October 2011, Shane O&rsquo;Farrell was killed on the side of a road by a drug addict who had more than 40 previous convictions and was at large because of two suspended sentences imposed by courts on both sides of the Border.  A significant issue arises in regard to the case also.  It is important that we listen to the hurt and pain of his mother, Lucia O&rsquo;Farrell.  Shane&rsquo;s family believe the justice system let them down.</p><p> Another case with which the Minister might be familiar relates to a protestor at the Kildare Street gate of Leinster House for the past nine or ten years, namely, Peter Preston.  His daughter was assaulted in a public house.  She was stabbed in the face with a glass by a member of a north side criminal gang.  Mr. Preston made serious allegations about a cover-up of the case.  I raised the matter previously and I was not satisfied with the response.  The files are in the Department of Justice and Equality and I urge the new Minister to examine the serious allegations made.  It is important we deal with them if we are trying to build up accountability.</p><p> I welcome the fact that the Government is to establish an independent Garda authority.  That is a sensible and progressive approach.  The new Garda authority&rsquo;s powers should include the power to commission inspections and inquiries by the Garda Inspectorate.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be able to make disclosures to those prescribed under section 62(5) of the 2005 Act as well as the confidential recipient and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission without fear of disciplinary action.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission should be strengthened by the provision of a statutory right to access the PULSE database and the power to investigate reports made against the Commissioner under Regulation 7(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007.  It is also important that the post of confidential recipient should be retained and enhanced.</p><p> The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held hearings with a number of groups, some of whom made excellent submissions.  I hope the committee and the Government will listen to many of their ideas.  We also need new approaches to deal with minor complaints to facilitate effective resolution.  Those who ask questions about the Garda should never be deemed to be anti-Garda.  We all have friends and family members who serve in the Garda.  We also have excellent garda&iacute;.  However, massive corruption took place within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that must be dealt with.</p><p> New approaches are also required to deal with serious complaints.  The Garda Commissioner must become subject to oversight.  Currently, the Act states that &quot;a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&quot; does not include the Garda Commissioner and therefore that officeholder is outside the remit of GSOC.  I strongly support the belief that effective oversight of policing and public confidence therein favours the Garda Commissioner being subject to independent oversight and the legislation should be changed to allow for that.  It is very important we would examine such issues.</p><p> We all want a policing service and good and effective police officers.  We want public service at its best.  We want police officers to be decent, honest and to do their job.  We know there are times when people make mistakes.  We all make mistakes, but I refer to serious complaints, corruption and major allegations.  We are not talking about human error in mistakes such as those.  Given some of the cases I mentioned today, we need a police force that is professional, ethical, inclusive, democratic and accountable to citizens.  We cannot have a situation where people feel they cannot trust their own local Garda service.  That is something we must address.  Trust has been damaged but I wish the Minister well as she tries to rebuild trust.  I will be satisfied if she achieves that.</p></speech>

Tugaim faoi ndeara go bhfuil an t-&aacute;bhar seo tar &eacute;is a bheith ardaithe ar an Ord&uacute; Gn&oacute; le m&iacute;onna beaga anuas agus t&aacute; go leor de Bhaill an T&iacute; ag tn&uacute;th leis an bp&iacute;osa reachta&iacute;ochta seo le tamall anuas.  F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimhe agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire agus le gach duine a bh&iacute; p&aacute;irteach i gcur le ch&eacute;ile na reachta&iacute;ochta.  </p><p>  In addressing this particular issue I must admit that for me one of the reasons for being involved in politics is social housing, and its importance to the well-being of Irish society, the impact it has on individuals and families, the manner in which the quality and nature of the housing we provide for our people impacts on their health and general well-being and the way in which housing influences the extent to which people can benefit from the educational opportunities and, very often, the employment opportunities which exist.  It is a key plank, or should be, of public policy and an area which ranks in importance together with education, health and employment.</p><p>  I commend the Minister of State on many aspects of the Bill.  She has a strong social conscience and I see her personal influence at play in some aspects of the Bill.  There are aspects of the Bill about which I am less enthusiastic and I will come back to them.  Deputy Heydon referred to the visits of the Minister of State to Kildare South and I know she has been in other constituencies.</p><p>  It is quite clear the Minister of State has taken on board her experiences in Limerick and what she has heard from people throughout the country on the particular problems which confront communities with regard to anti-social behaviour.  It is a plague on estates throughout the country and it happens in private estates just as it happens in local authority provided estates.  The activity of a small number of people in these estates, and the pressure that a small number of totally irresponsible and remiss individuals place on ordinary decent citizens who are trying to live their lives, is quite intolerable.  All of us as public representatives, when we go among the people and do our clinics, meet on a weekly basis people who are harassed and whose lives are being made a living misery by the problem of anti-social behaviour.  I am glad the legislation sets about tackling this particular issue.  I am also glad in doing so it also seeks to protect the complainant or whistleblower.  The whistleblower, however, is not always right.  In some cases the whistleblowers may themselves be perpetrators of anti-social behaviour, but none the less it is important that anonymity is available to them.</p><p>  Addressing the business of anti-social behaviour raises the responsibilities of local authorities which, in my view, have not taken adequate action within the powers available to them to address the issue.  We should have a multiagency approach, including the local Garda committees, and other efforts should be made to deal with this particular issue.  It is particularly important where the State aids people, through the provision of housing or subsidies or subvention for the acquisition of housing, that some vetting takes place.  It is not right that local authorities allocate properties in estates to people who have a track record in the sale and distribution of drugs.  People who give the fingers to society and who inflict lasting damage on communities should not be rewarded by the State or local authorities through having the benefit of housing made available to them.  They should know that if they engage in these types of practices the State will address the particular challenge they pose and they will not be rewarded.</p><p>  I commend the Minister of State on addressing the issue of social segregation.  She knows there are areas in the country where a disproportionate number of people have participated in anti-social behaviour and have had the capacity in this way to make life for other residents in these estates extremely difficult in many respects.  She also addresses the plight of separated individuals.  Over several months many Deputies have raised the difficulties of separated people trying to get on local authority waiting lists.  I am particularly conscious of people who have been the subject of domestic violence and the plight in which they find themselves as they try to get on a local authority list.  I commend the officials in Kildare County Council on being very sympathetic in how they try to deal with these situations.  The overall body of regulation and legislation surrounding this particular area has made it inordinately difficult for such people to access housing in the past.</p><p>  The Minister of State is also to be commended on the announcement of the new incremental purchase scheme.  I must admit I wonder about this.  I am struck by the fact that since it was first introduced several years ago, I have not been inundated by people seeking to avail of it.  The old traditional method of the sale of local authority houses at a discount where such houses had been tenanted for a considerable period of time was a good system.  I welcome the fact there is a purchase scheme.  It remains to be seen whether it will be as effective as it might be.  There is a major shortcoming in what is proposed, in that the moneys realised by local authorities are not to be ring-fenced for the provision of housing or housing-associated facilities, and this is a serious shortcoming in the legislation.</p><p>  Among the other problems I identify is that housing is not a priority in the Custom House, it has not been a priority for many years for county managers, and it is not a political priority.  We all stand indicted for the fact that in recent years not enough priority has been given to this issue, given its importance to society.  I take no great pride in the fact that my party, while having a proud record in the past on the delivery of social housing, in recent years has not done enough.</p><p>  I acknowledge Deputy Willie Penrose as an expert in this area.  When I was a member of Kildare County Council, I had the privilege of working with the late Joe Bermingham, a character in many respects, but a man who was absolutely committed to the role of the local authority as a housing authority, and was committed to the fact the local authority should have a continuous house building programme.</p><p>I assume my colleague, Deputy Wall, subscribes to the same position.  However, the problem we now face is the absence of a serious construction programme.  There are 90,000 people on the housing list, of whom 6,000 are in County Kildare.  The housing officer could tell me today that in respect of County Kildare this year, 20 new houses will be built in Kilcock and ten houses will be renovated or reconstructed in Newbridge.  In other words, while there is a waiting list of 6,000 people, 30 units will be provided for those people over the next year or so.  This is a pretty pathetic effort.</p><p> I do not blame the Minister of State alone in this regard because this has not been a priority in recent years.  I suggest to the Minister of State that one of the reasons it has not been a political priority is because many of those who are on the social housing waiting lists do not appear on the register of electors.  They move around from place to place and do not vote very often.  This is understandable because they are excluded in Irish society.  They are not a factor for county managers because the number of council houses one succeeds in building during one's tenure in a particular area is not something that will particularly advance one's case for achieving a managership somewhere else.  However, there are many other fancy sexy projects in which county managers could be involved that will garner positive press for them and will help their career paths.  County managers are unable to further their case and career paths, which are very important to those gentlemen - unfortunately they mainly are gentlemen - through the building of council houses.</p><p> I was struck this week by the real impact on individuals of the lack of progress in this area.  A young woman who has two children came to see me.  She has been on the local authority waiting list for eight or nine years.  Her daughter is 12 years old and during that period, they have been in nine different homes.  The woman is on anti-depressants because she is distraught that she is unable to provide some sort of permanent home and security for her child.  That is why I was appalled by what the media reported as a discussion in the Government recently on whether there should be a local authority purchase scheme.  The tradition in Ireland was for local authorities to build houses, for purchase schemes to be introduced and for people to be able to buy them out.  This was the way in which individuals progressed and communities developed.  There is a right-wing attitude abroad now, which I must note is reflected in the actions of the Government.  Perversely, if the media reports of what was going in government are correct, it appears as though Fine Gael, which obviously is the most right-wing element of the Government, was advocating a purchase scheme while the Labour Party was opposed to it.</p><p> Three areas are of concern to me.  The Minister's housing assistance payment, HAP, proposal has many positive aspects.  It makes a lot of sense to integrate the supports for housing within the local authority.  However, it will not work unless the local authority provides the staffing to support the initiative.  Down through the years, I have observed county managers making provision for road-building projects when such projects arose.  They recruited engineers and various other specialists to build the roads but when housing construction programmes were under way, I never saw housing departments being augmented by additional draftsmen, engineers or architects to help in that system, although I must accept the standard of council housing improved enormously.</p><p> However, what worries me in particular, apart from the staffing issue, is that in Part 4 of the legislation, which pertains to housing assistance, the Minister of State proposes that when clients get their HAP payments, their housing needs will have been deemed to have been met.  I understand from officials to whom I have spoken that this means people who get the old rent supplement, the new HAP payment, will be taken off the local authority waiting list.  I understand the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has been telling local authorities that people who have been accommodated in the short-term schemes, such as the RAS units, five-year tenancies or the leasing tenancies of ten and in some cases 15 years, also are to be taken off the list.  If this is the direction the Minister of State is taking, it constitutes a sad and sorry indictment of what her Department is about because a person who accepts a housing assistance payment is doing so because he or she has no other choice.  However, the ambition of such people still is to get a home that will be their permanent place of accommodation.</p><p> If, as it appears, it is the Minister of State's intention to remove HAP recipients from the housing list, she will have achieved something for the Government by massaging and manipulating the figures, whereby the number of people on waiting lists will appear to have reduced dramatically.  However, their housing need will remain and that girl about whom I spoke earlier, who has been in nine different properties over 12 years, will still be in that situation.  She will be forced out when private landlords do as they inevitably do, that is, pass the property to someone who can pay a higher rent or sell it when its value increases on the open market.</p><p> This came to my attention recently when I was addressing the issue of the RAS and leasing with my local authority.  Given that local authorities can now only offer casual vacancies in terms of council stock, my thinking was that rather than giving such casual vacancies to people off the list, they should be given to those who have a proven track record in the RAS or the leased accommodation in order that they could progress from a short-term provision into long-term provision, having proven themselves as tenants.  However, this is not the case.  Furthermore, a predicament has arisen whereby the fluctuations in rents to which many of Members have referred mean many local authorities can no longer get landlords to provide units to them to enable RAS contracts to be renewed.  The local authorities have a statutory responsibility to accommodate people who, through no fault of their own, find that their contract has ended.  This applies both to RAS and to leasing.  Due to the timing of the scheme's commencement, the issue in respect of RAS now is becoming a problem.  Many people are challenged and are finding it very difficult, as are local authorities, to secure premises.  In ten years' time, when large numbers of people begin to come out of leasing arrangements, the same problem will present itself to whoever is in government at that time and it will be a major problem.</p><p> The Minister of State has not included the issue of voluntary housing in this Bill, which is a weakness.  What is needed in respect of voluntary housing is a purchase scheme for those who are in the voluntary housing-provided units.  I am familiar with many of the voluntary organisations in Ireland, although to describe them as &quot;voluntary&quot; is something of a misnomer because they are large enterprises that depend in large measure on the rental income they receive from those properties.  However, the people who live in those units are not there by choice.  They are living in those units because there was no other choice.  The units were paid for in full by the Department and by the Government through the capital loan subsidy scheme, CLSS, system.  I do not refer to specialist housing built under the capital assistance scheme, CAS, but to the mainstream housing units in which people were accommodated because they had no choice.  They came from the local authority waiting list, as did local authority tenants.</p><p> I must admit an interest in this regard because I have established and am actively involved in voluntary housing.  In my constituency, there is an estate in Monasterevin called Millstream Avenue where the voluntary housing association acted as agents for the council and built both voluntary and council units.  The people who live in the council units can avail of the proposed incremental purchase scheme, as they could of its predecessor, but their neighbours, who had the initiative to establish the voluntary housing association locally in the first instance, cannot buy.  One reason they cannot do so is because, as the Minister of State and I are both aware, the Irish Council for Social Housing and some of its participant bodies are opposed to a purchase scheme.  I believe it is fundamentally unfair to deprive such families, who had no choice at the time they availed of these offers, of the opportunity of buying.</p><p> I will conclude by noting that some Members have made reference to the Part V provisions.  In particular, I have heard my colleague and good friend from Kildare North, Deputy Lawlor, speak frequently about Part V.</p><p>I would disagree with many of the initiatives in which my former colleague, Noel Dempsey, partook but it was an inspired initiative when he brought forward the Part V legislation.  Ideally, that legislation was going to force the creation of a degree of social integration which it had not been the practice to provide in this country.  The Minister of State knows that parts of towns and cities had swathes of local authority housing on one side while the other side had bungalow bliss and private accommodation and there was no social integration.  I say to the Minister of State, for the love of God, to please protect Part V and to please make it work.  In my view a lot of local authorities need a kick in the backside because of how they dealt with the very important Part V provision.  </p><p> I am concerned about the level of homelessness.  Local authorities are now struggling to deal with the homelessness challenge.  In my own constituency, the funding available to agencies such as Michael Garry House and Youth for Peace is hopelessly inadequate.  The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, opened a women's shelter which was built at a cost of a couple of million euro.  However, only two of the units in the shelter for women and their children fleeing domestic violence can be opened and this situation needs to be dealt with urgently.</p></speech>

We have raised this issue on a number of occasions in the House by way of Private Members' motions, for example.  The discussion of this issue is also happening in communities.  We all accept that there is a problem that needs to be fixed.  Sinn F&eacute;in would describe it as a crisis and I do not know what words the Minister of State would use to describe it.  There is a need for urgent action to deal with a significant issue which has been raised by constituents.</p><p>  This Bill has been three years in the making.  Like others, I have waited three years for the Government to take action to deal with this crisis.  I question whether the Bill is fit for purpose and suitably radical and whether it will deal with the problems in the system or will merely tinker with them.  I note the positive elements in the Bill which are welcome such as the recognition of the need to act on the provision of housing.  However, the Bill will do very little in response to the crisis.</p><p>  Over &euro;1 billion has been cut from the housing budget since 2008 and currently 90,000 people are on the housing waiting lists in all parts of the State while a total of 293 local authority houses have been built.  The waiting list is growing and the problem of homelessness is escalating.  Homelessness is a problem which affects the cities in particular.  There is a general acceptance that there is a dearth of housing in the Dublin area and the problem of homelessness is getting worse rather than better.  The cost of rented accommodation in the Dublin area has increased by 40% since this time last year, a pattern which has been established over recent years.  It has been noted that many private sector landlords are not prepared to take tenants in receipt of rent supplement.  Discrimination on grounds of race, colour and creed is forbidden but I suggest that discrimination against individuals on the basis of their economic need should also be forbidden by law, which would be a progressive step.</p><p>  I refer to the lack of housing stock and the discrimination practised by some landlords against some of the 78,000 households in receipt of rent supplement.  In many cases it is impossible to find a landlord who will accept rent supplement or else tenants are forced to pay illegal top-up payments in order to keep a home, following the introduction of two separate cuts to the rent supplement rate and the new rent thresholds which we have discussed in this House.  Many of us believe these thresholds are unrealistic.</p><p>  Many people who have lost their home through no fault of their own will go on a local authority housing list.  There is a nine-year waiting list in many areas, and even longer in some cases.  It is difficult for single persons as well as for large families to find suitable accommodation.  I have raised the issue of people with large families who have not been permitted to take a three-bedroom house because it would result in overcrowding.  In some cases they have not been permitted to avail of the RAS scheme even though their only other option is to go to one bedroom in a hotel.</p><p>  I wish to highlight some of the cases of homelessness which I have dealt with in recent months.  I had a case two weeks ago concerning a young pregnant woman who had fled domestic violence.  When her baby was born, she was asked to leave her accommodation and she was put out on the street.  She looked for emergency accommodation.  Her baby is three weeks old and she is walking the streets and has no secure accommodation.  I was informed by South Dublin County Council that the emergency accommodation list that day had accommodation for four people, three males and one female.  Applicants were advised to ring a central office at 4 p.m. to know if accommodation was available that night.  Dublin City Council is able to provide information at 2 p.m.  </p><p>  I usually get telephone calls on a Friday.  I know that a Member of this House accommodated a family of five in a local hotel for one night but that is no solution to the general problem.  Part of the problem is that many of the hotels that traditionally provided accommodation for homeless people are not prepared to do so.  Hotels are not ideal accommodation for families as facilities for washing clothes are limited and there are added costs.</p><p>This is an increasing problem across Dublin city.</p><p> Some hostels are better than others.  I have spoken to homeless people with addiction problems who were off drugs and alcohol but had no alternative other than to use what are known as wet hostels.  This creates difficulties for them as they come under pressure.  I spoke to one pensioner, a man in his late 60s or early 70s, who had been assaulted in a hostel by another hostel resident wielding a hammer.  I am not sure of the circumstances of this individual, other than that his marriage had broken down and he ended up in hostel accommodation.  The person in charge of the hostel was asleep upstairs when he was attacked.  Had it not been for two young people staying in the hostel who took the hammer from the attacker, the man would have been killed.  He telephoned me asking where he could go the following night and it transpired that the only option available to him was to sleep in another hostel.  He was too terrified to do so and the marks on his body and head showed clear evidence that he had been attacked.  Unfortunately, I could not offer him another solution. </p><p> When people put their names forward for public office they believe they will improve or change people's lives.  For years, public representatives found ways around the system and means of helping people here and there.  Increasingly, however, and despite the growing number of people who contact us, we are unable to offer any solutions.  Some of the problems we encounter are connected to the recession, while others are related to the length of the housing waiting lists.  I no longer have answers for people nor do colleagues inside and outside the House to whom I have spoken. </p><p> My local authority, South Dublin County Council, took an initiative on homelessness with which I am proud to have been associated.  Councillors are seldom congratulated but councillors in south Dublin recognised the problem of homelessness by collectively deciding to donate their conference fees towards the budget for delivering a 16 bed unit for the homeless that was opened in Tallaght last year.  While the initiative was launched by the alliance group on the council, namely, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and a number of Independents, councillors from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party subsequently joined.  This is an example of councillors responding to the housing crisis.  I thank and congratulate the individuals in question, especially as they do not receive a substantial salary.  They took a brave decision and showed leadership on this issue and deserve the congratulations of the House.  I urge members of other local authorities to take similar initiatives.  This year, councillors in South Dublin County Council are considering donating their conference fees to the budget for housing adaptation grants, which are being cut by central Government.  These grants support the increasing number of people who wish to stay at home and live independently and save the State substantial sums of money. </p><p> My constituency office is contacted daily by families who have been forced into homelessness or are on the verge of losing their home.  Every citizen should have a right to housing and the position in which some families find themselves is unacceptable.</p><p> I have addressed positive and negative aspects of the Bill.  The legislation takes a positive step forward in terms of improving the wholly inefficient procedure that applies to the summary conviction of tenants.  It improves tenants' rights by providing that the local authority must give a tenant ten working days' notice before beginning an eviction process in the District Court.  Many individuals and organisations will argue that this period is too short and eviction should be used as a last resort as it is not a solution to anti-social behaviour.  That position is a given.  Nevertheless, evictions are one of the few means of protecting communities as they provide a lasting solution in many cases of bad behaviour.  Previous speakers alluded to drug dealing and intimidation.  I am aware of cases where people were threatened with guns, burned out of their homes and had windows smashed.  Many of the victims are left to fend for themselves.  Sometimes the only option is to remove from the relevant community the individuals who are engaged in these types of behaviour.  While I accept that a multi-agency approach is required, especially where the individuals involved are young, if entire families are creating hell for their neighbours or intimidating people on the basis of their race, colour, country of origin or accent or because they wear glasses, they should be evicted.  I could list hundreds of cases involving people being intimidated from their homes.  The positive and negative aspects of the use of eviction need to be teased out on Committee Stage. </p><p> On the issue of succession where a tenant dies, the Bill provides that the occupier must be given ten days' notice of a District Court hearing on a repossession application.  If the application is granted, the local authority may then proceed with the repossession.  Some local authorities act quicker than others in securing possession.  We must establish parameters in this regard.  One has cases where a daughter or son moves into a local authority house to look after a parent who has been ill.  Such persons do not have succession rights and if the parent dies, they should be given time to grieve.  Local authorities must show flexibility and common sense when families experience a tragedy.  Some people will argue that a six month stay on repossession is too long and three months would be sufficient in cases where the occupier does not enjoy succession rights or does not have a recognised housing need.  People must be given an opportunity to find alternative accommodation because in nine out of ten cases, the person will be unable to secure private rented accommodation, particularly in the Dublin area.  The unfortunate consequence of this will be that local authorities will put people out on the side of the road.  This issue should be discussed on Committee Stage. </p><p> The Bill provides for a new tenant purchase scheme similar to that introduced in 2009.  I referred to the ongoing debate on this issue in the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party.  Most people are in favour of tenants being allowed to buy their homes.  Nevertheless, there is a concern that selling off local authority housing will shrink the stock of social housing if local authority housing construction is not increased.  The option of using the proceeds of sales to tenants to upgrade the remaining social housing stock should also be considered.  The tenant purchase scheme will not work if it results in the depletion of the social housing stock.  An incremental increase in the number of local authority houses is required.  While Sinn F&eacute;in supports the provision, the State must concurrently implement a significant house building initiative as a matter of priority.  </p><p> The provision allowing rent arrears to be taken from source is worrying.  Many years ago, people in the North engaged in a rent strike.</p><p>Flexibility has to be shown by local authorities because there are many good reasons, whether through illness or other pressures, that people cannot pay their local authority housing rent.  I am also aware of some cases where local authority tenants have not paid their rents because they are looking for basic repairs and maintenance to be carried out on their homes.  It is not so clear cut that the last people to pay their rent are local authority tenants.</p><p> I congratulate MABS, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, on the positive work in which it has been involved in helping people who have fallen behind in paying their rent.  In many cases, it was because the tenant had not budgeted correctly, which MABS has been able to assist.  On this idea of local authorities being allowed to siphon off rent arrears from people&rsquo;s bank accounts, are we in favour of private landlords doing the same to tenants who fall behind?</p><p> Community welfare officers have told me there is no mechanism for them to enter into their record systems information on repeat offending anti-social tenants due to data protection issues.  I have also raised this with the Minister of State.  I know of a case of one tenant involved in anti-social behaviour in an estate who did not pay rent for one year but when he was eventually put out of the house, he was moved only two doors away.  Those community welfare officers are paying their taxes, like everyone else, and are as frustrated by the system.  We need to examine this on Committee Stage, as we do not want serial anti-social behaviour offenders as tenants.  If we do not tackle them and their bad behaviour, we are only rewarding them by giving them other local authority housing.</p><p> While there are welcome elements in the Bill, the housing crisis is getting worse.  I do not see the radical approach required to tackle this problem in this legislation.  Sinn F&eacute;in has identified sources of funding that could be used for the housing market.  Will the Minister of State examine our proposals in this regard?</p></speech>

As usual, there was great passion and knowledge about housing provision.</p><p>  Deputy Browne suggested there was not enough time for the debate.  We did not guillotine it, however, and every Member who wished to speak on it was given the opportunity to do so.  There were some interesting suggestions such as the use of bonds, building social housing off the State&rsquo;s balance sheet and bringing back schemes that worked in the past.  I will examine all of these.  Other points were made about housing supply which is not strictly related to the Bill.  Some Members opposite claimed we were re-announcing stimulus packages, etc.  The package announced this week is new, not a re-announcement.  It will provide an extra &euro;20 million for new builds, &euro;20 million for restoring empty local authority housing and &euro;10 million for dealing with homeless people and families, a total of &euro;50 million.</p><p>  On the termination of local authority tenancies, we needed to respond to the court&rsquo;s decision that we needed to bring the legislation in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.  I agree with Deputies Crowe, Heydon and &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l on the need for a multi-agency approach to anti-social behaviour by local authority tenants.  Deputies Clare Daly, Stanley, Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan, Dowds, Naughten and Heydon raised the issue of anti-social behaviour and private-rented accommodation.  Side by side with this legislation, there is a Bill going through which will amend the Private Residential Tenancies Board and how it deals with anti-social behaviour in privately rented houses.</p><p>  Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan spoke about a particular investigation which revealed the poor quality of private-rented accommodation in Dublin.  To be fair to private landlords, that was a targeted examination of a particular part of Dublin where we felt there was an issue in the standard of accommodation on offer.  It would not be fair to say that it was a reflection of all private-rented accommodation in the Dublin area.</p><p>  Regarding excluding orders in respect of anti-social behaviour and their application, concern was expressed that these should not just apply in respect of a person's home but more particularly to the area in which they are carrying on the anti-social behaviour.  Deputy Catherine Byrne and Deputy Calleary raised this issue.  As well as prohibiting a respondent from entering or being in a particular house, the existing excluding order legislation allows a court to prohibit a respondent from entering or being in the vicinity of any specified area containing at least one local authority house.  Section 19(4)(c) of the Bill extends this prohibition to cover a specified place or area where there is at least one local authority house.  Therefore, it can be used if people go into another area and cause problems.</p><p>  Concern was expressed by Deputies Catherine Byrne and Calleary that the application of excluding orders should not just apply in respect of a person&rsquo;s home but more particularly to the area in which they are carrying out their anti-social behaviour.  As well as prohibiting a respondent from entering or being in a particular house, the existing excluding order legislation allows a court to prohibit a respondent in the vicinity of any specified area containing at least one local authority house.  Section 19(4)(c) extends this prohibition to cover a specified place or area where there is at least one local authority house.  It can be used if anti-social tenants are causing problems in other areas.</p><p>  Deputies Broughan and Shortall raised the issue of excluding orders being used against minors under the Bill.  My Department is liaising with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on this.</p><p>  The two parties in government are in favour of a tenant-purchase scheme.  It will provide an opportunity for tenants who have put down long-term roots in a community to purchase their accommodation.  We also want to ensure, however, there is a fair return to the local authority and that tenants are not put into financial difficulties by being offered a tenant-purchase they cannot afford.  If someone makes a profit on a subsequent sale of a house they bought out from a tenant-purchase scheme, the State can clawback some of that.</p><p>  Some Members suggested using the proceeds of a tenant-purchase scheme to build more housing units.  This is provided for under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Deputy Kitt asked what properties would be excluded under the scheme.  Regulations will be introduced on the exact operation of the scheme which will outline the excluded properties.  For example, it will include dwellings designed for elderly persons, affordable housing and properties shared in a building.  There is already an incremental purchase scheme for flats.  Some Members claimed it is not operating very well.  If it is necessary to amend it, we can examine it in the context of this legislation.</p><p> There were a couple of issues raised around the resources of housing assistance payment, HAP, the business plan and how exactly it will work, and whether it will be affordable.  It is a commitment in the programme for Government and we have put quite a lot of preparatory work into getting it to this stage, both in my Department and in working with the Department of Social Protection.  That work is continuing also with the housing authorities.  It includes the design of the necessary IT and business process solutions that are required to facilitate the implementation.</p><p> The HAP is essentially new business for local authorities, with consequent decisions required as to how best to deliver the service in the local government sector.  In that context, and in the context of the wider local government reform agenda, Limerick City and County Council, as the lead local authority on the implementation of  the HAP, has prepared a business case examining a number of options for service deliver, ranging from a devolved model delivering most of the service in each local authority to a centrally shared model of service delivery, and this is being given careful consideration in all quarters to ensure that we provide a sound delivery mechanism for local authorities to succeed in the roll-out of the HAP.  The piloting has begun in Limerick.  It will roll-out in six further local authorities this year, beginning in July, and then, gradually, in the local authorities.  This gives us an opportunity to learn as we go along, from what is happening now in Limerick and what will happen in six other local authorities, so that we will be able to develop it and ensure that it will work properly.  It is a significant change, in terms of new business for local authorities and bringing over all of those who are currently on long-term rent supplement into the local authority system.</p><p> There were a number of other points raised with regard to the housing assistance payment.  I want to touch on one or two, particularly the issue of separated persons because that has been brought up by a number of Members.  I direct the attention of Members to section 46 which provides for a number of amendments to section 20 of the Housing Act 2009.  Subsection (2)(e) of that section deals with the case of households seeking social housing support whose qualification for housing support under section 20 of the 2009 Act cannot be determined because the household member who is separated but not residing in the family home still has an interest in that home.  This amendment will allow that where the household member would otherwise qualify for housing support, the housing authority may determine the person qualified for support in the form of the HAP or the RAS.  This determination will be reviewed at certain intervals and when the interest of the separated household member in the family home has been resolved, if that person then qualifies for social housing support his or her time in the RAS or the HAP will be reckonable if that person or household applies to transfer to another form of social housing support.  That is a question many Members raised in various contexts.  We can clarify that as we go along with the legislation, but we have taken the opportunity to address that issue in the legislation.</p><p> There was also an issue around the responsibility for the house or apartment.  In terms of the landlord's responsibilities, they will be covered under the PRTB.  Under section 43(6) a housing authority will be empowered, amongst other matters, to refuse to provide or to cease providing housing assistance in respect of a qualified or benefiting household where the authority considers and has evidence that any household member is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour.  That is how that relationship will work.</p><p> I refer to the direct deduction of local authority rents.  In the debate, there has been some strong support for that and some concern expressed about it.  At the end of 2011, the extent of the accumulated rent arrears across all housing authorities was &euro;53.25 million.  There is clearly a problem with rent owed to local authorities.  The system we are putting in place will transfer upwards of 60,000 households from rent supplement to HAP and we want to ensure that we can do that in a smooth way that will work for everybody.  The mandatory rental deduction facility will ensure that households do not fall into arrears and do not have the problem of considerable arrears that they then have to try to pay back.  That is the purpose of the measure.</p><p> For the purposes of clarification, it is my intention that those on the HAP will be eligible to transfer into local authority tenancies and it will not mean that they will never be able to get a tenancy.  That is my clear intention.  It is also important to note that the rent contribution that a HAP recipient will pay to the local authority will be calculated in accordance with that authority's differential rent scheme, which is, as the House will be aware, an income-based rental scheme.  All in all, that is a fair system, both to the local authorities and to the tenants, and will, I hope, address issues around tenants falling into arrears.</p><p> From the point of view of the current system of rent supplement, many Members referred to the fact that sometimes the tenant is paid directly and does not pay the money to the landlord.  In the system here, as Deputy Joe O'Reilly pointed out, there will be a safeguard for landlords as well in so far as they will get a monthly payment, it will be the entire payment and it will come from the local authority which will have taken the tenant's portion and will pass on the whole payment to the landlord.  There have been fears suggested, and I am aware there is a problem with landlords pulling out of rent supplement and the RAS, but there is a security for the landlords in this which, I hope, will encourage them to become involved, or if they have been involved in rent supplement to remain involved in the HAP.</p><p> There were a number of issues raised and I hope I have addressed some of them, at least the ones that are directly related to the three elements of the Bill.  We will have opportunities for further debate at Committee and Report Stages and I look forward to that discussion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2014-05-15a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014051500039#MM00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for remaining in the House for this matter which will be of interest to her in her job in housing.  I raise the matter because I am increasingly alarmed that we are launching into a period of construction with construction strategies, housing programmes and stimulus packages, and today there was an announcement of a strategic investment fund of nearly &euro;7 billion, but that it is all happening in the absence of an overarching spatial strategy.  We had a national spatial strategy from 2002, but it has largely been abandoned.  The only one paying any attention to it now is An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>  The national spatial strategy failed, not only because it was largely ignored by the previous Government and by the local authorities around the country, but also because it was fundamentally flawed.  It tried to do too much.  It promoted a scatter-gun approach.  There were nine gateways and nine hubs.  Effectively, one was talking about 18 growth areas around the country but the reality is we do not have the requisite population.  Despite that fact there is a rapidly growing population, we will not have the kind of critical mass necessary in 18 different centres to bring about sustainable economic and social entities around the country.</p><p>  The drift to capital cities is everywhere, but the drift to Dublin has been going on for centuries and seems inexorable.  It is not desirable for Dublin and it is not desirable for the rest of the country and the only way to counteract it is to identify a limited number of cities and towns around the country that we can provide with the kind of facilities that will hold the young populations.</p><p>  I saw a piece on the news during the week about a town - it probably is just as well I cannot remember which one - that was in danger of losing its post office.  One of the residents was interviewed and stated that virtually everybody in the town is a pensioner.  No post office will save that town.  No advance factory will save it and no number of houses will save it.  All that will save it is if it comes within the orbit of a strong growth centre that has all of the facilities that will keep young people in such towns.  We need to identify these growth centres and funnel all the possible infrastructure we can into them.  If they are to hold rural populations in their hinterland, those towns must have all of the physical education and social infrastructure that one will find in a city such as Dublin.  I refer to the same range of facilities such as universities and hospitals, although perhaps not as big.</p><p>Otherwise it will not be an alternative attraction to Dublin for young people.  The Government talks about the need for more houses, stimulus packages and construction strategies.  We recognise that more is good, but where jobs and houses go is at least as important.  I am not sure there is an acceptance, either politically or publicly, that we simply cannot spread housing, hospitals, post offices, jobs and Garda stations into every town and village in Ireland.  If we try to do so, we will fail and will destroy rural Ireland as well as destroying Dublin.</p><p> During the Celtic years, one in three houses was a one-off rural house.  I see no let-up in the historic attachment to that kind of planning.  We are trying to stimulate building, both infrastructure and housing, private and public, in the absence of a national strategy.  The Minister of State has done a scoping report on a future spatial strategy which is planned.  I am raising this due to the seeming acceleration in investment and because we need to bring it forward now.  Even if we bring forward the bones of it, we do not need to cross every &quot;t&quot; and dot every &quot;i&quot; at this stage.  We do require a plan, however, in order that the State and private investors can take informed spatial planning decisions when making investments.</p></speech>

In essence, it introduced the concept of spatial development to the public policy agenda and set an overarching framework for the planned spatial development of the country.  In this regard, it aimed to provide the spatial vision and principles to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development and population growth between regions through the co-ordinated development of the gateway cities and towns and hub towns together with complementary policies to activate the potential for lasting economic development in their hinterlands and wider regions.  The NSS has since served as a strategic context for spatial planning in Ireland by regional authorities in their regional planning guidelines role, for planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la in their statutory planning functions, and by influencing investment priorities, particularly in transport, housing, water services, communications, energy, health and education infrastructure.</p><p>  The current NSS was drawn up at a time of unprecedented economic growth and transformation in terms of economic output, population growth and their various interactions in generating demand for travel and other necessary infrastructure.  The economic circumstances now facing the country are significantly different from those in which the first NSS was drawn up.  The economic outlook from now to the end of this decade sees Ireland attempting to move from fragile recovery to sustained renewal, as it addresses the challenges of achieving sustainable long-term economic stability and growth.  In this changed context, it is timely to consider the development of a new successor NSS to provide a spatial framework complementing wider efforts to support sustainable long-term national economic recovery.</p><p>  Against this background, and while the existing NSS remains in place, I and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, established in August 2013 a successor national spatial strategy scoping group comprising three experts with extensive experience of spatial planning and economic and social development, to prepare a short scoping report on the development of a new national planning framework to replace the current NSS.  I received the experts' scoping report earlier this year and I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly on the roadmap to develop a new national planning framework.  It would be my objective that this new national planning framework will be finalised and in place by the end of 2015.</p><p>  I take Deputy Mitchell's point that we need to engage in a national conversation about this.  We intend to have public consultations with various bodies and individuals.  We will seek to have a balanced development in the country, as well as examining the strengths of various regions and population centres to build on those strengths.  The scoping document has been received and we will shortly bring proposals to Government.  We will then go out to public consultation.  I hope there will be a genuine national debate on this matter because it is about what kind of country we are going to create.  Spatial planning is very important in that regard.</p></speech>

In the meantime, investment decisions are being made so perhaps it will be possible to publish the broad outlines at the beginning of next year.  That would be very welcome.</p><p>  It is hard to believe, but we have the fastest growing population in Europe and it will continue to be the fastest growing until 2060.  The population was forecast to reach 4.5 million by 2020 but we had already exceeded that by 2011.  We are well on our way to 5 million and by 2060 it will apparently be over 6.5 million.  It is a good thing to have a growing population because it offers the potential to obtain the kind of critical mass necessary for sustainability in a number of growth centres, rather than having fragmented development as in the past.  We can get it fundamentally right or wrong, so it is important to grasp this window of opportunity as investment growth continues.  It would be an absolute travesty if we made the same mistakes as in the Celtic tiger years when we were putting 500 houses into villages that had 50 houses.  We somehow expected that it would be sustainable, but that played no small part in the economic collapse.  We do not want to go down that road again.</p></speech>

We have a lot of data now, including information on likely population growth as well as the need for schools, transport and other infrastructure.  We must ensure the hierarchy of planning, from the NSS downwards, will all fit into what is actually required.  We have started work on reducing zoning for housing in areas where there is clearly not a demand for it.  That is the kind of planning we require.  We need to get the top of the pyramid right, which is the national spatial strategy, and ensure everything down the line fits into that.  Whether decisions are made by local or national government, they must be made within the parameters of population growth and with the potential of various regions.  I would like to have a debate on it in the House when we reach the next stage in the process.</p></speech>

Having listened to Deputy Mitchell, I was struck by the correlation that exists between this matter and the planning issue she raised.  Together with Monasterevin, Kildare town was identified as a secondary growth centre in the last regional planning guidelines.  The reality for local residents, however, was that we had no growth at all.  Thankfully, we have no derelict sites or boarded-up houses.</p><p>  We got no new houses during the Celtic tiger period, however, because our sewerage system was inadequate.  It took considerable effort by politicians, including myself, and the local community to convince the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that such a sewage treatment system should be provided.  It was provided, however, and something in the order of &euro;18 million was spent on a sewage treatment plant.  We now have a state-of-the-art plant but we need a network of pipes to deliver the effluent to the treatment plant.  Effectively, one will not work without the other.</p><p>  The treatment plant has been built and the network was at tender stage prior to the establishment of Irish Water.  In fact, I believe a tender had been accepted and approved and that a preferred contractor had been identified.  Therefore, I read with great interest this week about Irish Water's proposed capital investment plan.  I went through it and found the Kildare sewerage scheme network with the comment &quot;Continued planning and business case review&quot;.</p><p>The project is essential for the development of this area, which young people in need of housing are forced to leave because this network of pipes has not been put in place.</p><p> Much controversy surrounded the establishment of Irish Water.  It is seen as a super quango, has cost an inordinate amount to establish and has spent an inordinate amount of public money on consultancies.  In the first test of how it will perform we find that it will spend no more than the Department and local authorities were spending on capital projects in recent years.  One of the most significant capital projects in the pipeline, for which a tender was approved, must go back for further planning and a case review.</p><p> I ask the Minister to intervene and have common sense prevail.  Having spent &euro;18 million of public money on a treatment plan, it makes no sense to abandon the commitment to provide the pipes to get the effluent to the plant in order that it can work.</p></speech>

The Department has no responsibility for, or role in, the delivery of water services infrastructure or in the management, maintenance or operation of that infrastructure.  This is a matter in the first instance for Irish Water, the water services authority which is responsible under statute, for the provision, operation, maintenance and management of water infrastructure, under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Local authorities continue to provide some elements of waste water services on behalf of Irish Water through service level agreements that have been put in place between Irish Water and the local authorities.</p><p>From 1 January 2014 Irish Water has responsibility for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure.  On Tuesday last, 13 May, Irish Water published its proposed capital investment plan for 2014 to 2016, outlining the indicative investment priorities in water and waste water services infrastructure over the next three years.  The capital investment plan consists of a targeted programme of more than 386 individual projects, as well as a range of sub-programmes, for delivery over the next three years.  On publication of the plan, Irish Water indicated that its priorities for delivery under the plan include elimination of boil water notices in Roscommon; providing more water and, in particular, reducing disruption to supply in the Dublin area; improving water quality; investing for economic development; tackling leakage; increasing waste water treatment capacity and improving environmental compliance; improving existing plants; and better control and monitoring of infrastructure and service provision.</p><p>Irish Water has confirmed that the Kildare Town waste water network is one of the projects listed in the capital investment plan and that it plans to proceed with its construction.  It has indicated that the project will be advanced subject to full planning - the Deputy might clarify whether or not that has been achieved - and environmental assessment of the project, having regard to all regulatory requirements and specific legal obligations.  The capital investment plan is available to download from the Irish Water website, <i>www.water.ie</i>.  The Deputy is probably aware that there is an Oireachtas Members' e-mail address, <i>oireachtasmembers@water.ie</i>, and a dedicated telephone number.</p></speech>

We have already read that the project will be subject to further planning and a business case review.  All the planning was done before the &euro;18 million was spent on the treatment plan, before tenders were invited for the network and before the Department accepted the tender of the preferred contractor.  Irish Water appears to want to re-evaluate the whole process.  Clearly it is merely a time-wasting exercise and a means of avoiding spending in an area where there has been no significant development in recent times.  Were this area akin to the areas to which Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred, where there was outrageous development of 400 to 500 houses in small villages that could not be sustained, it would be one thing.  However this is in a town with a population over 8,000 where local people are being forced to go elsewhere to access housing, which we cannot build because we do not have the basic, essential services to which we are entitled and which the Department had approved before this super quango, Irish Water, came into existence.</p></speech>

I also suggest the Deputy directly contact Irish Water regarding this particular proposal.  I am not clear on whether it has full planning permission and the environmental impact assessment and has satisfied all the legal obligations.  If it has, there seems to be no reason why it cannot proceed.</p></speech>

Last year I was contacted by a school in my constituency in the Gaeltacht of An Rinn, Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Rinne.  The principal, Aodh Mac Craith, outlined to me that he had difficulty filling a vacancy in the school.  Given that permanent teaching jobs in good schools are hard to come by and the numbers on the teaching panel, one would think there would be no difficulty in filling the position, especially in a place as lovely as County Waterford.  The principal told me teachers were contacting him saying they were afraid of getting the job because their Irish was not good enough to teach in a Gaeltacht school.</p><p>  It is nonsense to expect teachers who are not comfortable teaching entirely through Irish to be engaged in such circumstances, particularly to children who were born into families where Irish is their first language in Gaeltacht communities.  Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Rinne teaches such children, may of whom are more comfortable speaking Irish than English.  The principal said he had received at least 16 e-mails from worried teachers.  These candidates said they would love the job but did not have the level of Irish required.  This was a major dilemma for the school and for those on the panel who feared they would lose their teaching rights if they refused a job which they felt unable to do.  It was a catch-22 for everybody.</p><p>  The school principal brought the case to local politicians and on to the Department of Education and Skills.  When it was first highlighted with me there was not even a box that candidates could tick on their panel forms to indicate whether or not they could speak Irish.  Through interventions from the school in Rinn and others such a box has been added, however there is no provision for candidates to indicate whether they are s&aacute;sta to carry out their duties in Irish.  Being willing to teach in Irish does not always mean a person would be good at it.  The Gaelscoileanna, like all schools, deserve the best teachers who can teach to the best of their abilities.  Would the Minister be happy for an English-speaking school to endure teachers whose first language was not English and who were not proficient in it?</p><p>  We have a duty to ensure, particularly in Gaeltacht areas, that children have teachers who have the ability to teach in the language of the school and are comfortable doing so.</p><p>The case of Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Rinne was brought to An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga last year and he agreed with its case and even highlighted it in his retirement speech last year, stating it was a classic example of the language being undermined.  Yesterday, there was a similar example with a Gaelscoil in Sligo, which had to turn away an entire class of 30 pupils because of a teacher issue.  This is not fair to schools or teachers and it does not show respect to our Irish language.  The panel must make allowances for teachers with the best Irish and not just those who are willing to teach in Irish.</p></speech>

At the outset I should clarify that teacher qualifications, including those relating to Irish, are designed to equip teachers to teach in all publicly funded schools.  The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to primary schools, including redeployment arrangements, are published annually.  The staffing and redeployment arrangements for the 2014 and 2015 school year are available on the Department website.</p><p>  Teaching vacancies are filled in the first instance through the redeployment of surplus permanent teachers.  Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term temporary or substitute and part-time teachers.  Redeployment panels are drawn up on a diocesan basis for Catholic panels, diocesan and united diocesan basis for Church of Ireland panels and on a national basis for other patron bodies.  The Department reviews the redeployment process with the education partners each year to ensure the process is operating effectively.  One of the outcomes of the review of the 2013 redeployment arrangements was that the redeployment process for the 2014 to 2015 school year would, on a pilot basis, give an opportunity to teachers being placed on main panels and supplementary panels to indicate if they were particularly interested in being redeployed to a school that operates through the medium of Irish.  This pilot approach will be reviewed in the autumn of 2014.  The purpose of this is to assist the school-led redeployment process for schools that operate through the medium of Irish.</p><p>  When the redeployment panels are published, a period is given for schools with vacancies to fill their teaching posts from the list of teachers on the relevant panel.  During this period there are informal and formal contacts between schools and teachers on the panels.  This pilot scheme will make it easier for Gaelscoileanna and schools in the Gaeltacht to identify and contact those teachers who are particularly interested in being redeployed to a school that operates through the medium of Irish.  The redeployment arrangements include provision for a panel officer to be appointed in the event that all the teachers on a panel have not been redeployed during the school-led redeployment process.  The redeployment of all surplus teachers is key to the Department's ability to manage within its payroll budget and employment control framework on teacher numbers.  Given our budgetary position, we need to have sufficient flexibility in the redeployment arrangements to ensure surplus teachers in all schools, regardless of patronage type, can be readily redeployed to vacancies wherever they exist.</p><p>  The panel officer process commences with the school of the same patronage that is located nearest the school with the surplus teacher.  The panel officer engages with the panel operator and with the school in his or her decision-making process.  As part of this process the school is given an opportunity to provide any relevant information to the panel officer.  This will now include information on whether a teacher on the panel has ticked the box expressing a particular interest in being redeployed to a school that operates through the medium of Irish.  The panel officer, having considered the matter, will determine if the surplus teacher should be redeployed to the nearest school.  The panel officer has discretion on this matter so as to facilitate, as best as possible, an appropriate match of a surplus teacher to a school.  If the panel officer determines there are valid reasons for not redeploying the teacher to the nearest school, the above process commences with the next nearest school etc. until the panel officer has identified the school for the redeployment of the teacher.</p><p>  It is important to note that the panel redeployment arrangements apply in the same manner for all schools, including those that operate through the medium of Irish.  Specifically, all teachers on a redeployment panel may receive offers of appointment from Irish medium schools, irrespective of whether they have ticked the box to indicate a particular interest in same.</p></speech>

He indicated the Department has a pilot scheme in place which will be reviewed in the autumn of 2014 but continued that if the process does not really suit, a teacher may have to be redeployed to a certain area anyway.  How has the process worked and is there any indication of it working efficiently?  I have just highlighted two cases, including the example at An Rinn outside Dungarvan in Waterford and the Sligo example, where a school could not fill a vacancy.</p><p>  As our teachers go through the same qualification process, one would hope they could be comfortable in having the ability to teach through Irish.  That is not the case.  It is important to natives of a Gaeltacht area like An Rinn and An Seanphobal in Waterford that they have the right to be educated through the medium of Irish by people who are proficient, professional and comfortable doing so.</p></speech>

The issue arises with regard to cost constraints imposed on us and the employment control framework.  If a school loses a teacher because enrolment numbers drop, the teacher would go to a redeployment panel while the salary is guaranteed.  The teacher must be redeployed into the classroom to ensure we get value for money and the contract is maintained.</p><p>  The new process is happening this year for the first time and I suspect last year's experience may have informed this approach.  It has been suggested that the process would be reviewed in due course.  Rather than having teachers such as those described in the Deputy's opening remarks, who indicate privately to a school principal that although they are on a redeployment panel they would not be up to teaching suitably as Ghaeilge in a Gaeltacht school, we should try to avoid such occurrences by having a box to tick which indicates that a teacher would be comfortable teaching through the medium of Irish.</p><p>  In theory the requirement is that applicants for initial teacher education must have done honours Irish in the leaving certificate but there are emerging difficulties in that regard.  I will listen to people from An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta and others in seeking to address this problem.</p></speech>
