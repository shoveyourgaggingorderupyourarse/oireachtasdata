In my view, the HSE must expand the sample audit to a full review of all files in north Kerry, going back 15 years, as a matter of urgency.  As the Minister of State knows, the Maskey report found that significant harm was caused to 46 children in south Kerry and that a further 240 were placed at risk of serious harm.  Since that report was published, I have spoken to social workers, parents, patients and former patients.  I spoke to a social worker who expressed concern about the supervision of children when there was no consultant psychiatric cover.  The social worker told me that requests were made for a review of children who attended CAMHS from 2005 to 2015, when a consultant psychiatrist was eventually appointed.  The concerns that she raised at that time were not addressed.  The social worker told me that many children were placed on strong psychotropic medication, with poor follow-up.  That was not even in Kerry but in another county.</p>  <p>  Some parents may even be unaware that their children were under the care of CAMHS because it happened prior to the HSE taking over in 2014.  I spoke to the parents of a child in the north Kerry area who is now in his mid-20s.  He was a promising sports player but does not leave the house now.  He suffered huge weight gain.  His life has been destroyed.  He was later told by another doctor that there was really not much wrong with him that justified that treatment and overmedication.  Parents who were desperate to get help for their children trusted doctors but were let down.  Their agony must not be prolonged by any more indecision and delays.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State called for a full review but that has not happened.  I am repeating the call for a full review.  On the heels of the Maskey report, we were told that there are reports that the medical practitioner at the centre of south Kerry CAMHS may have been assigned to north Kerry CAMHS patients.  That was reported by RT&Eacute;.  The sample audit of the north Kerry CAMHS patients was announced eight months ago.  The scope was limited to a sample of 10% of current patients or about 50 cases.  That sample audit was not enough then, as we said then and are saying again now.  The history of overmedication, no supervision, poor governance and lack of clinical oversight predates the HSE taking over in 2014.  I hear that complaints were made by social workers about poor follow-up in the Cork area from 2010 to 2012.  I also am concerned that south Kerry families are being let down.  They are not receiving therapies that they were promised and some therapies that were received were only online.  Despite requests from me to the Minister for Health and the HSE to extend the sample audit to a full review of all north Kerry CAMHS patients over the past 15 years, the HSE has rigidly adhered to the sample audit.</p>  <p>  I repeat my call to the Minister of State.  The consequences for children, many of whom are now adults, are far too serious for anything other than a full review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600003#A00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I am aware of the issues raised last week in the RT&Eacute; "Drivetime" programme.  The health and safety of children in CAMHS should remain the concern of us all.  The independent Maskey report of the review of care provided by south Kerry CAMHS made findings regarding significant failings across multiple levels of the system and made 35 recommendations to improve service delivery.</p> <p>Those recommendations cover a broad range of areas, such as the re-establishment of trust in CAMHS, governance of the service, delivery of clinical services, improved clinical practice and the use of information and communications technology to support the delivery of services.  The Government and the HSE are committed to implementing the recommendations as quickly as possible.  At the moment 16 of the 35 recommendations are in place.</p> <p> Deputy Daly said to me that a full review is not under way.  Actually, it is, as a full review of all 73 CAMHS teams across the country is under way.</p> <p> To provide assurance to those who use CAMHS, I requested the HSE to commission national audits in respect of prescribing practice, compliance with the HSE CAMHS operational guidelines and research on service users' and key stakeholders' experiences of CAMHS.  Those are three independent audits.  Independently chaired by Dr. Colette Halpin, the audit of prescribing practice in CAMHS is undertaken by an expert team, which is administratively supported by the HSE national centre for clinical audit and community operations.  Following an initial pilot phase, the full national audit commenced in July.  Data analysis has now commenced, with findings to be summarised in a final report prepared by the expert team.</p> <p> This all came about, as Deputy Daly will know, because of the situation in south Kerry CAMHS.  The HSE is conducting three individual audits.  Also, and this is important, I requested that the Mental Health Commission, which is independent of both me and the HSE, undertake a review of all 73 CAMHS teams across the country.  When both report I will have two parallel reports, which I think will give me great data I never had previously.</p> <p> As for the situation in north Kerry, I believe that the random sample audit works.  The reason we know it works is that it worked in south Kerry.  We did a random sample audit of 50 files.  Dr. Maskey identified at that time that significant harm had been done to children and that other children were also affected.  As a result of that, a full look-back was done.  However, I have to wait for the results of the random sample audit files, whether it is north Kerry, Waterford, Galway or Dublin, to see the results.  If then a full look-back is required, I will make sure that happens.  I have to go by the procedures Dr. Maskey put in place because I know they work.  They worked in south Kerry.  Fifty sample files showed there were issues.  We will have to await the results of this.</p> <p> Furthermore, massive supports have been put in place.  The HSE continues to engage with families locally, including the Kerry CAMHS family support group, on care and any other issues generally relating to the Maskey report.  Those affected can contact the HSE, as the Deputy will know.</p> <p> Furthermore, and I will come back to the Deputy in my supplementary response, I travelled to Tralee in August and launched the youth advocacy programme, YAP, for all users of CAMHS in south and north Kerry who want to advocate for themselves with the support of their parents.  An independent advocacy group is in place to support all service users of CAMHS.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600004#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  The only problem is that some of these families have been waiting 15 years since the misdiagnoses and the overprescribing of antipsychotic medication to their children.  They are suffering internally in their family units and their children are still suffering as a result of what happened.  The random sample, I believe, will lead only to a look-back.  At least 25 families have come to my office to ask that they be included in the north Kerry review.  Unless there is a huge proportion of people coming into my office, which is highly unlikely, a full review will be necessary.  It was announced eight months ago.  It was supposed to have been published within six months.  That has not happened.  It is supposed to be announced this week.  That is the latest I have been told.  I was told that about a week ago.  It is not happening.  The families are getting more frustrated and the status of patients who were treated pre-2016 is still up in the air.  The south Kerry difficulties dealt with a specific period from 2016 onward, but the Minister of State and I know that the problems were there before the HSE took over the Brothers of Charity Services in 2014, going back 15 or 16 years.  Some of those patients are now in their mid-20s and are still suffering, so they are getting increasingly frustrated by what they see as inaction.  Their problems will continue.  A full look back is inevitable, in my view, because this is continuing and because it is so serious.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to look into this - I know that she has called for it herself already - and to push the HSE into doing what will inevitably have to be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600004#B00300"><p>I am satisfied with the measures now being taken by the HSE in respect of north Kerry CAMHS.  When all this happened in February of this year, I moved very quickly to work with the HSE to put in place these three audits and the review through the Mental Health Commission.  We cannot lose sight of that.  There is a process in place.  The process is set out under the terms of the audit being carried out by the HSE.  What I requested at that stage across all 73 CAMHS teams was a sample random audit because I knew that it had worked in south Kerry.  Fifty files were audited and they showed immediately that there were issues.  Then Dr. Maskey performed a full look-back into, if my memory serves me right, about 1,250 files.  We should also note that there were 500 files of children who were medicated where no harm was caused to them.  It is important to say that.</p>  <p>  I have to await the outcomes of these and the other audits on CAMHS nationally that are under way, including the review by the Mental Health Commission.  This will help to inform any next steps necessary in respect of CAMHS in Kerry or elsewhere.  I want to build back confidence in the CAMHS teams.  We have 73 teams in operation at the moment.  We will have a 74th team in Wexford very soon.  It is important to state, however, that 2% of children who are referred through a GP or a primary care centre may need the support of CAMHS.  A huge amount of really good, positive work is being done by multidisciplinary CAMHS teams the length and breadth of the country.  It is really important that I try to support those teams to continue to do the really good work they have done, notwithstanding the issues we have.  The focus for me, the Department and the HSE is to complete as quickly as possible the various audits now under way along with monitoring take-up of the compensation scheme.  This will all help inform the next steps necessary.  I will keep this under constant review.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600004#B00500"><p>The latest Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, report on wastewater has highlighted major issues with poorly treated sewage continuing to harm the quality of our rivers, lakes and coastal waters.  The damage the report reveals is being done to our waters is incredibly worrying.  Some 51% of Ireland's sewage was treated to the European standard set to protect our environment, well below the EU average of 90%.  There are areas across the country that failed the EU treatment standards, but half of them are in Cork: Clonakilty and Kinsale, in my constituency, as well as Carrigaline, Cobh, Rathcormack and Mitchelstown.  Then there are the 32 areas where raw sewage is just being discharged into rivers and the sea, including Castletownsend, in Cork South-West.  Unless they lived in or visited these areas, I think most people would find it unimaginable that in 2022, we are still dumping raw sewage directly into our waters.</p>  <p>  This is symptomatic of underinvestment in water infrastructure.  There are many issues Irish Water needs to address but the Minister cannot pass the buck.  Issues with wastewater treatment are one of the major matters I deal with in my office, from the lack of a proper support system in Shannon Vale to malodours from wastewater treatment plants in Kinsale, Castletownbere and Belgooly.  Each time I bring this up here or ask a parliamentary question, I am told it is the responsibility of Irish Water, allowing the Minister to wash his hands of the matter.  That is not good enough because, ultimately, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has responsibility for water quality.</p>  <p>  This hypocrisy was most clear earlier in the year, when the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, visited Shannon Vale to see the impact of the lack of proper infrastructure.  A formerly beautiful park in the centre of the village is now a dangerous and polluted area due to the inadequate wastewater system.</p> <p>I tried to ask a parliamentary question following the Minister's visit but it was disallowed because he apparently has no responsibility for Irish Water.  The Minister was implying to the community that he could do something about the issue while apparently having no role in resolving it afterwards.</p> <p> Irish Water has an operational function but the issues raised in the EPA report relate to capital investment, which is definitely the Government's responsibility.  It clearly states that based on current investment levels, it will take at least two decades to get all treatment facilities up to standards.  The EPA has found that it will take a multibilllion euro investment and, based on current investment levels, at least two decades to get all treatment systems up to standard.  That is simply unacceptable.</p> <p> Some areas in Ireland are looking at the release of wastewater below health and environmental standards well into the 2040s.  There is a clear need for accelerated investment.  Each year, the EPA produces these reports and there is slow progress but this is shockingly slow.  New plans such as Castletownbere have come online but they have their own problems.  I have to once again point out the importance of investment in public services such as education, disability services, healthcare and now, water services, rather than giving tax cuts to wealthier people.  Every year, the Government chooses not to invest in water infrastructure and it is another year that our waters are polluted.</p> <p> This report only deals with wastewater.  It does not mention the areas in Cork South-West and throughout the country where drinking water facilities are at capacity.  Will the Minister of State provide the necessary funding to help communities such as Kinsale, Clonakilty and Castletownbere?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600005#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue on the EPA's urban wastewater treatment in 2021 report.  Having a well-functioning and resilient wastewater treatment infrastructure that will protect our environment is an issue of national importance and I appreciate the Deputy's concern in this matter.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  Irish Water's primary function is to provide clean, safe drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment.  In turn, the EPA holds Irish Water to account for its environmental performance.  The EPA is responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the necessary quality standards for the collection and treatment of wastewater discharges.</p>  <p>  As part of budget 2023, we secured funding of more than &euro;1.65 billion to support water services, with &euro;1.56 billion of this allocated to Irish Water.  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater infrastructure.  In 2021, Irish Water invested &euro;367 million in wastewater, which is the highest annual level to date.</p>  <p>  Many serious challenges remain which will take significant investment, as the Deputy pointed out.  The EPA has identified in this report the priority areas where Irish Water must target its available resources to deliver improvements where they are most needed and will bring the greatest environmental benefits.  Irish Water is also working to ensure that new capacity is made available for housing and commercial development.</p>  <p>  Irish Water's investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies throughout Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes to deliver improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.  It is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and wastewater infrastructure, including compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive.</p>  <p>  Some 93% of Ireland's public wastewater plants are compliant with the urban wastewater treatment directive.  The vast majority - 90% - of the total wastewater load that is not yet in compliance with the directive requirements comes from one treatment area, namely, the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant which serves Dublin and the surrounding area.  Irish Water is investing more than &euro;500 million in the staged upgrading of Ringsend wastewater treatment plant, which will deliver the capacity to treat the wastewater for a population equivalent of 2.4 million people, while achieving the standards of the urban wastewater treatment directive, by 2025.  Irish Water also has plans in place to address any outstanding issues at the remaining non-compliant plants.  Some 40% of the 90% of sewage about which the Deputy spoke comes from Ringsend, which will be brought up to standard by 2025.</p>  <p>  Since 2014, Irish Water has eliminated 60%, by volume, of all raw sewage discharges through targeted investment in new sewage infrastructure and is on target to eliminate nearly all of the remainder by 2025.  This work represents investment in 21 areas where there was no sewage treatment before.</p>  <p>  Urban wastewater pressures are impacting on 208 water bodies.  This equates to 4% of water bodies, nationally, where urban wastewater improvement measures are required to achieve water framework directive objectives.  Works are complete to address urban wastewater pressures on 12 water bodies and projects are progressing in 61 further water bodies.  Another 63 water bodies have assessments under way and for the remaining 72 water bodies, assessments will be initiated in a rolling programme to be completed by 2029.</p>  <p>  Collection networks will also need to be improved and adapted to a changing climate.  However, these projects are complex, especially in cities, and will therefore take considerably longer to address.  The number of areas on the EPA's priority action list has been reduced by one third since 2017.  Irish Water has a plan to complete works at all plants on the list by 2030.  We have a river basin management plan with public consultation that has to be ambitious.  With regard to the pressures that we are seeing on receiving bodies of water, the issue of urban wastewater is reducing and agriculture has taken over as the most significant factor.  Significant improvements are being made but I absolutely accept the Deputy's points that are still outstanding.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600005#C00300"><p>Unfortunately, that is the exact stock answer I have come to expect.  This is a pressing health and environmental issue.  Raw sewage and poorly treated wastewater impact on local ecology and has public health implications.  Wastewater in Kinsale and Clonakilty, two of Ireland's major tourist destinations, has failed to meet EU treatment standards and raw sewage is being discharged into picturesque Castletownsend.</p>  <p>  These areas need Government investment, rather than the Minister of State passing the buck to Irish Water.  The Government needs to provide the investment and then meet with Irish Water management to ensure that the projects are prioritised.  The EPA report clearly warns that, at current rates, we are still decades away from resolving this issue.  The problem is even more nuanced as the new plant in Castletownbere, similar to ones in Kinsale and Belgooly, regularly have malodours coming from it.  Castletownbere is being held as an example of success in this report and by Irish Water in the media afterwards, when it is awful for locals.  This gives an example of where we are at.  </p>  <p>  Related to this are the exorbitant connection costs.  At-standard cost for a single household is almost &euro;2,300.  It is even more depending on the length of the connection and SMEs can pay multiples of that.  It is just nonsensical to spend millions on a treatment plant and then have families be unable to afford to connect to it.  That comes down to funding and not Irish Water.</p>  <p>  The least we should be able to expect from the State is a safe and dependable water system that can guarantee safe drinking water and a healthy environment.  That should be a Government priority and not an issue to just pass on to Irish Water.  Communities throughout Cork South-West and the country need investment.  It is up to the Government to provide that.</p></speech>

It is certainly not the case that we are talking about decades.  We cannot take decades.  It has to be resolved.  Irish Water has plans in place for the 32 areas that were assigned in the EPA report.  Those plans will be brought forward.  The Government has brought in record investment over the past number of years.  We are front-loading that investment.  It is critically important we do so from a human health perspective, a biodiversity perspective and with regard to development of these small urban settlements.</p>  <p>  If there are specific issues, which I know the Deputy has brought to the attention of the Minister, we will certainly work with Irish Water on them.  The Minister has been deeply committed to ensuring that we achieve these targets and to holding Irish Water to account to ensure it will meet those targets.  We accept there has been historic underinvestment by successive Governments but that investment is being addressed.  The structural issues around Irish Water and the establishment are being addressed.  I have a hand in the river basin management plans.  We have to make sure that we get these water bodies up to a good standard.  It is critically important, from all of these perspectives, that we address the issue.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the issues around Clonakilty and other parts of west Cork that have to be addressed and which may have come under increasing pressure, especially during the tourism season in the summer months.  Capacity has to be built in and future-proofed.  We will continue to work with Irish Water on that.  The EPA report is very useful in highlighting where the challenges.  We are confident that Irish Water has the capacity and the ability to address the challenges, especially for these smaller settlements, which are equally as important as the Ringsend plant or those in any of the larger urban settlements.</p></speech>

I raised this issue on 19 January on the floor of the D&aacute;il and raised it again on 30 March.  I have raised it at the Committee of Public Accounts a number of times and have also raised it in a series of parliamentary questions.  I am raising it again this morning because it is really important that we get a domestic violence refuge in the county.</p>  <p>  The third national strategy on domestic violence issues was launched recently and I welcome that.  In that strategy, 12 locations in the country which do not have domestic violence refuges, including, nine counties, are identified as priorities.  Laois is one of the counties identified, as is Offaly.  The midlands is without one of these centres as there is no refuge in either Laois or Offaly.  Domestic abuse services in Laois and Offaly are both doing great work but are under pressure.  The pandemic brought its own problems but there was a 38% increase in demand last year.  We were coming out of the pandemic at that stage but unfortunately, domestic violence is an increasing problem.  It is a cultural, educational and societal problem.  In the Laois centre, there was a 38% increase year on year in the number of clients supported, with 505 people receiving actual support.  People working in the service tell me that the cases are becoming more complex and the annual reports of domestic violence services show that clearly.  The services can only do so much without a safe refuge for people, sometimes men but mainly women and children, who are trying to escape domestic violence.  </p>  <p>  There is little or no emergency accommodation available in the county.  Laois County Council is really firefighting at the moment in terms of the provision of homeless accommodation.  Unfortunately, the fact that people are fleeing Putin's illegal war in Ukraine is bringing its own pressures.  Accommodation that might have been available in the social housing system or by way of HAP tenancies is becoming more difficult to source and there are waiting lists for emergency accommodation.  Typically, people are being sent out of the county to access services, which means taking them away from local schools, doctors and other services and away from family supports.  </p>  <p>  The Laois Domestic Abuse Service has a four-year strategic plan and it was confirmed to me again yesterday that a refuge is the number one priority for the staff and the board.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm that capital funding has been announced for a refuge in Laois and that money will not be a barrier.  Can he assure me that if the jigsaw can be put together in terms of identifying a suitable site and so on, the money will be forthcoming?  A strategy group is in place locally and is working on this.  Tusla is working with that group, along with a number of other stakeholders.  It is really important that money does not become the barrier to getting a refuge in place.  People are at their most vulnerable when they are escaping domestic violence.  Often women and children go back into abusive situations because they have no other option.  They need a refuge space to feel safe, get their head together, access support services and to plan a way forward.  That may involve obtaining barring orders and so on but they need that space.</p></speech>

It is the intention of the Minister for Justice that every person who needs a refuge space will have access to one.  The Minister fully acknowledges the need for a significant increase in the provision of refuge spaces and she is committed to achieving this to ensure that victims have a safe place when they need it.  In June, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, brought to Government the third national strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, Zero Tolerance.</p>  <p>  The strategy has a particular focus on prevention and on ensuring victims are better supported.  As part of this, it contains actions for nationwide delivery of refuge accommodation.  As a start, the strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places.  This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces.  We will also work to deliver additional safe house and step-down accommodation.  We have identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of additional family refuge spaces would have the most impact, if prioritised.  These priority areas, as the Deputy is aware, include Portlaoise, where eight family places are suggested as a potential refuge size requirement.  </p>  <p>  The Minister is informed by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, that a group involving local stakeholders, including the Laois Domestic Abuse Service, has been established to take forward plans to develop the proposed refuge and associated support services.  Planning is not yet at the stage to identify the specific amount of either capital or revenue funding required.  Furthermore, planning is not sufficiently advanced to identify the specific timelines for completion of the refuge, but Tusla and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be working with local stakeholders to support and ensure the process progresses as fast as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy can appreciate, due to the variations in sites, resources available and specific local features, the costs for each of the planned refuge developments will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on funding will be supported into the future by work being progressed nationally to develop principles for refuge design.  Tusla will continue to engage with stakeholders to support the refuge development process in County Laois.  The Minister informs me that in 2022, the Laois Domestic Abuse Service was allocated &euro;281,440, with &euro;79,000 in additional funding to strengthen its capacity for the provision of supports to women and to further develop services to children impacted by domestic violence and abuse.  Additional resources such as project management support and other supports for capacity building will be available to the Laois Domestic Abuse Service and other organisations taking forward refuge developments in the 12 priority locations, as outlined in the third national strategy.</p></speech>

The point I want to make strongly is that typically, women and children fleeing domestic violence would be sent to emergency accommodation or refuges but the supply of emergency accommodation, which is typically in the private rental or bed-and-breakfast sector, is drying up.  In many cases it is also not suitable for women and children fleeing domestic violence situations.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the strategy has a particular focus on prevention and on ensuring that victims are better supported.  The delivery of refuge accommodation is central to that.  While I welcome that element of the Minister of State's reply, I am a bit concerned by his statement that the "costs for each of the planned refuge developments will be considered on a case-by-case basis".  That is fair enough but I ask him to restate the overall figure and to confirm that it is still available.  As I recall, funding in excess of &euro;300 million was announced for the strategy and I ask for confirmation that the money is there to provide these much-needed centres in each of the areas that do not have one, including County Laois.  Offaly is putting forward a different solution and that is fine.  The domestic violence service there is doing good work but the geographic situation in that county is different.  </p>  <p>  A number of site options are being considered in Laois and I do not believe finding a site will be a problem.  There is great local commitment to the development of a refuge from the local authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and various other stakeholders.  Ms Marna Carroll, the service director of Laois Domestic Abuse Service, and her staff have done Trojan work and I commend them on all of their efforts, particularly over the last couple of years through the pandemic.  It has not been easy for them.  All public representatives in the area have had occasion to refer people to the service, sometimes too often.  It is really important that we do this, that we give women and children support at that vulnerable point in their lives.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me on that.  I ask him to confirm that the pounds, shillings and pence are available and that money will not be a barrier when a suitable site is located.  We must move these projects on quickly.  We do not want them to take forever and a day.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that these projects must be up and running quickly.  We do not want any delays.</p></speech>

I have heard the Deputy's concerns clearly and will relay them to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.</p> <p>I heard very clearly and understand the very strong commitment in County Laois to deliver this necessary accommodation to support women and children who find themselves in the horrific situation of domestic violence or abuse.  I do not have the global figure to hand, but I will get it for the Deputy.  I assure him that funding is in place to support the establishment and building of necessary refuge accommodation over the coming years.</p> <p> As previously mentioned, the central element of the new strategy is that everyone who needs a refuge space should be able to access once.  When someone is faced with the difficult choice to leave an abusive situation, the Minister wants them to know exactly where they can turn to for help.  Over the lifetime of this strategy, we will see the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces.  The Minister believes that we will be putting in place the correct structures to deliver additional refuge accommodation now, including the development of a new strategy, and that it will accelerate the number of additional spaces that can be opened each year.  Work undertaken in implementing the strategy has already prepared the way for this, including a significant increase in funding as part of budget 2023.  An interdepartmental group is developing and progressing agreed processes and approaches to ensure that we will have the highest standard of refuge accommodation delivered in the most efficient way.  The Minister knows that there is much to do, but, along with our Government colleagues, we are determined to do whatever is necessary.</p> <p> Again, I will read the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns to the Minister.  In my county we have the Wexford Women&rsquo;s Refuge and Wexford Rape Crisis, both of which do fantastic and absolutely wonderful work.  I know how important it is for Laois to have its own accommodation.  I will relay that to the Minister.</p></speech>

Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland is failing to meet its hopelessly inadequate targets to increase the supply of social and affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the most accurate estimate for households with a housing need may be close to 122,000, when you include those on the waiting list and in receipt of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and other housing support payments;<br /><br />&mdash; of the 4,100 affordable and Cost Rental homes promised for 2022, only 325 affordable and 234 Cost Rental homes have been delivered to end of Q2 2022;<br /><br />&mdash; of the 9,000 social homes promised for 2022, only 1,500 have been delivered at the midpoint in 2022;<br /><br />&mdash; homelessness figures have risen in the last year from 8,475 to a record 10,805 people in August, including 3,220 children;<br /><br />&mdash; according to the Government, 2,273 households could have faced eviction over the winter, but that could have been higher if we take into account those who received a termination of tenancy date that was prior to the emergency period as set out in the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022; and<br /><br />&mdash; according to the Economic and Social Research Institute, the proportion of households eligible for social housing or social housing supports, such as HAP, RAS and leasing, fell from 46.8 per cent in 2011 to 33.9 per cent by 2019, and this has undoubtedly fallen further over the last two years because of the failure of the Government to raise social housing income thresholds; </blockquote>further notes that: <blockquote> 	&mdash; the Government has committed to introducing an eviction ban from November 2022 to the end of March 2023;<br /><br />&mdash; many tenants who receive Notices of Termination on grounds of sale are in HAP, RAS or Rent Supplement properties, where the State is already paying the majority of the rent;<br /><br />&mdash; many others who receive Notices of Termination have incomes above the income thresholds for social housing or social housing supports, but are unable to find affordable rental properties or property to purchase;<br /><br />&mdash; according to Census 2022, there are 166,752 vacant homes, excluding holiday homes, across the State, of which 48,387 have been vacant for at least six years;<br /><br />&mdash; there are also an estimated 22,000 derelict sites across the State; and<br /><br />&mdash; sites with full planning permission for 80,000 homes are being held by developers and investors that are not being built on, and delivery of private housing is falling short of targets; and </blockquote>calls on the Government to: <blockquote> 	&mdash; use the period of the five-month ban on evictions to pursue, by all means at its disposal, an increase in the provision of social and affordable homes, above the targets set by Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland;<br /><br />&mdash; introduce a &quot;Use it or Lose it&quot; scheme, whereby vacant and derelict properties and sites that are not activated within six months without reasonable excuse are acquired by the State, if necessary, by means of a compulsory purchase order, and such acquired properties and sites will be developed and made available for social and affordable housing;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure local authorities acquire HAP, RAS, Rent Supplement properties and other rental properties where the tenants are in receipt of a no-fault Notices of Termination on grounds of sale and where that acquisition would secure that home for the tenants;<br /><br />&mdash; ensure that local authorities embark on a pro-active programme of acquiring rental and developer properties that would be suitable for social and affordable housing, above the current Part V requirement;<br /><br />&mdash; increase income thresholds to ensure all households unable to afford private market rents and house prices are eligible for State housing supports;<br /><br />&mdash; impose tax measures to ensure that developers and corporate landlords do not profit from the foregoing acquisition programme; and<br /><br />&mdash; establish a State construction company and, in coordination with local authorities, speedily progress public housing projects, retrofitting and maintenance of public housing, thereby eliminating the long delays that arise from tendering and outsourcing processes, and the risk of public housing projects stalling or collapsing due to withdrawal or non-delivery of contractors or developers. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>I cannot believe that the senior Minister is not present for the debate on this motion.</p></speech>

We are facing an unprecedented housing, homelessness, and accommodation crisis.  Hundreds of thousands of people have been let down by the Government not providing the most basic thing, namely, a secure, affordable roof over the heads of individuals, families, and children.  There are 122,000 households on the various housing lists.  Almost 11,000 families, including 3,000 children, are in homeless accommodation.  Thousands of Ukrainians, who have fled war and conflict and are in desperate situations, are being failed by the State and the Government not providing a basic thing, which is to have a roof over their heads.</p>  <p>  The motion points out that the answer to this crisis is staring us in the face.  According to the census, there are 160,000 vacant properties in this country, 48,000 of which had been empty for the six years since the previous census.  In addition, although we do not do a proper count of derelict properties, it is estimated that there are at least 20,000 derelict properties.  The answer to the housing crisis, to the homelessness misery, and to the desperate situation of Ukrainians who need and deserve our assistance, is staring us in the face.  It is for the State and the Government to take the necessary action to bring derelict properties into use to house all those who need a secure, affordable roof over their heads.</p>  <p>  We are proposing a number of measures that could begin to address the crisis because we do not want to just give out about the situation.  The central solution, which we have not even included in the motion because we have put it out there so many times, as have others, is for the Government to dramatically ramp up construction of its own public and affordable housing on the abundant public land that is out there.  To understand the scale of the Government's failure in this regard, I refer to my area, which is one of the areas worst affected by the housing crisis.  Even if the targets are met in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area, when the Housing for All plan concludes in 2026, more people being on the housing waiting list than there are now.  That is how inadequate the plan is.</p>  <p>  As our motion sets out, the Government is failing spectacularly to meet its own targets for the delivery of social and affordable housing.  The Government's target for 2022 is 9,000 social homes, but it had delivered only 1,500 halfway through the year.  The Government promised 4,100 affordable and cost rental homes, but it has only delivered 325 affordable homes and 234 cost-rental homes halfway through the year.  These are hopelessly inadequate targets.  The ability of the Government to implement even its own targets is hopelessly inadequate.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge that, albeit belatedly and under massive pressure from the Opposition and as a result of the public outcry, the Government finally brought in an eviction ban.  If you want to address an unprecedented homelessness crisis, the obvious thing to do is to prevent further people from being driven into homelessness, which the Government has allowed to happen on a spectacular level over recent years.  In just one year, the number of people in homeless accommodation went from 8,400 to 10,800 because the Government allowed people to be evicted into homelessness.  Looking at the situation in Tathony House, Dublin 8, you get an idea of the motivations behind people being driven into homelessness.  The owner of the 35 properties is estimated to be making an income of &euro;700,000 per year and is claiming financial hardship as a justification for evicting 35 households.  That is absolutely disgusting.  Even the eviction ban the Government brought in has a loophole such that any tenant who got a termination date before the introduction of the legislation could be evicted in the coming months, in the depths of winter, which is something the Government had better amend in the legislation that will come before the House this afternoon.</p>  <p>  I refer to immediate solutions.  If we have 166,000 empty properties, of which 48,000 have been empty for six years, and 20,000 derelict properties, the answer is simply for the Government to take those properties under its control, refurbish them and use the necessary construction capacity to make them available as social and affordable housing.  However, the Government refuses to do that.  For four years, I have been pointing to an example of that in my area.  Some 17 apartments at St. Helen's Court have been empty for two to three years and the landlord - a vulture fund - has been trying to evict the rest of the tenants for a number of years.  The Government will still not take control of those properties.  We maintain that there should be a use-it-or-lose-it provision.  If a property is vacant for more than six months without good reason, the State should acquire it, by means of compulsory purchase order if necessary, in order to deliver social and affordable housing.</p>  <p>  Similarly, there are 80,000 sites with planning permission.  In many cases, however, developers are sitting on those sites, drip-feeding housing and watching the value of their properties go up.  In fact, the worse the housing crisis gets, the more money they make from the value of their properties.  Such sites with planning permission should be taken over by the State in order to deliver social and affordable housing,.  The Government should create a State construction company in order that we are not dependent on private developers to do it.  We should do it directly ourselves.</p></speech>

The scale of the housing crisis and how it affects ordinary people is a consequence of policy.  There are almost 11,000 people in emergency accommodation, more than 3,000 of whom are children whose lives will be forever blighted by their experience.  Hundreds of thousands of people are stuck living with their parents because they cannot afford to rent.  Some 250,000 people are on the social housing waiting list, or are on HAP or RAS precarious private tenancies.  Students are asking students unions if they can pitch a tent on campus because they cannot afford a room.  Traveller families are in horrific accommodation.  Now, refugees are unable to find shelter having fled from war.  None of that is natural or inevitable.  It is the consequence of years of aggressive neoliberal policies on housing by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour, and the Green Party.  It is all based on a policy that states the right of those people to a home comes second to the right of developers and big corporate landlords to maximise their profits.</p> <p>Fundamentally their right to do what they want with their private property, to maximise their profit, comes before the right of society to say no, we want people in one of the wealthiest countries in the world to have a home.  It is the consequence of commodification, privatisation and financialisation of housing that unfortunately is taking place right around the world.  The issue of vacant properties really gets to the heart of it because this is the most immediate solution to the crisis that people face.  There are vacant properties in every community, town and city throughout the State.  The most immediate solution is to use those vacant properties for people who need them.  It is also the most ecologically sustainable solution because the cost in terms of carbon emissions of bringing the house that is already build up to standard is very low compared to the significant greenhouse gas emissions that come with building a new home.  According to Central Statistics Office, CSO, data, based on the recent census, there are more than 166,000 vacant homes across the country.  Almost 50,000 of those homes have been vacant for six years or more.  Of those 23,000 were vacant even as far back as the 2011 census which is more than ten years ago.  On top of that, at the end of 2021, there were 22,000 derelict buildings in the State.  Even allowing for a certain amount of over-estimation of long-term vacant properties it is clear there is massive potential to bring vacant properties into use immediately as social and affordable homes for the tens of thousands of households desperate for somewhere affordable to live.  The issue is for us to say you do not have a right to leave a home vacant in the context of a housing crisis; that if people do not use it then they will lose it and the State will intervene and compulsorily purchase the home in order to make it available for people to live in.<br/><br/>Beyond that is the issue of planning permissions.  An estimated 80,000 housing planning permissions have been granted nationally but not activated.  In the Dublin area the most recent housing supply co-ordination taskforce reports that for the last quarter of 2021 planning permission for about 75,000 homes was granted.  Of those just under 9,000 were completed and 18,000 commenced, leaving an excess of 48,000 unused permissions.  That is almost two in every three planning permissions have not been activated in the middle of a housing catastrophe.  The Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance collected data on strategic housing developments.  By February 2022 that toxic process had granted permission for almost 70,000 units.  Fewer than 13,000 had commenced.  Even allowing for those under judicial review there are still 40,000 unused permissions country-wide.<br/><br/>What do we know about who is hoarding this land with planning permissions?  Cairn Homes with a stock valuation of close to &euro;600 million owns landbanks that could accommodate 17,700 homes.  Of these sites 82% have planning permission or are in the planning process.  The vast majority of this land is in or around Dublin.  Yet Cairn Homes plans to complete just 1,500 homes this year, in the middle of a housing crisis.  Similarly Glenbeigh Properties owns landbanks for more than 15,000 homes but completed just over 1,000 in 2021, in the middle of a housing crisis.  Their right to sit on land in order to maximise their profit by building later rather than now is taking precedence over the need for action in regard to the housing crisis.  At the weekend <i>The Business Post </i>reported that the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, is now considering buying up &ldquo;dormant housing projects&rdquo; or partnering with other developers.  I can imagine that will involve some handsome profit for them.  Let us acquire these sites at agricultural prices now, cut out the developers and their profiteering, and start direct-building by the State and local authorities.  I do not understand what the Government is waiting for.  We are in the middle of a housing crisis.<br/><br/>We need a State construction company to deliver all of this, providing thousands of high-quality well-paid jobs and apprenticeships, working with local authorities to repair and retrofit vacant properties for occupation and to build new homes on the landbanks currently being hoarded.  The market which this Government defends and allows to rule has failed completely to deliver housing for a very long time now.  The State must step in and do what the market will not.</p></speech>

He said he had pulled the short straw, and indeed he has.</p><p>I have noticed that the Minister, unusually, has put in an amendment to our motion.  We have been listening to Private Members&rsquo; motions for months now where there has been no opposition from the Government, it does not argue against us or vote against motions, it just ignores them and lets them run.  This one however has been amended.  I did a wordcount on it.  We have 21 short paragraphs in our motion describing what Deputies Boyd Barrett and Murphy just outlined as to what we think should be a beginning of a solution to the housing crisis.  The Minister responded with 50 long paragraphs.  This place would drive you to drink to be honest because yesterday the same thing happened at the Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  When I asked was there any intention on the part of the Government to go to COP27 and argue for more funding for people who are suffering from the extremes of climate change, a civil servant replied &ldquo;blah blah blah&rdquo; for almost 20 minutes.  Can we get decent answers to reasonable questions?</p><p>This motion poses very reasonable questions and I want to pose a few more.  One relates to Tathony House, which has been mentioned, in Kilmainham, Dublin 8.  One of our members, a councillor, lives there and has been there for more than ten years.  They have spent &euro;120,000 on rent in that ten years.  They are now being evicted by a landlord who happens to be, and I say this for a reason because I will follow on with another argument, one of our own, an Irishman called Ronan McDonnell who has made millions out of this block of flats.  He is evicting 35 families.  Those families are not just Irish.  They come from all corners of the planet but they all work here and are rearing their children here.  They are all very scared about what is going to happen to them.  I wrote to Dublin City Council, DCC, immediately and said that this is in its area and we need housing, the people here are on the housing list, what is it going to do about it.  Its answer is basically that there are no housing assistance payment, HAP, or homeless HAP tenancies in Tathony House, there is a very small number of acting housing applications on DCC&rsquo;s list and it is not straight forward for DCC to intervene, that the tenants <i>in situ</i>protocol cannot be used unless there are HAP or RAS tenants there.  Whatever we try to do here with these motions, there are always going to be obstacles.  Protocols, rules and regulations are dragged up and brought before us either by local authorities or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The truth of the matter is that it is a perfectly good site for DCC to buy regardless of who lives in it.  We need more public properties into which to get people so that we can house them and give families security.  Even if it was a question of buying it and fixing it up there would be permanent homes for people in the future so that they are not putting &euro;120,000 down the toilet in rent over ten years to be told at the end of it that they are going to be evicted.</p><p>This is important in the context of the crisis of Ukraine and the numbers of refugees coming into this country.  It is phenomenal but the numbers are nothing like those going into other countries.  Ireland is in fact down the table on the number of refugees per 100,000 of population that we are taking in.  The biggest number of refugees that move around the world when people are displaced go to some of the poorest countries and are allowed to stay there for years with very few supports.  When people get frustrated, and I understand it, people are sick of listening to Ukraine refugees getting this, that and the other, and what are we going to do about Ukrainian refugees, I get that, but people have to be careful and remind ourselves that long before Russia ever entered Ukraine to embark on a war, long before there was any crisis in Ukraine, or a refugee crisis, we had a deep, extreme housing crisis here.  It was put best to me by a young woman, who has been on the DCC housing list for 19 years, at a public meeting recently in Ballyfermot.  Somebody got up and gave out about the Ukrainian refugees and she said &ldquo;yes, I get it, we all think they are getting everything but I am 19 years on the housing list and that was long before there was ever any crisis in Ukraine&rdquo;.</p><p>This housing crisis runs deep.  It will be used to divide people and to put us against each other.  When the question is asked about why we do not look after our own first, let us ask who are our own.  The landlord of Tathony House is one of our own if that how you describe it.  Many of the people who evade paying taxes in this country, many of the landlords who own and sit on empty properties for years and practically all of the politicians in this House, are our own.</p> <p>I include in that all of the politicians on the opposite side of the House who, after decades of rule by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, have brought us into this housing crisis and kept us there.</p> <p> It is important that the issues be dealt with and that the Minister stop playing games, turn up in the Chamber and defend himself.  His amendment reminds me of Lady Macbeth, who could not protest enough when being accused of doing something of which she tried to say she was innocent.  As Shakespeare wrote, "The lady doth protest too much, methinks".  In this case, methinks the Minister doth protest too much because he is guilty of all of the problems that have been laid out this morning.  The solutions have to be found urgently.</p> <p> I want the Minister of State to address the question of how we will deal with local authorities that, even when it is necessary, refuse to buy properties from which tenants are being evicted.  Can we deal with specific cases where occupancies do not necessarily tick all of the boxes of local authorities' protocols but do tick the box that is the need of ordinary people and families up and down the country?  This would accrue to us more public housing, which would be in our housing stock on a permanent basis.  In the case of St. Helen's Court, Tathony House or anywhere else, we need to instruct the local authorities to buy, buy and buy where they can, fix the housing up and make it habitable and permanent so that people can live in proper affordable public housing.</p></speech>

and substitute the following:  	&quot;acknowledges: <blockquote> 	&mdash; that there remain challenges to overcome, one year on from its publication, Housing for All: A New Housing Plan for Ireland is delivering through increased housing supply, a range of affordable purchase and rental measures, new initiatives to tackle homelessness, and ongoing, long-term reforms of the housing and planning systems;<br /><br />&mdash; that the housing supply is increasing, despite such unprecedented challenges arising from the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, increasing interest rates and supply chain issues; in the 12 months to the end of June 2022 almost 25,000 homes were completed and in the 12 months to the end of September 2022 almost 27,500 were commenced, and last year 9,183 social homes were provided, with the Government's target of 24,600 new build homes for this year on track to be met, and all activity is completely focused on meeting the targets in subsequent years;<br /><br />&mdash; that this increase in supply will be key to meeting demand, moderating price inflation, and addressing affordability for those wishing to rent or buy their own home; and the Government has made the delivery of new homes (social, affordable and private) its priority through the development, resourcing and implementation of the Housing for All strategy;<br /><br />&mdash; that, in this regard, the Government's immediate focus has been on delivering homes for households in the lowest income brackets, and for those facing an affordability challenge, with historic levels of investment (in excess of &euro;20 billion) through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the Housing Finance Agency over the next five years;<br /><br />&mdash; that over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes, and 18,000 Cost Rental homes; and<br /><br />&mdash; the recent increase in the number of households in emergency accommodation, through concerted efforts by Government agencies, local authorities and Non-Governmental Organisations, the Government continues to address the housing needs of these households and those at risk of becoming homeless, through a wide range of support programmes, including: <blockquote> 	&mdash; the proposed introduction of a temporary stay on tenancy terminations;<br /><br />&mdash; increased funding for void units;<br /><br />&mdash; reinstating delegated sanction to allow local authorities to pursue appropriate acquisitions; and<br /><br />&mdash; modifications to the Repair and Leasing Scheme to open up more opportunities to include conversion of commercial units to residential; </blockquote> </blockquote>notes that: <blockquote> 	&mdash; Ireland has signed the Lisbon Declaration on the European Platform on Combatting Homelessness, committing to working towards the ending of homelessness by 2030, and agreeing to promote the prevention of homelessness, access to permanent housing and the provision of enabling support services to those who are homeless;<br /><br />&mdash; the National Homeless Action Committee has been established; this cross-Government, interagency and stakeholder Committee which is chaired by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage ensures the continued coherence and coordination of homeless related services, policies and actions;<br /><br />&mdash; the new Housing First National Implementation Plan 2022-2026 has also been published and expands Housing First targets, with over 1,300 new Housing First tenancies to be introduced over the next five years; in addition, a Housing First National Office was established in March in the Housing Agency to drive the implementation and a National Director for the Programme has been appointed;<br /><br />&mdash; with regard to the delivery of social housing, over 23,300 households had their housing needs met in 2021 &ndash; this is despite the very significant impact the Covid-19 pandemic had on delivery; noting that most residential construction was halted for a 13-week period from January to April;<br /><br />&mdash; the 2021 Summary of Social Housing Assessments showed that there were 59,247 households assessed as being qualified for, and in need of, social housing support: a 4.3 per cent decrease on the social housing waiting list in 2020 and a 35.3 per cent decrease in the social housing waiting list since 2016, when the first annual assessment was conducted;<br /><br />&mdash; the latest Construction Status Report (Q2 2022) shows 8,247 social homes on-site, with an additional 12,327 homes at design and tender stage, and 118 new construction schemes (1,647 homes) added to the pipeline; in total the Construction Status Report provides details on 27,006 new build social homes across 1,566 schemes;<br /><br />&mdash; notwithstanding the strong delivery pipeline, Minister O'Brien continues to emphasise the urgency of maximising delivery, and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is working closely with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to secure additional projects to deliver in the short-term;<br /><br />&mdash; with regard to the delivery of affordable homes, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 and the Land Development Agency Act 2021, both enacted July 2021, are two important foundations that will enable the delivery of affordable housing on the scale required;<br /><br />&mdash; taking into account that 2022 will be the first year of affordable housing delivery (affordable housing schemes having been stood down in 2011), the first affordable Cost Rental homes are now beginning to come into the market, advertised at rates that are 40 per cent to 50 per cent lower than market rent; and these Cost Rental homes are designed to assist households currently facing affordability pressures in the private rental market and targets middle-income households, with household net annual income of less than &euro;53,000;<br /><br />&mdash; homes are now being made available under the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme and the nationally available First Home Shared Equity Scheme supports first-time buyers purchasing newly constructed homes being made available for sale in the private market;<br /><br />&mdash; in addition, a new Local Authority Home Loan has been introduced for those on modest/low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home and the Help-to-Buy scheme, which has been a significant support for first time buyers, has been extended to the end of 2024;<br /><br />&mdash; the LDA has an immediate focus on managing the State's own lands to develop new homes, the majority of which will be social and affordable; and the transfer of State lands to the LDA, with potential to produce 15,000 homes, is underway;<br /><br />&mdash; the LDA has also launched Project Tosaigh to accelerate delivery of 5,000 homes on non-State lands where planning permission has already been granted, but not yet activated; and<br /><br />&mdash; in addition, the Government has launched a new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Cities) Fund Scheme to address the current viability challenges and activate housing supply at density in city centres through the delivery of 5,000 apartments for owner occupiers; and<br /><br />&mdash; good progress has been made in advancing the vacancy related actions under the Housing for All strategy, including: <blockquote> 	&mdash; the publication of a 'Town Centre First' approach earlier this year, which provides a co-ordinated, whole-of-Government policy framework to proactively address the decline in the health of towns across Ireland and support measures to regenerate and revitalise them;<br /><br />&mdash; the establishment of a 'vacancy' unit within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, led at Principal Officer level, to drive the implementation of the Department's vacancy related actions under the Housing for All strategy;<br /><br />&mdash; the move to a fulltime Vacant Homes Officer in all local authorities;<br /><br />&mdash; dedicated support to local authorities and AHBs via the Housing Agency across a number of programmes, and specifically in relation to the Compulsory Purchase Order programme, and working with partners to unlock the potential to utilise heritage buildings for residential purposes;<br /><br />&mdash; reform of the Fair Deal Nursing Home Support Scheme to remove disincentives for the sale/renting of vacant properties;<br /><br />&mdash; planning regulations, that exempt certain vacant commercial properties from requiring planning permission to change of use for residential purposes, have been extended to 2025;<br /><br />&mdash; the successful launch of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund Scheme for vacant property refurbishment grants and the 'Ready to Build' grant; and </blockquote>&mdash; the planned introduction of a vacant homes tax in 2023; and </blockquote>furthermore, notes that: <blockquote> 	&mdash; notwithstanding the responsibility of each Chief Executive for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out their functions as housing authorities, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has sanctioned over 200 posts associated with the delivery of their social housing build programmes, with additional posts being sanctioned for affordable housing delivery;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government is also implementing a suite of measures to facilitate increased residential construction activity and put the housing system on a sustainable footing, through, <i>inter alia</i>: <blockquote> 	&mdash; the Attorney General-led comprehensive review of planning legislation and a new process for large-scale residential developments of 100 plus units has been introduced to bring supply forward quicker;<br /><br />&mdash; legislation introducing a Residential Zoned Land Tax (commencing in 2024 following publication of maps showing land in scope), coupled with legislation being developed to introduce Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones, these reforms will help to: <blockquote> 	&mdash; activate vacant land zoned and serviced for housing;<br /><br />&mdash; reduce land hoarding that drives up the value of land and cost of housing; and<br /><br />&mdash; ensure greater community gain from land value increases; and community gain will be secured through a proportion of the uplift in land values for the provision of infrastructure to support development and, where appropriate, social and affordable housing; </blockquote>&mdash; legislative underpinning to a new requirement that residential houses be ring-fenced for individual buyers &ndash; almost 16,000 units restricted to single purchasers or social and affordable housing by mid-May as a result of restrictions on permissions, with legislative provision for this 'owner occupier guarantee' incorporated in housing strategies and development plans going forward;<br /><br />&mdash; measures to increase construction sector capacity, including greater investment to increase the availability of apprenticeships and training, international recruitment initiatives and the new 'Future Building' initiative to spearhead activation and recruitment for the sector; and<br /><br />&mdash; a number of significant measures to accelerate research and innovation in the sector, including Enterprise Ireland's new Built to Innovate Fund, a &euro;5 million investment for the establishment of a new Construction Technology Centre, and a new Modern Methods of Construction Demonstration Park, which will focus on increasing specialised training capacity and allow us to better respond to skills gaps in the construction sector; and </blockquote>&mdash; while very significant global and external challenges have emerged since the Housing for All strategy was published in September 2021, the Government remains focused on achieving the targets set out therein, and as committed to last year, when the Housing for All strategy was launched, the Government is currently reviewing and updating the actions in the plan which will be published in the coming weeks, this will allow the Government to respond to these challenges and redouble the focus on prioritising measures to activate and accelerate the delivery of housing supply. </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>The Minister will close the second part of this debate.  Ours is a busy Department and its Minister and two Ministers of State share duties, as is common.  I am sure the Deputies will accept that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="10:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600011#J00100"><p>Under fierce pressure from below, the Government is implementing a temporary ban on evictions.  That is interesting because we were previously told that a ban on evictions would be unconstitutional.  Then Covid came and, under pressure, the Government brought in a ban.  It said there were exceptional circumstances and, due to the restrictions on movement for public health reasons, it was necessary to bring it in.  Now we have another temporary ban on evictions and the Government is saying it can get away with it constitutionally because it is only of a short duration.  The key argument for the ban on evictions is that it is a public good.  It is in the public interest and the public interest overrides the sectional interests of landlords and their rights.  That is a very strong argument for why a ban on evictions could and should be longer than five months.  It is a very strong argument for why a ban on evictions should be for the duration of the housing emergency or the housing crisis we have in this country.  I am glad the pressure from below has forced the Government into taking this step, but I point out the timidity of the Government on the issue.</p>  <p>  Regarding the legislation on the ban that will be debated later, the only point I will make is that there has to be an explicit protection for people who can show an inability to pay their rent in full.  I gave the Taoiseach an example last week of a mother with young children who is faced with a choice between heating, eating or paying her full rent.  She might decide to pay half the rent or two thirds of the rent for the winter months to prioritise her kids and their welfare.  Under the legislation as formulated by the Government, that woman could receive a notice to quit.  She would have the right to go to the WRC but there would not be a guarantee that she would win her case - apologies, I meant the Residential Tenancies Board.  I have the WRC on my mind today because the Debenhams workers are in there this morning.  That woman should be given such a guarantee.  To that end, we have submitted amendments to the legislation and I hope those amendments are passed.</p>  <p>  I will make a couple of comments on the situation with the Ukrainian refugees and the housing crisis.  This has been commented on quite a bit on national radio this morning.  The Government and the State have let down the victims of this country's housing crisis.  There are nearly 11,000 people in emergency accommodation.  It is often wrongly described as us having 11,000 homeless.  That is not correct.  There are 11,000 people in emergency accommodation but there are tens of thousands of others who are homeless.  That 11,000 figure does not include rough sleepers or people in women's refuges.  It does not include the huge numbers of people who are couch surfing at the moment, or others.</p>  <p>  It is fair to say the State has made some significant efforts around accommodation for Ukrainian refugees, but the key point is the Government and the State are letting down Ukrainian refugees as well.  Last weekend, 43 were turned away because of a lack of beds while 35 were forced to sleep at Dublin Airport.  The T&aacute;naiste has said there will be no guarantee of housing for people who come in future.  People can still come but there will be no guarantee in that regard.  They are being let down by the Government and the State.  There was a very positive and broad welcome for Ukrainian refugees from the Irish people when they began arriving at the end of February and at the start of March.  I believe that sentiment still exists and is strong within society.  We saw a brilliant example of that recently in Killarney.  Ukrainian refugee families were told at very short notice - 48 hours - that they would be shipped up the west coast to County Mayo.  These were people who had kids in school.  Some of them were kids in school.  They were people who had jobs and good connections in the local community.  The local community came out and protested alongside them, highlighted the case alongside them and spoke out.  Real congratulations are due to that community.  It shows some of the best sentiments within our society.</p>  <p>  It is also the case that the failure of the Government and the State to provide housing for all has created a significant amount of discontent, anger and resentment in our society.  Many of those who feel that discontent, anger and resentment correctly blame this Government.  They know it is the Minister's failure and the failure of the Government.  It has created this crisis.  One of the Minister of State's partners in government, Fine Gael, has held the reins for nearly 12 years now, although to listen to its members sometimes you would think they were grappling with a crisis they inherited a couple of months ago.  Fianna F&aacute;il has either participated directly in Governments or kept Governments in power, de facto supporting their policies, for a period of nearly seven years now.  Those people are correct and they are right to blame the Government.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, some of the people who feel that discontent, anger and resentment blame refugees for their plight.  If anything, that sentiment is on the increase within society at the moment.  To be clear on what I am saying here, Government policy and the Government's failure have created a situation that is lending itself to an increase in tensions between the victims of the housing crisis on the one hand and the victims of Putin's war on the other.  All those on the ground know that to be the case and that I am speaking some truth about this.  For many reasons, but now for this reason as well, it is urgent that we have a genuine policy of housing for all in Irish society.   The Government has been trying to fix this within the framework of the market for years now.  It has not worked, it is not working and it is not going to work.  That is why we need to break with the policies of the market.</p> <p>This is why we need an alternative approach.  I support the proposal in this motion.  It is an important proposal for the establishment of a State construction company.  If one looks at the local authority housing estates in Cork city such as Ballyphehane, Garranabraher or Knocknaheeny, there are many successes there.  Yes, there are some issues but there are many successes without a doubt.  This was public housing.  The role of the Cork City Council building unit, which is long since dismantled, was an important part of that.  The establishment of a State construction company is an important proposal.  I suggest that such a company should not have to compete with the private sector.  The private sector should be taken into public ownership, ending the marketplace solutions, and be integrated into such a State construction company.  For example, the largest construction company in the State, SISK, employs 2,000 workers.  It made &euro;23.3 million profit last year.  It was tasked by the Minister of State's Government with building many of the social housing houses that are part of the Government's target.  What did SISK do just a matter of months ago?  It threatened to pull out of building the social houses unless it got increased payments from the State.  What is that?  Let us call it by its right name.  At a time when we have 11,000 families in emergency accommodation, that is blackmail.  It is a threat and it is sabotage.  SISK's counterargument would be that there is construction inflation and if they are not compensated their profit margins will be cut and they might even be wiped out.  That is not an argument for stopping the building of social housing.  That is an argument for having not-for-profit construction and for nationalising that company.  While we are at it, we should nationalise all of the major construction companies and integrate them into a State construction company.  This includes BAM, John Paul, PJ Hegarty, and others.</p> <p> I also want to make some points about the defective block levy.  It should not be a tax on the product.  It should be a tax on the profits and it should be far higher than the tax that was levied on the blocks.  The construction industry, the banks, the insurers and the suppliers are the ones who should be taxed from their profits.  Of course they have threatened to pass this on as well.  Once again, one cannot control what one does not own.  If we are going to put all of our resources at the point of attack and go to war on this issue genuinely to build housing for all, for the victims of Ireland's housing crisis and for the victims of Putin's war, those are the kinds of anticapitalist and socialist measures that now need to be taken.</p></speech>

We have heard many of the untruths here again today.  We are told repeatedly by the Government that we will see an expenditure of &euro;4 billion annually for tackling the housing crisis.  I have recent figures from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage which confirm that first, direct State capital investment under delivering social and affordable housing is just about &euro;1.8 billion for last year, this year and next year.  Even when one adds in approved housing bodies' borrowings and expenditure and the Land Development Agency figures for last year and this year we will not even reach &euro;2.4 billion.  I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, that this means if the Government is to reach that &euro;20 billion target that he stated here today, the Government must spend &euro;5 billion next year, the year after, and the year after that.  This is something that the Government neither intends nor has the capacity to do.</p>  <p>  We also hear regularly that the State is the largest developer.  This is also not true.  In fact, last year of the 24,000 new homes delivered the State was only directly responsible for the delivery of 1,000 of those, which is 4%.  How does 4% equate to being the largest developer in a market?  We hear about the largest social housing programme in the history of the State.  This is not true.  The Government's targets are lower than the original Fine Gael development plan, and for three years in a row the Government has not even been meeting those, as will be confirmed at the end of this year.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that social housing need is falling.  This is not true.  If one goes to any local authority and asks for their gross social housing need report we can see that social housing need is increasing.  The Government is concealing almost half of all social housing need by taking HAP or RAS tenants off the list.  I believe this is deeply dishonest.  We hear that this is the Government of home ownership.  Let me tell the Minister of State that the more house prices rise the less people can afford to buy them.  It is a very simple law of economics and maths.  Everything this Government is doing is pushing up house prices: the help-to-buy scheme; the shared equity loan; and the enthusiastic welcome, particularly from Fianna F&aacute;il, for the very high-risk recent changes to mortgage lending rules by the Central Bank.  These actually all show that house ownership is going to be increasingly difficult under this Government in the time ahead.</p>  <p>  The biggest untruth is that the plan is working.  How can the Minister of State say halfway through his term of office that the plan is working when house prices are higher than ever before, rents are higher than ever before and homelessness is higher than it has ever been before?  Yes, commencements are up, which is good, but they are only back at 2009 levels and we had a housing crisis then.  Yes, planning permissions are up but people cannot live in a planning permission if those planning permissions are not commenced.  In fact, contrary to what has been said, the Government housing policy is not only not tackling this crisis, it is making it worse.</p>  <p>  Later today we will discuss an emergency winter ban on evictions, which is something many of us in the Opposition have called for before.  This is evidence of the Government's failure.  It is a demonstration that the Government housing policies are not working.</p>  <p>  As we have said over and over again, there is an alternative.  We need about 40,000 new homes a year and half of those, which is 20,000, should be public homes, with increased social housing delivery and thousands of affordable homes delivered at a genuinely affordable prices to rent or buy.  We need to be bringing some 4,000 vacant and derelict homes back into active use as part of that 20,000 homes every year.  It is quicker, cheaper and it is better for the environment.  We need to embrace the new high-quality, timber-based products that have been developed here and we must have at least 1,000 zero-carbon timber frame and timber product homes annually.</p>  <p>  We also need more action to protect renters.  This winter eviction ban, while urgent and necessary, does not tackle the sky-high rents and it does not tackle insecurity of tenure.  This is why we continue to argue for a three-year ban on rent increases, for real refundable tax credits to put a months&rsquo; rent back into every renter's pocket, and real security of tenure.</p>  <p>  With regard to homelessness, other Deputies have mentioned Tathony House.  There is a very simple solution.  In fact, the local authority can buy it.  The local authority can combine social housing funding and cost-rental funding so those tenants who to date were not eligible for social housing could become cost renters.  The building could be bought by an approved housing body or it could be bought by a local authority.  There is no legal or funding impediment as to why, subject to structural condition of the building, the building could not be bought.  In fact, if this Government was serious about preventing homelessness the Minister of State would be calling for such a course of action today.  I urge people to support the residents' protest at Wood quay on Saturday.</p>  <p>  Crucially, we need a referendum to enshrine the right to housing under the Constitution.  We are all waiting eagerly to see the Government's response to the commission later on.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the Government is not listening.  The Government is not listening to the Opposition but I believe that it is going to have to start listening to the people.  All throughout November there will be public meetings in the four local authorities in Dublin organised by Raise the Roof.  The cost of living coalition has mobilisation organised for 12 November.  Raise the Roof will be organising a major march and concert on 26 November.  The Minister of State can either listen to us or listen to the people, but the longer he delays the worse it is going to get.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in is more than happy to support the motion before the House.</p></speech>

The Government said it was doing this because it wanted to get on urgently with introducing a scheme that could work for the families.  Today I put it to the Minister of State that some 500 home-owning families are stuck in stage 1.  They cannot get access to financial supports.  They are stuck in dangerous homes.  In some cases these homes are just not fit for human habitation.  If the Minister of State could see them himself there is no way he would expect any family to live in some of these homes.  There is a real sense of abandonment.  There is a sense that the Government has pulled off a con and that they told the rest of the country that the protests and the stories that we hear, that cause us so much concern, are all sorted now, that the Government signed the cheques and it is all okay.  It is far from okay.  There are huge numbers of families, from Donegal right down the west coast, who are trapped in despair.  We must remember that it is almost three years ago that the Minister announced the first scheme.  This became a discredited scheme, which was the so-called "90-10" scheme.  It dragged on and on.  Then there was this new scheme, which is very limited also.  We will introduce amending legislation through our spokesperson Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin.</p> <p>I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister of State will not task the housing agency and local authorities, be they in Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Limerick and, soon, it is hoped, Sligo and other counties, with assisting families stuck in homes that are not fit for human habitation.  How can he force families to remain in those homes this winter?  Why is he not helping them find temporary alternative accommodation and paying for it?  Do they have to pay for a mortgage and find temporary accommodation which is just not there?  Why is he not looking at high-quality modular housing?  These things pit one set of people against another and it is wrong.  There are solutions for everybody but the Minister of State is making a hames of the whole lot.  Please help the families in these dangerous homes, urgently.</p></speech>

By every metric the Housing for All strategy is failing.  In Dublin 15, the housing crisis is at its worst ever.  In excess of 88 families currently face a notice to quit, an increase of more than 50 in a little over three months.  Some are relieved there has been a stay of execution, but for some the ban has come too late and they face a dire situation, particularly those who are overholding.  They listen to the news every day and hear there is nothing out there to rent, and they have witnessed over the weekend Ukrainian citizens and others seeking international protection being told they have nowhere to go and to sleep on the streets.  That is despite the promises from Government that there would be accommodation.  It is shocking.</p>  <p>  I asked the Taoiseach last week about emergency legislation to put to use on a temporary basis land that is owned by local authorities but zoned other than residential, such as GE or HT, that is close to other homes and services and that can be brought into force quickly.  Will the Minister engage with Fingal County Council and allow it to use special temporary legislation currently being used by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and fund modular housing for local authorities to keep Dublin 15 citizens beside their schools, jobs, sports clubs, friends and families?</p>  <p>  A cohort of families and workers, especially those outside the income threshold for housing, are at real risk because they do not qualify for housing assistance payment, HAP.  They are trying to find accommodation and cannot afford it.  We heard of a man living in a tent with his family.  That will happen more and more because rents are completely and utterly out of control.  Working families are unable to secure the limited housing available and are faring very badly.  In a few short months, there is an opportunity to give people hope.   We and the people need to hear from the Minister of State.  People facing homelessness need to hear from the Minister of State and the Government what radical measures will be put in place to keep people in their homes with a roof over their head.</p></speech>

It is timely we are having this conversation because on Monday my colleague, Councillor Noel Connolly, brought a motion to Kildare County Council seeking the establishment of a dereliction task force.  The meeting was told the council is in the process of setting up a town regeneration team, which it is hoped will make some effort to address the blight of dereliction that is rampant in south Kildare and the Portarlington area of Laois and Offaly.  It needs an urgent and consistent approach.  If we are to make any headway, we need a carrot-and-stick approach.  We need to encourage property owners to bring these properties back into use or transfer ownership to someone who will.  They need better support but we need to collect levies.  In Kildare, there is more than &euro;1 million outstanding.  It is not acceptable.</p><p>Unfortunately, in some cases the State is complicit in the dereliction.  At the top of Main Street in Rathangan the Office of Public Works, OPW, owns a large building that has been derelict for decades.In Newbridge we have O'Modhrain Hall, another building that has been derelict for decades.  This building was held in trust for the people of Newbridge to support cultural, music and Irish language purposes.  It has recently been sold and there is still no word on the<i>cy-pr&eacute;s</i>scheme which will decide how the proceeds of the sale are distributed.  I ask the Minister of State to use his influence to see if the O'Modhrain Hall trust has been registered as a charity and when a decision will be made on the proceeds.</p><p>I would like to challenge the narrative being put forward by neo-Nazi groups who have raised their ugly head recently to sow dissent.  They maintain that the housing crisis is being caused by migrants, which is not true; by people seeking international protection, which is not true; or by people on social welfare, which is again not true.  We have a housing crisis because of deliberate Government policy that favours funds over families and treats the roofs over people's heads as a commodity.  It has to stop.  Sinn F&eacute;in in Government will deliver change, a referendum on the right to housing, social and affordable housing and everything necessary to reverse the disastrous policies of this Government, which has presided over a 175% increase in homelessness.  It is a disgrace.</p></speech>

Government policy has brought us here, in case the Minister of State is in any doubt.  It has not happened by accident.  What has been described, quite rightly, by Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann as a housing disaster has been caused by six years of Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael policy.  The Minister of State will know the Green Party did not exactly leave the housing market in decent shape when it last exited Government, so it shares some of that responsibility.  Unfortunately, people who live in my constituency are paying some of the highest rents in this State and in Europe.  They are not only locked out of home ownership but they feel home ownership is getting further and further away from them.  Some 180 people are known to Fingal County Council to be on notices to quit, 92 of them in my constituency, and we have nothing to say to them because there is nowhere for them to rent.  There is no emergency accommodation for these people to go to so people are fretting.</p>  <p>  I do not know if the Minister has ever been in receipt of a notice to quit when he has nowhere else to go, but I am sure he, like me, can only imagine what that is like.  Those people are worried.  Many are overholding and will not be covered unless the Minister of State makes a change to his legislation.  They are very anxious.  They are seeking something very basic: security and somewhere to live, raise their family and be able to shut the door in the evening and know they can have peace and quiet.  It is chaotic to be on a notice to quit.  It is chaotic for your children if you are not able to tell them where they will be living in a couple of months.   It messes with your mental health in a way I do not think we will understand for many years.  It destroys families.  Government policy has brought us here.  A change of Government policy is needed, but if the Government will not change policy, I suggest with respect it gets out of the way and makes way for a government that will.</p></speech>

Each week we hear the news from the Government that local authorities are meeting their targets, so you might think building enough social and affordable housing to meet the need is happening, but it is not.  Not one local authority that has been in says that if they meet all targets on social, affordable and cost rentals, that list will not rise.  Not alone should we be stopping the lists from rising, we should be trying to reduce the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  Using Cork City Council as an example, I will go through a few numbers.  That council's target for affordable housing each year is 78 homes.  The council has estimated that 3,294 families will not qualify for either a mortgage or social housing in the next five years.  How in the name of God does the Minister of State and Government think delivering 78 affordable houses will solve that crisis?  Cork City Council thinks it will exceed its social housing targets, which sounds positive, and build 2,134 homes, but it estimates that 2,688 households will join the waiting list in the same period.  To make it simple, that means the council's targets, when they are met, will leave it with 500 more families on the housing list than it had before it met any targets.  We are talking about thousands of children being detrimentally affected.</p> <p>Cork City Council needs to build more, but its targets need to be higher.  These are Government targets.  It is setting targets that are too low and not ambitious enough.  Sinn F&eacute;in, People Before Profit-Solidarity and the rest of the Opposition are not giving out for the sake of it, which is what the Government always says.  We want the Minister to put real ambitious targets in place that will finally deliver and reduce the housing crisis.  Right now, the Government's plan is not working and the Minister should consider his position.</p></speech>

I have not seen the housing crisis as bad as it is now in Galway city in a very long time.  We are having a crisis in all the different strands relating to housing.  We are not seeing supply come on stream.  People who have been on the housing waiting list for 15 years have had no offer of accommodation.  There is nowhere to rent.  If the Minister of State went on <i>daft.ie</i>today to see what he could rent in Galway city, he would find nothing but if he went on a short-term let website to see what he could rent for a few nights in Galway city at huge cost, he would find a lot of places.  That is what is wrong in our rental crisis.  On top of that, those who have received notice to quit and have nowhere to go have nowhere to go because there is also a crisis in emergency accommodation.  It is not good enough for us to ask people to sleep on their friends' couch or live in the spare room or sitting room of their parents' house, as a family with three children.  That is not the way things should be.  It is absolutely wrong that the crisis is just getting worse.</p><p>Galway is a university town with NUI Galway and the Atlantic Technological University, ATU.  Students are coming in who have nowhere to go.  They are being told to go out to the countryside and see if they can find a place to live.  First, that is extremely expensive and, second, there is nowhere there either.  Even if they were to find somewhere, there are no buses to bring them into their lectures on time.  There were media reports yesterday that there are 30 students in Galway who have been unable to get to their lectures in NUIG on time because a few Government crises have come together: accommodation and transport.  The buses that are supposed to be bringing these students in on time are not doing that.  It is affecting everyone in Galway: those who have literally nowhere to go; the students who are trying to learn; and everyone in between who is trying to support these families.  It is simply not good enough.</p></speech>

One year on from the publication of Housing for All, the Government's signature plan is failing and failing abjectly.  The Minister of State might think that as an Opposition Member that I would take some pleasure in reminding the Government of that, but I do not, because we need a plan that works.  We need a housing plan for all but this is not it.  I take no pleasure in saying that because housing is the single biggest social and, arguably, economic issue facing this country.  It is the number one issue based on the contacts from my constituents to my office, at my clinics or when I speak to those I represent on the streets of Louth and east Meath.  The way we as a State approach the basic fundamental question of housing has changed dramatically in the past 25 years.  When I first became a public representative, which I think was around the same time as the Minister of State, local authorities were more or less building a sufficient number of homes to meet demand.  That is not to say that there not problems.  There certainly were at back in the 1990s.  At that time it meant that we, as elected representatives, worked with housing officers in local authorities to make the case for our constituents who were eligible for social housing to have them housed in a timely period.  More often than not, those reasonable expectations were met.  The local authority provided them with the support they needed and the State provided the local authorities with the support they needed, by and large.</p>  <p>  We had some agency, as public representatives, to advocate with and on behalf of our constituents, but now, with the dreadfully low level of social and affordable homes available, constituents of mine have been reduced to coming into my office or stopping me on the street and asking, for example, for references for private landlords for properties they will probably never be able to rent.  They feel they have no agency.  They have been on a housing list for up to 12 years.  I feel, as a public representative of 23 years' standing, that I have no agency with the local authority.  We are having meetings with housing officers in local authorities and making cases to them for properties that simply do not exist and they are not going to exist this time next year and they are not going to exist in two years' time either.  This is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>  <p>  All this changed in the early- or mid-2000s with the financialisaton of our housing model.  Despite what the spin attached to Housing for All claims, the reality is that not much will change during this Administration's time in office.  There is an over-reliance on private developers to address the housing crisis and piecemeal tax breaks for landlords and renters that fail to understand the extent and depth and nature of the problem, while all the time maintaining the destructive speculative model that is undermining the fabric of our society and our economy.  We do not have a functioning housing system.  A working system would not see more than 11,000 people homeless, and that is an underestimation of the real figures.  A system that works would not see hundreds of people queuing around corners, waiting to view properties they will never be able to rent and certainly never be able to buy.  Yes, we need an eviction ban, a three-year rent freeze and to adjust HAP limits throughout the State.  Yes, we need to build more private homes in sustainable communities and get our act together to deal finally and fundamentally with dereliction and vacancy to bring homes back into use.  Yes, we need to ensure income limits for public housing are increased to &euro;40,000, and we fundamentally need to tackle hoarding of land that is ripe and ready for housing developments with the kind of penal taxes and disincentives we see applied right across western European economies.  The systemic solution is staring us all in the face: the need to build more social and affordable homes - end of story.  We also need to identify and acknowledge the fact our broken system has an extreme over-reliance on State subsidies for private rental accommodation to provide social housing through current expenditure programmes like HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and social leasing.  What started out as short-term schemes, in some cases specialised support schemes, have now become a deeply embedded feature of our social housing system.</p>  <p>  Our ultimate goal should be to phase out those kinds of systems and ensure systems such as HAP and RAS are only used as short-term measures until a person or family with an identified housing need is permanently housed in public owned buildings or by approved housing bodies.  We need to allocate, as the Labour Party has proposed in its alternative budget this year, an additional &euro;1.43 billion in capital for the delivery of housing in 2023.  In this year's budget we would have invested enough to deliver 20,000 social and affordable homes in 2023.</p>  <p>  According to revised estimates, the target for social housing units through old build programmes in 2022, was 9,000 homes.  These targets are unlikely to be met.  Approved housing bodies were this year to deliver 3,850 homes, with 400 through the capital assistance scheme and the remainder through the capital advanced leasing facility.  At least another 100 were to come through the national regeneration programme.  The balance of approximately 5,050 homes would come from the local authority housing budget of &euro;1.238 billion according to the Government plan.  The proposed build programme under Housing for All in 2023 is to deliver 9,100 social homes in all.  That is nowhere near sufficient given the needs and targets this year, targets that will not be met in any case.</p>  <p>As provided for in our costed alternative budget, we would provide an additional &euro;835 million in funding from excess corporation tax receipts to build an extra 2,900 local authority homes next year on publicly owned land.</p> <p> We propose to more than double the annual delivery of cost-rental and affordable housing.  These two streams would ensure that 4,000 affordable-purchase homes and 4,000 cost-rental homes would be delivered in 2023, partially funded through the scaling down of the help-to-buy scheme and the first-home shared equity scheme.  I remind both the Minister and Minister of State of the reality of the deadweight nature of these schemes, as enunciated by the ESRI and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the inflationary effect on the cost of purchases by first-time buyers.</p> <p> As noted by previous speakers, the answer to our housing crisis is staring us in the face.  It is fundamentally about scaling up social and affordable housing provision.  In reality, Housing for All does not come anywhere close to meeting the demand that exists and that we will face in the future.  There needs to be a refocusing and a genuine national effort regarding social and affordable housing.  It is on this that the Minister will be judged.</p></speech>

There is a sense that one's life is being uprooted.  Often people in these circumstances talk about how the increased anxiety affects their children.  They might tell you about how a child is doing well in school after having overcome several challenges in the preceding few years and that they are deeply worried that a notice to quit and an eviction will uproot that child just as things settle.  I am referring to the families in luckier situations.  Children with significant learning difficulties or challenges owing to their not receiving the mental health or disability supports they need face major anxiety and distress when an eviction notice is issued.</p>  <p>  I thank People Before Profit for tabling the motion.  When we hear the response of the Government to it, it seems to us that it is not listening or responding to the points made by us this morning.  There has been no engagement.  The Government displayed genuine arrogance by not responding and by listing off things it is doing that are part reality but also part fiction.  As said before, the figure of &euro;4 billion for capital expenditure on housing is not correct.  Not only is it not correct but the Government is actually 30% behind in its capital expenditure on housing right now, according to its own figures published in the September Fiscal Monitor.  How is it possible, in the depth of the crisis we have, that it is 30% behind in its capital expenditure?  It is scandalous given the considerable hardship that people are going through.</p>  <p>  You would swear from listening to the Government's response that it is not aware that we have the highest-ever rents in the country.  New rents increased by 9% in the past year.  We have the highest-ever house prices.  They have increased by 12% in the past year.  We have the highest-ever number of people living in emergency accommodation because they have become homeless.  In this regard, there has been an increase of 30% in the past year.  The number of children living in emergency accommodation has increased by 47% in the past 12 months.  There has been no mention of that in the response by the Government, which denies the reality of what is going on and keeps telling us things are getting better.  There has been no mention by the Government of generations stuck at home or the huge number of people who are now living in their parents' homes against their wishes.  The number of people between 25 and 34 who own a home collapsed from 60% to 27% between 2004 and 2019.  I suspect this proportion has decreased further in the past couple of years.  The Government is oblivious to the impact this is having on people in terms of their not being able to get on with their lives or become independent, combined with the anxiety and impacts on mental health and well-being.</p>  <p>  At the same time as this is happening, over &euro;1 billion in public money is going towards the HAP, RAS and long-term leasing, which is pushing up rents and not directly increasing supply.  The profits of those who are exploiting the housing crisis are soaring.  Institutional housing investors' profits nearly doubled last year.  The amount of effective tax they paid collapsed from 17.9% to just 5.9% last year as their profits soared.  The profits of one of the largest house builders in the country, Cairn Homes, jumped by 84% in the first half of this year.  While people are massively impacted by the housing disaster, the profits of those benefiting from it are going through the roof.  The Government is in denial about the scale of the problem.</p>  <p>  I will list a few things the Government could and should do now to address the crisis.  We need to increase the delivery of social and affordable homes.  We need 20,000 affordable cost-rental and social homes to be delivered per year.  Incidentally, this is what the Minister promised during the last election campaign but which he has failed to achieve.  We need to tackle vacancy and dereliction.  Consider the Government's proposals in this regard.  Fine Gael promised a tax on vacant properties as far back as 2017 but never did anything about it.  We finally have a 0.3% tax on vacancy coming in but this is designed to fail.  It will not have the desired effect.  We need a strong, effective and punitive tax to get the more than 100,000 vacant homes back into use.</p>  <p>  We also need measures to penalise developers for slow build-out and for sitting on planning permissions.  There is a huge number of planning permissions in the system now for projects that are not getting built out.  Where there are larger schemes, there is drip-feeding in an effort to control prices.  At the same time, the profits of the larger developers responsible for the slow build-out and the drip-feeding of homes are soaring.  We need this to be addressed.  We need more support to get more small and medium builders back building, allowing them to compete with the larger developers.  We need to strengthen the capacity of the not-for-profit sector and local authorities to build more homes.  Recently at meetings of the housing committee, representatives of some of the local authorities have said that if they had better resources in terms of staff, they would be able to do more to deliver affordable cost-rental and social homes.</p>  <p>  We also need to tackle vested interests that are making huge profits from the housing crisis.  Land costs comprise a significant cost associated with new housing.  Let me give an example from my constituency that the Minister and others will be aware of, namely a very successful housing development built 100 years ago in Marino in my constituency.  The land for the development was bought for less than &pound;5,000; it was bought for &pound;4,974.  I realise that was 100 years ago, which is a long time ago, but when the sum is adjusted for inflation, it equates to about &euro;350,000 today.  The land cost when the Marino development was built out was 1.5% of the overall cost.  Now the land cost is about 16% of the total cost of a development.  One can see that if land costs were tackled by the Government &ndash; they have not been &ndash; it would contribute towards bringing costs down and making homes more affordable.  It would reduce the cost of delivering social and affordable homes and make it more feasible.</p></speech>

I am not going to tell him what is wrong, because I think he knows himself what is wrong.  There is no point in me repeating what everyone else says.  What we must do is look at a few issues and see how we can improve on delivery.</p>  <p>  The very first issue I will address is the planning system.  I give the Minister the example of Galway County Council, which has just completed a county development plan.  The regulator put in recommendations that were accepted and signed off by the Minister.  One of them was not to allow the zoning of land at Woodlawn train station where we can build residential houses.  The reason is that there is no sewerage facility.  If we do not zone the land, we are going nowhere.</p>  <p>  The limiting of the amount of land zoned for R1 is resulting in the price going up.  Why is there such a policy?  If we have more land that people are willing to make available, and it is zoned R1 then we would perhaps get some houses built at a reasonable price because there would be competition in the market for the land.</p>  <p>  I am coming at this from the point of view of what I see on the ground.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is in place to deal with vacant properties.  I have one constituent who made an application to Galway County Council in August yet the property has still not been inspected.  He has had to go ahead and build out what he is doing at the risk of losing the grant.  Why is that the case?  It is because the council does not have the resources to carry out the inspections.  I know the Minister is giving each local authority &euro;60,000 each to put an inspector in place, but that will not solve the problem.  When the Minister issues his directive next week or whenever else for rural areas, we will have a significant volume of applications, as people are willing to take it up, but there is a logjam due to inspections not taking place.  That is what is happening on the ground.  Putting an engineer into the system is not what is needed.  We need a full team in every local authority to deal with bringing vacant properties back into use.  We must be able to deal in a very economical and quick way with the applications that come in.  We have people who are willing to do something for themselves and the Minister has put a scheme in place, so let us resource the scheme properly so that it can function.  Let it not be like the retrofitting scheme, which is an abject failure at this stage because only 59 houses have been retrofitted since the scheme was announced last spring.  We must learn that there is no point in announcing something and saying we are putting money into it unless we put the resources in place to make it happen.  What is happening right now is that the local authorities are being blamed because they are not carrying out the inspections.  To be honest, these are the type of issues that gall me when I see them happening because it is not doing anything for the public sentiment for the Government or politicians.</p>  <p>  The towns and villages that do not have wastewater treatment plants are currently frozen out of the planning process.  In my parish, there is a fine track of land right in the centre of the village of Corrofin that could accommodate retail and up to perhaps 100 residential units, but Galway County Council cannot give planning permission, and neither will An Bord Plean&aacute;la because a previous decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2007 stated that any further development in this village is premature pending the installation of a municipal wastewater treatment plant.  We have a situation where the numbers in the schools in the parish are beginning to reduce because we cannot get people into the villages.  We have six housing estates in the village and they all have private wastewater treatment plants.  They need to be connected to the wastewater treatment system.  There is a river running through the village which is part of the tributary into the Corrib.  In effect, we have an environmental time bomb.  One of these days we will see fish with their bellies up in the water and the river full of sewage.  We must get real about this.  These are not insurmountable issues.  All that is wrong is that Irish Water does not seem to have any interest in the towns and villages that can deliver houses.  People will build the houses and they will not be looking for State intervention to build them.  The houses will be built at a lower cost and young families will buy them and move into them, rather than putting them all into the cities.  We must think rationally about the issue.  I am giving Corrofin as an example, but I could give the Minister 20 more, such as Abbeyknockmoy, Craughwell, Laban and Ardrahan.  It is not possible to build any houses in these towns in my constituency all around Galway.  People have sought planning permission and they have been refused.</p>  <p>  On the other side of the coin, if somebody wants to build in a rural area, he or she is being told that the council has to watch out for linear development.  If there are four houses in a row, planning permission will not be given for a fifth one.  Another issue that comes up is an over-intensification of septic tanks.  These are the type of issues that are driving people mad.  Whether the Minister likes it or not, we now have a situation where the National Roads Authority, NRA, is the agency dictating who builds what, where and when, because it is restricting every road in the country that it can in order that people will not get to build on them.  This is what is happening.  Farmers' sons and daughters cannot build on their own farms.  It is wrong and we must put it right.  We have a crisis at the moment.  We must stop talking about all the money that we are putting into it; the focus must be on what is coming out of it.  Where are the houses being built and how quickly are they being built?  Nobody knows anything about the shared equity scheme in Galway.  It is supposed to be the greatest panacea to solve problems, but we have not seen it.  What I am saying is that announcements are being made about funding, but nothing is happening.  At the end of the day, we are just not doing it right.</p>  <p>  We also have a situation whereby the private sector is not functioning either.  It is dysfunctional.  The cost of building houses is so high that builders cannot get people to buy them, yet the Minister came along and tried to put a further levy on construction materials at a time when it is ridiculous.  It is time to take off the gloves and to get at this at the level it is at.  Currently, in the private sector we have countless private landlords, who are selling up.  In fact, there are 500 houses for sale in Galway and the tenants are local authority tenants on housing assistance payment, HAP, schemes.  The private landlords are selling up.  I declare a vested interest in that I am a private landlord.  People are not interested in renting a property any more because there is too much hassle with it, and they are being demonised for having a rental property.  If someone is on a HAP scheme for instance, if the tenant refuses to pay the rent, then the landlord does not get paid either and the State might have a free run for perhaps two years until the person can be removed from the house.  There are a lot of ills, and we must start to rectify them.</p></speech>

Some 20,535 properties were built in 2020, less than a quarter of what was constructed during the height of the housing boom in 2006.  The national planning framework estimates that structural demands for new housing based on the demographics supplied is between 25,000 and 35,000 per year.  Rebuilding Ireland has failed to meet its annual target every year since it was implemented.  It was 41,000 units below its overall target.  Cumulative annual defects in the new building completions have amplified trends in rents, house prices and homelessness.  Supply-side constraints such as skilled labour shortages, rising costs of construction and excessive lead times are limiting the affordability of new dwellings.  The shift in demand for dwellings has caused both house prices and rents to increase substantially.  This surge in prices has made housing unaffordable for many, leading to a decline in homeownership rates from 78% in 2007 to 68.7% in 2020.  High demand and low supply have been long-term obstacles in the path to providing a stable housing market.  On the supply side, the most notable issues preventing affordable housing are the rising costs of construction, skilled labour shortages, poorly planned and executed Government housing policies and supply chain disruptions.  Ireland's housing problems are rooted in the high cost of construction, which has driven up sales and rental prices and they are compounded by a lack of supply and a growing population.</p> <p>It has become apparent that Rebuilding Ireland has failed in its objectives and that the past few years, under the rebranded Housing for All, have delivered little progress in providing a sufficient level of housing.</p> <p> The eviction ban, for example, will not result in an increase in the provision of housing for people.  It will not help any one person who is on the housing list in, say, County Kerry.  It will not provide a home for them, and it has to be knocked on the head in case people think it is a magic bullet that is going to be great.  People building houses on their own land should be encouraged, should nearly be given a medal, because if a young person wants to build a home on his or her own land, to hell with the crackpots, the objectors and the noodeenaws who do want not people to live on their own land.  Let them go away and whistle their ducks to water but let the person who wants to build a house on his or her own land do it.</p> <p> As for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, it is a discredited organisation that is a shame in its existence.  It has held up building in this country for long enough and it is being shown up now for what it is.</p></speech>

A week or so ago, Councillor Maura Healy-Rae tabled a motion in Kerry County Council asking how many vacant houses, voids, were in the county, and the number was 171.</p>  <p>  I am glad the Minister is in the Chamber because I want to put this to him straight.  The Government is boasting and blathering about the housing programme that it is responsible for.  Perhaps it is doing it somewhere else, but it is not doing it in Kerry or for the people of Kerry.  Perhaps Dublin is being looked after again.  When a house becomes void in Kerry, the housing section is told it has to bring it back to a standard whereby it has to be deep-retrofitted and everything else that goes with it, and it costs &euro;60,000 to &euro;70,000, yet the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in Dublin will give only &euro;11,000 towards the house.</p>  <p>  The Minister can shake his head but I am saying it here and it is on the record of the House.  If the house comes back into use after less than six years, the owner will get no bob at all.  There are 171 such houses in Kerry, and if the Minister says he is doing something about the housing market, I am asking him now to give money and sort this out.  Many of these houses have been void or vacant for years.  I can name a lot of them.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to raise the housing cap because it is not acceptable with the cost of living.  Moreover, the family income supplement, where it is included in their income, should be disregarded and I ask the Minister to do that.  Some single people and families have been on the list in Killarney and Kerry for 13 to 16 years.  Will the Minister announce the repair grant scheme for vacant houses outside of towns and villages and give details of it?</p></speech>

One issue with much construction at the moment that would help businesspeople relates to the planning laws that need to be changed or amended to allow business owners to build accommodation for their staff, which would encourage their staff to stay within the business they are in and which would allow businesspeople to future-proof their business and build apartments or housing for their staff.  The current laws, however, mean that if they build housing for their staff, they have to give a certain amount back to social housing, which is causing a problem for some industries.</p>  <p>  One person is looking to build 20 apartments to house people within his business but he cannot do it under the planning laws because, given the location of the property, adjacent to his business, it would not do for social housing.  The company Eli Lilly is coming to Limerick and spending &euro;500 million on the start-up stage, which will end up with a total of &euro;1.3 billion invested in Limerick.  Its biggest issue, however, relates to housing and getting houses for people to work there, yet in Croom, I have 130 or 140 houses that could be built but that have been held up by Irish Water for the past two years.  Within ten minutes' drive of Limerick, I have 130 houses that, if built, would help the social housing aspect and the industry we want so badly within Limerick.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister look at amending the laws relating to businesses that want to provide housing for their own staff such that they will not have to give back to social housing?  That is the one thing I am asking.  Can they be amended to allow for businesses to build apartments, if they wish, for their staff only, without having to contribute to the social housing sector?</p></speech>

I have a difficulty with one issue, relating to the six months and the taking-over of houses, which I think needs a lot more thrashing out, but on a general level I support the motion.  The five-page response from the Government is nothing short of shocking.  When we look at the background to the motion and to the housing crisis, we have normalised homelessness.  When I go back to my hotel at night, I walk past people in the street and ask myself what I have become.  What have people become who are sitting there on one side of the little divide, having a drink and something to eat, while on the other side there is somebody on the ground in a sleeping bag?  What has happened to me as a human being and what has happened to those people?  That is something I have to fight with myself.  Nevertheless, in regard to Government policy, I have had the privilege, or the torture, or being a representative for a long time.  Over that time, I have watched the results of Government policy intensifying the housing crisis over and over.  We on this side of the House have repeatedly begged and appealed to the Government to call it a crisis and begin to deal with that, and that has not happened.</p><p>And so we are here today with a five-page response from the Government that does not put anything in context.  It does not deal with the gracious motion from People Before Profit-Solidarity that notes the background to it and highlights the positive aspect of the eviction legislation that is planned, even though it came only after sustained pressure.  The homelessness figures are 10,805, including 3,220 children.  As I have reiterated <i>ad nauseam</i>, surely there is something wrong with our policy when that is the level of visible homelessness we know about, not counting the hidden homelessness.  The question is what is wrong.  I go back to my experience as a councillor.  We stopped building public housing well before the war in Ukraine and the illegal invasion by Russia.  We stopped building houses in 2009, and then we copper-fastened that policy by saying the only game in town was the housing assistance payment, HAP, and people were taken off the waiting list.  Much of our energy and time as councillors was spent arguing with officials about whether people were on or off the list.  I was told I was telling lies, and I recall pointing out at the time that I was a lawyer, not a liar, although there is often a shady area between the two and I will be the first to say that.  That was the level of the engagement, rather than deciding that HAP would be the only game in town and that people would be taken off the list.</p><p>That was to be a temporary solution, although that is not what the legislation said.  It said a person was adequately housed if he or she was in a HAP apartment.  Some Opposition Deputies now who are behind that, along with Government Deputies, say it was never meant to be permanent but it absolutely was, and HAP is a fundamental part of the problem.  I ask the Minister please not to stand up and tell me he cannot get rid of HAP overnight &ndash; obviously, he cannot - but he has to acknowledge that the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government went down that road and the Minister is now in a position to make an announcement stating that this is not the correct way and that we need to phase it out and build public housing on public land.</p> <p>The snobbery and duplicity that is inherent in the talk about balancing communities is simply unacceptable.  I go back to the city council when its representatives were here reporting to the committee.  Let me just stay with Galway.  We have land in the docks run by a company on behalf of the people of Galway that is entirely answerable to itself, even though it is technically or theoretically owned by the city council.  Why that public land is not simply being used for public housing is beyond my comprehension.  I am told there is engagement with the Land Development Agency, LDA.  This should be public land for public housing.  We have land at Sandy Road.  It is public land and should be for public housing.  We have lots of other land although the council is now telling us there is no more land, but it has identified those sites.  If the Minister wants to make a difference, he should make an announcement that public land is for public housing.  Then, he should ask the LDA to give him a copy of the audit of all public land in the country.  the agency was supposed to have carried out that audit years ago but we are still waiting for it.<br/><br/>The background of the Simon Community report is worth looking at.  It does a snapshot every quarter of 16 study areas over three days.  This is its 27th snapshot.  It is worth looking at.  These are not my words.  There are no properties available in Galway city or the suburbs under any part of HAP or discretionary HAP.  There are no properties available whatsoever.  There has been a consistent rise in rents, which have gone off the deep end.  The latter is the case and yet we persist with a housing policy that is fundamentally flawed, notwithstanding the good parts the Minister zones in on sometimes.<br/><br/>Let me look at the Mazars report.  I read this into the record last night in the context of the help-to-buy scheme.  I only mention it again today because when the Minister of State was in the Chamber, he referred to this as a good.  On public money, Mazars tells us:</p><blockquote>	The scheme is poorly targeted with respect to incomes, location, house prices and ... socioeconomic factors.  As a result, it ... [is] socially regressive ... [it has] considerable deadweight ... and it is poorly aligned with spatial policy. </blockquote> <p>The report suggests that if we were to start now, it would not be a rational way to do things.  It is utterly condemnatory of the scheme.  More than one third of people already had the deposit; they did not need any help.  What we have done is help people buy houses costing up to &euro;500,000.  That is what the scheme is doing.  Consultants and various professionals, some of whom are in my own family, avail of the schemes, and fair play to them.  The problem is that the Government policy is a dead weight.  Does the Minister know what  Mazars said?  Scrap it, but do not scrap it now.  It is like the prayer to God that goes: &quot;Forgive me for sinning.  I am going to change, but just not now.&quot;<br/><br/>Mazars tells us that this is a terrible scheme but not to change it now.  Why does it say that?  Because it has become embedded in Government policy.  What is Government policy?  Feed the market on every single level across HAP, RAS and long-term leasing.  The Minister is shaking his head but the facts are there for him to see.  If a communication was issued to the markets to the effect that a home is sacred and is the most fundamental essential in a democracy for security, then the Minister would be sending a message.  Prices would have to come down and the Government would be right there in the middle of the market providing public housing.  We have to change the income limits.  All that has to be done.<br/><br/>I live in Galway city.  We cannot even meet the officials there.  Can the Minister imagine that?  Since the advent of Covid, we have to do everything by e-mail.  Covid has been a great excuse.  At one time, you could go with an applicant, reassure them and say, &quot;Do your time and you will eventually get a house&quot;.  That is gone by the board.  Now, people are told to go on the choice-based letting scheme.  Can you imagine telling someone in their 60s or 70s to go online, on a computer they have not got a clue about, and opt for choice-based letting?  They are on the list and have been since 2007.  I checked before I came here.  Surely, the homeless figures and the fact that no properties are available would tell the Minister that something is seriously wrong with the housing policy.</p></speech>

I fully accept the bona fides of what is in the motion and of the Deputy Boyd Barrett's perspective.  I do not agree with everything in the motion, although there are parts with which I do agree.  I will say to Deputy Connolly that there is nothing in the five-page counter motion that is incorrect.  That is factual.  She does not have to agree with it all, and I respect that too.  However, this debate again shows the scale of the challenges we have in housing.</p>  <p>  I will put it in context if I may.  We have had ten or 12 years of significant undersupply of public social homes and no affordable homes to speak of at all.  We have got to turn that around.  We are not going to turn that around in a year or two years.  We have had one year of Housing for All.  I would say respectfully, to speak to what Deputy Connolly said, that this is true housing for all.  We will be putting in &euro;4.5 billion in 2023 and have put in more than &euro;4 billion this year. It is about actually building public housing and social homes.  I believe in social housing.  This year, we have targeted 9,000 new build social homes between local authorities and approved housing bodies.  That is really important.  I had the pleasure of meeting many people in Deputy Connolly's county, in Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s constituency and in the Acting Chairman's county of Wexford who are now getting those safe and secure for homes for life.  There is a good pipeline into next year.</p>  <p>  Of course there are challenges, and we were restricted.  That is a fact.  To be fair, Deputy Boyd Barrett recognised previously that we had two severe construction shutdowns in 2020 and 2021 that limited supply.  Even in those years, however,  if we take last year, on social housing alone, 9,183 social homes and just over 5,000 new builds were delivered.  That is not enough at all.  We will note this in the Deputy's motion as well.  Looking at the quarter 2 delivery figures, which I say to the House and to Deputy Boyd Barrett specifically, we will have very strong delivery on the social housing side in the last two quarters of this year.  Much of it is always back-ended to the last part of the year due to completions.</p>  <p>  I will address some of Deputy Connolly's comments for the record because I want to respond specifically to Galway.  It is about building the platform and putting in the foundations to deliver social homes at a scale we have not seen before, that is, 90,000 between now and 2030.  I respect Deputy Connolly's suggestion, and the policy her party has, about creating a State construction company and letting that company do all this building of public homes.  I would ask this question, however.  How long would it take to get that State construction company established and up and running run and to be effective?  How long would it take to get the people in to do the work, get the land and deliver those additional homes that we need?</p>  <p>  Deputy Connolly mentioned the LDA.  I fully agree with the concept of using idle State land to provide homes for our people.  That is actually what we are doing this year.  For the first time, the LDA has delivered homes.  I was in the homes in Mallow in County Cork this year.  We are breaking ground in Shanganagh Castle, which the Deputy knows very well, which will provide just over 600 affordable and social homes.  The St. Kevin's site in Cork will provide cost-rental, affordable purchase and social housing.  There will  be thousands more.  We have planning applications in through the LDA on State land for affordable and social homes for approximately 2,500 new properties.  Therefore, it is happening.  The overall target for delivery under Housing for All this year is 24,600.  The Deputy will say that is not enough, and it is not enough.  It is, however, about building that capacity of having the people to actually build the houses.</p>  <p>  When we look at the levels and the numbers of people in construction pre pandemic versus what is there now, there are actually 20,000 more.  That is because the plan is giving confidence in the sector that there will be a safe, secure and stable housing market.  We must build that capacity up.  Thankfully, this year, it is projected from the data and research I have done that we will exceed the overall target.  We might not hit all the targets within it but we will exceed the overall target and deliver affordable purchase homes for the first time in a generation.  These homes start from &euro;166,000 in Lusk in my area to Kilcarbery in south Dublin and right the way across.  I have already approved 1,900 local authority-led and deliverable affordable homes through 30 schemes across the country through the affordable housing fund, and we are approving more and more.  That is with real money, with the State putting in that subvention and taking that equity piece to allow the low-income and middle-income earners to actually buy that home.</p>  <p>  Deputy Canney mentioned the first home scheme, which I will address for the purpose of the record of the D&aacute;il.  People said they do not know about in Galway.  We have already had approximately 20 approvals of houses for people in a very short space of time in Galway county.  That is ramping up.  We had 600 approvals for real families and real people to buy real homes at an affordable rate.  These are people who were locked out of the market for years, many of whom were renting and who, if they could get a mortgage, would be paying much less.  I want those targeted supports in there because I believe in home ownership and in public housing.  We have seen a reduction in the numbers of people in social housing but not on social housing waiting lists.  It is not near enough, however.</p> <p>I want to address the issue of HAP that has been raised.  HAP is a support for approximately 60,000 households.  I am certain no one is suggesting that we flick the switch and turn off HAP overnight.  What I have done in the two years I have been Minister is reduce dependence on HAP, transferring people out of HAP and into permanent tenancies.  That involved about 4,000 households.  I am allowing for a lesser increase in HAP tenancies this year and next year because I want more people in permanent social homes.  What we have got to do is deliver them.  This year we will have significantly more new-build social homes than last year and than in decades.  We have to build on that again.  Next year we are targeting 29,000 and it moves on from there.  It is not going to be changed overnight.<br/><br/>On the issue of vacancy, by the end of this year I will have brought more than 7,500 vacant social homes back into use.  Our local authorities have to be quicker at tenanting and re-tenanting them and turning them around.  They do not all have to be deep retrofit, either, as Deputy Danny Healy-Rae suggested.  I want those homes back in safe good use and we are doing it.  That is actually happening.<br/><br/>When I look at the measures in the motion, with the exception of the commentary that led into the motion, there are elements that I would completely agree with.  I want to use my opportunity here today to address in particular the notices to quit with tenants <i>in situ</i>.  For RAS and HAP tenants, I have told every single local authority, in person with their directors of services for housing and their chief executives over a housing summit last Thursday week and again in writing, that for any HAP or RAS tenant who is issued a notice to quit, the local authority should buy the home, end of story, no conditions.  They do not need to come back to me to ask for it.  Since then, and I think the Deputy questioned the Taoiseach on this last week as well, we have about 650 properties, and I hope to get more.  The local authorities have been told very clearly they are to do it.  If anyone comes across instances where that is not happening - there are one or two exceptions such as criminal antisocial behaviour or something like that.  That is fine; we would all agree on that.  I want that done as a measure to help people not fall into homelessness as we are building up our supply.  It also increases the public housing stock that we have.  I have been very clear about it.  I am not putting any further conditions on it.  I want them to do it.  I want to deliver affordable housing, which we are doing.<br/><br/>Cost-rental did not exist in this country 12 months ago.  We legislated for it in the Affordable Housing Act, which the Deputy, as is his right, opposed.  We legislated for a national cost-rental scheme for the first time.  We have already got hundreds of tenancies in place in that scheme and I want hundreds and thousands more of them.  It is extremely popular.  Every single cost-rental scheme that has been advertised has been oversubscribed.  I cannot deliver 10,000 cost rental units overnight.  The Deputy knows that and, in fairness, the general public knows it too.  It is about building the capacity and having a robust plan that is fully funding and is going to be able to drive this development, both public and private.<br/><br/>In the area of vacancy, in the budget and more recently I announced the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe vacancy grants.  We have vacant and derelict homes right across the country.  It is expanded into the rural areas from 1 November.  I have announced that, in answer to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  That is done.  The grants are &euro;30,000 for a vacant home and &euro;50,000 for a derelict home.  Since August, there have been over 400 applications to that scheme by people who want to buy a home and use that money to affray the cost of renovating it.  We are also expanding the buy and renew, which is local authorities buying vacant and derelict homes and doing them up, and bringing them back into public use.  That is happening through repair and lease really well in some counties.  Other counties need to be supported to do more.  In Waterford and Limerick there is some really good work in conversion of old commercial buildings where I have set aside the planning, by the way, for conversion from commercial to residential.  There are many things happening and momentum is building around it.  Is it all done in one year?  Of course it is not.  No one would suggest that it could be.  That is why I certainly take on board and acknowledge the manner in which the Deputy raised the points he has from his policy position.  Many of those things are actually happening.</p></speech>

The policy can be traced back decades.  It is one of commodification of shelter.  That is the heart of this debate about the crisis of homelessness.  Corporate bodies saw that ideology and they saw bricks and mortar as something to invest and speculate in and get very rich on.  They did this not only in Ireland but across the world.  Politically, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il bought into that ideology as well.  Big developers bought into it and they brought it into Fianna F&aacute;il as well.  The amount of donations that were given to Fianna F&aacute;il over the last 25 years runs into millions of euro.  That tells us something about the heart of dysfunction in the housing market.  People have to go without a home and go into emergency accommodation.  Over 10,000 people in this country are in that situation at this moment.  It is absolutely incredible that the situation is getting worse rather that better.  That ideology was one of looking to the free market and not to public or affordable housing.</p>  <p>  To its credit, Fianna F&aacute;il in the 1950s and 1960s had a very good policy on public housing.  Many housing estates in Dublin and across the country were built by the Minister's party.  It believed in public housing and social housing.  It believed in communities.  The ideology of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is one of the free market and commodification of shelter.  This has only been compounded by Fine Gael, which has been in power since 2011.  That is 11 years of power in the context of its policy.  That has only compounded the issue.  Until we change the ideology and ultimately the Government, the housing crisis will get worse and worse.</p>  <p>  I was out canvassing a number of days ago and two young people, teenagers, asked me a very pertinent question.  They asked me why is there homelessness in this country.  I was not struck by the question but by the level of passion in their voices.  Why are there some many people homeless in this country?  I tried to answer that as well as I could.  In that situation young people, and there are many young people here, ask themselves.  They may be in a house at the moment or maybe not.  They will ask themselves why politicians cannot for once sort out the problem of sheltering our citizens.  It is the biggest question and issue of our time.  Politicians on the Minister's side of the House cannot fix it.  That is the question here.  They cannot fix it.  What is wrong?  There is an answer and a solution to every problem.  There should never be people homeless in this country at all.  Once we go with the ideology of the commodification of shelter, unfortunately there are going to be tens of thousands of people in the future in the situation of being homeless.</p></speech>

I am not going to get into the war of statistics that these debates often descend into although I am not saying statistics are unimportant.  The Minister has to start with acknowledging the truth.  When the Government says the number on housing lists has falling it is a misrepresentation of the reality.  According to the Parliamentary Budget Office there are actually 122,000 households, if we take waiting lists where people are on HAP, RAS and leasing arrangements, that are not secure tenancies.  The reduction in the numbers on the housing list is overwhelmingly because the Government failed to raise the income thresholds.  People are taken off the list not because they no longer have a housing need, no longer need social housing support or are no longer in a position where they cannot pay the rents out there or afford the housing prices, but because their income goes slightly over the threshold.  They are off the list, it makes the statistics look better and leaves their situation exactly the same.  In fact, it makes their situation worse.</p> <p> I referred to the woman who, with her teenage son, has been in one bedroom in emergency accommodation for four years and is not even entitled to HAP support, never mind a council house, because she is over the threshold. There has been a deliberate policy of not raising those thresholds.  I read it in the Government report.  In fact, it was Byron Warren, a transition-year student who is in my office this week, who read the review the Government got last November and pointed out that people in Dublin are paying 60% of their income in rent.  Huge numbers of those people are not entitled to any financial support whatsoever, whether HAP or social housing.  Many of them have been cut off the list because the Government refused to raise the income threshold.  At a time when more households than ever need social housing and social housing support, the proportion of people entitled to that support has been slashed from 48% to about 30%.  That is the reality of the situation.</p> <p> The long-term solution is for us to build, on scale, public and affordable housing.  We need at least 20,000 public and affordable houses a year.  Setting that aside, there is stuff the Government could do now.  The reason it does not do it goes back to the point made by Deputy Gino Kenny and others.  We need to get something into our heads regarding the housing misery facing hundreds of thousands of families on housing waiting lists, unable to afford rents and so on, and now the desperate people fleeing from Ukraine.  That misery is benefiting a certain group of people.  In fact, the worse the crisis gets, the more valuable is the rental property of those who own it and the more valuable the lands of those who have planning permission but are sitting on that land.  There are 80,000 such planning permissions and their value is clocking up the worse the housing crisis gets.  That is the elephant in the room when it comes to the housing crisis.  Unless we break our reliance on people who are profiting from the housing crisis, that is, the vulture funds, investors, speculators and property developers, we are not going to solve this crisis.  Indeed, there are worrying indications that private builders are starting to slow down their delivery because they do not see it as profitable for them.</p> <p> Setting aside the bigger ideological debate, we propose some immediate solutions to this problem.  First, it should be a case of use it or lose it.  If you have a vacant property - there are 48,000 such that have been vacant since the last census and 160,000 in total - you should have six months to use it or, if there is no good reason for not doing so, you will lose it.  Of course, there are good reasons in some cases but we must have a proactive policy of saying that if a property is vacant for six months or more, it will be taken over by the State and used to provide social and affordable housing if there is no good reason for not doing so.  We need teams of people in every local authority who will go out and pursue those properties and ensure they are brought into use.</p> <p> We must rebuild the State's construction capacity.  The Taoiseach is correct that we cannot rebuild it overnight, but he can stop the situation whereby property is being actively run down.  The State and local authorities must start to take on apprentices again and begin to rebuild our direct construction capacity in order that we are not dependent on contractors and developers who, in many cases, are doing what was done in the case of the co-operative housing in Loughlinstown, of which the Taoiseach may be aware, whereby 45 properties are now frozen because the contractor pulled out.  We need our own construction capacity to deal with that situation.  In any situation, whether people are on HAP or RAS, leasing or, as in Tathony House in Dublin 8, where some of the people are over the threshold and are not getting RAS, HAP or leasing support, where a landlord is selling just to benefit from the high prices that can be commanded at the moment, the State must step in and buy the property.  That is not happening and all sorts of excuses are being put up for why that is.  St. Helen's Court still has not got over the line.  There are 17 empty properties sitting there for three years when people, including children, are in homeless accommodation and so on.</p> <p> Then we come to income thresholds.</p></speech>

That strain is caused by the Tory Government's orchestrated undermining of the Good Friday Agreement and its persistent attacks on the protocol.  This self-serving agenda has seeped into the stability of Government and power-sharing in the North.  The Tories facilitated the DUP in using the protocol as pretext for its boycott of the political institutions following last May's election.  The appointment of a new British Prime Minister can bring an opportunity for a real step change in how Britain engages with Ireland and with our European partners.  This can be a chance for a fresh start.  The question is whether it will be.</p>  <p>  We need to see relationships based on good faith and a genuine desire for real progress.  For our part, we have contacted Downing Street seeking a meeting with Mr. Sunak as soon as possible.  The new Prime Minister must put a focus and energy into ensuring the implementation of the protocol, the ironing out of outstanding issues and getting the Executive in the North back up and running.  The protocol is widely supported.  It is working.  Of course, if can work better and we want to see that happen sooner rather than later.  Time is of the essence.  The six-month deadline to form an Administration expires on Friday.  Sinn F&eacute;in stands ready to form an Executive for all and ready to work with others to shape a better future.  It is with this objective in mind that the assembly will sit tomorrow.</p>  <p>  Our message to the DUP is clear.  It must end its boycott, join with us and work with us together in an Executive to tackle the cost of living, fix the health service and make people's lives better.  Caithfidh aontachtas a thuiscint nach ionann bloc&aacute;il an fheidhmeannaigh i mB&eacute;al Feirste agus riail dh&iacute;reach &oacute; Londain.  Is &eacute; an t-aon rogha eile n&aacute; socr&uacute; &uacute;dar&aacute;is idir St&aacute;t na h&Eacute;ireann agus st&aacute;t na Breataine.  Political unionism must understand that wrecking the institutions of Government will not usher in direct rule from London.  If the restoration of the Executive in Belfast is blocked indefinitely by the DUP, the only alternative will be an arrangement of joint authority between the Irish State and the British state.  This is in line with the position taken in 2006 by the Irish and British Governments when facing a deadlock situation.  Fractured relationships serve nobody.  We need partnership and a commitment to make politics work in the interests of the people.</p>  <p>  I know the Taoiseach will speak with the new British Prime Minister this evening.  I very much hope the D&aacute;il can maintain a unified stance on the important matters ahead.  I have no doubt he will make clear to Mr. Sunak that the British Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and must play a constructive role in implementing the protocol through a negotiated settlement.  No doubt the Taoiseach will make clear that the North's democratic institutions must be restored as a matter of priority and, in the event they are not, that direct rule from London is off the table.  Have those in the Irish Government engaged with their British counterparst to prepare for joint authority arrangements should the formation of an Executive continue to be blocked?  Can the Taoiseach tell us what stage those preparations are at?</p></speech>

I look forward to having the opportunity to engage with him later today.  What has sustained this House over the last difficult period since Brexit happened has been the unity of purpose in Ireland's fundamental aims and objectives.  We were never supporters of Brexit, but we respect the decision of the British people to leave the European Union.  The issues that have arisen from that decision have clearly not been resolved, namely, the relationship between Britain and the European Union, the British-Irish relationship and, more specifically, the continuation of the trading relationship between Europe and Britain and how that impacts on Northern Ireland.  The protocol was designed to deal with that trading relationship.  From my engagement with industry and businesses in Northern Ireland, particularly in manufacturing and the food industry, they have said the protocol has been very beneficial.  In fact, the food industry has said the legislation that is going through the House of Lords at the moment would be injurious to it, given the dual regulatory framework of that legislation.  It would disrupt the integrity of the food chain from beginning to the end, onto the market, and could have very serious consequences for the food industry.  I said that to the previous Primer Minister, Liz Truss, who, to be fair, did indicate to me a resolve to get these issues decided between Europe and Britain through negotiation.  I hope the new Prime Minister will equally believe in that idea that negotiation is the preferred option in resolving the issues around the protocol.  Europe stands ready.  I have had regular engagement with President von der Leyen and with Vice President &Scaron;efčovič.  I am in no doubt that Europe stands ready to be flexible in all matters pertaining to the protocol, and in the context of the geopolitical difficulties that we are facing across Europe, with the first war on the Continent of Europe since the Second World War, the need for like-minded countries, such as the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Japan and so forth, to be together in dealing with that issue.  That really puts the issue of the protocol, and the necessity to get it resolved, into context.</p> <p> I have made it clear to the DUP that the party should come back into the assembly and facilitate the restoration of the assembly and the Executive.  It is a denial of democracy not to do so.  I have been very consistent, since the election, that the results of the election should be vindicated.  The people have voted and the results should be reflected in the composition of the Executive, the positions of First Minister and deputy First Minister, and the operation of the assembly.  I have held that position for a long time.  In previous periods when the Executive was taken down or stopped meeting for various reasons, I called it out then just as I call it out now.  When people elect their representatives, they expect their parliament to be elected.  On what happens in the event of no restoration, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference kicks in.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for meetings of that group, with close consultation with the Irish Government in matters pertaining to Northern Ireland.  I will come back in on the supplementary.</p></speech>

Just to reiterate, the protocol is widely supported and it is working, as the Taoiseach has attested to and has witnessed from his conversations with various sectors north of the Border.  I, too, hope we get to a position where we have a functioning Executive, a First Minister for all and a functioning assembly.  That is where this needs to land.  However, it is essential everybody understands that the alternative to that is not a return to direct rule from London.  We need to be very upfront and frank with our unionist colleagues in that regard.  Will the Taoiseach elaborate, in the minute he has available, on the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, that partnership relationship, and how he envisages that functioning in the event there is a failure on the part of political unionism to help us re-establish the Executive and to have a functioning assembly?</p></speech>

The Good Friday Agreement provides for meetings of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to promote bilateral co-operation on matters of mutual interest and to consider non-devolved Northern Ireland matters.  It makes provision for the Irish Government to put forward views and proposals, recognising the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland.  That is in recognition of that special interest we have.  In the event there is a sustained period with no functioning of the Northern Ireland Executive or the assembly, there cannot be a return to the direct rule arrangements of the past.  The Government will fully pursue its consultative role under the Good Friday Agreement.  That is the position, and we will exhaust every possibility within that framework if there is a sustained period of absence of the Executive or the assembly.</p></speech>

Gas prices have dropped by more than two thirds since the summer.  Yesterday's benchmark futures dropped to &euro;92 per MWh, down from an astronomical &euro;340 per MWh in August.  A number of factors are feeding into this.  The EU set a target for having its gas stockpiles at 80% by 1 November.  This figure has been exceeded, with storage currently at 92%.  Demand has also reduced, and is down by 7% across the EU so far this year.  Finally, consumption across the EU is around 20% lower than for this time of the year.  It may well be to do with the mild weather, but people are also fearful about turning on the heat.  I understand there are a number of variables feeding into the price reduction.  However, the key point remains that wholesale gas prices have significantly declined from the exorbitant peak we saw earlier this year.</p>  <p>  Energy companies in this country were quick to increase their prices for consumers when gas prices started to rise.  Electricity prices have gone up by more than 90% over the past 12 months, and energy prices are up by 80%.  This means workers and their families are paying up to an additional &euro;2,000, on average, this year on their energy bills.  It is also important to note the annual price increase did not come in one fell swoop.  Companies have been steadily increasing their prices every three to six months in response to what they say are increases in wholesale energy costs.  This month alone, Electric Ireland, Bord G&aacute;is Energy, SSE Airtricity and Flogas, to name a few, have all hiked their prices by 50%.  While prices have soared, the number of discounts available for customers has been slashed.  The discounts customers get for switching providers are now minuscule.  Switching was the mechanism for ensuring competition between suppliers.  Potential savings for switching have been cut from between 25% and 40% to barely 10% right across the board.  The result is that the energy market here is increasingly resembling a cartel, with almost no real choice for customers.  To put this in context, those who switch their accounts are now missing out on savings of up to &euro;1,000 a year.  That is coming on top of increases in bills of up to &euro;2,000 a year.  Many families facing into the winter will be choosing between feeding their families and heating their homes.  Any reduction cannot come soon enough.</p>  <p>  How quickly can we expect to see reductions in energy prices passed onto consumers?  What power does the Government have to ensure energy companies are passing on reduced costs and are not gouging their customers?  In the interim, has the Government acted to give the energy regulator the power to regulate the exorbitant standing charges?</p></speech>

It does not normally happen in exchanges between the Opposition and the Government sides.  However, I do take the point made by the Deputy.  Today's price is the lowest since June, and it is down more than 70% from the record level of 640 pence hit in August.  That is the gas spot price in the UK market.  It is around 190 pence a therm today.</p> <p>That is the lowest since June and considerably lower than the price of 640 pence a therm in August.  That may be the result of temperatures but we also need to reflect on the fact that the European Union working together has an impact.  When the storage policy was first announced more than a year ago, people did not think it was credible that the European Union member states could get to the levels of storage they have.  That has created an impact on the markets.  The work the European Union has been doing to move towards a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to price caps and so on is also having an impact on the market, as is reduced consumption, which is clearly the result of people being fearful of the prices involved.  However, it also points to the inadvisability of moving to a blanket cap of the kind the UK Government originally proposed, and which was also proposed in Ireland.  That would incentivise consumption.  It is a complex matter and the discussions at the EU Energy Council at the moment are complex.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution.  All the markets are different with member states having different energy mixes.  For example, we import 75% of our gas from the United Kingdom and get 25% from the Corrib gas field.  Even to a certain extent, we are more dependent on what happens in the London market than on other markets within Europe.  Security of supply is a key issue for us.  We have prioritised security of supply for the country.  Given that many companies and most utility companies base their prices on future and forward contracts, the recent drop in spot prices may not immediately translate into lower electricity and gas bills for customers.  This country spent &euro;8.3 billion on the importation of energy products in the first eight months of this year compared with &euro;3.4 billion last year.  It is an extraordinary gap.</p> <p> Therefore, hopefully it will, but there are other issues also.  Future markets are pointing to higher prices in the coming months.  There is still a certain degree of uncertainty because of political uncertainty, the war in Ukraine and the need to start preparing for winter 2023-24 in terms of further storage and necessities across Europe.  It is by no means certain but it is good news so far in terms of what is happening.</p> <p> Europe is focusing on stabilising the spikes in prices we witnessed over the past eight months.  If we could stabilise the market, it would give us greater certainty to plan.</p></speech>

That was the key point in the questions I asked the Taoiseach.  The market looks more like a cartel arrangement.  There is now only a minuscule benefit to switching provider.  Will the Taoiseach address the issue of standing charges?  Has the regulator the power to deal with that?</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach might also address the following point.  It was reported in an EU publication that 15 member states, including France, Italy, Poland and Spain, supported a price cap while other countries, including Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands, opposed it.  There is no unity on a Europe-wide price cap.  Why is Ireland taking that approach?  I ask the Taoiseach to address, in particular, the issues as to how any price decrease can be passed on to consumers.  What mechanisms are available to do that?</p></speech>

This is the worst energy crisis we have had.  It surpasses even that of the 1970s.  By definition, it is feeding into the price in the market and that is why the Government has taken unprecedented moves in the recent budget to provide substantial payments across the social protection system between now and the end of the year.  The energy credit and a whole range of other reduction of costs initiatives have been undertaken to try to enable people to get through the winter.  I hope this trend will continue beyond the winter.  That would be great news all round.</p>  <p>  At European Union level, different member states have different energy mixes.  Gas has been the determining factor in electricity prices.  Some countries have up to a 70% dependence on gas for electricity while other countries' dependence is as low as 20%.  The Iberian Peninsula has a different energy mix than most of Europe, with a very strong performance on renewables.  It has carved out a particular model and the European Commission is examining that to see could it have a wider application.</p>  <p>  In short, we are all coming at it from a different perspective.  The Irish perspective puts security of supply first.  Our relationship with the UK is key.  We do not want any unilateral decisions to impact security of supply from the UK to Ireland.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach had been recently elected and was supporting a Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, led by former Deputy Charles Haughey.  The D&aacute;il was debating the Building Control Act, which introduced a regime of self-certification, allowing builders effectively to sign off on projects themselves.  Former Deputy Eamon Gilmore, then of the Workers' Party, said:</p> <blockquote> 	The principle being enshrined in this section is very dangerous.  It will expose people who are buying homes to buying products which are sub-standard against which they will have no comeback. </blockquote>  <p>What was the response of the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, former Deputy P&aacute;draig Flynn?  He said:  &quot;If Deputy Gilmore buys a building without having put in place some checks and without having carried out checks, then he is the one who is being negligent in protecting his own investment.&quot;  That is incredible.  The Minister was blaming the residents and not the builders.  Fianna F&aacute;il opened the door for the kind of defective building we have seen.</p><p>Here we are, 33 years on and the fruits of that policy are becoming crystal clear.  According to the report commissioned by the Government and released in July, up to 100,000 apartments and houses around the State are likely affected by defects, mostly fire defects.  That includes Hunterswood, Park West Crescent, Carrickmines Green, a recent development in Inchicore and many others, the owners of which do not yet want their developments named yet.  That is only the tip of the iceberg.  Most people who are affected do not yet know it yet.  There are probably significant defects in any apartment or duplex built between 1991 and 2013.  Those homeowners will have a very unwelcome surprise coming in the form of a bill of an average of &euro;25,000.  For many, it will be much more than that.  It is money that people simply do not have.  Contrary to what the then Minister, P&aacute;draig Flynn, was suggesting, that is not their fault.  They did everything right when they bought their property.  It is why residents have come together to launch a campaign called Not Our Fault.  They are calling a major public conference open to all affected in a few weeks' time.</p><p>The Government has had the expert group report from which these figures come since July.  A month ago, the Government set up another group, an interdepartmental and agency group, to look into the issue.  The people who are living with the fruits of Fianna F&aacute;il policy know what the answer is.  It is extremely simple.  A 100% redress scheme is the only just solution.  It is also the only workable solution.  The scheme should be retrospective and the State should then pursue the builders responsible.</p><p>Last week, residents in Park West Crescent voted not to pay the &euro;68,500 they were being asked to in order to address fire defects.  Residents in Hunterswood did the same a few months ago.  Nobody is going to hand over enormous amounts of money now when the Government has not indicated that the scheme will be retrospective.  I ask the Government to stop kicking the can down the road.  Will the Taoiseach agree to a 100% redress scheme that is retrospective?</p></speech>

He has commissioned the largest and most significant survey of apartment defects in this country.  He has the results of that report.  He has indicated repeatedly to the House that he will be bringing forward a scheme by the end of this year in respect of apartment defects.  He has already introduced a most comprehensive scheme in respect of mica.  A previous Government brought in a scheme in respect of pyrite.  In the first instance, those in construction, including builders and in the case of mica, quarries that supplied defective blocks, are responsible.  The Government has taken the view that the residents facing such a situation should be looked after.  It is not the residents' fault.  That has been the clear position of the Government.  Responsibility is on the builders, insurers and all the rest, and there should be mechanisms, including bonds, to protect people from defects.</p> <p>Because of the need for people to live in their primary residence and to have a roof over their head, the Government is going to come forward a with very comprehensive scheme to deal with this, just as we have in respect of mica and other areas as well.  Many of these have occurred in more recent times in respect of the apartment defects, but this does not lessen the need to do something about it.  I know the Minister met with the Construction Defects Alliance last week and also met with the apartment owner group and network.  He is very proactive on this issue and the scheme will be brought forward and published before the end of the year.  Deputies will have an opportunity to have an input into that in respect of its precise nature.  I have no doubt Deputies will bring forward amendments and make suggestions to the Minister.</p> <p> We took on many additional recommendations in respect of the mica scheme when we met with representatives of residents, and that is in comparison with the previous scheme that was introduced some years back.  The Minister will publish the scheme before the end of the year and we will engage with Members of the House in respect of it.</p></speech>

The Government has the report from July.  It is very simple and it sets out the problems and the potential solutions.  At the very least, the residents are looking for a commitment from the Taoiseach today that any scheme that will be introduced will be retrospective.  Will the Taoiseach answer that question and give a commitment that, regardless of the details of the scheme that is introduced, it will be retrospective?  If the Taoiseach does not do that, nothing is going to happen on this issue.  Nobody is going to vote to pay &euro;25,000, &euro;30,000, &euro;50,000 or &euro;70,000 to fix defects that are not their fault and when they do not have this money.  Give a commitment that the scheme that will be introduced will be retrospective.</p>  <p>  Second, give a commitment that this will be a scheme for 100% redress because that is not the scheme that was introduced for the people affected by mica.  These people are the victims of cowboy builders.  Fianna F&aacute;il, with its regime of self-certification, opened the door for cowboy builders to jump through.  Give a guarantee that the State will be funding these costs so that these works actually can be done, because they will not be done if the Government leaves any portion of them up to ordinary people, because they cannot afford it, and then to go on to pursue the builders responsible.</p></speech>

No one is kicking any can down the road.  This is a very significant issue.  We have already allocated up to &euro;2.8 billion for the mica scheme and a further &euro;1 billion for pyrite.  These issues have to be taken seriously.  They involve a great deal of expenditure on behalf of the taxpayer.  We take our responsibilities seriously and go through it in a proper and serious-minded way.</p></speech>

The housing crisis is felt in every part of the country.  Not a day goes by where people call to my constituency office looking for a home or somewhere to stay.  There is a severe housing shortage, spiralling rental costs, and in Louth alone, rents have gone up by 8%.  This is hitting everybody and all walks of life.</p>  <p>  I invite the Taoiseach today, together with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, seated beside him, to come to my home town of Dundalk to visit three areas.  At present there are about 30 unoccupied council houses in Dundalk.  I appreciate the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is paying &euro;11,000 to local authorities to get these houses back on the market.  It is taking approximately between six and seven months, if not longer, to get this done.  These are called void reports.  There are 30 families in Dundalk alone, not Drogheda or Ardee, who could walk into these homes tomorrow morning.</p>  <p>  The second issue is that I want the Taoiseach to come to visit a site on the outskirts of Dundalk.  This developer has planning permission for 500 houses and is willing to put in 150 to 200 modular homes.  These modular homes are fully serviced, are close to schools and shops, and the developer, as I have said, is willing to go ahead with these.  These are family homes for people who are in a very bad situation at the moment and who could be on the waiting list of Louth County Council for as long as ten years.  I have asked all my constituents if they would be willing to go into modular homes and they would be delighted to have a roof over their heads.  As homelessness is at record heights at the moment, this would be a win-win situation for all.</p>  <p>  I would then like to take the Taoiseach and the Minister to a factory about ten miles from Dundalk which manufactures modular homes.  These are three- and four-bedroom, top-class and fully fitted modular homes.  They take between four and five weeks to put them together.  The company is willing to put a team together to facilitate these 150 to 200 homes.  I have seen these houses myself.  They are high-spec family homes and, again, I believe it is a win-win for everybody.</p>  <p>  With home ownership declining, and no further homes to buy, it is very important we do this.  The present cost to rent a property in Dundalk and the Louth area is &euro;1,420, and that is the cheapest.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to give assurances on the issues I have raised and that he and the Minister will come to Dundalk.  This is just one area and, as I have said, there are many other areas such as Drogheda and Ardee.  The Taoiseach is always asking for solutions.  To me this is a win-win for all.  People at the moment are only talking about modular homes for Ukrainians.  I have no problem with that but I have people coming to my constituency office asking me, where there is a house for rent, to please contact them or the auctioneer.  I could have possibly 20 to 30 such people calling in a day.  This is a win-win for all.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, come to Dundalk to have a look?</p></speech>

From what the Deputy has outlined, I have suggested to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, that he should go up to County Louth for the weekend, where the Deputy could take him around to a few more sites.  The Deputy's points are well made.</p>  <p>  Housing is the biggest issue facing us as a society and we have to facilitate all construction types.  We have to reduce and stop objecting left, right and centre to various projects that are coming forward because the scale of the housing need is such that we have to get progress on planning permissions and on housing projects that are well designed.  There have been too many objections over recent years - there is no point in saying otherwise - and these are objections which do not match the crisis.  Everybody needs a mindset change in respect of the enormousness of the challenge facing us in housing, the war on Ukraine, on migration generally, and on those accessing emergency accommodation.  The scale of this is quite enormous.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's point on voids is well made.  Approximately 7,000 voids have been brought back into use in the two years since the Government came into office.  The Minister has given particular attention to ensuring houses are not left idle for any unreasonable length of time and that local authorities get in there - we have provided the funding - and get those houses back into use.  Given the current crisis, it is not good enough that any house would be left void for any period of time.</p>  <p>  Modular or rapid-build housing, which is the term I prefer, because these are good, high quality houses with a significant cost per unit, will have to form part of the wider housing building programme we have into the future.  The companies the Deputy is talking about require certainty over a reasonable period of time in terms of the volumes that need to be constructed.  In addition to our conventionally built houses, we need more rapid-build and more timber-framed homes also.  We as a country are unusually low in percentage terms in timber-framed homes compared with other countries like Scotland.  We are therefore developing plans to get additional rapid-build homes over and above the 700 we have already identified in respect of the Ukrainian situation and so that these type homes would be used more broadly.  Again, the capacity exists in the country to do what the Deputy is proposing in respect of rapid-build homes.  Other countries are also doing that and it is something we can do.</p> <p>If we get the first projects off the ground, people will develop more confidence in this form of housing.  That is why I am anxious, if I can, to get up to see the company and the areas Deputy Fitzpatrick has identified.  If I cannot, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will certainly do so.  If there is a person who can provide 500 houses on a particular site, we should facilitate him or her and enable that project to be accelerated as quickly as possible because there is great need out there.</p></speech>

This developer is willing to help with the current housing crisis.  These houses are family homes with a front and back garden.  The people who come to me do not want to rear their children in apartments.  They want them to have a normal life in a very safe environment.  I will again use the term "shovel-ready".  The electricity, sewage and gas infrastructure is ready.  There are schools, shops and everything else in the vicinity.  The Government is talking about putting billions aside.  This is just one area.  Will the Taoiseach and the Minister please give a commitment to come and look at this project?</p>  <p>  The second thing I mentioned was unoccupied council houses.  There are 30 such houses in Dundalk.  Louth County Council should be run as a business.  If I had a business, I would have a thing called a float, which covers normal day-to-day running costs.  I ask the Taoiseach to give Louth County Council a float of &euro;100,000 so that, as unoccupied council houses come up, they can be dealt with straight away rather than waiting five, six, seven or eight months.  These houses are being handed back to the council in perfect condition.  If they are left lying idle for that length of time, they will get damp and everything else.  Let us allow local authorities to operate as businesses do.</p></speech>

This is the highest ever level of hospital overcrowding for the month of October.  Some 15 hospitals across the State did not have a single bed available.  My colleague, Deputy Cullinane, has information showing that the average wait in an emergency department this year is nearly 13 hours.  It is nearly 15 hours for those aged over 75.  As the Taoiseach will know, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has repeatedly warned of a catastrophic winter for our hospitals, so this crisis was entirely foreseeable.  The big question is, where is the plan and the action needed from the Minister for Health?  Where is the plan for emergency departments he promised last April?  Where is the multi-annual plan for tackling hospital waiting lists the Minister promised more than 18 months ago?  Why are these plans lying on the Minister's desk while our people are lying on trolleys?</p></speech>

There has been a very substantial increase in core funding for the health service.  The Minister has published an initiative to deal with this winter.  There are concerns about a combination of a flu outbreak and a return of the Covid virus, which could cause very significant difficulties with regard to admissions to hospital.  That is why there has been a stronger focus on primary care and community care.  The enhanced community care programme is a very significant development and initiative, which will prevent people from having to go into the hospitals in the first instance.  Key to this is patient flow, that is, keeping patients moving efficiently through hospitals and making sure there are facilities for discharge to the optimal location for them to recover when they have finished the acute phase of their treatment.</p></speech>

Back in July, we in Labour put forward a motion on the need for better co-ordination and improved services for children with autism that got cross-party support and yet, over recent days, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and I have been hearing from school principals who are deeply concerned at a new instruction from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that they are to carry out assessments of need on their own pupils in the place of educational psychologists.  This is a matter of real concern.  There is a need for clarity on this.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I learned today that the Milne twins from north Dublin, whose plight I raised with the Taoiseach in May, have still not received an appropriate school place.  Kyle and Ryan Milne are twin boys.  The Taoiseach gave an apology with regard to their case in May and their plight was addressed on two different "Prime Time" programmes on RT&Eacute;.  Despite this, their mother, Gillian, has said that, even though we are now coming up to the Hallowe'en mid-term break, her kids are still at home and there is no school place ready for them.  They will be 12 next March.  It is simply not good enough.</p></speech>

Approximately &euro;2.6 billion is now spent on special education.  We have established additional posts including posts for new special needs assistants and teachers.  Approximately 392 new special classes have been sanctioned by the NCSE for the 2022-23 period.  Those are the figures.  I will seek clarity on the issue the Deputy raised with regard to the NCSE and I will talk to the Minister about it.  Everything is designed to get people <i>in situ</i>as quickly as possible.  We do not want children without school places and we want children to have access to services as quickly as possible.  I can only surmise that the NCSE is asking whether we can get children into special classes and special units to get services provided but I will seek clarity in that regard.</p><p>In terms of the Milne twins-----</p></speech>

Both communities have been waiting years for these vital projects.  Innishannon is basically divided in two because of the amount of traffic and the tailbacks in the morning and evening are only getting worse.  In Bandon, heavy goods vehicles and other large vehicles are being forced through the centre of the historic walled town because of the inadequacy of the relief road.  The Minister for Transport has basically said that the Innishannon project has been shelved.  Will the Taoiseach assure the community that this is not the case?  The planned schedule for the Bandon relief road means that the project is still years away.  Will the Taoiseach help to accelerate it?</p></speech>

Brody Martin is eight years old and has multiple complex needs that mean he cannot be left by himself.  He has to be minded at all times.  He needs to have spinal surgery every six months.  He was due to be in Crumlin hospital this Tuesday but his operation was cancelled on Friday.  His mother was told this was because the hospital could not offer any supports, that is, when she went to drop Brody's brother to cr&egrave;che, there would be nobody available to watch him.  His consultant has said that, if he does not get his surgery before winter, he is in danger of getting pneumonia.  His mother has said to me that he is not an animal, he is a child.  It is incredible that we do not have the resources to ensure that children with complex needs can get the operations they need.</p></speech>

It is my view that the service should make every effort.  If a date is given for surgery, the child in question should have that surgery and every effort should be made to provide wraparound services.  I do not know why that is not the case here.  It should be.</p></speech>

I seek the Taoiseach's direct intervention in the humanitarian crisis facing eight families in Ballagh and Lisfelim in the area of south Roscommon.  Along with six of my colleagues from across the country, I have tabled a motion seeking the establishment of a cross-departmental and cross-agency task force to address emergency climate adaptation measures to protect homes nationwide.</p> <p>I ask the Taoiseach, as the Head of Government, to establish a national task force to take on this role.  It should set as the first item on its agenda the authorisation of the flood alleviation works at Lough Funshinagh in County Roscommon and use that as a case study.</p></speech>

We have to move in a more proactive way.  I am not saying we are not doing that already; there are moves being made on adaptation in general.  We have to avoid the worst consequences of climate change through the actions we take but increasingly, we have to look at the adaptation side of the issue as well and take more proactive measures to prevent damage to communities, towns, villages, coastal areas and so on.  We can see what is happening with the frequency of storms over the last number of years across Europe.  I recently saw a survey showing &euro;150 billion of damage in Europe alone this last season due to climate change weather events.</p></speech>

That is what the Government is doing with its proposals for late openings up to the morning in cities and big places, opening the pubs earlier in the morning in the country and deregulating the licences.  That is what I understand the Government is trying to do.  That was needed one time with the taxi regulations but we saw what happened after that.  These are family businesses in many cases have that have given excellent service for generations and support their communities in every way.  It looks like the Government is going to give a licence to anybody to have a bar now.  Has the Government nothing else to do, with the crimes statistics and everything else, only come up with these mad proposals in a time of crisis?  Is it just a distraction it is trying to create?  The Taoiseach has six weeks left in office.  Is that going to be his legacy, that he will not deal with any of the serious problems but will bring in all the sideline stuff that nobody wants and nobody is interested in?  It is only going to destroy our young people and our countryside.</p></speech>

No property was compulsorily purchased in 17 counties last year and no levies were levied by 14 county councils.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has introduced a grant scheme to do up derelict houses.  That is very welcome but someone cannot buy a house unless it is for sale.  Does the Taoiseach think there are only 1,415 derelict sites in this State?  If not, what will his Government do to bring about the greater use of the derelict sites levy and the derelict sites framework so these houses will be put on the market and done up and families can move back into them?  That is what we need across both rural and urban Ireland.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point.  I do not think the existing Derelict Sites Act has been effective.  That is why the Government is moving to add measures and instruments to deal with dereliction.  The urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, has been very effective in respect of dereliction in our cities and our major towns but it is going to take time for it to feed through.  The equivalent rural fund will do likewise.  The combination of those with the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund will do far more than any derelict sites Act has done with regard to dereliction in our towns and villages.  The town centre first policy, which has been published, is a further policy instrument to enable us to reduce and try to eliminate dereliction across the country.  Fundamentally, given the enormous housing need, we have to use every mechanism we have to get empty buildings into use.</p></speech>

Would the Government consider a deferral of the rates re-evaluation that is currently under way in Clare, Donegal, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Galway, Kerry and Mayo?  These areas are currently facing their first commercial rates re-evaluation in 160 years, the last one having taken place in 1862.  They have been well supported by the Government during Covid and well supported in the recent budget but this is a cliff edge for many businesses.  I have received emails from many of them.  They are facing rates hikes of 33% and more.  There are looking for the Government to step in and do something.  This could cancel out all the benefits that just accrued to them in the recent budget.  They need a deferral.  It happened during Covid and it can happen again.  There are legislative processes to be followed here but a statutory instrument could defer this.

I would recommend all Members of the House read and give careful consideration to it.  Recommendation 12.2 reads:</p> <blockquote> 	The Commission recommends that working-age payments should be reformed to move towards an income related working-age assistance payment available to all households.  The payment should be designed so as to avoid subsidising low-paid employment. </blockquote>  <p>This chimed with commitment number 43 in the Pathways to Work strategy, which undertakes to &quot;Prepare a paper on options to modify the longer term jobseeker assistance payment by utilising the Revenue real time earnings data to adjust payment levels in line with a person&rsquo;s weekly earnings, to guarantee a basic income floor and ensure that in all cases a person&rsquo;s income increases when they work.&quot; Can the Taoiseach inform the House when it is planned for that options paper to be prepared and published?</p></speech>

Work is under way on progressing this commitment in the Department of Social Protection.  Consideration is being given to the development of a new working age payment.  The Minister for Social Protection will be in a position to provide more detail as this project develops.  It is a very significant project and requires detailed analysis.  Options are being examined to modify or merge existing supports by utilising Revenue's real-time earning data to adjust payment levels in line with a person's weekly earnings to guarantee a basic income floor and to ensure that in all cases, a person's income increases when they work.  Technological advancements support this type of model through the sharing of real-time earnings data between the Department of Social Protection and Revenue.  The Commission on Taxation and Welfare has also recommended that working age payments should be reformed to move towards an income-related working age assistance payment available to all households, and that the payment should be designed so as to avoid subsidising low-paid employment.</p></speech>

The strain of being on call 24-7 in understaffed fire stations has morale on the ground.  The situation is putting at risk the safety of both firefighters and members of the public.  Failure is to address the issues within the retained service has resulted in firefighters having to serve two weeks' notice of their intent to ballot for industrial strike action.  This is not a matter for local authorities.  This is a failure of Government policy in relation to the retained service.

I raised the matter with the Taoiseach a number of weeks ago on what is the Government's position on joining the international research programme.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach may be aware, 23 member states across Europe are members of this organisation, with Ireland being the exception in terms of membership in western Europe.  Will the Government give some consideration to joining CERN, given the multiple benefits?  We welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, back to the House.  Under the Minister of State's leadership at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, an in-depth report was undertaken while we were in opposition with regard to the benefits of such a move.  I ask that the Government would show some consideration to this, given the extraordinary progress that has been made in this programme, and the multiple benefits of Ireland's membership for our academic community in Ireland, for our engineering science and for research.</p></speech>

This vital sector has sought and requires an immediate increase in their capitation.  The Taoiseach will be aware that ECCE was introduced in 2010 at &euro;64.50 per child per week.  That capitation has remained static over the past 12 years.  Spiralling costs are putting the viability of ECCE-reliant services in question.  We cannot really afford to lose these vital services.  The request from the Federation of Early Childhood Providers is that the capitation is increased to &euro;76 per week per child.  Will the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, ensure that this will happen?</p></speech>

On a more general level, budget 2023 announced a record level of investment in the early learning and childcare sector.  This will exceed &euro;1 billion next year.  Core funding is distributed to services based on the number of child places offered, the hours per week, the weeks per year that the places are offered and the age group of children for whom the places are available.  There is also additional investment for graduates in leadership roles.</p>  <p>  To date, with the scheme in operation for just one month, 91% - well over 4,000 providers - have signed up for the core funding.  Some providers have raised concerns about the impact of the change to the funding model on smaller services.  The majority of services will see an increase in their funding.  No service will see a decrease in funding on last year.  We will, therefore, examine and keep it under review, considering there are those who have significant concerns.  We will ensure that those services that are most vulnerable will have at least the same income as previously.  Apparently, this applies to fewer than 100 of the 4,000 providers.  I will follow up on that with the Minister also.</p></speech>

We had assurance from the HSE and from the Government, including from the Taoiseach, that these beds would be reopened in September.  It is now almost November.  Information I received today from the HSE has said that it is not possible to give a specific reopening date for these beds.  This is simply not good enough. There is a crisis right across CAMHS.  Has the Government engaged with the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland on this matter?  Will the Taoiseach give assurances that every child who needs acute mental health inpatient treatment is getting it?  Can the Taoiseach give a guarantee that Linn Dara will be back to full capacity by the end of the year?</p></speech>

The most important thing to look at here is the fact that we have children who need supports but when they get the supports, we must also have in place safe staffing numbers.  Unfortunately, at the time if my memory serves me correct, there were 63 staff funded at the time but we only had 27 in place.  That decision had to be taken from a safe staffing perspective.  I have kept this under review the whole time.  If there are any cases of children who need the supports, we have acquired private capacity.  Yes, I have met the Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland.</p></speech>

It is a hugely important issue in each constituency, as the Taoiseach is aware.  The early childhood care and education programme was introduced in 2010 at &euro;64.50 capitation grant per week per child.  By 2018 it had increased to &euro;69, where it stands today.  If capitation had kept pace with inflation, it should be at &euro;76 per child.  The approach has been to leave capitation where it has been for years and early years service providers are absorbing the rise in inflation.  This means that in many cases early years providers are, effectively, subsidising their businesses at a personal cost.  They have not had an increase in capitation in four years.  It must be borne in mind that this is an increasingly expensive essential public service that has been delivered by private business owners.  There must be fairness in the funding levels.  Will the Government increase the ECCE capitation from &euro;69 per week to &euro;76 per week per child, with immediate effect, before some of these cr&egrave;ches see closures?</p></speech>

The argument is that capitation has not increased in line with inflation.  Data from the FECP show that capitation rates from 2010 of &euro;64.50 per child, adjusted in line with inflation capitation rate would be &euro;76.  With core funding, however, the weekly capitation for a child would be at least &euro;78.75 per week.  That may not apply to ECCE-only services in terms of the core funding model.  Because of the nature of ECCE, which is 15 hours per week over 38 weeks of the year, it is equivalent to 23% of the annual hours of a full day service operating from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.  We will engage with the Minister on the points the Deputy has raised.</p></speech>

In rural Ireland there is a Transport for Ireland Local Link, which goes door to door and which is on demand public transport.  A person can use his or her free travel pass on it.  This is especially important for people with disabilities or with mobility issues.  In Dublin, there is no such service.  We have a door-to-door disability service on 15 and 20-year-old buses where a person cannot use a free travel pass.  It only takes one wheelchair at a time.  People need that service for medical appointments, for jobs, and for social life of any kind.  In February 2022, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said that the service was not adequately funded.  In a letter from December 2021, the Taoiseach also addressed the matter.  The service desperately needs capital funding, hopefully from Transport for Ireland, for ten new buses to provide any service for transport for people with disabilities and mobility issues in south County Dublin.  Will the Taoiseach help me to secure a meeting with Transport for Ireland to try to advance that on behalf of the people of south Dublin?</p></speech>

Our climate action plan assumes that we have been planting 8,000 ha of new forestry, but we are only managing about a quarter of that on an annual basis.  It is getting worse since the Government took office.  We hear lots of rhetoric.  We are working on the basis of a forestry programme that dates back to 2014 and that should have been renewed in 2020.  It was not renewed at that point and is only being updated this year.  The absence of that programme means that between now and March, we are unlikely to see a single tree planted.  Saplings will be destroyed, and there is a real potential for job losses.  Will the Taoiseach intervene to ensure that we have a forestry strategy that works and delivers?</p></speech>

The crisis in our health service goes far beyond staffing, as the Taoiseach well knows.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to target an increase in opening times for unscheduled care, radiology and diagnostic services in the community when we cannot see a stabilisation of the hours already committed to.  What is the Government going do to secure the opening hours at Ennis injury unit in order to prevent further closures?  How exactly does it plan to extend them?

When will the Government realise it is not working and will not work because it excludes a large number of households?  One example is stone-built houses that were constructed in 1965 or earlier.  These homes could really do with deep retrofits but we are told that they do not qualify.  Such homes are usually lived in by elderly people, parents or grandparents, who have stayed in the family home all their lives.

Progress has been glacial, even by the Department of Health's standards.  As a result, the task force in effect remains shut down.  This represents a wider shift away from evidence-based community addiction responses.  Fine Gael decimated task forces in the austerity years and they have never seen their funding returned.  Inadequate co-funding has removed autonomy from task forces. </p>  <p> The Taoiseach knows addiction is complicated, trends move quickly and local responses are needed.  Will the Taoiseach meet with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, to discuss how to support task forces, in particular the north inner-city drug and alcohol task force, and bring back their autonomy?</p></speech>

It is not only a feature of the north-east inner city but also in my own constituency where residents in the south inner city have raised with me many concerns around crime and anti-social behaviour in their areas.  Clearly this is a multifaceted problem requiring a multi-agency approach.  Key to it is the presence of more visible community policing on the streets and I have raised that with local police and urge that that be a major element but there are other ways by which these issues can be addressed.  Recently, my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in and I met with Merchants Quay Ireland and heard its real concern at the delay in the introduction of supervised injecting facilities on its premises which is one way of addressing serious problems around open drug use on city streets which creates its own difficulties for local residents but very seriously it is also a health and safety issue for those injecting on the streets.  A change in the law was secured by Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in in 2015 to deliver supervised injecting facilities in the city centre but the plan has run into difficulty since.  There is a real lack of urgency from this Government in pursuing and making progress on this.  It is something that was agreed some years ago and which could be rolled out even on a mobile basis.  Will the Government commit to the roll-out of other regional self injecting facility centres?  Will it commit to addressing the serious concerns of inner city residents around the lack of visible community policing also?</p></speech>

It is a complex problem but it is mostly emblematic of a failure of Government policy on multiple fronts.  I want to make a very simple point when people give out about activities that are going on on O'Connell Street.  There used to be three supervised public toilets in the O'Connell Street vicinity.  Now there is none.  Particularly for people who are homeless, as a result of another failure of the State, there is nowhere to go to the bathroom.  It is a basic thing.  During Covid we managed to introduce supervised public toilets throughout the city.  As soon as Covid was gone they were taken away.  That is not just true in O'Connell Street but it is true in my area and many other areas.  We showed we could have supervised public toilets and it was good and beneficial, but we removed them immediately.  Many of the public toilets near O'Connell Street are still there.  They are just gated up because we do not put the resources into providing them.  That is a basic elementary thing that we could do as well as the supervised injection centres.</p>  <p>  There are solutions that could make an immediate impact.  Rather than demonising people or somehow giving the idea that O'Connell Street is a no-go area there are basic things that could be done by the local authority and the Government that would make a significant impact as well as improving the lot of people on O'Connell Street.</p></speech>

The north-east inner city initiative has not been going at a glacial pace.  It has been very effective.  I think that is widely acknowledged.  I was recently at the restoration of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station and saw the community room in the station.  There has been tremendous focus in the north-east inner city initiative.  This year, &euro;7.5 million will be allocated to it.  He did make points on the broader issue around task forces more generally.  Yesterday, at the Cabinet meeting on social affairs, I was pursuing an initiative with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, that we would endeavour to reinvigorate local area partnerships and responses to create proper co-ordination but also an approach from the bottom up that would use and leverage from existing agencies, from Tusla to ETBs and the health service, to ensure that we can deal with addiction issues on the ground in many communities across the city and the country.  We are progressing that proposal.  We are making progress on that.  Some significant work has been done in my Department on this initiative.  An assistant secretary is overseeing and co-ordinating across all Departments an initiative and endeavouring to identify the 11 or 12 key areas of the country that need sustained, high-level attention on multiple issues including addiction and community development, education, school completion and many others.  We are pursuing that broader issue.</p>  <p>  The north-east inner city initiative does give us an interesting model of what works.  For example, there was an external chair who was not involved in any particular stakeholder group who chaired that initiative.  That has worked well.  There have been significant initiatives coming out of it in investment and physical infrastructure, community facilities and so on.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue which Deputy Bacik raised, I am willing to engage with her and Deputy &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in on the injection facilities.  My understanding was that there was opposition to planning and issues around planning.</p></speech>

If a planning application goes in and it is refused by the independent planning authorities then I do not think that we can blame the Government for that.  In any event, I would be interested in consultations or engagement as to how we can progress a facility like that and in learning lessons about why it has not happened to date and the obstacles that it faced in planning and the issues around all of that.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of O'Connell Street and anti-social behaviour more generally, the budget has allocated further funding to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to support high visibility policing and tackle crime and anti-social behaviour and an additional &euro;2.5 million for youth justice measures bringing the total investment to &euro;24 million.  The Minister for Justice and the Minister of State with responsibility for law reform met with the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, and the assistant commissioner, Angela Willis, from the Dublin Metropolitan Region to discuss safety and anti-social behaviour in Dublin and other areas following public concern over a number of incidents.  The Minister asked the Commissioner to review the operation of anti-social behaviour legislation and procedures.  She also asked the Commissioner about improving the use of anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs, including the disparity in the use of ASBOs in different areas of the country.</p>  <p>  In line with the programme for Government commitment, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, established an expert forum on anti-social behaviour in 2020.  This forum will examine the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward including new powers for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders.  The forum is examining a broad range of issues with a focus on developing measures which will counter the negative impact on community morale and quality of life.  There are two subgroups considering knife crime and the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes specifically.  Other subgroups may be established.  That is more detail on the medium-term response to some of the issues that were raised.</p>  <p>  On O&rsquo;Connell Street, I repeat what I said last week.  I do think that we need to get on with the physical refurbishment of O&rsquo;Connell Street.  My own experience, having been on city councils in the past, is that streets can be transformed with investment in their streetscape.  For a long time, with O&rsquo;Connell Street and in and around Moore Street and the GPO, there has been exhaustive discussion among parties and political parties at local and national level, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was involved, trying to reconcile the various interests around the heritage site and so on.  Eventually agreement was reached.  There is not full unanimity on it and there are objections and so on.  Until we get that transformed we will still be in trouble in relation to O&rsquo;Connell Street.  We live in a democracy and people are entitled to have perspectives but it is not enough just to say "that's wrong; that's wrong; that's wrong".  We need to fix it.  There are multiple ways to fix it.</p></speech>

This has been long considered in great detail by everybody.  Not me; I am not involved.</p> <p>I do get impatient at our complaining about everything for decades and not reaching a compromise to get something done to transform streetscapes and bring about an improvement.  Improvements have been made in other parts of the country to good effect.  We have transformed towns and cities across the country and this has had a huge impact in tackling dereliction and behaviour that follows it.</p></speech>

This is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.  This work is proceeding on a whole-of-government basis and we are working with the Northern Ireland Executive, UK Government and cross-Border local-authority, education-institution and civil-society partnerships.</p>  <p>  To date, the Government has allocated &euro;140.4 million from the shared island fund to move forward with projects that implement commitments and objectives on the shared island initiative, as set out in the programme for Government and the revised national development plan.  Shared island fund projects are taken forward by the relevant Minister and his or her Department, working through all-island partnerships.  Allocations are included in departmental Votes, as needed, over a multi-annual period, managed by the relevant Department with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The allocations from the shared island fund to date are &euro;5 million for the shared island local authority development funding scheme; &euro;3 million to bring the Narrow Water bridge project to tender; and &euro;47 million for phases 2 and 3 of the Ulster Canal restoration, taken forward by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There is &euro;40 million for the North-South Research Programme and &euro;20 million for all-island research centres, taken forward by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science.  There is &euro;15 million for the shared island electric vehicle charging infrastructure scheme and &euro;3 million for a shared island strand in the community climate action programme, taken forward by the Minister for Transport and for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  There is &euro;7.4 million for shared island arts investment projects, taken forward by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Fostering inclusive and constructive dialogue is also central to our shared island approach.</p>  <p>  More than 2,200 citizens and civic representatives have participated in 12 shared island dialogue events so far.  This year, the events have been held in person and on a regional basis across the island.  The All-Island Women's Forum, convened by the National Women's Council, was a very welcome follow-on from one of the early engagements as part of the dialogue series with women's representatives.  The forum aims to address under-representation of women and further develop women's role in peace-building and civic society.  Its work has been supported through the reconciliation fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I was pleased to launch the forum's first report on 8 September.  This set out its first term of work and made recommendations, for both jurisdictions on the island, on tackling gender-based violence, civic engagement, education, media and women's political participation.  The Government will consider and positively engage with the forum's recommendations, consulting the Executive and the UK Government, as relevant.</p>  <p>  The Government looks forward to continuing to engage with the All-Island Women's Forum as it continues to provide an important, necessary space for civic dialogue led by women, contributing to wider public debates and helping to shape the all-island civic agenda.</p></reply>

One of the outcomes of its work is its highlighting of the urgent need to adopt a joint approach to tackling gender-based violence in all its forms.  While the Departments of Justice in the North and the South share best practice in tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, there remains a shared challenge associated with a lack of disaggregated data both north and south.  Much of this shared island focus is on research and data, so addressing the findings of the report could be a matter that the Taoiseach could advance before stepping down on 15 December.  I ask him to consider that and commit to it.</p>  <p>  The island of Ireland has one of the highest rates of domestic femicide in Europe.  The former Minister for Justice initiated a study three and a half years ago.  We understand that the lead has submitted the final report to the current Minister for Justice but that it has not been published.  The current programme for Government commits to legislation to introduce domestic homicide reviews.  We ask that this be delivered as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I encourage a focus on the shared island initiative in the North and South, with particular reference to the economic benefits accruing and recognising the value of closer co-operation, building on what the Taoiseach has just referred to.  There are considerable benefits associated with the sharing of the island.  We should get away from the silo syndrome indicated in the results of a survey last year which showed that 62% of people in the South are negative about a united Ireland, shared island or any such arrangement on the basis of the cost.  Everything has a cost.  If we are serious about these matters, it is important that we give them our all in terms of support and enthusiasm and recognise the benefits accruing to us all on this shared island.</p></speech>

He told me two pieces of research have been conducted, one by Dr. Catherine Conlon of Trinity College into the experience of women who have accessed abortion services here and a second carried out by Manchester Metropolitan University into the views and experiences of abortion providers.  The Taoiseach mentioned that the Trinity College research was published in July but did not say anything about the Manchester Metropolitan University research being published.  I have searched and cannot find it.  Is it the case that it has not been published yet?  If so, why would that be the case?  When does the Taoiseach intend to publish it?</p>  <p>  I wish to convey my best wishes to the organisers of this weekend's march in Dublin to mark the tenth anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar and of this Saturday's Women Deserve Better march in Belfast, which calls on Sinn F&eacute;in's Minister for Communities to deliver on the promise of providing essential women's services, a promise that has not been met yet.</p></speech>

May Blood was a committed trade unionist who fought for better conditions for the workforce, mainly women, in the linen mills.  She was also a president of the Labour Party of Northern Ireland and played an invaluable grassroots role in the peace process through her work as a founding member of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition.  One of her passions was integrated education.  Her work on integrated education in Northern Ireland provides a pathway to addressing the divisions that remain.  One of the recommendations of the All-Island Women's Forum was the expansion of integrated education and Educate Together models.  It would therefore be a fitting tribute to May Blood to make progress on that now, particularly the recommendation on a joint North&ndash;South education scheme.  Does the Government have any plans to act on this?</p>  <p>  Given that it looks increasingly likely &ndash; ominously so &ndash; that an election will be called later this week for the Assembly, has the Taoiseach spoken yet to the new British Prime Minister and asked him to take any steps necessary to delay that prospect?</p></speech>

The DUP has used a boycott of Stormont to attempt to whip up sectarianism to stop its slide in the polls.  The truth is that more and more people are seeing through its sectarian and Tory policies.  This is the party that backed the disastrous policies of May, Johnson and Truss and failed to do anything about the cost-of-living crisis affecting working-class people in the North across the sectarian divide.  Now, more than ever, we need socialists like Gerry Carroll in Stormont building an alternative to the <i>status quo</i>, supporting workers' struggles and putting forward a politics of class, not creed.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the DUP should stop playing games with people's lives and drop this boycott?  Is it not clear that a simple return to business as usual is not good enough, that the institutionalised sectarianism of Stormont has failed and that we need to be fighting for a socialist Ireland?</p></speech>

I draw his attention to something that was raised in testimony at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight about the Irish film industry by both Equity, which represents artists and performers, and representatives of crew, the people who work behind the camera, if you like.  Both of them were testifying to the fact that, even though we have a lot of State money going into the live action film area, the contracts that performers here get are grossly inferior to those in the UK or in the North in terms of their access to royalties for the future use of their performances and their general pay and conditions.  That is also true for crew.  As I stated to the Taoiseach many times, we must ensure the public investment in this country to develop the film industry is closely tied to decent conditions for performers and crew.</p></speech>

We will pursue that.  We have the capacity to do it working with the various groups North and South and the agencies that are in a position to collect the data and do the research.  I will follow up on that.  The recommendations put forward by the forum include the development of an all-island approach to ending gender-based violence.  We would be interested in doing that and following up on it.  Deputy Gould might be interested to know that next month the Minister for Justice is convening a shared island dialogue on tackling gender-based violence and abuse.  That would be a very useful dialogue and engagement to bring this issue further forward.  I would see merit in research that would look generally at the issue, but also at wider issues such as the under-representation of women on the island more generally.  I have asked the shared island unit in my Department to consider that and to work in consultation with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the relevant Northern Ireland Executive departments.</p>  <p>  On the further recommendations on the civic forums and their establishment, which was provided for under the Good Friday Agreement, the parties did not develop or show great enthusiasm for the civic forums, which was a mistake.  We would support the recommendation from the women&rsquo;s forum.  There is potential for synergy in the development of a media partnership between broadcasters to amplify women&rsquo;s voices, on gender quotas for assembly elections and local elections, and on a wider range of issues that overlap with those of the recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly on Gender Equality and the Oireachtas committee.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan that there is tremendous potential here to concentrate on what we can do together as opposed to that which divides us.  The whole ethos has been without prejudice to the constitutional position of people, that we plough ahead and make progress on a range of issues such as climate, biodiversity restoration, economic development, education and so on.  The Deputy's points are well made.</p>  <p>  Deputy Barry raised a more specific question.  I will check that out in terms of the research by the Manchester Metropolitan University.  I will ask the Minister for Health where that is.  I do not see why it would not be published.  I understand the UK Government has now come forward with the legislation in respect of termination of pregnancy services in Northern Ireland.  There were issues on the ground in terms of getting that through the assembly when it was up and running prior to the last election, just as there was with the Irish language Act, so Westminster is facilitating the passage of both issues, which have been deadlocked for some time.  That remains the position.  There is a timeline for the review of the legislation on the termination of pregnancy in the Republic.  The review is under way, and it is informed by the research the Deputy referenced.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to bring recommendations from the review and to publish it in due course.</p>  <p>  I concur with Deputy Bacik&rsquo;s very strong tribute to May Blood and the contribution she made to reconciliation, integration and the promotion of a progressive perspective on the future of Northern Ireland and politics within the island, and to the Labour Party within Northern Ireland, which lost a lot of support over time.  One of my first engagements in the North was when I was a young student.  I went to the Shankill area to meet Alf Midgley, who was a social worker in the area.  His father was a Labour Party MP, Harry Midgley.  I got a very strong sense of his commitment to the working people of that area.  The Labour Party has an honourable tradition within Northern Ireland.  Because of the polarisation and the sectarianism and the degree to which the electoral system always gravitated towards getting people back into trenches, so to speak, it has never allowed for that type of what we might call normal politics to emerge.  There are issues there that must be considered in the future.  The elections we have had should be vindicated.  We cannot mess around with that.  We should allow the full validity and integrity of those elections to be followed in terms of the restoration of the Executive and the assembly and then, in the fullness of time, in five years&rsquo; time, when there is to be a future election, we would have a different system.  There is time to review that.  It is a necessity.  I think it was Deputy Boyd Barrett or Deputy Paul Murphy who raised the question on the way the electoral system currently works.  It could be argued that it is polarising and does not allow for the multiplicity of views to come through.  Right now, the results of the election must be validated.  By that I mean the Executive should be restored, and the First Minister and the deputy First Minister should be as per the election results.</p>  <p>  On the film industry, that is an issue I will raise with the Minister, Deputy Martin.  It is open to Deputy Boyd Barrett and others to make a submission to the shared island unit in respect of that, although it is more of an industrial relations issue.  Broadly speaking, we want to create parity and we want to learn from the experiences North and South, and if the situation is better in the North, then we in the Republic can learn from that in respect of the film industry.  We are open to improving our situation in the Republic.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Bacik&rsquo;s point on education, I have been passionate about school completion.  It is one of the key weaknesses in certain areas within the North.  We are very anxious to engage with a Northern Ireland Executive, following on from the ESRI research on school completion in the Republic and in the North on whether lessons can be learned.  We would be willing to use the shared island fund to underpin initiatives to help school completion outcomes in the North.</p></speech>

In the past 12 months, child homelessness in Cork and Kerry has risen by an unbelievable 40%.  The blame for this solely lies with the Government&rsquo;s failed housing policies over the past six years where Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have been together.  The Government has completely failed to get a grip on the issue and the reality now is social housing is no longer a safety net.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, has done nothing but push up the price of houses.  The Government has no real plan to tackle the crisis.  Will the Taoiseach give us any detail on emergency accommodation that will be rolled out in Cork, because the crisis is getting much worse and families and individuals are struggling as they enter homelessness?</p></speech>

On behalf of the Labour Party, I sought a briefing for Opposition leaders and spokespersons as we are keen to engage constructively with the Government in assisting what has to be a collective national effort to ensure sufficient accommodation is available for those who come here seeking refuge and that we do not see any more people sleeping on the floor in Dublin Airport.  What I have heard from communities in my constituency and across the country is real concern that we seem not to have the capacity available, yet we know that capacity is there.  Even since yesterday, I have continued to engage with the Government on seeking to put forward proposals for vacant premises that can be used to house those in need of refuge.</p>  <p>  I am very concerned to hear that the plan for modular homes is being so delayed.  In July, I hosted a briefing in Leinster House with members of the Ukraine civil society forum, and at that point, the members sought a more co-ordinated structure, better management and better communication with local authorities and communities to ensure we would have a short, medium and long-term plan for the housing of refugees.  Indeed, that plan had to include modular housing.  We now hear that the Office of Public Works, OPW, will install 700 units of modular housing but that these will not come on stream until January and February.  It is of concern that there appears to be some opposition to the housing of such sites in different communities.  What approach will the Government and the Cabinet committee take now to address this urgent need to ensure accommodation is put in place for refugees, to ensure sufficient homes and units will be available and to ensure we are able to step up?</p>  <p>  This morning, I met the Czech delegation.  The Czech Government and people have so far housed four times as many refugees from Ukraine per head of population as we have.  Members of the delegation expressed great support for Ireland's effort, but we have to be mindful this is a collective effort across Europe.</p></speech>

A public consultation concluded on 12 October and the views of taxi drivers on this are beyond doubt.  They want the extension from ten to 15 years for taxi drivers.  Currently, they have to get rid of their vehicle after ten years.  Virtually no electric vehicles are available and taxi drivers took a massive financial hit earlier during Covid.  Six hundred drivers in January and February are going to have to leave the industry or get finance for a new vehicle they cannot really afford.</p>  <p>  They are asking that the results of that public consultation on the Government decision to give them the five-year extension on the vehicle licensing rule be announced now.  They have been hearing it is not going to be until 18 November.  These 600 drivers need to know now whether the Government is going to extend the ten-year rule, which is a ridiculous rule anyway.  If a car passes the national car test, NCT, it is fit for the road, so why on earth do these people have to jump over an extra hurdle at a time when we need taxi drivers?</p></speech>

It is being reported the Government is to use social media to tell Ukrainians there is no accommodation in Ireland.  So much for the Ireland of a thousand welcomes.  Sometimes people say to me the Government should put its own first, but the problem is precisely that the Government does put its own people first, namely, the corporate landlords, the big developers and those who are sitting on empty properties.  There are enough resources in this country to house all the homeless people here and to welcome those who are fleeing war in Ukraine, Syria or elsewhere, but it requires breaking from reliance on the market and, right now, seeking to use the 50,000 properties that have been vacant for six years or more.</p>  <p>  In respect of refugees who are attempting to flee conscription in Russia, it is estimated that somewhere between 200,000 and 700,000 people have fled the country.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that all those fleeing participation in a war and fleeing conscription should be given refuge?  Why would we send men back to Russia to become soldiers in Putin's army?</p></speech>

Thirty-five households are being evicted, including many families and children.  An entire block of renters is facing mass eviction.  The Tyrrelstown amendment was meant to stop these sorts of mass evictions happening, but there are so many loopholes in it that landlords can exploit that it is not effective.  In this case, the landlord is claiming financial hardship despite the tenants and renters estimating he gets a rental income of &euro;700,000 from the apartment block.  In most European countries, it is completely illegal to evict tenants who are paying their rent.  It is just not possible to do that in most European countries but it is allowed here.  We should not allow landlords who sell to evict their tenants.  What is the Government going to do to prevent these 100 people who face this mass eviction from getting evicted?</p></speech>

We have been in government for two and a half years and, since then, we have made significant efforts on the housing issue.  It is the biggest social issue facing us.  We have a lot more to do but, this year, we have the highest number of housing completions since 2008.  We have the highest number of commencements on record, the highest number of planning permissions since 2007, the highest number of first-time buyers, at 16,000, since 2007 and the highest number of home buyers since 2008.  Also, the highest number of social houses will be provided this year.  Progress is being made and we will reach our target of 25,000 houses this year.</p>  <p>  What held the Government back were the two shutdowns during Covid over the past two years, which depressed construction activity in house building but we had to do it because of Covid and the lockdowns.  We were then hit with the dramatic increase in the costs of building materials, such as steel, timber and so on, because of the supply chain issues that arose out of the economic recovery from Covid and the war in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding those storms, and we need balance in all this, in fairness, not just the usual knockabout stuff the Deputy and his party go on with, ignoring Covid, the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine and just shouting "failure, failure, failure", we have developed solid foundations legislatively through the Land Development Agency, for example, the Affordable Housing Act and various schemes such as the first home scheme to help first-time buyers, in addition to the existing help-to-buy scheme.  Fianna F&aacute;il, a party the Deputy attacked, is committed to building more social houses and, along with our colleagues in government, we are determined to do that.  Our colleagues in the three Government parties will look at any additional measures that can be brought on board to increase housing supply and get more houses into use for people who need them.</p>  <p>  In Cork, some very good work has been done by both Cork City Council and Cork County Council, to be fair.</p></speech>

I am hoping that meeting can be organised whereby an official could brief party leaders either tomorrow or Friday, whichever can be arranged subject to their own hectic schedules.  In the eight months since Russia invaded Ukraine, the State has housed more than 43,000 people.  Many more, coming up to 55,000 in total, have come into Ireland and some have been availing of people they already knew and so on.  Unlike other countries, we did not have a strong resident Ukrainian population prior to the war.  Other countries did and that gave them greater flexibility.</p> <p>That figure was 43,000, however,  In addition, 11,700 people have arrived in Ireland seeking international protection more generally from across the world.  In total, we are potentially looking at approximately 60,000 refugees from Ukraine and the rest of the world who have been housed in Ireland.  The average annual arrivals under international protection in 2019 numbered 3,500.  That figure has risen from 3,500 to 60,000.  Deputy Gould said it was coming for years.  No, the war was not coming for years-----</p></speech>

In terms of the Ukrainian situation, decisions have been taken.  Again, we appreciate the constructive role Deputy Bacik has played in terms of giving any potential properties that we can act upon in terms of the call for pledges but also the reconfiguration of existing buildings and development of modular accommodation or as I prefer to call it, rapid-build high-quality housing.  Again, that ran into objections and issues.  We have to expedite the mechanisms by which we get these projects over the line, which I accept.  We even heard this morning on the radio that people have concerns about it and say they want more consultation and more engagement.  It is an emergency and we need to get these projects up and running as quickly as we possibly can through both the reconfiguration of existing facilities, which the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is leading, and the development of rapid-build units.  We need to do far more of that, more generally, in terms of housing.  It could be particularly helpful in terms of dealing with emergency accommodation and the avoidance of homelessness, for example.  These are high-quality units.  I would argue that they are far superior to some of the existing local authority flats, for example, in some locations.  We need to get on with it.  We are committed to doing that and refurbishing buildings.  The refurbishment programme to date has provided 2,145 beds with another 162 due to come on stream.  Buildings with a further capacity 2,805 beds have been identified at various stages of the refurbishment process.  All that is under way.  There is much more detail but I do not think I need to go into it at this stage.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised a wider issue in terms of the Taxi Alliance.  I cannot be the arbiter of what is safe and what is unsafe.  We have expert agencies that determine what they believe to be safe and unsafe in terms of roadworthiness and so on.  However, I will take the view the Deputy articulated to the Minister to see if that can be re-examined in terms of moving to a ten to 15-year licence, especially given the difficulties procuring electric vehicles.  The Deputy should remember that we are not talking about a normal car here.  We are talking about a car that would have had a significant degree of usage.  I presume it is a safety issue.</p></speech>

We are not relying on the market.  The State is the big actor and player now in housing.  You name it.  This goes across the board with the help-to-buy and first home schemes, which are designed to help first-time buyers.  We have quite a large social housing programme.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="14:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600033#LL00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I am grateful to the Acting Chair and all Deputies for facilitating debate on this urgent legislation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann this week.  I also wish to record my thanks to the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for providing the necessary waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny and to the Chief Whip for enabling the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022 to be debated on Second Stage today.</p>  <p>  I am asking the House to pass the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022 today to enable its early enactment to make emergency provision to defer the termination dates of certain residential tenancies that fall, or would fall, during the period beginning on the day after the date of the enactment of this Bill and ending on 31 March 2023 to mitigate the risk that persons whose tenancies would otherwise be terminated during that period would be unable to obtain alternative accommodation, and to provide for phased arrangements to enable tenancies affected to be terminated over the period from 1 April to 18 June 2023 to assist in managing demands on housing services as a result of such deferred termination.</p>  <p>  The number of people entering homeless emergency accommodation has been increasing since the start of this year.  There have also been increases in notices of termination from private rental accommodation during this period.  My Department and local authorities have taken a number of steps to deal with the situation.  Given the extraordinary situation and ongoing increases in the numbers of people accessing emergency accommodation, however, additional emergency measures are now required.  This Bill provides for deferment of certain tenancy terminations taking effect over the coming winter emergency period due to the ongoing, acute supply constraints in the residential rental sector and the expected increase in homelessness presentations over the coming period.  The Bill seeks to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants during the winter months.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that although a landlord&rsquo;s constitutionally protected property right to terminate a tenancy will be constrained by this Bill, it is necessary to take this step to achieve an urgent social objective of preventing tenants being made homeless or having to source alternative accommodation in an extremely constrained market during the coming winter months.  To ensure the response is proportionate, the measures in this Bill are limited to the winter of 2022-2023, they will impact only in respect of certain tenancies, and they are calibrated to apply as fairly as possible.</p>  <p>  In proposing the termination pause, the Government is balancing the competing priorities of preventing people falling into homelessness and recognising the need to stem fairly the continued exit of small-scale landlords from the private rental sector.  The Government is conscious of the need to ensure small-scale landlords remain in the private rental market.  With this in mind, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, has commissioned a comprehensive review of the sector after significant regulatory changes over recent years and the Department will act on its recommendations as soon as practical.  Our housing system needs a safe, secure framework for both landlords and tenants.</p>  <p>  I am also conscious that, if passed, this Bill provides a window of time for my Department, local authorities, approved housing bodies and NGOs to progress delivery under Housing for All to remove the need for this emergency legislation.  The Government is taking significant steps to address the supply constraints in the housing market and to deliver homes for rent and purchase, including social, affordable and cost rental housing.  However, there are a number of factors, including the increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness, increased demand for accommodation resulting from the Ukrainian crisis and significant inward migration, which are combining to create significant difficulties in the provision of emergency accommodation, particularly over the coming months.  This is placing additional pressure on homelessness services as we enter the winter period when capacity constraints are extremely tight for emergency accommodation and housing providers generally.</p> <p>I assure Deputies that the Government, my departmental officials and I are doing everything within our power to mitigate pressures people will face this winter.  For tenants who are struggling to meet their obligations to pay rent, in particular due to loss of employment, there are supports available to help.  These include the provision of rent supplement and-or the use of additional needs payments from the Department of Social Protection to address individuals' particular needs.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department of Social Protection can make additional needs payments to help meet expenses a person cannot pay from his or her weekly income.  This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from someone's own resources and are deemed necessary.<br/><br/>As well as assisting people with fuel, utility bills and repairs, among several other eligible costs, access to additional needs payments is available to assist persons with rent deposits.  The social protection schemes are demand-led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of each case, to ensure the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Any person who considers that he or she may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact his or her local community welfare service.  Otherwise, people may contact the national community welfare office, which will direct callers to the appropriate office.<br/><br/>The housing assistance payment, HAP, is available as a social housing support from local authorities for people who have a long-term housing need.  Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for HAP.  Where the circumstances of rent supplement or HAP recipients worsen, they should contact the Department of Social Protection or their local authority, respectively, for any additional help.<br/><br/>This Bill gives us breathing space but it is not a solution to the issues we face.  I recognise there are major trade-offs in undertaking such an emergency measure.  We need to use this respite to expand capacity by all means available to address the core underlying issues driving our homelessness levels.  This means providing more emergency beds, tackling vacancy, using modular homes and improving allocations and relettings to make the most of existing stock.  To tackle homelessness in the immediate term, there are more than 500 additional beds due to come on stream in Dublin through a combination of new short-term leasing agreements, the opening of a new facility and the reopening of a facility following temporary closure for essential works.  More than half of these additional beds will be operational in the coming weeks and the remainder in the coming months.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, is entering into a leasing agreement to secure the ongoing exclusive use of a further 415 beds that are already in use.  The Department has recently given approval to three capital projects in Dublin, one of which will open next month.  These will yield an additional 154 emergency beds.  A further seven capital projects are being reviewed and have the potential to add a further significant number of emergency beds in Dublin.<br/><br/>Following on from the voids programme of 2020 and 2021, which delivered more than 6,000 units of social housing stock, a new voids programme was introduced for 2022.  The allocation of tenancies of void properties is subject to the requirement that a household is on the social housing waiting list and the property is allocated in accordance with the allocation scheme in the relevant local authority area.  Homelessness ranks very highly in the order of priorities across all local authority allocation schemes, in recognition that homeless households are particularly vulnerable.  The refurbishment and return to use of as many vacant properties as possible, both public and private, can increase available supply and help to alleviate the homelessness situation.  Local authorities have been encouraged to be as proactive as possible in returning vacant properties to use by availing of the voids programme funding, their own local authority resources and the use of the buy and renew and repair and lease schemes.  I have tasked each local authority to review and improve its allocation and reletting process to ensure each unit is maximised.<br/><br/>The Department is supporting local authorities to acquire homes for social housing for priority purposes, including acquisitions that support a household to exit homelessness and acquisitions with tenants <i>in situ</i>to prevent homelessness.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has given local authorities clear instructions and the sanction needed to undertake ramped-up tenant <i>in situ</i>purchases.  To expand emergency accommodation in the short term, my Department is also working with the Office of Public Works, OPW, to undertake significant modular home construction.  This new delivery mechanism will help swiftly to increase our capacity.<br/><br/>Housing for All continues to deliver homes at scale.  Including acquisition and leasing, we are currently projecting that more than 10,000 new social homes will be delivered this year, with record levels of direct new-build construction.  It has, yet again, been a year of volatility for the construction sector.  The impact of construction products inflation, supply chain issues and rising energy prices have created a difficult delivery environment.  However, prices are stabilising and the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, reports supply chain issues are generally resolved.  Therefore, we are seeing something of a recovery and will see very strong delivery of social housing in quarter 4.<br/><br/>We have modified the repair and leasing scheme to open up more opportunities to bring accommodation on stream, including by the conversion of commercial units to residential use.  Workshops have been held with local authorities to promote increased uptake of the scheme.  We are putting a significant focus on the building pipeline for future years and the development of housing delivery action plans have proven very successful in this regard.  All local authorities have finalised their plans for social and affordable delivery from 2022 to 2026.  These plans will provide an important framework for delivery in the coming years and will be reviewed in light of delivery this year.  My Department is also working with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance on the potential emergency expansion of long-term leasing to deliver an additional 1,000 social housing units.  An independent valuation of expressions of interest received is now under way and should be concluded in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>As committed to under Housing for All, the first affordable cost-rental homes are now beginning to come onto the market, some of which were advertised at rates that are 40% to 50% lower than market rent.  Cost rental is a State-backed form of tenure aimed at middle-income households under which the price of rent is equal to the cost of building, managing and maintaining the home only and over a set period of time, most usually 40 years.  This means prices are not driven by market movements, making them more affordable, and they are not profit-driven.  Many cost-rental homes have been tenanted since the passing of the Affordable Housing Act in July 2021, which has facilitated this form of rental tenure.<br/><br/>I turn to the emergency provisions contained in the Bill.  It is important, at the outset, to note the exceptions to its provisions.  These exceptions are provided in recognition of constitutionally protected property rights and the need to balance the rights of the tenant with those of the landlord.  The deferral of notices of termination from taking effect during the winter will not apply where there is a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations under the tenancy.  The core rights of a landlord to protect his or her property and to secure a rental income will not be limited by the Bill.  Landlords' obligations to their tenants and to third parties, such as neighbours, do not change under the Bill.<br/><br/>I will outline the specific provisions of the Bill, which contains 5 sections.  Sections 1 and 5 contain standard provisions dealing with the interpretation, Short Title and collective citation of the Bill.  The &quot;winter emergency period&quot; is defined to mean the period commencing on the day after the enactment of the Bill and ending on 31 March 2023.<br/><br/>Section 2 provides for the deferral of a notice of termination where it has been served by a landlord on or before the date of the passing of the Act and specifies a termination date that falls during the winter emergency period, or where a dispute in regard to the termination of a tenancy is referred to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, under Part 6 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and a determination order is issued in respect of the dispute that specifies a termination date that falls during the winter emergency period.<br/><br/>In terms of the exceptions, as I have alluded to, the deferral does not apply to a notice of termination where the termination is grounded on the tenant's failure to meet his or her obligations under section 16 of the 2004 Act or where the landlord states in the notice of termination that the reason for the termination is on the ground of a breach of tenant obligations other than to pay rent, on the ground of a breach of a tenant's obligation to pay rent or on the ground that the accommodation no longer suits the tenant's accommodation needs, having regard to the number of bed spaces and the size of the household.<br/><br/>Some concerns have been raised about continuing to allow a landlord to terminate a tenancy during the winter on foot of overcrowding.  A number of Deputies have submitted amendments on this issue and we can debate them fully on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>For now, I wish to be clear that the Oireachtas should not seek to prevent a landlord from fulfilling his or her obligations to tenants and their neighbours.  Overcrowding can be very serious and a landlord needs the legal right to act to prevent it.  It is very rarely used, with less than 2% of all notices of termination referred under it.  In reality, only a small such number of notices of termination already issued will be impacted by this exception during the winter emergency period, but it is important in instances of clear health and safety or fire risks.<br/><br/><b></b>Section 2(3) of the Bill sets out, in a table, how the deferment of relevant tenancy terminations will operate.  As can be seen, the deferment dates operate in a staggered fashion beyond the winter period to ensure that there is no cliff edge at the end of the period, which would put unmanageable pressure on the private rental market and homelessness services.  The timing operates to provide proportionately greater protection to those tenants on the shortest termination periods.  The aim is to provide additional time to those most in need of extra time to secure alternative accommodation.<br/><br/>Section 3 of the Bill provides that, where a tenant is not in breach of his or her obligations, any notice of termination served by a landlord in respect of a tenancy of less than six months duration during the winter emergency period shall not specify a termination date that falls earlier than 18 June 2023.<br/><br/>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the interoperability of the Bill with the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 introduced to deal with the Covid pandemic.  Should a stay on tenancy terminations come into effect under that Act, in the event of people's movements being restricted on public health grounds to within 5 km of their home under section 31A health regulations made by the Minister for Health, the revised termination date that applies to affected tenancies in an area under that Act would apply, if later than the relevant deferred termination date under this Bill.  The Bill also provides that a tenant shall not accrue rights under Part 4, Security of Tenure, of the Act of 2004 by virtue of the operation of the deferred, or later, termination dates required under this Bill.  The Bill is framed in a proportionate and fair manner in its limitation of landlord&rsquo;s constitutionally protected property rights.<br/><br/>As legislators, we have shown throughout the pandemic how we can work together quickly to help tenants.  I think that we can all appreciate and recognise the sentiment behind this Bill, a sentiment that I believe is shared by the vast majority of Deputies.  This Bill will deliver enhanced tenancy protections when they are most needed over the coming winter months.  The Government is very aware of the increasing pressure on homelessness services, the limited supply of rental accommodation and the struggles that people will face over the coming winter months.  These temporary and emergency measures will protect tenants from the prospect of homelessness by deferring any no fault tenancy terminations from taking place this winter.  We will use this breathing space to ramp up emergency supply.<br/><br/>Improving standards, security and affordability for tenants is a key priority for this Government.  We will continue with the implementation of Housing for All and significantly increase the supply of housing across the country.  While this emergency Bill is necessary and will provide assistance to tenants in the short term, I want to underline that the only solution into the medium and longer term to the crisis in the rental sector and in the wider housing sector is sustainably and quickly to increase our supply of new housing for both rent and purchase.  Landlords, big and small, continue to have a key part to play in the provision of a balanced and affordable rental market.  Today, the Government is asking the sector to accept limitations on their rights, as property owners, for the greater good.  I acknowledge that fact and thank them for their contribution to meeting the challenges that we are now facing.  The Government will ensure that we have a rental market that is fit for purpose and this is something that we will return to when we launch the first year review of Housing for All in the coming weeks.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="14:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600035#NN00200"><p>The most recent reports from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage tell us that homelessness in the State is that the highest level ever recorded since the modern reporting method was introduced.  As the Minister of State knows, in August there were over 10,800 adults and more than 3,000 children in Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage-funded emergency accommodation.  The Minister of State also knows that the real level of homelessness, including adults and children in emergency accommodation funded by other Government Departments, is much higher.  The latest figures from the Department of Justice tell us that there are more than 4,500 adults and children with the legal right to remain in this country and refugee status, who are trapped in direct provision, essentially using it as emergency accommodation.  We know that on any given night, Tusla-funded domestic violence refuges hold about 600 women and children fleeing coercive control and domestic and sexual violence.  At any one time, there are between one and 200 adults and some children in religious institution-run emergency accommodation not funded by the State.  On homelessness in terms of rough sleepers, we know that there are at least 100 people on any given night in those areas where they are counted.  That actually means that tonight, the number of adults and children in one form of emergency accommodation or another or sleeping rough on the streets is about 16,200.  That does not include the unaccounted homeless - all those adults and children who are in what is known as own-door transitional accommodation funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the many thousands of people who are sofa surfing.  Whatever way it is counted, we have the worst homelessness crisis in the modern history of this State.  Since Deputy O'Brien has been the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and he is almost approaching his halfway mark, almost all categories of homelessness have increased.  In his almost two and a half years in charge, adult homelessness is up 25%.  The highest level of homelessness among single adults has been recorded, and is up 19%.  The number of families with children in emergency accommodation is up 28%, and the number of children in such accommodation is up 25%.</p><p>The question has to be asked as to why this is happening.  What is it that is going on, since this Government took office, that is leading to this catastrophe?  The central reason why homelessness is spiralling out of control is because of the low, and continually missed, social housing targets of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  First of all, those targets are too low.  I keep making the point that this Government actually has a lower social housing output than was previously included in the original Fine Gael national development plan, but the Department is not even meeting that target.  In 2020 we fell short of social housing targets by 25%, and in 2021, it was 30%.  That is 5,969 social homes that should have been delivered that have been lost to the system.  If we want to know why so many people are currently homeless, that is the key missing part of the answer.  The Minister of State knows that as of the halfway point of this year, only 20% of the targeted 9,000 social homes will be delivered.  We will wait eagerly to see what is the final output.  On top of that, despite the fact that we were calling for the reintroduction of the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme last year, through which local authorities would buy properties with HAP, RAS or rent supplement tenants <i>in situ</i>, that has only been reintroduced recently and the instruction to the local authorities is not strong enough.  I will come back to that point later.  The affordable housing targets themselves are an embarrassment.  They are so low as really to suggest that this Government is not serious about either cost rental or affordable purchase, and even those low targets cannot be met.  Worse still, we still do not have any meaningful action on raising the thresholds for social housing eligibility, so people who cannot actually afford to buy or rent in the market also cannot access social housing supports and are left languishing in homelessness.</p><p>At some point there has to be a lightbulb moment when the Minister of State's Government realises that in fact, the cause of this homeless problem is not what is going on in the private rental sector.  That is a trigger and it is not helping.  It is the Government's failure, policy, inaction and missed targets.  That is why today the Minister of State is bringing forward this emergency Bill, a Bill, in fact, that the Minister of State's party did not want to introduce.  Indeed, several days before it was approved at Cabinet, the Minister of State's party leader, the T&aacute;naiste, was very hostile to its introduction in his public remarks.  It is the Government's housing policy failure that has led us to where we are.  Some 19 of our local authorities have no emergency accommodation on any given night and the rest are almost full to capacity.</p><p>Let me be very clear.  As the Minister of State is aware, we have been calling for this Bill for some time.  We have always wanted a temporary winter ban on evictions to give us some breathing space and we are supporting this legislation.  However, I must say that there significant weaknesses with the Bill and with the content of the Minister of State's speech in terms of how the Government intends to use the breathing space.  I will deal with them in the remainder of my time.</p><p>On the overcrowding provisions of this Bill, a big mistake has been made.  The Minister of State is absolutely right that a very small number of notices to quit are made under those provisions.  However, the majority of the people who receive those notices to quit are large families.  They are Travellers, Roma people or families from certain African countries who, for completely legitimate cultural reasons, have more children.</p> <p>When they become homeless, and the Minister knows the figures, they spend three or four years in emergency accommodation.  In fact, the Minister in 2020 introduced a special provision for local authorities to be able to buy large vacant homes on the private market to try to get those families out of emergency accommodation and yet he is now giving an opportunity to landlords to evict such families.  That will have devastating consequences.  I plead with him not to do this.  There is no need for it and that measure should be removed from the Bill.<br/><br/>The Minister is also creating a loophole because some unscrupulous landlords who are now unable to issue a notice to quit, for example on the grounds of sale or use by a family member, could use this measure because for several years, they have had a family in their unit that is larger than is provided for in the outdated 1966 overcrowding legislation, and they can use this provision as grounds for eviction.  Not only is the Minister jeopardising the well-being of very vulnerable larger families, particularly Travellers, Roma and some African families, but he is also creating a loophole for a small number of unscrupulous landlords to exploit.  Even if the Minister listens to nothing else we say, I urge him to remove that provision between now and tomorrow.<br/><br/>It is disappointing that there is no additional provision for those people whose due date falls before the commencement of the Act.  I know the same level of provision cannot be provided because of the way the legislation is designed, but the Minister could have done something in terms of extra discretion for the Residential Tenancies Board when deciding on those cases where people are forced to overhold because they have no access to emergency accommodation or alternative permanent housing to give them more time.  The issue of the commencement date of the Bill is key.  We need the Minister to be clear about when it will commence so people know when they are getting protection.<br/><br/>Let us also not forget that council tenants get no protection in this legislation because, of course, they are not tenants as registered under the Residential Tenancies Act.  Travellers on either official or unofficial halting sites get no protection.  The Minister will remember that when the most recent ban on evictions was introduced, a circular was issued to the local authorities to urge them to accept the spirit of this legislation in their practices.  I urge him to do the same again.  I am concerned there was no reference to that in the Minister's opening speech.<br/><br/>Of course, as the Minister said, and he is right, a ban on evictions, and especially a temporary ban, is not a solution even though it gives tenants breathing space.  I must say that the Minister's speech made me even more concerned than I already was at the fact that the Government has no comprehensive emergency plan to take advantage of these five months to ensure we are not in the same place come April of next year.  In fact, from what I heard in the Minister's speech, all that is being considered in respect of additional accommodation is 654 emergency beds in Dublin.  While they would be welcome, that is not enough.  I have outlined over and over again what needs to be done.  We need a circular to be sent to the local authorities telling them with regard to the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme to suspend the scheme of letting and ensure that the local authorities buy, subject to price and the structural condition of the property, irrespective of where the social housing applicant is on the scheme of letting.  Without that measure, we will continue to see some councils, such as Kerry County Council, not engaging; councils such as the one in my area only engaging when households have length of time on list; and others responding to the Minister in the spirit in which he has raised it.<br/><br/>We also need upfront funding for local authorities to acquire derelict and vacant properties.  Without that, there will no significant movement in that regard.  We need the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to do what the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has done, that is, sign a contract for 1,000 high-grade, good-quality, fully fire compliant modular homes to be put in place in the next five months.  That is achievable and can be done with the right political will.  We need the Minister to use emergency planning powers to get those units on site.  We need to cut the bureaucracy imposed on local authorities and approved housing bodies.  That is among the principal reasons, along with the pandemic and Brexit, they are behind on their targets.<br/><br/>As the Minister knows, we are supporting the Bill.  I urge him to act in the spirit of the legislation in respect of the issues around overcrowding and the circular to local authorities on council tenants and Travellers.  I call on him to extend those protections and do much more to ensure that come 1 April next year, we are not in exactly the same position because the Government has again missed its social housing targets.</p></speech>

While we support it and recognise there is a need for an emergency ban on evictions, and there are parts of the legislation we welcome, the Minister has missed an opportunity to go further, which he should have taken.</p><p>Child homelessness in Cork has increased by 40% in the past 12 months.  Our homeless figures are now at record levels not only in Cork but nationally.  The hidden homeless have not been covered in this debate.  Those include people who are couch-surfing and rough-sleeping, those in domestic violence centres and families who are in boxrooms in multigenerational households because there is nowhere else for them to go.  According to the Simon Community, there could be up to 290,000 people in those situations, including families and children.</p><p>At one time, when you got a notice to quit, it was a devastating blow.  It meant upheaval, the packing of boxes, stress and trying to find alternative accommodation.  It did not, however, mean homelessness and that is what it means now.  For the vast majority of people, a notice to quit is an eviction into homelessness.</p><p>This legislation is welcome.  It does one thing but it does not go far enough.  It gives people breathing space for the winter, which is security they need.  It gives people room at least to enjoy their Christmas.  On <i>daft.ie</i>today, there are only ten properties available for rent in Cork for less than &euro;1,500.  This is not a functional rental sector.  There are over 200,000 people living in Cork.  How is anyone meant to secure a property when those are the figures involved?  On <i>airbnb.ie</i>, 153 properties are available to rent for a short stay of over a week.  At the end of quarter 2 of this year, there were 9,000 vacant properties in Cork city and county.  The Minister spoke earlier about getting local authorities to do more but he needs to do more and give local authorities the necessary funding.  He needs to get rid of all the red tape and bureaucracy that requires local authorities to go to the Department in Dublin and return again.  He should give them the funding in advance in order that they can deal with these issues.</p><p>We need more properties for rent and more social housing.  People who are faced with a notice to quit do not have the option of finding a property on <i>airbnb.ie</i>and they cannot squat because they will be arrested.  The reality is that this legislation is not enough.  It needs to be a part of a suite of measures.  We need a rent freeze and one month's tax credit given back to people.  We need real protection for renters and a big uptick in the delivery of social housing.</p><p>We have heard from the Taoiseach and the Minister about start-ups and what is being done in Ireland.  The facts are that under this Government's watch, rents are at the highest levels they have ever been.  House prices are at the highest levels they have ever been.  Homelessness is also at the highest level it has ever been.  Fine Gael has been in power for 11 years and Fianna F&aacute;il has been supporting Fine Gael for the past six and a half years.  The buck stops with the Government and no one else.</p><p>I am dealing with 14 people who are overstaying; whose eviction dates have passed.  People were looking forward to this Bill because they thought the Government would protect them.  It does not.  Their eviction dates have now passed and those people will have nowhere to go unless they are going to overstay and be brought to court.  This legislation does not protect those people.  I have read the Bill from cover to cover and those protections are not there.  It is not a long Bill and there is nothing in it for people who are overstaying.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin and I have submitted amendments.  We are bringing forward a set of amendments that we feel are credible.  We will try to strengthen the Bill.  We support this Bill but we ask the Minister to consider our amendments and those of others because we need to ensure this Bill is fit for purpose.</p></speech>

However, it is a pity that the Government has been dragged kicking and screaming to this point.  The notice to quit file in my office has in recent months filled up at an alarming rate.</p> <p>Moreover, from the speeches that have been made on a daily basis in this Chamber, I know it is the same for every other Deputy.</p> <p> Families with young children on notices to quit, many of whom are in receipt of HAP, are presenting to my office on a weekly basis.  They are in absolute fear as they face homelessness due to the lack of social and affordable homes and emergency accommodation in the Dublin 15 area.  In fact, there are zero such homes available.  Can we end this nonsense that people on HAP are deemed to be socially housed?  They are not. They have absolutely no security of tenure and that is the essence of a person being socially housed.</p> <p> Many of these are families are in circumstances where they have lived and reared their families in their home for many years.  Their children are settled in the area with their school and friends.  They play sports, are involved in dancing and have family living all around them.  They have a full support base and their lives are rooted in these areas. They grew up in and lived and worked there and now they face homelessness and, particularly in Dublin 15, they have to move away from their own community because there are zero places to rent and there is no homeless accommodation available.</p> <p> They face the daily grind of having to move out of Dublin 15, in many cases to unsuitable accommodation.  This can be coupled with two bus rides to get their children to school every day, no proper facilities to prepare a home-cooked meal upon their return and no proper bedrooms for the children to play.  When I was working for Tusla, one of the most heartbreaking pieces that I had to deal with on a regular basis was bringing children to a family resource centre for them to have their birthday party or any type of celebration, be it communion or confirmation.  That is the reality of people living in homeless accommodation and it is completely heartbreaking.</p> <p> The Bill needs to be enacted as soon as possible to provide for those who may be facing eviction this winter.  The despair and fear of any family looking at homelessness this close to Christmas must be incredible.  In fact, the fear at any time of the year is appalling.</p> <p>Many people are saying that this is fine and that we have a short break up to the winter but what will happen after that?  The Housing for All strategy on social and affordable housing has failed miserably.  As for the statistics that were read out here today, on every metric the Government has failed to deal with the housing crisis.</p> <p> In the case of people who are not in breach of their obligations and who through no fault of their own have been issued a notice to quit; what are their prospects now?  What is the availability of a social or affordable home or short-term emergency accommodation in their community?  It is not likely, because the Government's housing strategy will not provide either in the short term and certainly not when this eviction Bill ends.</p> <p> Section 2 of this Bill allows for landlords to evict a family for overcrowding.   Again, as has already been said, this is wrong and this provision has to be removed.  When a family has initially rented the property - this happens quite often when people will be staying in the property and are quite happy to stay there - they may have a family of one, two or three children, depending on family size.  If they are on HAP, they will only be given property for one-bed or two-bed accommodation, if that is what their need is.  They may then have another child.  Those people are facing eviction now.  If an unscrupulous landlord wishes to do that, the Government has given them the get-out clause to do so.  This is unfortunate and this must be removed.</p> <p> I also ask the Minister of State to accept the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment on property holders who themselves are in danger of homelessness.  I am currently dealing with one constituent who is a doctor and who has moved back home after a number of years away.  He is currently living in a hotel and is unable to get back into a house.  We need to provide support for the person who is in the house, as well as providing support for the person who is trying to get back into their own home.  That is something that has been missed at the moment.</p> <p> This Bill brings a short-term solution and a small breathing space for families facing homelessness but it is not a long-term solution.  That is what I and people fear in the coming months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600037#PP00200"><p>I may not use the entirety of my allotted time but I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party this afternoon in a debate that is long overdue.  As remarked upon by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, some representatives from Fine Gael were actively resisting this Bill up until recently even though it was clear to all of us that this type of legislation was needed.  The very need for this Bill in the first place is a symptom of the State&rsquo;s basic failing to house its own citizens and to house all of those others for whom the State has responsibility at present.</p>  <p>  This is a symptom of the Government&rsquo;s shocking over-reliance on a private rental sector and the logical conclusion of a policy that is being maintained and is leading to a situation where simply not enough social and affordable homes are being built and provided for those who need them.</p>  <p>  Everyone is suffering from this broken housing model.  These are young people, those going through separation and those on low pay.  The knock-on effect of a broken housing model hits us all as parents and colleagues, and the public services often have to bear the cost of this broken system presided over by the Government.  </p>  <p>  Nowhere is this more true than in the situation that obtains in respect of HAP tenants, as alluded to by other colleagues and, time and again, not just in the context of this debate, but this morning also in the context of the People Before Profit debate on social and affordable housing.  In a market where rents are constantly increasing, it is nearly impossible for HAP recipients to find alternative accommodation in the rental sector.  Yet they are still subject to no-fault evictions for reasons of sale, renovation or the moving in of family by the landlord.  The definition of family here is very broadly defined.</p>  <p>  The Simon Community recently reported that there are no properties currently available for rent within normal HAP rates.  As an experience, that is not unfamiliar to all of us operating in our constituencies representing and advocating for people who are HAP tenants and who may lose their tenancy.  This results in HAP tenants becoming homeless upon receipt of notices to quit being issued by the private landlords.  Things are now so stark that even this Government knows that an eviction ban is necessary to prevent homelessness figures from skyrocketing this winter.</p>  <p>  Let us be clear, our homelessness services and emergency accommodation services simply cannot cope.  What we saw in Dublin Airport last weekend is unforgivable for a wealthy, liberal, open democracy.  We must also be clear that it is not those fleeing war in Ukraine who are causing our housing crisis.  Let us be very clear on that point.  The housing crisis is being caused by a problem being compounded by bad Government policy; a policy it seems incapable of ditching.  </p>  <p>  Last month we saw a record high of homeless people, with some 10,800 individuals seeking emergency accommodation.  Among these are 3,220 children, and older people with complex health needs who never envisaged themselves to be in this situation.  </p>  <p>  We also have workers who work for the emergency services who sleep in their own facilities at work with no idea of where to go.  We have come across these situations of people who are working for the State.  This is completely extraordinary and is the reality behind the numbers.  These are real people living in an uncertain and often miserable situation with consequences both now and in the future.</p>  <p>  As the Labour Party has pointed out, an eviction ban alone will not solve the homelessness crisis.  Instead, it needs to be paired with adequate long-term preventative measures including limiting the grounds that allow landlords to evict tenants as per our Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill, which we debated a number of months ago, by reducing reliance on the volatile market of private landlordism, and by establishing a strong public housing system yet again.  We cannot apply just another short-term sticking plaster until the show moves on.  The media and others may get fixated on the next scandal.  There is always a scandal down the road and cases which are difficult to consider but many of those 10,000-odd people will still be in the same boat next week.  The measures in this Bill will certainly prevent those who are at risk of becoming homeless from doing so but will not make a single unit available on a long-term basis for anybody.</p>  <p>  That is why the Labour Party is deeply concerned that the grounds for eviction are not strong or strict enough in the original Act.  What we have before us today is not a long-term solution and is simply a stay of execution for many tenants who are at risk.</p> <p>We know and they know that, when March rolls around, the wide range of reasons for which tenants can be evicted will again be exercised by landlords.  The Minister of State knows this, as do we all, but we sometimes prefer to cover our ears, close our eyes and simply hope that the problem will go away.  As asset prices continue to rise - and house prices are continuing to rise albeit at a slower rate than over the past three years - the reality is that landlords will try to realise the value of their assets and sell their properties.  That is basic economics.  It is how this works.<br/><br/>We need actions rather than words.  It is vital that we take steps to restrict the grounds for eviction.  As demanded in the Labour Party amendments we will debate later on, we must prevent landlords from evicting tenants for reasons of sale unless the tenant <i>in situ</i>and the local authority have been offered the property first.  My colleague, the Labour Party housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, and the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage have been very clear that, when the RTB is notified of an eviction, the local authority should also be notified to ensure clarity on the situation and the demand in each local authority area.  It is incredible that this connectedness is not in place and that these systems are not networked properly.<br/><br/>Evictions on the grounds of overcrowding fail to recognise the nuance of the housing crisis.  While it is never ideal for people to live in overcrowded accommodation, an overcrowded home is better than no home at all.  Tenants who were forced by the inaction of the State on the housing crisis to reside in overcrowded accommodation should not be evicted and left homeless.<br/><br/>Landlords should only be allowed to evict a tenant to move in family members in circumstances where they are direct family members such as spouses and children.  We have seen shocking abuse of this measure in Ireland with distant third cousins and imaginary nieces being touted as new tenants, thereby providing landlords with a reason to evict long-standing tenants to free up their properties.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the only way to end this vicious cycle is to increase the State supply of social and affordable housing.  Not only is this a moral imperative, as report after report has shown, it is the right thing to do financially and economically.  However, as it stands, there are more than 60,000 households being socially supported within the private sector.  This makes no sense.  Rather than investing today to solve the problems of the future, we throw good money after bad on temporary measures such as HAP, income supports and emergency accommodation.  A lot of temporary measures that were introduced a number of years ago have now been embedded in the system and are proving to be very costly.  Of course, we would like to see HAP, RAS and other measures only used on a temporary basis at a time when there is sufficient housing to meet the needs of people across the country.<br/><br/>Let us take HAP as the obvious example.  As rental markets spiral, HAP rates have to increase to keep up, with those State payments ending up in the hands of landlords.  It is more cost-effective for the State to acquire the housing in which the HAP tenants are <i>in situ</i>rather than to pay out these perpetual subsidies and supports.  This is a pure waste of taxpayers' money in the long term.  It is totally bonkers.  The direction of travel needs to change.  Tenants should be in social housing, which provides increased security of tenure as they are no longer at the mercy of landlords.  Even the targets in Housing for All will again be missed this year.<br/><br/>We need to return to a public housing model and the idea that this country could build necessary accommodation, even at times when we did not have the resources we have now.  That would bring much more stability to our country, improve growth and stabilise our society.  The Minister of State knows as well as anybody how much focus is now on housing, which has become a real issue across our society, and on the question of whether the political system can resolve this problem.  There is a real problem, and a real question is being asked of this Government.  To date, the performance has been incredibly disappointing and less than we would expect.<br/><br/>In addition to an extension of the eviction ban, we urge this Government to reduce red tape in respect of the tenants <i>in situ</i>scheme and to prioritise the acquisition of housing by local authorities.  The Labour Party will be proposing amendments to the Bill, which the Minister of State will have already seen, to ensure that these kinds of mechanisms to end homelessness are joint implemented alongside the overdue eviction ban.  Failure to do so will see homelessness figures rise dramatically once the ban elapses at the end of March and evictions on a staggered basis become the reality again in the middle of next year.  I do not believe the Minister of State or any of us want us to be back in that situation next March, discussing another eviction crisis.  If we can resolve the issue now, let us do so.  However, it will require a refocusing of Housing for All and more resources for social and affordable housing.  That is the trick.  That is how this will be resolved.  Let us not wait until more children, elderly people and vulnerable groups are shamefully put out on the streets of cities and towns across this country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="14:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600038#QQ00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing this important legislation to the House in such a speedy and timely manner.  It is a sensible move that seeks to protect renters from eviction.  I acknowledge the work of Department officials in drafting this Bill and the work of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in ensuring that its provisions are constitutional, legally defensible and strike a balance between property rights and protection of renters at this difficult time for so many.</p><p>The Minister arranged a briefing for the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and we were given the time to discuss and ask questions on the draft Bill.  It was agreed unanimously by the committee to waive pre-legislative scrutiny in order not to delay and to ensure that we can pass this law as soon as possible to protect renters.</p><p>I reiterate the recommendation from the committee that, where a notice to quit is issued and the RTB is notified, the relevant local authority should also be informed at that time.  That was a strong recommendation from the committee following that session.  It may not be easily included in the primary legislation but I urge the Minister of State to take that recommendation on board and to consider what is the best method for the local authority to be informed and made aware of a notice to quit and the date on which the tenancy will expire under this law, which relates to the length of tenancy, so that the local authorities can monitor and manage homelessness challenges.</p><p>I also ask the Minister of State to note the submission received by the Oireachtas committee from Threshold with regard to his Bill.  I am sure he will agree that Threshold is a leading organisation in preventing homelessness and a crucial source of independent information and support for those at risk or experiencing homelessness.  Threshold stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Threshold welcomes the introduction of the emergency measures contained in the Bill and commends the government for having listened to homelessness organisations and others who have been advocating for such an intervention.  The rationale for the Bill is clear and well-rehearsed, but the impact will be significant.  It will prevent homelessness for thousands of individuals during the winter period. </blockquote>  <p>However, there are two areas which require further consideration.  They have already been outlined by others.  One relates to overcrowding and the other to those in rental arrears.  The suggestion is that those renters who have engaged with the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and who are working to actively engage on repayment should be allowed to avail of the deferred termination dates.  I ask the Minister of State to consider these suggestions.  We can discuss them on Committee Stage.</p><p>The Bill introduces emergency provisions that place a moratorium on evictions between now and the end of March 2023.  We are conscious of the difficult winter ahead resulting from increases in the cost of living and primarily the increased electricity and gas prices caused by Russia&rsquo;s war on the people of Ukraine, with whom we stand in support and solidarity against the weaponisation of energy supplies.</p><p>We are also conscious of the difficulty people experience in trying to secure alternative accommodation at this time and the great pressure on homelessness services across the voluntary, community, NGO and local authority sectors.  I take this opportunity to thank all those who work in that sector.  It is a difficult and stressful job and those people help thousands of people every year when they need it most.  I have worked with my own local authority in Wicklow and I have no hesitation in saying that the staff in the housing section do a fantastic job, as do staff in all of our local authorities.  Many go way above and beyond their job descriptions to help our constituents with their housing needs, often in emergency situations.  In order to assist those staff in our local authorities, I hope the Minister of State will consider the Oireachtas committee's recommendation on local authorities being informed of notices to quit at the time of issue.  The phased arrangements to enable affected tenancies to be terminated over a period to assist in managing demand on housing services as a result of such deferred termination also constitute a sensible measure.</p><p>While this Bill is a welcome measure that will provide some temporary relief for renters, the longer-term solutions are the provision of affordable rental properties of a good design and high standards under secure long-term tenancies.  I refer here to the cost-rental model.  Cost-rental is a core Green Party housing policy and I am proud that we introduced and legislated for the provision of cost-rental accommodation last year in the Affordable Housing Act 2021.</p> <p>That was only just over a year ago.  Despite comments from others, you cannot just switch on affordable housing schemes and cost-rental like a light bulb but we are doing so.  It is a concept that is new to Ireland but it has proven to be highly effective in the European rental sector and especially in Vienna.  We met with our Austrian Green Party colleagues prior to passing that legislation to learn from their model and to ensure that cost-rental will work for Ireland.</p> <p> The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage is currently going through a series of meetings with local authorities from across the country to engage with them and learn from their delivery of housing across the range of social housing provision, through direct builds, with approved housing bodies, AHBs, through affordable purchase schemes and through delivery of cost-rental directly, with AHBs and with the LDA.  The figures we received from the  local authorities are encouraging.  The pipeline of projects is strong and they are confident of meeting their targets.  They have told us they are well funded and resourced but that there are challenges caused by inflation and staff recruitment and retention.  My constituency in Wicklow has actually exceeded its social housing delivery targets.  It has just progressed its first affordable purchase scheme and in recent months I have attended the opening of four social housing schemes across the county with the Minister, and more recently in Bray with An Taoiseach.</p> <p> In engagement with the LDA, we have heard of its commitment to the delivery of cost-rental across its many projects.  Across ten projects nationwide, its near-term deliveries are at design, planning and construction stage and will provide over 5,000 homes.  That is public housing on public land, including affordable and cost-rental, that is secure, to a high standard of design and with good transport links.  Just up the road from me in Shanganagh they are well advanced on delivery of 597 homes.  That consists of 200 social apartments, 306 cost-rentals, 40 affordable purchase apartments and 51 affordable purchase houses.  That is one example of what the LDA will deliver.  It still surprises me to this day when I hear Opposition spokespersons criticise the LDA and not want it to construct houses, although it is possible they have changed their position by now.</p> <p> The legislation we will pass this week will offer a short-term but very necessary protection for renters.  It has been widely welcomed.  However, we must continue with determination and using every method available to provide housing.  We must engage with investors, large-scale landlords and smaller landlords with one or two homes.  We must invest public tax money wisely to provide the best return for our people and long-term returns on that tax money, to activate land, ensure compact growth and compact living and inject action into stalled developments and uncommenced planning consents.  We must find that spot where viability and affordability align and work with all players to deliver.  State investment must provide a return to homeowners and renters through the delivery of affordability and secure tenures.  The output must be sustainable and compliant with our carbon targets, using all available alternatives in building materials and design, bringing as many vacant and under-used buildings as possible into productive use.  We must continue do that at scale and pace with the targets set out in Housing for All.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="15:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600039#RR00200"><p>The Social Democrats will be supporting this Bill.  I have tabled a number of amendments to improve it.  It is unfortunate that there will only be 60 minutes for dealing with amendments today.  We will likely only be able to discuss one or two of the amendments rather than all those that have been submitted, which does not do the legislative process justice.  This Bill is needed fast and quick but we should have had at least a few hours to discuss the proposed amendments.</p><p>The reason this Bill is in front of us is because the Government's housing plan is failing.  It is as simple as that.  Homelessness is at record levels.  Rents are at record levels.  House prices are at record levels.  The number of people living in emergency accommodation for homeless people has increased by 30% in the last 12 months while the number of children in emergency accommodation has increased by 47%.  That is not to mention people living in direct provision, people fleeing domestic violence and living in refuges, people who are sleeping rough on the streets or in tents or people sleeping on couches and floors.  That is not to mention the hundreds of thousands of people who are still living in their parents' homes even in their late 20s and 30s, when they do not want to be there.  They want to be able to have some form of independence and get on with their lives.</p><p>I was struck by the comments the Minister made towards the end of his speech.  He said &quot;The Government will ensure that we have a rental market that is fit for purpose&quot;.  With housing, the Government is always saying &quot;We will do this&quot; or &quot;This will happen in the future&quot;.  Halfway through its term, it is still telling us things will happen in the future.  Fit for purpose for whom?  I have not heard anything from the Government to indicate that it intends to make renting fit for purpose by giving renters proper security so they are not always looking over their shoulders and worried in the pit of their stomachs about what will happen if they receive a notice to quit.  In many senses, it is that insecurity that really gnaws at people when they are renting, even if they have not received a notice to quit or have been in the place for years.  It is that worry.  Things might be going well in their lives and in their kids' lives.  Their child's development might be going well, they might be settling into school and overcoming different challenges or learning difficulties they have.  There is still that absolute worry of what will happen if they get the notice to quit.  When they do get the notice to quit, all of that kicks in and they can see the years of struggle and the progress they have been making in getting through those challenges in life unravelling in front of them.  I do not think there is a proper awareness of that in the Government.  If there was, we would not be seeing these kinds of piecemeal, emergency, reactive measures.  We would be seeing reforms brought in to make renting secure for renters, as is the case in most other European countries.</p><p>The Government is failing to meet its own targets on housing.  The big promise of this Government on housing was that we would be building additional supply and new supply.  The number of social homes in the housing delivery targets for this year and last year were nearly all meant to be additional homes.  That was the big promise.  We were promised 9,500 new-build additional social homes last year.  Instead we got about half of that number.  We were promised a couple of thousand affordable homes from the Government last year but we got zero affordable purchase homes.  We were promised 350 cost-rental homes but only got 65 of those were tenanted.  For new build social housing delivery this year, less than 2,000 homes were delivered in the first half of the year when there were 9,000 additional new build social homes promised.  For affordable purchase and cost-rental accommodation, in both categories we only have a few hundred delivered so far this year, when we need thousands of those to meet the Government targets.  Indeed, we need a lot more than that to meet demand.  Not only that, but somehow the Government is not even spending its full capital allocation on housing.  That is scandalous given the situation we are in.  It is 30% behind its own targets at this time of the year.  If that is made up towards the end of the year, rather than the shortfall being made up through building a sufficient number of new builds and additional supply, it will be made up the way Governments have always done it, by buying up existing supply towards the end of the year to try to meet its targets.  It is certainly better than not doing that but it is the additional supply that really is needed.</p><p>The Government has spoken about needing these emergency measures for breathing space but there is no sign of what its plan is for that breathing space.  Regarding the tenant in situ scheme, I am very concerned about the <i>ad hoc</i>and haphazard way it has been implemented across the country.  It varies from local authority to local authority and even within local authorities we are getting mixed messages about how it is being implemented.  I appreciate that it is a new scheme but the Government could give more direction to local authorities on that.  That would be useful and is something the Minister might look at urgently.  I agree with the points made by previous Deputies about local authorities being notified of notices to quit.  That would be useful, especially in terms of local authorities being proactive about potential purchases.</p><p>There is no question that the social housing limits must be raised.  All of us are aware of situations where people who have been on housing waiting lists, who are on low incomes and cannot afford to meet their housing needs themselves are being knocked off housing waiting lists because they have gone slightly above the thresholds.  I know of people in my constituency who did overtime during Covid when others were out sick just to keep production going, in food production and so forth.</p> <p>They got knocked off the housing waiting list because their earnings went above the threshold because they were covering for people through once-off overtime and once-off sickness leave due to Covid.  Others, who have got small pay increases from their employers to meet the cost-of-living crisis are also getting knocked off the social housing waiting lists.  This is a brutal thing that is happening to people, including those who had been on the waiting list for a long time and who were close to having homes allocated to them.  They will never be able to meet their own housing needs because the Government has not moved those thresholds up, at least along with the cost of living and inflation.<br/><br/>What happens to people when they do get a notice to quit?  It causes absolute devastation, stress, anxiety, and disruption in their lives.  Their very first thoughts are about the rest of their family.  They are thinking about their children who may already have been suffering with anxiety and mental health issues.  Having a notice to quit, where they will be evicted from their home and uprooted from their friends, their family, their GAA clubs and anything else they are involved in with the local community, has a devastating impact.<br/><br/>It must be said that such evictions are not normal practice.  This is not what happens in most European countries.  In most European countries, it is simply not legal to evict renters who are paying their rent simply because the landlord wishes to sell.  They cannot do it in other European countries.  It is totally against the law, be it one house or 100 apartments together.  It cannot be done.  One cannot do this in Austria, Belgium, or the Czech Republic - and we had a delegation from the Czech Republic visiting the Oireachtas today.  One cannot do this in Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, or Romania.  What is it that we think it is okay or that the Government thinks it is okay for it to happen here?<br/><br/>I welcome this Bill as a temporary measure, but if Ireland was in line with most other European countries, we could not even bring in such a temporary measure, because in those other countries it is permanently in place that one cannot evict people who are paying their rents from their homes simply because the landlord wants to sell.  If the landlords in those countries want to sell, then they go ahead and sell, and there is not a problem.<br/><br/>We must also recognise that with increased property prices and the value of homes, properties, and landlord properties, a lot of that value is given from public investment and public infrastructure.  Much of the value of housing and the value of homes is because of the roads that have been put in, the water infrastructure, the wastewater infrastructure, community facilities, public transport and so forth.  That gives a lot of the values.  It is not simply the case that this is a private asset that has gone up in value simply from the hard work of the person who owns the property.  Much the value has gone in from public investment, not to mention the public subsidies through HAP and so on, which inflate rents and which also increase the values of homes, including the value of those homes from which people are being evicted.<br/><br/>I want to reference some of the amendments I have tabled for the Bill.  Before I do this, however, I implore the Minister and the Government to look, in addition to this, at what immediate measures can happen to protect people for example like the tenants in Tathony House, where more than 35 households are being evicted.  This is 100 people, an entire block, facing mass eviction.  The Tyrrelstown amendment, which was brought in some years ago supposedly to prevent these mass evictions, is not working.  There are too many get-out clauses in it and loopholes that can be exploited.  If the Government is looking at emergency measures to stop people being evicted then it should be looking at that and closing down those loopholes.  Ultimately, the Government needs to get out of emergency measures and bring in long-term reform.<br/><br/>I have some sympathy for landlords who complain about all of the constant legislative changes.  This is not the way to reform the sector.  We need one set of changes that bring in proper security for renters.  We must stop messing around in the sector with incremental changes causing haphazard, piecemeal changes.  We must bring in proper long-term reforms that give stability to the sector, and then there does not have to be multiple changes to legislation each time during the year.<br/><br/>Before I discuss the amendments I have tabled for Committee Stage, I must mention the concerns that have been articulated about the Bill by the Irish Traveller Movement.  The measures will not protect Travellers from being evicted from temporary accommodation, which is something they had flagged previously. This is specifically relevant in the context of the Irish Traveller Movement noticing an increase in the number of queries and cases they are dealing with around evictions.  It is particularly relevant because, as we are aware, Travellers were particularly over represented in homelessness in 2019.  We do not have complete figures on this but we do have the figures for 2019, when 25% of children in emergency accommodation outside of Dublin were Travellers and 13% of homeless adults were Travellers.  This is a complete over-representation for the Traveller community.  Their particular concerns around this should be noted and taken onboard by the Government.<br/><br/>As previous speakers stated, there should be a requirement for the local authority to be notified of notices to quit at the same time the RTB is notified.  This would potentially assist in the context of tenants <i>in situ</i>and with the acquisitions by the local authority.  This would provide some time and would potentially take some of the stress out from tenants who are caught in the middle on this.  Tenants are incredibly vulnerable when they receive a notice to quit.  They are being put in a position where they are not clear what their role is between themselves, the landlord, and the local authority.  An acquisition is a very stressful situation for them to be placed in.<br/><br/>With regard to allowing evictions on the grounds that the property is no longer suitable, this should be withdrawn. Threshold has made the case that they have seen an increase in the use of this ground for evicting people.  It makes no sense.  Threshold argues, for example, that a family with a new child might be evicted into homelessness on these grounds.  That does not help anyone.  They have argued very strongly that the moratorium should at least be extended to include people being evicted on those grounds.  I support that.  Threshold has made the case that if this ground is to be retained with regard to overcrowding, for example, then there should be some basis for that such as confirmation from a fire authority that the dwelling is no longer suitable.  Threshold also made the point that there needs to be enhanced support for those who are in rent arrears.  I have also tabled an amendment on the undermining of tenancy rights that have accrued due to the length of tenancy.<br/><br/>I have tabled amendments in respect of the removal of sale as one of the grounds for eviction.  As stated, this is simply not possible or legal in most European countries.  I do not see why the Government will not support that.  If the Government removed that ground, it could be a game changer for giving renters more security and giving stability into the sector, but also very importantly in reducing the number of people being evicted into homelessness.  Even Boris Johnson, when he was UK Prime Minister, had promised to bring in a ban on no-fault evictions.  It was not a temporary ban.  It was to be a ban on no-fault evictions.  Boris Johnson was, in my view, a terrible leader of the Conservative Party.  I cannot think of much that he has done or promised to do that is commendable, but he was backing that as a measure.  If the Conservative Party can talk about doing that, then one would think that this Government could at least do it as well.</p></speech>

Since then, homelessness levels have increased almost every single month.  We all take having a roof over our heads for granted, but imagine waking up tomorrow to find out that you were going to be made homeless?  That has been the reality for 78 families so far this year in Kildare who are tenants in receipt of HAP.  I have spoken to many of them.  They come into the office in shock wondering how they can keep their family home, keep their kids in school, and get to work.  There is a crisis in homeless accommodation, so much so that families have been sent from Kildare to Roscommon for emergency accommodation.</p> <p>That is 170 km, a two-and-a-half-hour drive and far from schools, support networks and places of employment.  It is a scandal.</p> <p> There are almost 11,000 adults and children in Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage-funded emergency accommodation.  This includes 1,483 families with 3,220 children.  The Government might say they have a roof over their heads but their childhood is being stolen from them.  Can the Minister of State imagine trying to prepare food for a family while helping with homework and dealing with day-to-day family issues?  It is hard enough in a three-bed semi-detached house.  Imagine what it is like in homeless accommodation.</p> <p> Families in direct provision are also being deprived of their dignity.  They are human beings the same as me and the Minister of State, and we need to treat them with respect and allow them to play their full part in society.  I help people in emergency accommodation daily.  It is clear the stress of such an existence - and all it is for them is an existence - is having a huge effect on their mental health.  They all say homelessness was something that happened to other people until it happened to them.  We can and must do better.  A home is not a product to be bought and sold for profit but a place of safety, security and privacy.  People are not just losing that home.  Homes are being taken from families by vulture funds and greedy institutional landlords.</p> <p> I send my solidarity to the more than 100 residents living in an apartment complex in Dublin who face possible homelessness.  The tenants of Tathony House, a 35-apartment block in Kilmainham, received eviction notices last Wednesday.  The Government needs to step in and support the residents.  The eviction ban worked during Covid but only delayed the problem.  As soon as the ban ended, the floodgates opened.  Unfortunately, the Government did not take action.  It did not use the breathing space to build homes or introduce a credible plan to address this crisis.  The Government transfers almost &euro;2.5 million per day in taxpayers' money to private landlords to meet social housing need.  It is doing more harm than good and needs to step aside so this crisis can be addressed once and for all.</p></speech>

We had an election.  There is a Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in had its chance to be in that.  I would love to see its housing solution because it does not stack up.  That is what commentator after commentator has costed and analysed.</p>  <p>  I welcome the legislation before us.  It is positive legislation and protects vulnerable people from November until the end of March.  It should be subject to review thereafter because we saw during Covid that those who are less well-off and who are penalised by paying the highest rents in our country are put to the pin of their collar and are at the whim of landlords.  We have seen excellent landlords, but also unscrupulous ones.  This gives protection to people who, through no fault of their own, face eviction.  There is a sunset clause in the legislation, of course.</p>  <p>  The legislation also protects landlords.  We have had people from both sides of this argument contact our offices.  There are worried landlords who have seen properties trashed or rents not being paid.  There are protections in this legislation for such people, but most important and central to the legislation are those who are vulnerable and will struggle to have a roof over their heads and have struggled so for a long time.</p>  <p>  Inroads are being made and on Monday the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, was in County Clare officially opening 153 new social housing units.  That is delivering on housing and there is much more to come.  If anyone saw the RT&Eacute; news on Monday night, County Clare is one of several counties that are ahead of all expectations and of their own aims and thresholds.  They will exceed it by 2026.  That is not to clap backs but there is a rhetoric time and again that needs to be challenged.</p>  <p>  In the spirit of this eviction ban, another group of people is very pressed at the moment.  That group comprises small business owners, coffee shops and small retail.  They face huge electricity and heating bills and overheads.  I argued in the Chamber earlier that, just as we bring in this legislation to protect tenants, we should put a moratorium on and defer the revaluation of commercial rates for small businesses.  It has been devastating for some of them in the past week in County Clare who faced a 33% commercial rates hike, on top of electricity and gas bills etc.  Budget 2023 did an awful lot to support those people, but it will be taking with the other hand if we allow these increased rates to go ahead.  It is in the same spirit of helping people over these difficult few months.  We were able to defer commercial rate hikes during Covid and the same should happen as we face this new crisis in the cost of living.  Many small businesses face an existential crisis and the sensible and prudent thing would be to defer it.</p>  <p>  Counties are bundled together for revaluation processes.  Clare is in with Galway, Mayo, Donegal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  People in those counties who have taken the plunge, gamble and risk to enter small business now face a hike in revaluation bills of 33% or up to 40% on what they faced heretofore.  Revaluation does not happen every few years.  The last revaluation in County Clare took place in 1862.  If we have not had to tackle it from 1862 to 2022, I think we can kick it a little further along the road.</p>  <p>  The legislation before us is positive, progressive and has my full support.  That sunset clause has to exist in things like this but should be subject to review.</p></speech>

It has been dragged by pressure from the Opposition, by the growing housing movement, which will be seen on the streets again from 26 November with the Raise the Roof protest, and by the rising homeless numbers and the political pressure that puts on the Government.  In that context, the Government says the thing it said was definitely not constitutional before is, all of a sudden, constitutional but, even when dragged and forced to do it, it cannot help but do it in the most minimal way possible, stitching in as many loopholes as it can for landlords to jump through.</p>  <p>  One loophole, incredibly, is that in a cost-of-living crisis there is no protection for tenants who lose their jobs and are unable to pay.  In the discussion around this in the media before the Bill was published, the Taoiseach and others spoke about those who wilfully refuse to pay not being protected but that is not what is contained here .  This is not just about those who wilfully refuse to pay but anybody who cannot pay.  Those who have an inability to pay are not protected and can be put on the streets this winter.</p>  <p>  Another loophole concerns those who have already been served their eviction notices.  I spent time in a woman's house the Monday before last.  She got her eviction notice for that day.  She is a young woman with four children and is in college studying psychology.  She had tried everything to find somewhere else to stay but was unable to, like so many people, so I advised her, as others did, to overhold and tell the landlord she would not leave and make herself and her four kids homeless.  She stayed there.  The landlord is relatively understanding and said he will not try to evict her again before Christmas but, legally, there is nothing protecting Stephanie and her kids from eviction over this winter despite the fact the Government is introducing an eviction ban.</p>  <p>  The other group not protected are those who have received notice now for later on, for example, the eviction notices given to the tenants of 35 apartments in Tathony House, Dublin 8, affecting about 100 people living in the block.  The landlord says "I'm selling it" and has issued a notice to quit for the start of June.  One renter, James O'Toole, has said he is terrified to go back into the rental market in Dublin with the limited supply available.  He has lived in the building since 2009.  Many other tenants are similar.  The occupants are looking to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to enforce the Tyrrelstown amendment, because it is a mass eviction, to stop it.  However, there are loopholes in that amendment.  The landlord is claiming, and this is a very rich landlord by all accounts, that preventing this mass eviction would cause hardship to the poor landlord.  Therefore, the landlord is seeking to mass evict these people.  The residents are not taking it lying down.  They are protesting outside Dublin City Council on Wood Quay a 3 p.m. this Saturday, 29 October.</p> <p>In particular, I call for the council in that situation and in Stephanie's situation to buy these properties and prevent people from being made homeless.</p></speech>

Over the past four years, People Before Profit has brought in four different Bills proposing eviction bans.  The Government has argued against them.  It has dragged its heels and resisted.  It put up every argument as to why it could not happen and why it was problematic constitutionally, but when sufficient pressure came on, it was forced to introduce it, but, as Deputy Murphy said, in the most minimalist fashion possible.</p><p>One of the groups that will suffer as a result of the minimalist approach taken by the Government are people who have already received and past their termination date.  Deputy Murphy gave one example and I will give another: a couple and their two children, whose termination date was last Friday week from a home the parents have lived in since they were born in the 1950s.  The landlord has multiple properties.  They are not suffering any financial hardship.  One can only speculate as to why they are selling but I think it is fair to say that, given the number of landlords who are selling up and evicting people consequently, that it has something to do with the extortionately high level of house prices at the moment.  Landlords are cashing in and they are doing that precisely on the Government's failure to deal with the housing crisis.  Why do property prices go up?  They go up because there is a shortage of housing.  The worse the housing crisis gets, the more the property of landlords and large property owners is worth.  That is the way it works.  The more they can charge in rent, the higher the price they can command when they sell.  When they think it has reached the peak, they sell and they do not care about the human wreckage they leave behind, in this case by evicting a working family with two children where the parents in this family have lived in the house since the 1950s, because they are cashing in and that is allowed.</p><p>I pointed this out here last week.  I was the first person in the D&aacute;il to point out that the Government's eviction ban did not protect them.  There was not a word in response to that from the Government.  Even though it was flagged on several occasions, there was nothing in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to explain why that gap has been left.  There is simply no justification.  Worse again, what will every single local authority housing section I know of tell anyone who is facing an eviction and has passed their termination date, given the authorities have virtually no emergency accommodation, if they have any at all, and no social housing to offer most of the people in that situation, and there is virtually no affordable housing?  What does the State tell people to do in that situation?  It tells them to overhold.  It is an unspoken but all-pervasive policy.  It is not just Deputy Murphy, I and other Deputies who tell people in these situations they have no choice and they will have to overhold but local authority housing departments are also telling them they have to overhold because those departments  have nothing for them.  However, the Government is not going to protect those people with this Bill.  How can the Minister of State justify that?  I just do not understand.</p><p>We have tabled an amendment on this but, of course, the Government has guillotined the debate tonight so we probably will not reach it.  In any event, our amendment was ruled out of order on the basis it represents a charge on the Exchequer to extend the eviction ban to those who have already passed the termination date.  I was scratching my head when I heard that one.  How is that a charge on the Exchequer?  That was done during the Covid eviction ban which the Government was also forced into introducing after weeks and weeks of pressure.  How is that a charge on the Exchequer?  I would really like somebody to explain that to me.  Therefore we cannot debate that amendment and vote on it tonight although we probably would never reach it because the Government has guillotined Committee Stage to 60 minutes.  Families are terrified and have nowhere to go.  They are all searching <i>daft.ie</i>, <i>myhome.ie</i>, ringing up the place finder section, which is in an equally despairing and hopeless situation, looking for rental properties, and there is no emergency accommodation available for them, but we are not going to protect them.  It is flipping outrageous.</p><p>The duration of the ban is also outrageous, given the situation. It will end at the end of March.  Some of the protections may last until the summer but then we will have thousands of people facing eviction again.  It has to be extended for a year at least, as again we are proposing in an amendment.  Frankly, it should be extended for the duration of the emergency.  The D&aacute;il officially declared a housing emergency in 2018.  Again, it was forced to do that because of the Raise the Roof protest when there were 10,000 people out on the streets.  People Before Profit put forward a motion on behalf of the Raise the Roof campaign.  Finally, after denying it for about five years, the Government conceded there was a housing emergency.  If there is a housing emergency, there is no question that we are constitutionally protected in taking emergency measures.  I do not buy for one minute the legal arguments the Government used to try to justify not doing that.  We have done it before when the Government said we could not, and we are doing it again now.  There is an emergency, declared by this House, and that gives the Government the legal constitutional basis on which to protect people from being driven into homelessness.</p><p>Most disgustingly, every single child who is made homeless is going to be marked for life.  The Government is lucky that in the case of the family I mentioned, they do not want to talk to the media because the parents are terrified their children will be humiliated in school.  That is the situation of so many of these families and that is the situation the Government is putting them in.  The mental health of children is being put on the rack because they are facing the humiliation of being made homeless.  There should be absolute protection against that and it should last until we provide them with alternative, affordable and secure accommodation.</p><p>Could we do that in the period of the duration of this eviction Bill?  Not on the current policy trajectory of the Government, but would it be possible to make a significant impact over the duration of this eviction ban Bill?  It would if the Government were willing to do certain things.  First is that it would actually do something about vacant and derelict properties.  For example, in my area, there is a building called Kelly&rsquo;s Hotel.  It is owned by the council.  It has been empty for around 20 years.  I do not know how many times I have brought it up in this Chamber or with the council.  At one stage the council wanted to sell it.  We kicked up enough of a fuss to stop that.  Now it is just sitting there empty.  It is perfectly suitable to house people in.  Nothing happens.  It just sits there.  There are Ukrainian refugees desperate for accommodation.  There are people 20 years on the housing list.  There is no homeless accommodation available in the area.  Kids and families are sent into hostels in town when they are going to school in Ballybrack, Sallynoggin or Shankill.  It is flipping outrageous that the State itself is sitting on empty properties.</p><p>I will mention Tathony House again because if the Government does not do something about that, then the same thing will happen there as happened in St. Helen&rsquo;s Court.  Landlords try to get around the Tyrrelstown amendment, but even if the RTB asserts they cannot do that, the tenants themselves are so stressed that they start to leave.  They will be forced out because of the pressure, anxiety and stress.  That landlord, with a &euro;700,000 a year rent roll, is claiming he has the right to evict people on the grounds of financial hardship.</p> <p>Can you believe it?  Can you believe the venality and greed of a landlord who would do that to people?  Some of the tenants will leave and then the properties will be vacant.  Then the landlord can do exactly what a vulture fund does.  I refer to an Irish vulture fund.  The landlord of Tathony House is an Irish landlord evicting people, one of our so-called own.  When tenants leave, a landlord can sit on empty properties, as was done in the case of St Helen's Court for three years.  There are 17 empty properties, and the State allows it to happen.  It does not take them over.</p> <p> The Government currently gets 10% of most new private developments.  It is a pathetic figure considering that house and rent prices are such that about 70% to 80% of people in the Dublin area could not afford them.  The State is getting only 10% of new builds.  All the rest will be rented or sold at prices that ordinary working people could not possibly afford.  Why do we allow that to happen?  Most of the developments in question are on sites that were previously in the ownership of NAMA and that the developers bought from that agency at a major discount.  Often they make massive capital gains out of selling these properties.  They do not even pay capital gains tax on them in many cases because of the tax loopholes they benefit from.  To me, it is obvious what you do in that situation.  You do what they do in Finland, for example.  In Finland, 25% of any new development has to be social housing and 30% has to be affordable housing.  Therefore, 55% of any new development has to be social and affordable housing.  One might ask why, in the current situation in Ireland, anything less than 100% should not comprise social and affordable housing.  In all seriousness, what is the point of building housing that is not affordable?  There is none.  The State and the buyer or renter get screwed for massive amounts of money.  What is the point in that?  The State should buy 100% of the developments.  Admittedly, that would be at a cost but there is a way it can be got back.  A windfall tax could be applied to the capital gains the people in question will make out of the sale.  One could take the money back off them.  They should not have got it in the first place.  The greatest scandal ever in this State was the disposal of the NAMA property to them.  They should not make a cent out of it.  We should acquire 100% of the sites and tax the windfall gains made by the developers so we can get the money back.  In this way, we would start to have a serious impact.</p> <p> If those who live in south Dublin drive down the N11 on their way to Wicklow or Arklow, they will see all the apartment complexes being built in the region, some of which are near completion.  Currently, we are getting 10% of them.  We should be getting at least what the Finnish get in Helsinki, namely, 55%.  I would say it should be 100%.  The State should buy the complexes and then it could solve the problem.  Cherrywood, the biggest residential development in the history of the State, is on what was NAMA-owned land.  As things stand, the beneficiaries will be foreign investors, including Dutch pension funds.  They will rent at extortionate levels and sell at extortionate prices that nobody can afford.  Now there is pressure on the banks to start lending money to people that they cannot really afford, with interest rates going up.  Believe it or not, we are actually threatening to do what we did before 2008.  There is an alternative.  It is for the State to take the property back, buy it all out and deliver it all as affordable and social housing.  We built the infrastructure with the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  We have paid for the roads and parks with public money but private investors will reap the benefit.  What we are doing is just insane.  The solutions are in front of us if we are willing to take the necessary action.</p> <p> My last point, which I am making yet again, is on income thresholds.  As our motion pointed out today, in 2008 some 48% of households were entitled to social housing or eligible to go on the social housing list.  The ESRI points out that because of the Government's failure to increase the thresholds, that was down to 33% by the end of 2019.  That means it is well below 30% now.  This is happening when more households than ever need the support because house prices and rents have gone up.</p> <p> There has been a massive stealth cut to the proportion of households eligible for State support.  You will not even get social housing because you will be on a list for 20 years, but at least you might get housing assistance payment, HAP, support as an interim, temporary measure.  If you are over the threshold, you are goosed.  The Government support is very clear about the reason for the delay in raising the thresholds.  It states it has to ration social housing.  The word "ration" appears on about 20 occasions.  That is what it is down to.  It is not down to justice or anything like that.  Precisely when people need assistance more than ever in accessing housing, the proportion of eligible households has been dramatically cut.</p> <p> The reason the Government does not want to do what I suggest is because it does not want to acknowledge the scale of the problem.  However, one does not solve a problem unless one acknowledges it and how many people actually need State support through the delivery of social and affordable housing and, at a minimum, financial assistance to secure housing they can afford.</p></speech>

The winter months can represent the most difficult and stressful time of the year for many families facing significant costs and expenses as we approach the festive season.  To be able to provide comfort and security to many households fearing eviction is very welcome.  However, we know the measure is a temporary one to provide temporary relief.  In many cases, it is simply pressing pause on the inevitable reality.</p>  <p>  At the centre of Green Party housing policy are affordability and security.  Last year, the Government introduced tenancies of indefinite duration and increased the periods for notices to quit, which will mean no tenancy will have a termination period of less than 90 days.  The Land Development Agency will be constructing 30,000 cost rental units.</p>  <p>  I believe all parties, the Department and local authorities wish to solve the homelessness crisis.  Ongoing measures are being implemented and should continue until we find ourselves in a position akin to that of Finland.  Finland's example is one we can follow.  It is the only EU country to continuously reduce homelessness.  The success of its story is not miraculous; it is down to housing first.  I would therefore like to use this opportunity to ask the Minister and his Department to continue to improve and expand our Housing First policy to solve our homelessness crisis.</p></speech>

Only this week, people contacted my office in Cashel because they had nowhere to go after their tenancies ended.  One case involves a single mother and her children.  This family just cannot find accommodation in a market that is strangled through a lack of supply.  The mother, who has tried all the local estate agents in an effort to get a house, had to sleep at her neighbour's over the weekend and is now in contact with the council about emergency accommodation.  How long is she going to be in emergency accommodation?  How suitable will it be for her and her children?  What impact will it have on the children's well-being and education?  This is the situation that so many people throughout the country are finding themselves in.  My party and I will support this Bill because we are talking about people's well-being.  We are talking about maintaining for children a life that is as normal as possible under the current circumstances.</p>  <p>  The figures show the sheer number of people, of families, who are facing challenges.  Since the last ban on evictions ended, the number of adults and children in emergency accommodation has increased to 10,800, according to the August figures.</p> <p>That is not an exhaustive list, as it does not take account of the women and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence refuges, the adults and children who are trapped in the direct provision system and are using it as emergency accommodation, nor the adults and children who are in hostels that are not in receipt of State funding.  Neither does it include those who are sleeping on people's sofas or those families crammed into a spare box room in a friend or relative's house.  This is where we are.  This is where the Government has led people, by failing to deliver an adequate supply of social and affordable homes.  The situation will continue for as long as the Government continues to plan for too few social and affordable homes.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for months for a ban on evictions during the winter.  While the Government may have been initially reluctant to do this because it may force it to admit to the failings of its housing policy, it is obvious that the realities facing thousands of people and families has finally hit home.<br/><br/>This is not a reason for the Government to sit on its laurels, because although it is a much-needed measure, it will not fix the problem.  If urgent action is not taken to increase the supply of social and affordable housing over the next five months, we will be revisiting the crisis in April.  We need more action on voids and on purchasing homes with tenants <i>in situ</i>.  While Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting this Bill and has called for something similar for months, we will be tabling amendments.  For instance, we do not support the provision in the Bill to allow for terminations to proceed where the property is overcrowded.  This could put large and vulnerable families at risk of long stays in emergency accommodation and could also be used as a loophole for those who cannot proceed with terminations on grounds such as the sale of a property.</p></speech>

I will support the Bill's progress on Second Stage today.  Over recent months the cost-of-living, energy and housing crises have meant that people are making choices between paying their rent, paying energy bills or having money to put food on the table.  People are being sacrificed and to add to their worries, there was a significant jump in the number of landlords selling up.  There was a substantial increase in the number of notices to quit in the private rental sector in the past year.  It increased by 47% between the first and second quarter of 2022, from 1,132 to 1,666.  Tenants are in constant dread and fear of eviction where the landlords have significant power over their lives.</p><p>The RTB operates a register of private tenancies, as well as resolving disputes between landlords and tenants.  This Bill is required due to the ongoing acute supply constraints in the residential rental sector and the increasing number of people presenting as homeless over the winter.  I welcome the fact that the Government wants to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants within the residential tenancy market.  This temporary measure will protect renters who face homelessness by deferring any no-fault tenancy termination from taking place this winter until after 31 March 2023.  Where people are in financial difficulties as a result of the cost-of-living and energy crises, they should be protected if they fall into arrears.</p><p>One young mother from my constituency contacted me because she is in fear of imminent eviction.  She was recently given notice to vacate in the new year.  Although she has been searching, she cannot locate an alternative property, with hundreds vying for the same properties in Louth.  This extension is very welcome to her as she needs time to locate a new place to live for her and her family of four.  Thankfully, most renters will be protected under the new moratorium, including students.  However, it must be noted, rightly so, that it will still be possible to serve a notice of termination during the winter period and this protection will not extend to a tenant who chooses not to pay his or her rent or who is in breach of other tenancy obligations.  This is fair and offers the landlord protection also.</p><p>While this emergency Bill is necessary and provides assistance in the short term, the long-term answers to the housing and accommodation challenges remain.  The Government pitches the Housing for All plan as the proposal to alleviate the housing crisis.  It promises an increasing supply of new housing, with an average of at least 30,000 new units per year.  The promise of social and affordable homes for purchase or rent aims to eliminate homelessness and to address waiting lists, yet homelessness is at a record level, additional people are queuing down the street for a room, people are being priced out of buying a home and nearly half of people's wages are being paid in rent.  The homelessness figure will continue to grow after the eviction ban has concluded unless the core problem of the lack of social and affordable homes is addressed.</p><p>Last week, the Union of Students in Ireland co-ordinated a students' walk-out in protest at the lack of accommodation for those attending further education.  The Government must listen to these students.  The market has failed to deliver accommodation for those renting and seeking to attend college, with many choosing to stay in hostels or to sleep in cars or even in tents rather than face a long commute each day.  Because Louth is located along the commuter belt, my office has received numerous calls from students from across Ireland in search of accommodation.  I will not say the Government has done nothing but it must do more.</p><p>The housing crisis is felt in every part of the country.  In my constituency of Louth, we have a severe housing shortage and spiralling rents.  The latest figures from <i>daft.ie</i>show that the cost of renting in County Louth has risen by 8% in the past year.  The average rent is now at &euro;1,420.  Letting agencies on the ground have painted a devastating picture of the current rental market with a shortage of supply that has hit all age groups and walks of life.  In Dundalk and Drogheda, the rental crisis is catastrophic as thousands of people are vying for only a handful of homes.  We must do whatever we can to keep families in their homes as a matter of urgency this winter.  I fundamentally agree with the principle of a person having access to housing and, as such, I agree with the passing of this Bill.</p><p>The number of people being made homeless is unreal.  Not a day passes without someone coming into my constituency office who is in that situation.  It could be due to a husband and wife separating or someone in the home who has an addiction and their parents cannot put up with them any more.  I commend the homelessness section in Louth County Council.  We seem to have a hotline to it.  We ring it nearly every day and, in fairness to them, its staff do their best.  Many of the homeless people who come into my office have an addiction problem.  The emergency accommodation is a good place to go but most of them refuse to go there because they maintain there are drugs available in them.  This is something we must examine, given the amount of money the Government is spending on emergency accommodation.  If there is a problem with drugs in them, then we will have to examine it seriously.</p><p>A young girl came to see me recently who has a problem with alcohol.  She is only 18 years of age.  Her parents threw her out.  I rang the parents and they did not want to do anything with her.  I contacted my local homeless centre and they told me the girl has a serious drink problem and she was in the Simon Community hostel but they threw her out because was drinking again.  She came back to see me.  Where does this young girl go from here?  Nobody seems to want to know anything about this young girl - neither the HSE nor the mental health services.  She is only 18 years of age.  She slept for three nights on top of a new Halliday Mills apartment block on Quay Street in Dundalk.  She slept at the top of the building because she felt safe there at night time.  I keep ringing and asking how come this young girl is forced to sleep rough.  The system does not work right.  If we ring the psychiatric unit in Crosslanes in Drogheda, we are told a person must be referred by a doctor or consultant.  If you go to the doctor, the doctor will give a few sleeping tablets.  This young girl is caught in the middle.  She feels as though nobody wants her.  My main concern at the moment is what is going to happen to her.  She keeps calling to the office and we keep ringing up on her behalf but I am afraid that some day this wee girl will not come in and she will be found dead.  The system is failing drastically.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for Health should be working together to help the likes of this young girl.  I will contact Louth County Council tomorrow and let them know that I spoke to the Minister today.  There is no way that society should be like that.  I apologise as I did not realise I had used up so much time.</p></speech>

Why is that, if the economy was never stronger and employment levels are so high?  NAMA is part of the answer.  It was initially sold to the public as a system that would save the housing market by warehousing loans, but instead this changed midstream and those loans were sold to vulture funds, resulting in the utter collapse and devastation of the housing market in Ireland.  Ruined developers were made bankrupt at every turn.  The skilled workforce they employed left for greener pastures, never to return.  Whatever the spin doctors say about developers, it was not the builders and developers that caused the housing collapse, but they are part of the solution, if they were only listened to by the politicians.</p> <p>I uttered those words on the floor of the D&aacute;il in March 2020, just after I was elected.  Here is a little more of what I said at the time:</p><blockquote>	Change means looking at and introducing current macro-prudential rules, not applying rules of another era.  Can we consider a mortgage interest rate cap?  As we hear every day, banks are making excessive profits.  Can we simply legislate to equate multiples of borrowing to the current interest rates, not ten year old interest rates? </blockquote> <p>Irish banks were flush with money and we had a regulator that could only be described as asleep at the wheel.  Today, two and a half years since I uttered those words, we have a regulator who has woken up but it just a few years too late, as he decides to increase the multiples house buyers can borrow but with their ability to repay greatly reduced because of a cost-of-living crisis and at a time when interest rates are rising at speed.  I return to my 2020 maiden speech:</p><blockquote>	The main people now facilitating the building of properties are the cuckoo funds which, as we know, pay no taxes but the optics are that we are building.  We will never be able to break free of the rental limbo this Government has put us in nor will the affordability crisis ever be over unless we change how we do things.  That means taking decisive action that works. </blockquote> <p>Today, optics and spin are not what it is about.  It is about policies that work.  It means strong leadership and standing up and being counted when faced with officials who will not listen, like a regulator insisting on the implementation of regulations and measures that reduce viability, such as dezoning lands, even serviced lands.  It is just mind-boggling.<br/><br/>Let us not forget that for every new build, the Government takes a tax of 33%, yet rather than reducing VAT on new builds to zero, like our nearest neighbours in Northern Ireland, and encouraging building and affordability, it attacks people's property rights.  An eviction ban is necessary only because of the disastrous attitude to housing of this Government and previous Governments.  We should not forget that Ireland was the only country that closed its building sector during Covid.  Instead of taking actions to encourage building, the Government has increased the cost of doing so with a block levy, that is, a lifelong levy for the innocent to pay, whereas those who were responsible or had been tasked with the oversight ride off into the sunset laughing at the fact they got away scot-free.  The Government is making sure that housing is unaffordable for those most in need, first-time buyers, by introducing a levy.  These are sticking plasters.  There is not one big idea coming from the Government with regard to housing.  Scheme after scheme is announced with no evidence they increase the supply.  There are no meaningful actions.  Where is the LDA or Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe?  It is nonsense, all spin.  There is no one in the county councils to carry out the inspections.  All of them are afraid to make a decision.<br/><br/>On 6 July 2021, there was a debate in the House about a ban on rent increases.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, closed his remarks by stating:</p><blockquote>	There is no single, silver-bullet solution to rents.  There are many solutions and a multifaceted approach is required.  That is what the Government is doing.  A realistic way of dealing with this would be to assess, over a 12-month period, how the measures we hope to pass tomorrow night, with the support of Deputies across all parties and none, are taking effect.  We must have a proportionate response that is not going to impact on supply in the market. </blockquote> <p>I challenge any member of the Government to explain how the situation is better than it was in July 2021, when those comments were made, after all the interventions made by the Government.  Is it that the Government now believes a ban on no-fault evictions is a silver bullet?  It is time to admit that the Government and the housing Department are out of their depth.  They are out of ideas and now they are out of housing.</p></speech>

I will preface my remarks by declaring my interest in that I am a landlord and I have some properties we have rented.  If we keep demonising landlords who are renting out properties in the way we are doing, we will find we will be in bigger trouble than we are right now.  I understand there are about 500 properties in Galway that are up for sale where notice has been given and the tenants are local authority tenants.  There is something wrong when that is happening, and it is not greed or anything like that.</p>  <p>  People forget that many landlords are accidental landlords.  I know of someone who bought a home but had to relocate for their job.  They rented out their house to be able to pay their mortgage while they were renting somewhere else.  They will not be coming back to the house now because they have moved permanently to another location.  They are trying to sell the first house in order that they can buy a house in their new location but they cannot get the tenant out of the house, having been trying for two and a half years.  There are two sides to every story and I am not saying every tenant is wrong.</p>  <p>  The HAP scheme, as it stands, is totally alienating landlords.  If a landlord has a rogue tenant who refuses to pay his or her portion of HAP to the local authority, the HAP office will not pay any rent to the landlord, leaving the landlord without his or her rent and leaving the tenant with a free house that costs the State nothing.  Going through the process of notification, validation and all that goes with that can take a couple of years.  There has to be a reality check in what we are doing.</p>  <p>  Why are we bringing in legislation to ban evictions over this winter?  It is a reflection of where we are with our housing.  Policies are failing.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme is proving to be a major struggle for local authorities.  I have been dealing with a constituent who has been waiting since August to have an inspection carried out.  He could not wait any longer to get the builder in or he would miss the opportunity to do up a house to live in.  He is one half of a young couple.</p>  <p>  That is a disservice and it is not the local authorities' fault.  They were handed this scheme as a panacea to help bring vacant properties back into use.  It was a very good idea, except that nobody asked how we would help the local authorities to manage the scheme on top of all the other schemes we are foisting on them.  Next week, or whenever the Minister issues his directive following his announcement at the ploughing championships that he was going to extend the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme to rural areas, how are the local authorities going to deal with that?  How are they going to carry out the inspections?  They will not be able to do it.  We will have created an expectation, with applications going in, but there will be nobody at the other end of the phone to say when an inspection will be carried out.  There will be nobody to say whether the application is right or wrong.  We will just have another bunged-up system.  If we are real about doing things and putting things right, we have to put money in place to run the scheme and resource the local authorities, if they are what we are going to get to do it.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows about the next issue because he was notified about it.  A housing scheme in my constituency has been boarded up, despite being almost complete, because there is a technical planning issue, which has now gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a judicial review   Most of the houses were going to the local authority and the local authority itself deemed that the application was invalid.  It beggars belief what is going on.  I have been dealing with another housing scheme, which the Minister has visited, and it is almost complete.  It is a great scheme with beautiful, well-built houses but it is waiting for Irish Water to connect it.  That is another fiasco.  Developers cannot install the connections themselves.  They have to get the contractor that has been nominated by Irish Water, and that is driving the price through the roof.</p> <p>I had a case of a person who was building their own house and had to bring water 150 m along a public road.  This person could not do it; Irish Water had to do it.  The cost for doing it was &euro;60,000 for a single house.  Let us get real.  What is going on is madness and nobody is calling it out for what it is.</p> <p> Every gateway of approval is being put in place for procurement for local authorities trying to deliver housing schemes.  There are maybe seven or eight gateways of approvals.  Why not trust the local authorities to deliver the housing the Government wants to deliver and that is so badly needed?  Why does it not devolve the money to the local authorities and ask them to deliver it?  Every time they look for approval, it takes three to six months.  These approvals create layer upon layer of bureaucracy, as well as jobs and costs that are not really necessary.  We have to get real about this.</p> <p> At one time, we had an agency called the National Building Agency, which we got rid of.  It was able to build houses and work with the local authorities.  It was able to get things done.  It had the expertise to do it.  We do not have that expertise within the Department or in the local authorities because we got rid of it all.  We said we do not need to build any social housing.  We need to get something going in terms of a crack unit that will tackle this problem head on, cut out all this trash in the middle and free up the system so we can actually build houses.</p> <p> There is talk about rapid building and how we build our houses.  I can tell the Minister of State now from my own experience that the easiest thing to do in this world is build a house.  If we get a contractor on site, we will get a product at the end of it.  It is the gap in between deciding to build something and getting to the stage of having a contractor, however, that will take four, five or six years of procurement, reports and whatever else.  Let us get real.</p></speech>

They are facing into a winter of uncertainty.  Of course, I welcome any attempt to keep families in their homes and provide them with security.  For families who feared losing their tenancy or perhaps felt a notice to quit was imminent, this will buy them time and eliminate the worry of eviction in the coming months.  It also buys the sector time to increase delivery of new homes; something to which we are absolutely committed.</p>  <p>  I have raised my concerns previously in this Chamber that a rent freeze and eviction ban could lead to a similar situation to that experienced in Berlin, where things got worse for tenants after measures were introduced because the supply of rental properties dried up and landlords left the market.  We have a very constrained market here in Ireland.  We must guard against those potential unintended consequences at all costs.  We need to give tenants certainly and security.  That is the absolute bottom line.  We will not achieve that long-term security for tenants without bringing landlords along with us, however.  That is why I would personally favour also introducing measures that support landlords and keep them in the market because that is how we keep tenants in their homes.</p>  <p>  Housing for All is aimed at addressing Ireland's overall housing supply challenge but we know the private renal market has now become an acute crisis.  Small-scale landlords are exiting the market.  At the same time, there is a need for an additional 6,500 rental properties annually, according to the housing needs and demand assessment.  Owners of one or two rental properties represent 86% of registered tenancies.  Preliminary data from the RTB survey of landlords show that taxation is a major factor for exiting the sector.  Notwithstanding the various protections for tenants, it is clear that extra steps are required to stem the exit of landlords from the private market and most importantly, to support renters who are paying high rents that are often more than a mortgage would cost.</p>  <p>  Tax is the one area in which a quick market response can be encouraged.  I am not talking about institutional landlords.  I am talking about the 86% of landlords who have one or two properties.  I am talking about the mom and pop landlords and accidental landlords.  I am talking about helping to keep them and their properties in the rental market.  How can we do this?  We need to give them fair tax treatment.  It is my belief that tenants should get a dividend from any tax reduction landlords receive.  There are two goals here.  First, we need to keep landlords in the market so tenants have a place to rent.  Second, and most crucially, we need to reduce rents for renters.  I welcome the tax credit for renters that will give couples back &euro;2,000 in tax in the next few months. I am glad that is now being extended to parents who pay rent for their children if, for example, the children are students.  I believe we need to do more for renters but we also need to do more for landlords.</p>  <p>  We should look at capital gains tax and at providing some form of relief on property sold, acquired and retained as rental accommodation, including an appropriate clawback for a five-year period.  This would give flexibility and incentive for landlords to enter and stay in the market to deliver homes for people.  It needs to pay to be a landlord and it needs to cost less to rent.  Landlords need to stay in the market and tenants desperately need security.  While I welcome this Bill, we need to be even more innovative.</p>  <p>  On the topic of banning evictions, I want to mention those who are overholding because they have nowhere to go.  I ask the Minister of State to look at their particular circumstances too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="16:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600046#YY00400"><p>I echo the comments of Deputy Higgins.  To expand on that, I am of the view that while the tax treatment of a small landlords, the very large proportion of whom own one or two properties, is fair, in a progressive taxation system any additional income they make from it should be taxed appropriately.  The unfortunate reality, however, is that they are leaving the market in droves.  That is causing evictions to take place, which is putting good people out on the street in the midst of a housing crisis.  The reality is that we must do something.  We can support tenants but we can also support one-off small-time landlords, if you want to call them that, to stay in the market because they are the ones who are exiting the market.  Even my colleagues on the benches opposite would agree that something must be done to increase the supply of rental properties.  If we do not do anything, it is evident that more people will leave the market.</p>  <p>  This Bill is to be welcomed.  I also welcomed the eviction ban in the midst of Covid-19.  We are in a crisis of a different type but it is a crisis, nonetheless.  This Bill offers the breathing space for tenants up and down the country to ensure their tenancies can be maintained throughout a difficult period.  I would say, however, that perhaps a matter that should be discussed at the housing committee, on which I am very much aware Deputy Higgins serves, is the length of the ban.  It should be discussed by all parties and by the Minister because I do not think we are going to be getting out of the rental market crisis in March or April of next year.  I believe it will go on for some time and on that basis, further consideration should be given to ensure those who are in vulnerable tendencies are supported.</p>  <p>  Housing for All, of course, sets a path for 300,000 new homes between now and the end of 2030, including more than 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable homes and most importantly, in the context of a discussion on rental, 18,000 cost-rental properties.  That is something to which we must aspire.  However, I would be wary of the impacts Covid-19 and, of course, the war in Ukraine have had on construction costs and any potential slow-down that might arise from that.  I was pleased to note the Minister of State saying that social housing supply will show progress in quarter 4 of this year.  I certainly hope that can be sustained.  A point I wish to reiterate in the last few moments of my contribution is that we should keep a close eye on commencements across the State and be prepared to act swiftly to support the construction sector should commencements start to decline.  That would be a very worrisome trend in the housing market, should it arise in 2023.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.304" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="16:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600046#YY00500"><p>Many struggled through the pandemic dealing with illness, loss, isolation and grief but for others, it was a lifeline.  For the first time in years, we saw the numbers of homelessness actually decline.  How bad does housing policy have to be that a pandemic improves a person's situation?</p> <p>That was the case for many individuals and families.  The Government lifted the Covid eviction ban last April and everyone knew what would happen, that we would again have a situation where homelessness would rise month on month, back to where we were pre pandemic.  The housing crisis continues to deepen, with rents in my own county of Mayo up 90% from the lowest point.  According to the latest <i>daft.ie </i>report, they increased 16% in the last year alone, yet we do not have any designated rent pressure zones.  It is almost impossible to keep up with the number of people contacting my office and I am sure other people's offices just seeking help to find a roof over their heads.  It is a really desperate situation.  I have never seen the like before in all of my time as a public representative.  The eviction ban is not a silver bullet but it will mean the world to families currently fearing being evicted into homelessness.<br/><br/>The measures still require people to respect the property and continue paying their rent, obviously.  We need to keep this in proportion when we are talking about the impact it will have on landlords.  I talked to a woman in Castlebar last week who is a landlord and who has one house.  She told me that in all conscience she could not raise the rent because she knew her tenant could not afford it.  There are many responsible landlords but there are others who are exploiting the situation out of base.  I know of professional carers who work full-time and share a room with five other people, particularly in cities.  English-language students are often packed into overcrowded conditions by unscrupulous landlords.  I fear that a minority of landlords who never cared about the overcrowding situation might now use the loophole to evict renters.  While overcrowding is a serious issue, the Government's sudden concerns about people living in these conditions ring hollow.  There is a window of opportunity with this necessary intervention, but it is just a window.  If the whole situation is not escalated in terms of increasing the supply side, we will again have another cliff edge come March.  That has to be fixed.  We also have to lift the income thresholds.  They are a nonsense.  That report is on the Minister's desk.  It needs to be published.  We have this opportunity.  It will be an absolute failure upon the failure that is already there if this period is not taken to make these interventions count for people in order that they have something as basic as shelter come March and April of next year.</p></speech>

I tried to grapple with it.  My staff in the office, especially Kathy, my daughter, Councillor M&aacute;ir&iacute;n McGrath, and all the girls who are there are dealing with terrible situations on a daily basis.  They are just flocking in with nowhere to go,with letters giving notice to quit, you name it.  Successive Governments have failed to grapple with this.  Regulation is never the best way.  For a business with an employer and employees, they are better off if they can have good will and a two-way street.  About 86% of landlords are ordinary small landlords.  The vast majority of them are decent people.  They are not in it for a quick buck or for gain.  Some of them inherited a house or bought a house as a kind of pension plan.  They do their best.  Then we have the tiny minority of terrible bad tenants as well.  There would need to be room.  We had one of them in my own county recently, in my own town of Clonmel, and the house was nearly demolished on a daily basis.  It took two years.  I could not understand how any human beings would do such damage to a house.  They came in and sat in front of me after being through the courts and after being evicted.  They were in the hostel and thankfully they have been rehoused now.  They need to be rehabilitated.  If people are not able to mind a house and look after it, or do not want to, and damage it and dig up the cables, the oil pipes and God knows what, and try to blame the landlord - it was a horrible case.  There are many cases like that.  Eventually, the court and all found in favour so they had to be.  This was turned into a head of steam by people, groups trying to have a protest at this family being evicted.  However, we must understand the situations landlords find themselves in.  They are not business people, many of them, they are ordinary decent people, no fuss.  As Deputy Conway-Walsh said, they have good relationships with their tenants and do not want to put up the rent.  Properties are being damaged and other things like that.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State announced Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe at the ploughing championships.  He was out ploughing, and he would better off if he had stayed ploughing.  Ministers love announcing these schemes.  They have no consultation with the county councils - none, zilch.  Now there is a grand scheme going to create so many places.  So many people were delighted because they have buildings they want to upgrade and do up that may be semi-derelict and so on.  They were waiting a long time for it but now they are waiting since the ploughing championships, well over a month ago.  The Government is great at announcing these schemes.  There is no follow-up or follow-through, no knock-on down to the county councils.  Then there are voids that are out there and not being brought back.</p>  <p>  We are talking about tenancies.  I am perplexed, as I said, as to whether this legislation is a good or a bad thing.  I would prefer that there could be amicable relations between the tenant and the renter.  I hate calling them landlords because they are not, they are accidental landlords or they acquired the property, as I said earlier.  We need to be understanding here.  The blunt force of legislation - this is going to come to a crescendo again in a couple of months' time.  What are we going to do?  Is it going to go on and be extended for another three months?  There lies the real problem.  We need to be encouraging and have more educational programmes for landlords and tenants.  We need to have more understanding.  It would be an awful thing to be evicted but if people go through a court process and everything is found against them, the renter has to have rights as well.  There has to be respect for his property.  It is a two-way street.</p>  <p>  I agree also that some students are exploited, with different foreign-language people coming in here.  What kind of a sense is that going to give them of us as a nation of a thousand welcomes, c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte go h&Eacute;ireann?  There are bad messages going back.  There is a lot of obair stairi&uacute;il to be done here.  The Government just does not seem to be grappling with it.  Announcing schemes one after the other in succession and not dealing with it is not the answer.</p></speech>

I, too, am looking at this from both sides.  I really feel for the people who have to give up their tenancy or whatever or when they get notice to quit, mothers with maybe three children, couples and young children.  So many times there is a human side to their story.  It is sad that we are not improving and have not improved the situation.  For the number of years I have been up here now, the situation has not improved.  In fact, it is getting way worse.  It is sad for the people who have nowhere to go.  This eviction ban that the Government is putting in place now until the end of March will do nothing to encourage landlords or householders to stay in the private renting business.  It is one of the reasons that they will get out of it and sell their houses or do something else.  If we want control, and I believe that someone who buys or pays for a house - first of all I should have declared that my brother is an owner of some houses, I do not know how many, I will not ask him.  I have only my own house anyway.  It is so tough on people.  I know someone who has their house sold for a number of months, and they have notice given to someone to quit for over two years.  It is a well-heeled professional man and he will not get out of the house.  That is not encouraging other house-owners or landlords to stay in the renting business.</p>  <p>  Our homeless centres are not adequate, where couples with children are directed into a homeless centre where there are other people with addiction, noise and everything and small quarters.  I say to the Minister of State and I really mean it that the Government had no problem in the world in directing and finding a hotel in the Park Road in Killarney for 193 asylum seekers, and it is putting more of them into Ballybunion.</p> <p>I am asking the Government to find proper rental accommodation for our own people who become homeless and to look after them in the same way it looks after the hundreds of thousands who come here from other countries.  We have enough of them at this time and we need to cap that story and give it up until the Government is able to look after them.  It is not doing that and it is leaving our own behind.</p> <p> There are 171 vacant houses in Kerry.  I am directly blaming the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for this because he is demanding that those houses be deep retrofitted, which will cost &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 in each case.  However, the Department is giving only &euro;11,000 towards that.  If homeowners got a grant in the past six years, they will not get a euro or a penny to bring their houses back into use.  Heretofore, the council was able to rely on the tenant purchase scheme to bring voids back into use but that scheme is no longer working.  The ban on Airbnb letting and other short-term letting is not going to help people to rent long term.</p></speech>

However, I speak on behalf of the people I represent in making a number of observations on the matter.  First, the introduction of a ban on evictions will not increase the availability of housing, public or private, in any shape or fashion whatsoever.  For the people in County Kerry who are on the waiting list, it will not improve their lot one inch.  I want to see real and meaningful work by the Government that will make housing available to people.  The one thing this proposal certainly is doing is causing a very negative effect on any person who is involved in private letting.  We should remember these people pay 56% tax on rental income.  The biggest beneficiary of rental income in Ireland today is the Government.  It collects the 56% tax from those people.  It is important to make that clear.  For every &euro;1,000 of rent received, the Government gets &euro;560 of that money.  I am putting that on the record of the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  I was contacted by a person from the Taoiseach's constituency who voted for him in the past but does not intend to do so in the future.  This person has come together with 70 other property owners in the Taoiseach's constituency who are pulling out of the business of providing accommodation on the private market.  They have spoken to a family member of the Taoiseach and they have contacted his office.  They have failed to make contact with him, despite many of them having voted for him.  They cannot get to talk to him.  They asked me to put the matter on the record of the D&aacute;il to remind the Taoiseach that he is ignoring 70 people in his constituency who are getting out of the private property market because of what they see as the negative attitude of the Government and the lack of assistance to them in providing accommodation.  The State has abjectly failed in its role of providing accommodation.  There is a need for private accommodation.</p>  <p>  I also want to give the human side of what the lack of housing means for people.  Only in the past couple of hours, I got a telephone call from a very nice girl whose name and location I will not give.  She is a mom of three children who was living in private rented accommodation.  That accommodation is no longer available to her for a number of reasons.  She had no alternative but to move back in with her mom and dad, who live in a three-bedroom house with two sisters and two brothers of the girl who called me, as well as a niece.  Now the girl and her three children are also living there, which makes a total of 11 people in this small and ordinary three-bedroom house.  I listened to the girl and gave a lot of care and thoughtful consideration to her plight.  When I was coming through the door of the Chamber this evening, all I was thinking of was that girl and her story.  She reached out to me asking whether there is some hope for her.  She is not on the local authority housing list for a long enough period of time to be in line for a home.  As we know, eight, nine, ten, 11 or 12 years is the minimum time people must be on the list to get a house.  She will be waiting an awfully long time to get one and in the meantime she is living in that cramped and crowded accommodation.</p></speech>

Many of both are fantastic but there is a minority of bad landlords and a minority of bad tenants.  Many of the bad landlords care about nothing other than increasing rents on their properties.  Some of those properties are not even liveable but their owners continue to squeeze people because they know they have nowhere else to go.  The average rent across the country is now &euro;1,500 a month, with variations on that figure throughout the State.</p>  <p>  The provision in the Bill that a tenant who engages in antisocial or criminal behaviour will not be exempt from termination of their lease is only fair, both for people living in rental accommodation and for those living next door to rental accommodation.  This is a two-way street and we must make sure people in rental accommodation appreciate where they are and that both renters and landlords work together with their neighbours in the locality.  As I said, there are fantastic people renting and fantastic landlords.</p>  <p>  I have been talking to local business owners who are struggling to get employees.  They say that if they had to, they would build accommodation for staff.  One of the people I spoke to, who has been in business since 1977, expressed the same willingness to put up accommodation for staff but said the planning laws will not allow it.  Under those laws, he can build accommodation for his staff but he would have to give X amount back for social housing.  For the future-proofing of these businesses, it does not make sense for the owners to build properties for their staff and then have to build social and affordable housing or make a payment in place of doing so.  The Government needs to look at that situation.  It could help people to get a job and have a roof over their heads.  Some of the people these business owners want to build properties for have been in their employment for the past 15 or 20 years and are currently in rental accommodation they can no longer afford.  This is putting pressure on the employers, who must raise wages to hold on to their staff.  That cost will be passed to the person who is buying the product over the counter.  This creates inflation, which means the cost comes back to the Exchequer in the end.  This is an issue the Minister of State must look at if we are to ensure people in this country can be housed.  Businesses should be able to provide housing for employees if it benefits the business to do so.</p>  <p>  Elsewhere in Europe, 50% of people live in apartments.  In Ireland, that figure is 10%.  It does not make sense.  The reason for the lack of accommodation provision in this State is the failure of this Government and previous Governments to put infrastructure in place around the country.  That lack of infrastructure is causing a lot of our problems.</p></speech>

We cannot talk about housing without talking about the plight of some landlords.  They are not all unscrupulous.  In fact, many of them are being very fair.  In looking at the housing crisis, we must reverse back to where the mistakes were made and the fact is there were a shocking number of mistakes.  There are issues with what was done with planning permissions, with rooms in towns and villages and the doing away with village nucleuses.  The roots of all these problems are found in the county development plans.  Some of the local authorities, including my own, had a lot of polished but clueless craturs who were drawing up these plans without looking to the future.  They made sure planning permissions and opportunities would not be given to young people in rural communities.</p> <p>We are now planning to build houses and apartments all over the blooming place, trying to catch up many years later.  All this negativity was built into country development plans.  Areas where village nucleuses were taken from them and areas that were previously designated for development are being cut back.  Where are we going?  Every time we come up here we are told there is no control over planning here; it is just a case of building as high and as long and as far as we can take it.  However, in rural areas there are severe restrictions.  Unfortunately, that has led to people feeling they have no choice but to give up.  They could not get the banks to back them and could not get planning permission, so it was basically back to social housing for them.  Now, there is a real crisis in social housing.  I presume it is the same for every other Deputy.  There are people coming into my clinics every weekend with letters from their landlords saying they are being evicted.  There is a freeze on that at the moment with the eviction ban, but that will not last long.  </p> <p> I also want to look at the other side of the coin in the little time I have, and talk about the situation of landlords.  I was talking to a landlord recently who had a tenant who was not willing to pay the rent.  The landlord asked me to raise the issue in the D&aacute;il because he felt that perhaps we are hearing only one side of the story all the time.  The tenant would not pay the rent, and significant work and cost was involved in getting the individual out of the house in west Cork, with the sheriff and all the other expense and time involved.  In the meantime, the tenant was only teasing and laughing at the landlord.  The landlord may have succeeded in evicting the tenant, but it cost him a hell of a lot of money.  Some landlords can get a bad name.  I met a person the other day who told me they were renting their house in Bantry for &euro;800 a month, which is way below the normal rate.  The landlord said they had a very nice tenant and they did not want to put hardship on them.  There are a lot of decent people out there who are letting houses and are trying to keep good people in their homes, and who do not charge as high a rent as others.  Obviously, there are also rogue landlords.  </p> <p> I am very conscious of young people who do not qualify for HAP and are disqualified over small sums of money and cannot qualify for social housing.  That is a huge hardship for them.  They are falling between two stools, and this needs to be looked at.  The cap needs to be raised.  It may be that a couple are working and are not on a high income, but still cannot qualify to get on the housing list.  This is a very important issue.  Other speakers talked about the new funding scheme that was announced at the ploughing championships, which provides for a grant of up to &euro;50,000.  That needs to be worked on immediately.  We were talking about ruins in the countryside and in villages 15 to 20 years ago and nobody was listening.  Now everybody is running around and trying to listen.  Unfortunately, the horse has bolted and the Government is standing at the station when it comes to the issue of housing.  The way things are going, it will not get any better; it will get much worse. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="16:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600049#BBB00200"><p> I have a fundamental problem with this Bill, because the purpose of it is to transfer responsibility for a series of failures of government over decades onto the private sector and, in particular, onto a small group in the private sector who are less well equipped to bear the burden of that than another group in the private sector.  Before I was elected to this D&aacute;il, I worked as an adjudicator in the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.  In that time, I was shocked by the standard of tenancies in which people were expected to live in the Clare area.  I was shocked by the complete inaction of the State apparatus to do anything about that.  There was a complete lack of engagement by local authorities.  The responsibility to inspect was given to local authorities, rather than to the PRTB, and local authorities were simply not carrying out those inspections, which was essentially enabling rogue landlords to get away with letting houses in appalling conditions.  I am aware that the Housing for All strategy has set a target of 25% of all tenancies to be inspected, and there was quite a big jump in the number of inspections in 2019.  It fell off in 2020 and 2021 during Covid.  I note, from the Minister of State's latest response to a parliamentary question, it was up again substantially in the first quarter of 2022.  I hope that continues, because it is vitally important that landlords know  their tenancy will be inspected and it has to meet a certain minimum standard.  Otherwise, we are essentially allowing a free-for-all in a market where there is complete inequality between the tenant and the landlord.</p>  <p>  The other thing I was shocked at was the complete powerlessness of landlords to evict a rogue tenant.  I am not referring to a tenant who perhaps could not afford to pay, which would be very unfortunate for a landlord if it meant he or she would fall behind.  Not every landlord buys as an investment, and certainly not every landlord is a huge investment trust.  I will come to a particular example soon.  There are lots of people who are accidental landlords, who ended up being a landlord because they bought a house, could not afford to sell it because it was in negative equity for a number of years, and had to move to another part of the country.  Often such landlords become tenants themselves, and become landlords of their own homes.  If people stopped paying rent, even if it was because they could not pay it, it still left the landlord in arrears.  The length of time it took to get action from the PRTB was simply appalling at the time.  There were other cases of the willful destruction of the tenancy by the tenant, and again, the landlord was completely hamstrung.  There is no right to peaceable re-entry as there is in a commercial tenancy.  Many people in this House called for private tenancies to be treated like commercial tenancies in terms of tenancies being able to continue beyond the sale and properties being sold subject to a tenancy, but obviously nobody is calling for the right to peaceable re-entry, because it is somebody's home.  Therefore, there has to be a certain fairness in the legal framework that is applied.  I am talking about small individual landlords.  I have seen photographic evidence of the most appalling destruction of what was once a landlord's family home that they ended up having to let out, and having to wait months - years, in some instances - to be able to get the tenant out lawfully by relying on the State.  That, as much as the failure to carry out inspections, is a failure of the State.</p>  <p>  During the summer, I had the luxury of being on holiday at one point.  I got a phone call from a constituent, who I will call Se&aacute;n, for the purposes of this contribution.  I know his family well.  He and his wife left Ireland to go to another country with their child.  They had planned to return to Ireland, having made some money like a lot of young couples.  His wife became ill and due to the deficiencies of our health system, which are particularly pronounced in the midwest, they decided to stay in the country they were in for treatment.  She subsequently passed away from cancer.  It was their joint wish, before she passed away, that he would bring up the child up in the family home in Ireland.  Se&aacute;n contacted the tenant that was in the family home and asked him to leave.  The tenant said, "Oh yeah".  When he got back to Ireland he reminded the tenant that he would like him to leave at that time, and the tenant responded and said that he had not been served with a notice to quit.  Se&aacute;n then served the tenant with a 120-day notice to terminate the tenancy.  On the 120th day, the tenant said he had received the notice and knew what Se&aacute;n meant, but the notice was deficient because a couple of words were missing from it, so he was not moving anywhere.  The process started all over again.  Now, the Government is telling Se&aacute;n that he and his child cannot go into their home. </p> <p>I appreciate that hard cases make bad law but we must acknowledge that not all landlords are unscrupulous profit-loving corporations that are investing.  If we continue down the road we are on, those are the only people who will be landlords.  I would not like to be a tenant with a dodgy landlord but I certainly would not want to be a landlord in Ireland either.  The only people who will want to be landlords are these large corporations because they are the only ones with deep enough pockets.  My constituent is living in what is now overcrowded accommodation with other family members and his infant son, having returned to Ireland.  He is bemoaning the fact he brought his son, who is a citizen of Ireland, back to this county.  As far as he is concerned, he has been utterly let down by the State.  As much as his tenant might feel let down by the State because there is no rental accommodation available, that is not a failure of my constituent or people like him, yet they are the ones who are going to bear the brunt of it.</p> <p> This Government and previous governments failed to invest adequately in the Residential Tenancies Board to ensure it was fit for purpose. They failed to ensure there were enough inspections to disincentivise rogue landlords.  Most fundamentally, they failed to invest in housing and build houses.  Notwithstanding that momentous failure of governments over decades, it is now being made the problem of my constituent.  His tenant's problem is his problem.  His own child's problem is also his problem.  Is that fair?  It is not disproportionate for a landlord to tell tenants they can still be evicted if they cannot pay rent, which is the fundamental problem.  If it is okay to evict somebody because they cannot pay rent, why can my constituent, or somebody like him, not tell his tenants that while he has the utmost sympathy for them, he needs the house as much as they do?  Why can he not tell his tenants that while he appreciates it is their home, it is also his home because he bought it and is paying the mortgage, and wants to bring up his son in the house, as his wife wanted?  If the Minister is going to exclude people who cannot pay rent, and that is considered proportionate, then I say it is utterly disproportionate not to allow somebody to serve a notice to quit so they can re-enter their home.  I am introducing an amendment to that effect, which the Minister of State might be minded to accept.  It is something that will not affect the large corporations because they are not going to want to enter a home.  It is only individuals who will want to enter a home for their own purposes or those of a family member.  I urge the Minister of State to think about that.  As far as I can see, all this Bill is doing is to transfer responsibility for a problem to which this Government and previous governments have contributed on to the private sector.  That seems utterly disproportionate.</p></speech>

It is the second time today I have spoken about housing, which is unusual.  Part of me does not want to repeat the same thing.  However, it is extremely important that we continue to counter the narrative from the Government.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill and the effort that has gone into it.  This should have happened sooner.  We know that the moratorium on evictions during the pandemic had a positive impact.  There was a dramatic decrease in evictions.  After it was lifted, of course, evictions rose sharply.  Since then, the housing crisis has worsened and deepened.  Notwithstanding the narrative from the Government, we now know that there were 10,805 people homeless in August, 3,220 of whom were children.  It is important to say those figures slowly and out loud because their homelessness is a direct consequence of Government policy.</p>  <p>  Imagine, we are here today and the Government has the help of all the Opposition.  Pre-legislative scrutiny was waived.  No analysis has been done by the Library and Research Service, which I thank for the Bill briefing it produced under pressure.  All of that effort has been made to help the Government to bring in legislation to stop evictions for a certain length of time, to defer them, and introduce them on a phased basis so that the homeless services will not be overwhelmed.  That is what we have come to in this country.  That in itself is worthy of a little silence and reflection.  We have come to a point in our lives where we have to bring in legislation for phased evictions.  They will be deferred and then brought in on a phased basis so that the homeless services will not be overwhelmed.  We know officially that 10,805 people are homeless.  I like to be precise with figures because they represent mothers, fathers and children.</p>  <p>  A wise Government or politician would ask what they are doing and what is happening because things are worsening, despite the narrative.  In Galway city, there is not a single home available under any housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, whether the regular scheme or the scheme under which discretion is allowed.  We know that from the Simon Community, and I read that out this morning.  There is nothing available.  We have a housing task force that has been sitting every now and again.  I understand we are waiting for the minutes of a meeting in February, in a situation when Galway is at crisis point.  I checked today.  One person has been on a waiting list since 2007 and has never been offered a home.  This is the tenth year of her wait.  There is no need to exaggerate because the figures are stark.</p>  <p>  The CEO of Galway City Council made a two-page presentation to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage last week.  I always look for brevity because I think it adds to an argument.  However, in this particular case, brevity from the CEO meant a two-page presentation dedicated to a city that is going under because of the housing crisis.  One thing that jumps out at me from that presentation is where the CEO stated, "Essential to the delivery of our targets are the private sector in their role in delivery of social and affordable housing through Part V and turnkey schemes."  The document includes a list, which I welcome, and the numbers of builds involved are minute.  We are utterly reliant on the market, according to the CEO of Galway City Council, even though the Taoiseach tells us the State is the biggest agent in the sector at the moment.  The CEO tells us we are reliant on the market in Galway city.</p>  <p>  I have mentioned the task force, and I mentioned the Land Development Agency, LDA, this morning.  I will come back to that point.  We have pockets of land in Galway.  We have no city architect.  We have run down the planning department.  I am not here to demonise any planning department because its staff work extremely hard.  We have absolutely run them down and run them ragged.  We have made them involved in the strategic housing schemes, which means extra work for which they got no recompense, psychologically or financially, to help An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We have done away with them now, again on a phased basis.  We have no personnel within the city council and no policy to directly build public housing on public land.  We can use the LDA, or any agency we like, but we must allow the local authority to lead, with vision from the Government.  We need public housing on public land.</p>  <p>  We must deal with our waiting lists.  We must look to remove the silly situation, and "silly" does not capture it, in respect of income limits.  In my office and with my staff, as is the case for all Deputies, one cannot imagine what we are doing.  We are trying to get people back on lists from which they were removed because their income went up a little bit, either as a result of extra payments or extra work for a period of time.  We write letters.  It is like a lucky dip.  Sometime we are lucky and get those people back on those lists.  That makes us rejoice.  Those people bring me gifts, which I do not need, such is their gratitude.  All us Deputies are doing those things instead of looking at the bigger problem.  Very often, when such people are put back on the lists, they have lost two years.  People may have been on the list since 2007 before losing time between 2019 and 2021 and thereafter being reinstated.  We are delighted by such a result.  That is what we have been reduced to.  We are utterly failing, and I include myself in that.  Despite my best efforts, and those of the Opposition more widely, we have utterly failed to get the message across.  We are not ideologues on this side of the House.  It is about what is practical and common sense.  We must have homes for people and security of tenure.  That can be achieved in a myriad of ways, but mostly through the provision of public housing on public land.  We must balance the market and let it provide.  We have done the opposite.  We have removed local authorities and the Government from the equation through the introduction of HAP.</p> <p>Do the Members remember that?  I did not have time to quote it this morning and I do not have it with me but somebody in the Department absolutely rejoiced at the wonder that was HAP.  It is quoted there in my papers.  This person was taking a delight in the progress that was made with HAP, which was a complete privatisation of the housing service.  We then bring in all of the other little schemes which ensure we keep the prices so high, we think it is normal when the Central Bank changes its rules to make it more flexible for somebody to buy a house and get a mortgage of four times their salary.  What kind of a civilised society thinks that is civilised?  These are more flexible rules.  The inflexibility of the Central Bank, going back in time, was the justification for the help to buy scheme.  I have read into the record what Mazars, in its fourth report analysing this, said and it is utterly terrible.  I am paraphrasing but it asked not to get rid of the scheme now because it would be too much of a jolt to the market and to the expectations that we will continue to help people to buy houses costing up to &euro;500,000.  This is four times more the cost of the scheme than had ever been envisaged by the Department of Finance.  The Government wants us to have faith in it in this respect.</p> <p> I certainly welcome this legislation although I am at a loss to know the cut-off point.  I understand it from a legal point of view but what does one do with all of the people who have received notices to quit and are overholding before this legislation?  Do we just look on them as deadweight, or what is the rationale for that?  I ask that the Minister of State might try to explain that to me, please, because I will go a long way with him in understanding legislation.  What is this cut-off point and what about those people who are already overholding?  What will happen to them?  There is no emergency accommodation available in Galway city, as I understand it.  There are very few houses for rent.  The houses there do not come under any of the schemes we have, yet we are persisting with that and putting money into the market.</p> <p> I know we cannot a rid of these schemes overnight but I certainly do not agree with Mazars that it will take another two years to get rid of the help to buy scheme.  We need a fundamental recognition that we allowed this to happen, government after government, based upon Government policy which said the market would provide.  This is a market that is driven by greed and profit, and off with them.  I am not here to judge them on a moral basis.  I am here, however, as somebody in the Legislature who says there is a different way and it needs to be regulated and controlled.</p> <p> I will finish again by talking about Galway.  We have a port in Galway which owns land which is doing its own thing.  We have Ceannt Station with 14 acres of land in the middle of the city doing its own thing.  We have Sandy Road with more land, and Headford, and we are being told repeatedly by the narrative that these are all marvellous plans and we have drawn in, I believe, nine or ten architects in respect of Sandy Road to give us their vision.  We know the vision and it is public housing on public land, indistinguishable from other houses.  Stop this hypocrisy and division and let people who want to rent for life rent for life.  Allow those who want to buy to get a mortgage but not at four times their salary.  I welcome the legislation in the limited way I have outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="17:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600051#DDD00200"><p>I welcome this legislation and we will be supporting it insofar as it goes, in that it is very much an emergency stopgap legislation to deal with the crisis that has evolved.  The crisis in a rental sector reaches to every part of the country.  My colleague from Galway mentioned a city area.  In rural areas everywhere, this problem exists where people who are in accommodation, many of them for many years, are faced with very significant increases in rent.  A woman was in my office last week who is working three days a week in a supermarket, has two small children and is on her own, and her rent went up six months ago from &euro;500 a month to &euro;850 a month.  The landlord refuses to take HAP.  HAP is very much a measure to try to help people but many landlords refuse to take it because the market is such that they can choose outside of it.  There is nothing she can do about it because she cannot find anywhere else and she is pleading to find a local authority house where she will have stability so that cannot happen to her.</p>  <p>  I have another instance where a woman in a rural area in County Leitrim contacted us again in recent weeks where she and her husband are in a house and were paying approximately &euro;600 a month.  Their landlord has now put their rent up to more than &euro;900 a month.  Again, there is nothing she can do about it because there is nowhere else to go.  That is the case for many people throughout the country.</p>  <p>  We saw the situation in Sligo earlier this year where a landlord had nine or ten houses in a whole housing estate and increased the rent by over 150% in some cases.  He put it up through the roof because he wanted to push the people to get out of there because he wanted to put others in.  This area is not one of the zones we have set out, so simply nothing could be done.  I raised this issue in the Chamber with the Minister and with the Taoiseach but nothing can be done.  This is the problem we have where so many people are in this vulnerable position.</p>  <p>  I also want to acknowledge, as previous speakers have talked about landlords, that many landlords are also in a difficult position.  Not all landlords are bad people.  Most of them are decent people who want to do their best.  There are some out there, however, who see the opportunity to make a killing on this and that is a problem that has to be dealt with.  This particular Bill, insofar as it goes, is about giving people a little bit of breathing space.  That breathing space has to be used by Government, however, to ensure we put more accommodation in place for people and we find a way to provide more housing for more people to give them some stability and sense that they have a future.  There are so many people now who are very much in dire straits.  I know they are in the Minister of State&rsquo;s and in every constituency, and every Deputy is dealing with this every day of the week.  It is not just people from poorer families or from what used to be termed the working class or the council housing estates, but it is from everywhere and affecting everyone now.</p>  <p>  I have had people on to me who are qualified with very good jobs but who simply cannot get anywhere to rent.  Three girls contacted me who are schoolteachers living in Dublin, and all three are living in the same house.  The rent has gone through the roof to the stage that they want to move back out to a rural area where they could find some cheaper rent.  That is the case for so many people.  The crisis we have in housing is particularly acute in the rental sector, and while this legislation will do something about putting a ban on evictions for a short time, the real answer is to ensure we provide adequate housing for our people.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, will fully debate these matters with the Members later this evening on Committee Stage of the Bill.  I have listened to colleagues intently in what has been quite a detailed debate.  Overall, I am confident the House will agree to pass this Bill today to quickly put in place enhanced protections for tenants immediately upon its enactment until the winter is over, and until 18 June for some tenancies.</p>  <p>  The broad consensus of Deputies across the Opposition is that five months of enhanced protections is not long enough and these essential protections should be extended for up to 17 months.  The efforts by Government through Housing for All in delivering supply at scale over the coming months aim to counter the need for a longer application of these enhanced tenancy protections.  The Government is acting now, in line with the advice of the Attorney General, to protect and balance the rights of both tenants and landlords.</p>  <p>  Housing for All is underpinned by unprecedented levels of investment, with annual Exchequer funding standing at an average of &euro;4 billion a year for the next five years.  Budget 2023 provides &euro;4.5 billion.  This Government commitment provides the construction industry with the certainty and stability it needs to build the housing the country needs.</p>  <p>  While global and external challenges have emerged since Housing for All was published, the Government remains focused on achieving its targets.  As committed to last year at its launch, the Government will review and update the actions in Housing for All.  The updated actions will be contained in the next quarterly report, to be published in the autumn.  This will allow Government to respond to the challenges facing the sector and to redouble our efforts in prioritising measures to activate and accelerate the delivery of housing supply.</p>  <p>  The Housing for All plan is working.  Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures for the second quarter of this year record the highest number of completed homes in any quarter since the CSO series began in 2011.  This year, the Government&rsquo;s target is delivery of 24,600 homes.</p> <p>In the year to the end of June, just under 25,000 new homes were completed.  The number of commencements over the 12 months to the end of September stood at 27,417.  These figures give confidence that the Government's overall supply target for 2022 of 24,600 homes will be exceeded, with the Central Bank forecasting 25,000 completions this year and some commentators forecasting up to 28,000.  Figures on home completions, commencements, permissions, home purchases, first-time buyers and mortgage drawdowns are all very encouraging and give confidence that the Government's overall supply target for 2022 will be met.  The impending changes to the Central Bank's mortgage lending rules will also help people become homeowners and move to a more suitable home.  Renters will be in a better position to own their own home.  The Central Bank aims to ensure sustainable lending standards in the mortgage market.  Local authority home loans are also available to help people own their own homes.  The latest Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures show that planning permission was approved for 44,715 homes in the year ending in the second quarter of 2022.  This represents an 11.4% increase on the same time period ending in the second quarter of 2021, when the figure was 40,131.</p> <p> Last Wednesday, 19 October, following collaboration with local authority partners, the Land Development Agency, LDA, renewed its Project Tosaigh invitation for expressions of interest, seeking further submissions by 4 November from those in the house building sector on delivering housing and apartments, with a focus on high-density developments within urban areas.  The current call is focused on projects that have full implementable planning permission; projects capable of commencing construction in the near term and those that have commenced and which are either fully or partially paused; and high-density typologies, including apartments and duplex houses, preferably at a development scale greater than 75 units.  The LDA will prioritise proposals for these higher density homes in the cities of Dublin and Cork, where the developments would otherwise struggle to be advanced in the current market environment.  The LDA recently announced a new affordable purchase scheme of 95 homes in Mallow, County Cork, under its Project Tosaigh initiative.  This new supply demonstrates the progress it is making in accelerating the delivery of affordable housing.  Project Tosaigh will see 5,000 new social and affordable homes delivered by the end of 2026, which will complement the supply the LDA is already working on through its State land pipeline.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, has made a number of announcements aimed at stimulating and securing as much new supply as possible in the coming months.  The Minister has made clear to local authorities that, where there is a risk of tenants being evicted into homelessness as a result of a landlord selling a home, the local authority will be supported by the Department to purchase that home, should that be the appropriate course of action.  Local authorities have been encouraged to be as proactive as possible in returning vacant properties to use through the use of the voids funding programme as well as the buy and renew and repair and lease schemes.  Local authorities have been asked to prioritise additional tenancy supports and prevention measures in their homelessness expenditure programmes.  Additional financial support is also being made available, where needed.</p> <p> My Department has approved the reintroduction of the place finder fee incentive, implemented through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  This will be payable where suitable properties are made exclusively available to homeless families and not advertised elsewhere.</p> <p> To ensure housing supply ramps up to the scale of delivery committed to under Housing for All, we must increase productivity and the number of people employed in building residential accommodation by 27,500 to 67,500 workers by the middle of the decade.  We may possibly have to increase that number to 80,000 thereafter to deliver housing at the required scale.  Recent data released by the Central Statistics Office show that we now have more than 167,000 people working in the construction sector, which is 20,000 more than the pre-pandemic level and 40,000 more than this time last year.  We are, therefore, well on the way to having the skills to deliver the homes we need.</p> <p> As housing delivery builds to the requisite level throughout the country, this Bill provides for the deferment of certain tenancy terminations taking effect over the coming winter emergency period to alleviate pressure arising from the ongoing acute supply constraints in the residential rental sector and the expected increase in homelessness presentations over the period to 31 March 2023.  The Bill seeks to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants and the residential tenancies market generally during the winter months.</p> <p> In proposing the temporary pause on certain tenancy terminations taking effect, the Government is balancing the competing priorities of preventing people falling into homelessness and fairly stemming the continued exit of small-scale landlords from the private rental sector, which we recognise we need to do.  The Government is proposing a number of exceptions to the winter emergency period provisions to ensure the core rights of a landlord to protect his or her property and to secure a rental income will not be limited in any way by this Bill.  We need to retain a landlord&rsquo;s right to deal with antisocial behaviour and any other breach of tenancy obligations.  We need to maintain a viable rental market and retain a landlord&rsquo;s ability to deal with issues such overcrowding, which may pose a fire hazard or a health and safety risk to tenants.</p> <p> In addition to addressing supply constraints over the coming months, the Government will be examining what further reforms of the market are also needed.  The Government is reviewing and modernising the planning system and implementing actions to increase capacity, innovation and productivity in the construction sector.  Given the exit of landlords from the sector, we propose to include a new measure in the review of Housing for All, which is to be considered by Government shortly, to conduct a review of the residential rented sector by the end of the second quarter of 2023.  Subject to any final terms of reference, the review will examine the current acute supply constraints within the residential rented sector with a view to identifying what measures are required to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector, ensuring sufficient affordable supply and making it a viable and attractive tenure of choice.  A report on policy considerations will be made ahead of budget 2024.  In addition, consideration will be given to any relevant recommendations from the commission on housing, which is due to report by July next year.</p> <p> The provisions of this Bill have been carefully framed to maximise their benefit to those considered most vulnerable and to balance the legal rights of tenants and landlords.  I thank all Members of this House for facilitating the swift passage of this Bill to ensure these protections are in place for tenants at such short notice.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, looks forward to debating the Deputies&rsquo; proposed amendments on Committee Stage later this evening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="17:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600052#EEE00400"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputies for the opportunity to present this Bill.  Having regard to the unprecedented pressures on the energy sector, I am pleased to have the opportunity to commend the Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022 to the House.  I shall open the debate today by setting the context for the action to be taken on foot of this Bill, which will provide for emergency measures for temporary electricity generation development to ameliorate problems in this area and to protect the security of electricity supply in this State in light of the exceptional circumstances that have arisen in the market in that regard and because of the situation in Ukraine.  Although many Members will be familiar with these issues, it is important to take this opportunity to set out the complex situation we find ourselves in with regard to security of electricity supply and the wider pressures on the energy sector.  I will also describe the sections of the Bill in detail, set out the background to its main provisions, and explain why those provisions are needed.  My overarching message today is that, while the provisions of the Bill are part of a broader programme of actions, it is critical this legislation is passed in as short a time as possible to provide for a critical step in the process of providing for temporary electricity generation.</p> <p>I, therefore, seek Members' support to achieve that.  I will first discuss the generation capacity shortfall that exists, which the provisions in this Bill seek to alleviate by providing for the disapplication of existing approval processes and a new alternative application, assessment and ministerial approval process for temporary emergency generation projects that will deliver up to 450 MW for winter 2023-24.  Second, I will reaffirm the urgency of this Bill in order to enable the delivery of emergency capacity to maintain a secure electricity supply for customers.  Finally, I will outline the Bill itself.<br/><br/>On the factors affecting security of electricity supply, Deputies will appreciate that we in Ireland face additional pressures due to our geographical location, low levels of interconnection with other countries, our fossil fuel dependency and the smaller scale of the Irish market compared to many other European countries.  However, the most immediate factor affecting security of electricity supply in Ireland over the coming years is the potential generation capacity shortfall that was identified in EirGrid's all-island generation capacity statement, GCS, published in September 2021.  This potential capacity shortfall arises in periods of peak demand coinciding with low renewable and interconnector availability, and it arises largely due to non-delivery of previously contracted capacity, increasing electricity demand and the increasing unreliability of existing plants.  This is a critical point.  The State needs to react to an unprecedented situation it has been presented with and which has been unfolding over the course of the past year.  This is an electricity emergency and emergency powers have already been used to address it.<br/><br/>The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has statutory responsibility to monitor and take measures necessary to ensure the security of electricity supply.  It is assisted in this role by EirGrid, Ireland's electricity transmission system operator, TSO.  On 7 June 2022, the CRU directed EirGrid to procure, using the most expeditious means available, approximately 450 MW of additional generation capacity from winter 2023-24 to winter 2025-26 to ensure a secure electricity supply.  This temporary generation capacity will be in place until more enduring capacity can be delivered through regular market auctions.  This procurement process was provided for in other extraordinary legislation passed through these Houses in the summer, in the form of the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022.  EirGrid commenced the procurement process on foot of this legislation passing.  Until such time as the proposed equipment manufacturer and the selected sites were known, it was not possible to know what time was available to secure the relevant consents in line with existing legislation.  Now, as a result of the requirement for early site preparation works and the long lead-in time for the commissioning of the equipment, it is apparent that extraordinary emergency measures are required to ensure works can commence to provide for emergency generation by winter 2023-24.<br/><br/>The legislation before the House today will ensure the next tranche of two emergency generation projects, which will provide 450 MW of additional generation capacity, can be delivered by winter 2023-24.  It is the next step in the process.  Delivering the proposed legislation will ensure preparatory site works can commence as soon as possible, followed by development works over the course of 2023.  While this legislation facilitates security of supply through the provision of temporary generation, which ensures there is sufficient reserve capacity on the system to enable security of supply in the peak periods when there is low wind and low interconnection available, it is important to note that this will not impede any of our plans for renewables, interconnection, batteries, demand-side response or energy efficiency.  This emergency generation does not replace our long-term ambitions for renewable energy, which will continue at pace.  In order to ensure the security of our electricity supply over the coming years, it is vital that this legislation be passed as expeditiously as possible.  This will ensure the next tranche of two emergency generation projects can be brought forward within a timeframe that would enable preparatory site works to commence as soon as possible, followed by substantive development works over the course of 2023, allowing generation to commence in winter 2023-24.<br/><br/>This capacity will remain available until the necessary replacement capacity has been secured.  I note that the procurement process is inexorably linked to the provisions of the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022, which indicates that these projects must cease operation in 2027, with an option of a further year if required but only if such a resolution is passed by both Houses.  The temporary generation will be used only when needed and will be used as a backup in addition to existing generation capacity in the electricity market.<br/><br/>As a result of the extremely tight timelines for delivery, pursuing the standard route through the planning system will not meet the timeframe required for these projects to be completed by winter 2023-24.  Furthermore, even complying with the existing emergency provisions in the Planning Acts would not permit site works to commence in the time needed.  This legislation is therefore required urgently in order to ensure an application can be made, most likely by EirGrid, for the designated developments.  This will likely be in November to allow for a decision to be made in December, in order that site clearance works can commence as soon as may be possible.  This is an ambitious timeline but we need to do everything in our power to facilitate the development of this emergency generation.  The State will not be the barrier to progress here.  We are using extraordinary measures in an unprecedented situation.<br/><br/>I will devote my remaining remarks to the Bill's subject matter.  This Bill seeks to disapply the Planning and Development Act 2000.  It clearly states that the designated development, that being the provision of up to 450 MW of emergency generation, is considered to be an exceptional case for the purposes of exempting it from the provisions of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive.  It also provides for a new alternative application, assessment and ministerial approval process for the temporary emergency generation projects to deliver power by 2023-24.  I would like to clarify that by passing this legislation, the Oireachtas is not approving any development.  Rather, it is providing for a predetermination that an exceptional case exists for the purposes of Article 2(4) of the EIA directive and providing for streamlined and accelerated consenting procedures.<br/><br/>Many of the provisions set out in this legislation are already on the Statute Book.  For example, a Minister of the Government may disapply the provisions of the Planning and Development Act by order in accordance with section 181(2)<i>(a) </i>of same.  I have done so myself for another emergency generation project at North Wall.  The Planning and Development Act also provides that an application can be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to exempt a development from the requirements of the EIA directive, as set out in section 181(2I) of the Act.  These procedures are in and of themselves not streamlined enough for the extraordinary situation that we find ourselves in and alternative processes must be provided for.  All potential existing options under conventional and emergency planning processes have been considered.  They have been ruled out on the basis that none could enable delivery of the emergency capacity within the timeframe needed.  This Bill is therefore required urgently in order to ensure that an application can be made and site clearance works commenced as soon as possible.  We need to progress this project quickly and we need to do it now.<br/><br/>Finally, I will provide a section-by-section summary of the Bill.  There are 12 sections in the Bill.  Section 1 is a standard provision, which provides for definitions.  Deputies will note the reference to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am providing for an independent assessment of the proposals.  Section 2 provides that a specific electricity generation project of up to 450 MW of temporary emergency generation and ancillary works, intended to be located on two separate sites at Shannonbridge and Tarbert generation stations, is a designated development for the purposes of the Bill and is required for the purpose of ensuring security of electricity supply.  This section also sets out that the designated development may take place on a phased basis and is not likely to have significant transboundary effects.  Section 3 provides for the disapplication of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Section 4 provides that EirGrid or any other person may apply to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications for approval to carry out a designated development.<br/><br/>Section 5 sets out that the designated development shall be exempt from the provisions of the EIA directive on the basis that the designated development is an exceptional case allowable under the directive and that the application of the directive would adversely affect the purposes of the designated development.  It also provides that the Minister shall arrange for an alternative assessment to be carried out and that this assessment is carried out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I note that this goes further than the requirements of the directive in that it mandates that an alternative form of assessment be carried out.  It also sets out that this assessment of the designated development carried out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is co-ordinated with any appropriate assessment pursuant to the requirements of the habitats directive.  Section 6 provides that an assessment of the designated development shall be carried by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the purposes of the habitats directive in accordance with the relevant regulations, subject to modifications that the Minister may prescribe.  Public consultation is mandatory where an appropriate assessment is required.  It is my intention to make the information in respect of any such assessment available to the public for inspection and views.<br/><br/>Section 7 provides that, having considered an application and associated assessments, including any mitigation measures, the Minister may approve, approve in part, or refuse to approve the designated development.  It also provides for instances where a derogation is granted for the purposes of-----</p></speech>

Such is the curtailed nature of this whole debate, the Minister of State cannot deliver the most basic of remarks reflecting the contents of the Bill within the guillotined time he has.</p> <p>Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, knows how we feel on this side of the House on so many occasions when it comes to legislation and emergency legislation from the Minister.</p> <p> This is yet more emergency legislation that is being rushed through by the Government due to the unmitigated failure to manage our electricity demand and supply.  It is quite remarkable that we are now being asked to completely set aside important planning and environmental conditions for the installation of 450 MW of power generators.  In effect, it is more than a topical issue; I would say that it is a national scandal.</p> <p> At the outset, I must state my discomfort about bypassing the planning and environmental impact assessment process, as that brings with it obvious risks.  In truth, it is an invidious position for the Opposition.  This Government has walked the State to the cliff edge when it comes to energy security, electricity supply, and the risk of blackouts.  As a result, we urgently need backup generators put in place to try to help keep the lights on in the coming winters.  This is acknowledged and we will be responsible in our opposition.</p> <p> As I have said before with regard to previous legislation and it also applies to this proposed legislation, this is no way to do scrutiny and is no way to do legislation.  The Bill received no pre-legislative scrutiny and is being rushed through all Stages in one day.  It is curtailed in a way that is far more extreme than we are used to, such is the nature of it.  It is a dreadful approach.  It is the wrong approach.  I would imagine that it is, at least in part, related to the absolute chaos and frantic goings on within the Department and within the Ministry.</p> <p> The Bill seeks to set aside normal planning and environmental requirements to allow emergency electricity generators to be installed quickly at two existing power plants, Shannonbridge and Tarbert, or at some as yet unidentified place, for operation in the coming winters.  Despite the fact that Ukraine is referenced in the Title, we do not need these generators because we have just run out of gas due to that dreadful war.  We do not need them because the shipments of oil have stopped.  We need these extra generators because of the spectacular mismanagement of our electricity supply and demand over the past number of years.  Successive Governments, the CRU, and EirGrid all share some responsibility for this failure.  We simply do not have enough generation capacity to meet the growing electricity demand.  This is despite repeated warnings over a number of years about the growing shortfall.  Again, this is unrelated to the conflict in Ukraine.  The Government should take responsibility for its failures in this area and not try and hide behind other external factors.</p> <p> Last June, when we were dealing with another emergency item of legislation, the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told us he had appointed the former Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, Dermot McCarthy, to undertake a review of how we ended up in this crisis.  That is appropriate.  Will the Minister provide an update on the status of this review?  When will the review be completed and will he publish it in full?  Will there be accountability up to and including ministerial level and the agencies?</p> <p> We do not need to wait for the McCarthy review to tell us some of the contributory factors.  EirGrid has said that since 2016, its generation capacity statements have warned of an increasing tightness between demand and supply.  In addition, EirGrid issued 18 amber alerts since 2017, with 17 of these since this Government took office in 2020.  These were all flashing red lights that went unheeded.</p> <p> All the while, it was full steam ahead for the rampant increase on the demand side and especially in the expansion of data centres.  The policy was to make Ireland the data centre capital of the world.  We all recognise the role data centres play in a digitised society but it was reckless in the extreme to pursue this approach so vigorously when our offshore wind generation was non-existent, when power plants were ageing and being wound down and when there were clear warnings about the increasing tightness between demand and supply.  In truth, the State and the Government could have brought forward this legislation 12 months ago, but it did not.  It was conscious Government choices that contributed to the current situation.</p> <p> Another contributory factor to this current situation was the Government&rsquo;s failure to develop our offshore wind over the past decade.  Along with others, I was in Scotland recently, visiting the Moray East offshore wind farm and I witnessed at first hand how far ahead of us they are, specifically due to choices they made in recent years.  The Fine Gael Administrations that we have had here over the past decade wasted a huge opportunity to exploit our massive offshore wind potential over this time.  It was a lack of vision, whether it was for offshore, onshore or solar.  It was a lack of vision and a lack of foresight.  To put it simply, they failed the people of Ireland.  As a result, we are still hugely reliant on imported energy and are now required, in a climate emergency, to continue to build more fossil fuel infrastructure to help meet our basic electricity demands.  If we had developed just a fraction of our offshore wind potential by now or if we had expanded our onshore or solar generation, we would not need to procure this new capacity at this scale and in this way with expensive diesel generators.  Instead, we could have relied on existing infrastructure or less demand.</p> <p> Will the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, outline for how long these generators will be in place?  We are aware that these generators will be in place until 2027 but perhaps a Minister of State will outline the process for decommissioning them or for moving them on.  This issue was raised at a previous stage but during their operation, who exactly will own the generators when they are operating and afterwards?  How will that structure work?  This question had been raised, in fairness, from the Government and from the Opposition at various Stages of the passage of the recent EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill.  This issue still needs to be addressed.  Will the Minister of State outline how these facilities and generators will be procured, what will be the ownership structure for them, how will they be sold on and what will be the terms of that?  There is a real concern that we will roll forward a number of years to 2027 and having spent &euro;350 million, which is a huge amount of taxpayers' money, they would be sold off for a song or that some private entity will reap the huge rewards of that.  What protections are there for the taxpayers' &euro;350 million?</p> <p> During the debate on the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill, a question arose about the charge that would be added to ordinary household electricity bills to help to cover the &euro;350 million cost.  The Minister did not have a specific figure at that time.  Will the Minister of State confirm how much this procurement process will add to ordinary people's bills to cover the cost of the 450 MW?  A figure of &euro;40 was speculated on but is that figure confirmed?  It is clear now that it is not &euro;200 million and that it will be &euro;350 million.</p> <p> In the last minute I have to speak I will touch on some of the amendments that Sinn F&eacute;in has submitted.  We will have even less time to discuss those later on.  The first is a concern that is shared by many others and it came up at the very short briefing we had with the Department on this.  It concerns the text "or at alternative appropriate sites".  I believe that this is far too vague.  I question whether it is consistent with the provisions of the directive.  It certainly leaves it very loose.</p> <p> We also have an important amendment, and I hope the Minister of State will support it, to require a report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas following a post-enactment review.  This is unprecedented legislation.  It gives huge powers and sidesteps significant protections for communities.  It should not be done lightly.  There should be a review and it should be laid before the Houses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="17:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600054#GGG00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak for the Labour Party on this Bill.  I join with Deputy O'Rourke in expressing frustration at the truncated nature of the debate and the fact that it is all being compressed into such a short timeframe.</p> <p>It was particularly regrettable that the Minister of State did not get to finish his speech on the record but it is also frustrating for Opposition Deputies to be given such a short and tight timeframe in which to submit amendments and deal with legislation on such an important issue as the energy crisis.</p> <p> The nature of the Bill and its content raise serious questions about failures in Government energy policy and the circumstances that have led us to the point where we need to pass the second item of emergency legislation this year in order to secure energy supplies, not even in the long-term future but the immediate future.  It raises questions about how we can achieve the necessary steps to ensure we make the transition to renewable energy sources and a net zero future.  It is a source of frustration to all of us that we are in this position again.</p> <p> We have had emergency legislation already this year in this context.  We passed the EirGrid Bill before the summer.  We represented a responsible approach in Opposition and Deputy O'Rourke has expressed that well.  This issue should and could have been addressed then and the concern is we may be back here again in another few months' time for another emergency Bill if longer-term issues are not addressed.  The briefing note provided to us says all potential options under conventional planning processes have been ruled out as they would not enable delivery within the limited timeframe.  That begs the question as to why things are being done in such a time-compressed manner.  We are told this is coming within the framework of the exceptional cases provisions of Article 2(4) of the EIA directive.  We also legislated for exceptional cases in the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022, passed in a rush this summer.</p> <p> As we have seen with the Derrybrien wind farm, failure to comply with EU environmental laws can have serious consequences.  It is concerning that the State appears to be reliant on these exceptional mechanisms to ensure security of supply for the winter ahead.  The situation is a result of a flawed and failed electricity supply market.  When markets fail, we accept it is incumbent on the State to step in but it should happen in a more structured and strategic way, rather than through last-minute legislation.  I think everyone would accept that, including the Government.</p> <p> This Bill will allow for the installation of up to 450 MW and associated works at Shannonbridge and Tarbert generating stations.  It also provides for a broadening clause to open up its provision for other suitable or appropriate sites.  The new generators will be installed in the sites specified in the Bill but will the Minister of State indicate what criteria would apply for other sites to be deemed appropriate?  On what basis would they be deemed appropriate?  A number of my colleagues have tabled an amendment to delete the clause "or at alternative appropriate sites" in section 2.  We in Labour will support that amendment unless we hear a compelling reason for that clause.</p> <p> There is another matter of EU law it is important for the Minister of State to clarify.  The central thrust of the Bill is to disapply the Planning and Development Acts and substitute a ministerial approval process for the development, on a temporary and emergency basis, of electricity generation to be in place for winter 2023-24, rather than this coming winter.  I understand a roughly similar approach was adopted on a non-temporary basis under Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007 in relation to the construction of new prisons.  A key difference in that scheme was the requirement for resolutions to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas as a final step in the approval process.  That is an important check and balance.  I have tabled an amendment to provide for such an resolution to be passed in the Oireachtas for this case as well.  I hope the Minister of State takes that on board.  For such extraordinary emergency powers to bypass planning requirements, there might well be a specific approval provision on a case-by-case basis by the Oireachtas, where the Minister would have to address key climate metrics in each case.  We will come to that amendment shortly, given the shortened timeframe, but I wanted to put the rationale for it out on Second Stage.</p> <p> A key question I have for the Minister of State relates to the allocation and separation of responsibilities under EU law as between electricity generators and suppliers, on one hand, and the transmission system operator, EirGrid, on the other.  It seems clear from the Bill that it is the intention that EirGrid be permitted or expected to apply for ministerial approval to carry out a "development [consisting] of the installation of up to 450 megawatts of temporary emergency electricity generation plant, site development and works ancillary to that installation, and the operation of the plant".  However, our understanding has been that under EU law, EirGrid, as the independent transmission system operator, is not permitted to perform any function relating to electricity generation or supply.  Will the Minister of State clarify why EirGrid is identified in the Bill as the applicant?  Does this arise from the previous emergency legislation?  Is our understanding correct or is some exception or derogation being relied upon in the current circumstances?</p> <p> In a related question, it is our understanding that for similar reasons, EirGrid would generally be prohibited from owning, developing, managing or operating an electricity storage facility, but we are aware an exception is provided for, subject to conditions designed to ensure the transmission system operator does not become a player in the electricity markets.  We seek clarity on that.</p> <p> I think we all agree that the electricity sector has a central role to play in combating climate change.  Clearly, achieving our emissions reduction targets will involve putting much more electricity from renewable sources on the grid, especially generation through using offshore wind capacity. I know Wind Energy Ireland briefed Oireachtas Members today on this.  Where there is a great deal of potential wind power on an intermittent basis, the development of large-scale capacity to store excess electricity generated in this way and release it to meet demand will become crucial. </p> <p> The promoters of the Silvermines Hydro 360 MW plant are expected to apply for full planning permission early next year, with delivery no sooner than 2028.  There is a long lead-in for these projects and I am not aware of any other proposals promising delivery in a similar timeframe.  Given this long lead-in, many commentators are convinced the engineering and logistical capacity to plan and deliver projects on the necessary scale within the necessary timeframes would be greatly enhanced by the active participation of the State sector, with the State and public sector supporting and providing additional capacity.  There is a real and valid concern that private operators will not by themselves have capacity to provide the solutions needed soon enough.  That is why we believe we need much more direct State intervention.  The Government's policy statement of November last year acknowledged that one of the challenges to security of electricity supply is ensuring adequate storage capacity.  It has specifically acknowledged the need for significant investment in additional storage capacity.  What role do the Minister of State and Government foresee for EirGrid or the ESB in speeding up the deployment of clean energy by promoting a renewables-focused power system with a greatly improved energy storage capacity?  Does the Minister of State envisage ensuring that derogations under EU law will be availed of, so as to enable the bank of engineering and logistical expertise in the commercial State sector to be brought into service in the national interest and ensure delivery of this urgent and demanding project?  Our concern is it may well be a case of emergency legislation again to allow for fossil fuel-power generating capacity but without any sense of similar urgency for clean energy generated through renewables.  </p> <p> I am conscious we all have a much shorter timeframe than we might have liked.  Will the Minister of State clarify in his wrap-up or on Committee Stage how it is intended that section 10 will allow the Minister to comply with the provisions of section 15 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act when it is so broadly defined?  What is the manner that would be consistent with section 15 when the legislation provides in the proposed section 10 an open-ended caveat stating "to the extent that they consider practicable, taking particular account of the said exceptional circumstances and urgent and compelling necessity."  How does that align with the provisions of the climate action Act?</p> <p> We are all anxious to see Dermot McCarthy's review of energy security completed.  I am sure the Government is also anxious to see that.  Will the Minister of State update the House on the timeframe for that report?  How will we go about seeing any recommendations in the report implemented in a more measured and structured way that will not mean we are back before the House in the coming months with yet more emergency legislation to guarantee energy security over this and coming winters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="17:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600056#JJJ00100"><p>The Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action decided to waive pre-legislative scrutiny for this Bill.  It was appropriate to do so.  It was certainly not a unanimous decision but given that it is emergency legislation, when we were asked, I think that was the right thing to do.  However, I must agree with Deputy Bacik that the committee should not have been in the position where it was asked at the eleventh hour to make this decision.  We need to be more strategic about taking these decisions.  That said, I recognise that these things often arise very urgently and sometimes there is no choice but to make that request.</p>  <p>  Generation capacity is critically important.  We do not want to be building fossil fuel infrastructure.  It will make achieving our climate targets harder.  We are trying to reduce our emissions in energy generation by 75% based on 2018 levels by 2030.  However, I recognise that this is capacity generation, that is, generation for situations when we do not have the renewables.  It will actually help us build out the renewable generation portfolio that is in the pipeline, whether wind or solar.  I note that 65% of our electricity comes from wind.  That will not always be the case.  In future, we may have a situation where 80% or 90% comes from wind but the following day there may not be the renewables there and we will have to rely on fossil fuel generation.</p>  <p>  I welcome that there is a sunset clause and that the legislation winds up in 2026.  By then, we will have had a few years of developing renewables and we should have got to the point where we are largely a renewable-electricity driven economy.  The huge opportunity that this State has, as others have mentioned, is in offshore wind.  Members across the House have alluded to the lost decade.  I would argue that it is a lost 15 years.  The Arklow Bank project dates back to 2004.  We were one of the first in the world to develop offshore wind, and then we stopped abruptly and decided that it was too difficult and that gas and oil were too cheap.  As a State, we took our foot off the pedal.  Now we are in a situation where we are trying to develop offshore again and unfortunately it is much later than we would have liked.  I believe we will become world leaders in time, albeit that we are coming from behind.  We are going to catch up with Scotland.  It is well ahead of us, ten years ahead.  Deputy O'Rourke, myself and others on the committee visited the very impressive Moray East farm off the coast of Aberdeen.</p>  <p>  I am out of time so I will wrap up there.  I do think that we will be world leaders.  I welcome the Bill but I do not think that we should have been in this situation.</p></speech>

The Bill seeks to bypass some of the usual elements of the planning system, in particular parts of the environmental impact assessment.  While Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the need to act to prevent blackouts and brownouts we have been vocal in criticising the rushed nature of this legislation.  It should have gone through pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is not acceptable to ignore environmental concerns when it suits the Government.  We will submit amendments to ensure the process is reviewed after its conclusion and to recognise the impact of data centres on the energy crisis.  There are huge environmental concerns around data centres, not only in the context of their energy hunger but also their water hunger, which is so great that water from the Shannon is being diverted to the Dublin area at great cost to the taxpayer.  Data centres must pay their way and pay for the damage they do to the environment.</p>  <p>  We are here today because of the Government's lack of planning.  There is need for emergency back-up generation to avoid blackouts.  We need an end to talk of penalising workers and families for energy usage at peak times.  They are suffering enough.  They need help and not hassle.  We need to address that as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Like my colleagues, however, I have concerns about the amount of time allocated for the debate and the process that has been followed.  Unfortunately, it seems to be the go-to solution for this Government that whenever anything difficult or controversial or there are things it wants to do quickly that it undermines good governance by seeking to bypass pre-legislative scrutiny.  The information given to the joint committees are given literally before meetings are held; there is not sufficient discussion and the guillotine is used in the debate.  While I understand that that is required in some instances, it seems to be used consistently by the Government, particularly around issues of energy.  This is the second time that we have debated an emergency electricity Bill this year.  The first time was the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill in June.  Why was it that this Bill and its amendments were not included then?  Because this Bill is to implement many of the emergency measures that were introduced in June-July.  Whether it was the Department, the Government, the CRU or EirGrid was the key driver behind the initial Bill, how was there not the foresight in June to incorporate these provisions?  That really concerns me if we are expecting the same entities to plan our electricity and energy grid into the future for the next ten, 20 or 30 years if they cannot even think three or four months ahead.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was peppered with words like &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;, &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo;, &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo;.  That is done to create the illusion that there was no option here.  That is not only for us in this Chamber but also because the Government will have to go to Europe and convince it that there is an exceptional reason why this Government wants to exempt itself from undertaking environmental assessments that are due on a development such as this.</p>  <p>  The Bill will exempt the need to undertake those environmental assessments.  I have some specifical concerns about the Bill.  First, I do not believe that it should reference Ukraine.  The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications has been very clear throughout the last year that there are two very separate issues at play when it comes to Ireland&rsquo;s energy: security, which is a planning issue, and pricing which has been impacted by Ukraine.  Those two issues have been very separately discussed by the Minister and he has been at pains to separate them.  Yet, when it comes to this emergency Bill, we see that Ukraine is included in the Long Title.  I wonder if that is an attempt to convince Europe that this measure and this exemption are necessary.</p>  <p>  It is the case that member states can exempt specific projects from Article 2(4), which means that we will not need an environmental impact assessment under the Planning Acts.  I want to raise a couple of things on that.  Exceptional case is interpreted very narrowly by Europe.  It can include issues of energy security but it must be where it is impracticable or impossible to achieve the purposes of the project that the state is trying to exempt.  Again, I question whether this Bill has been left until the eleventh hour because the Government wants to use this clause.  The Government could have brought it forward earlier in the year.  It could have got through the proper environmental assessment at that point.  I do wonder whether this was a purposeful omission.</p> <p>I wonder whether the Government is trying to get around environmental scrutiny.<br/><br/>I have a concern in respect of which I have tabled an amendment.  The provision is very open-ended.  The Minister of State said the measure is for 450 MW of generation.  He referred to two sites but then said &quot;and other sites&quot;.  That essentially a gives <i>carte blanche</i>to the Government to generate wherever it wants without applying the environmental provisions of the planning Act.  This gives a huge amount of power.  I question whether it is really within the realm of Article 2(4), which entails exempting specific projects on a case-by-case basis and which is not even project wide in scope.  The Minister of State will therefore have a great deal of difficulty explaining to Europe the need to have such an open-ended provision.  That is why I have tabled my amendment.  I hope the Minister of State will take it on board.  Saying we have an emergency and that if the two sites for potential generation do not work out, the measure can be applied to any other site is not acceptable.  I do not believe Europe would view that as acceptable and I do not believe it would fall within the provisions of Article 2(4).<br/><br/>There are some issues with this.  I agree with my colleague that the Government has put people in opposition in a very difficult position in this regard.  None of us wants to see blackouts or brownouts.  However, because of the Government&rsquo;s failure to plan, take control and drive an energy system that is secure, we are expected to support provisions that we could never agree to in normal circumstances.  The Minister of State said in his speech that the factors affecting the security of electricity supply in Ireland are our geographical location, low levels of interconnection, fossil fuel dependency and the small scale of the market.  He also stated the shortfall was identified in September 2021 in EirGrid's All-Island Generation Capacity Statement.  These are not the reasons we have a security-of-supply issue in Ireland.  The reason we have risk when it comes to security of supply is that the Government has not implemented what needs to be implemented or delivered a secure grid.  My point concerns not only the current Government but also previous ones because EirGrid has been ringing the alarm bell on this since 2017.  It is not a new phenomenon; it has been highlighted year in, year out since 2017.  Not only has implementation not happened and not only has the grid has not been made secure but there have been no curbs on demand.  The Government has allowed exponential growth in electricity demand, primarily through the development of large data centres.  At no stage did the Government think that since our grid is weak, we cannot meet the demand and need to start curbing it.  That is why we are in the situation we are in.  We are not here because of Ukraine or because Ireland is a small country with a small electricity market; we are here because the CRU, EirGrid and the Government have not between them managed to develop and maintain a proper, functioning electricity grid worthy of a developed country.  Owing to that, communities and businesses are facing potential blackouts and the Government's rushing through of emergency legislation is doing us enormous damage internationally.  The Government needs to be cognisant of that and ensure every effort is made to ensure our grid and supply will be reliable and that our lights will be kept on this winter and in future winters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="18:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600057#KKK00200"><p>I welcome this legislation.  It is imperative that we secure energy supplies in Ireland this winter and beyond.  We all want to see Ireland transition to renewables.  It cannot happen quickly enough but it takes time to build the infrastructure we so desperately want to see, be it on land or offshore in the form of the wind-generating facilities.</p>  <p>  I want to speak for a moment about Moneypoint power-generating station in County Clare, a coal-burning facility.  In an ideal world, it would have transitioned.  It is in the process of doing so, however, because we are preparing for it to become a hydrogen-processing point using wind energy generated off the wild Atlantic coast.  While we have plants like Moneypoint, it is essential that we fire them up to generate electricity so we will not have blackouts and the energy crisis we all fear this winter and beyond.</p>  <p>  I met stakeholders from the offshore wind sector last week.  They tell me that, at present, approximately &euro;78 billion worth of offshore projects are planned for Ireland.  We need to make it possible for these to become real-time projects.  The stakeholders fear that other European countries have more streamlined regulation that will allow projects to be delivered quicker.  Admittedly, we have the Maritime Area Planning Act, which was passed in both Houses and signed by the President just before Christmas last year, but that in itself is just one aspect of what is required.  Much more needs to happen.  I want us to have energy security.  In this regard, the Bill under discussion is essential.  I hope it will pass rapidly through the Houses.</p>  <p>  My final point is one that I have mentioned twice today.  We had a really good budget a few weeks ago that has brought some stability to households and businesses.  However, one of my big fears at the moment concerns the fact that six areas in Ireland are having their commercial rates bases revalued.  These include County Clare, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Mayo and Donegal.  They are facing a 33% increase in their commercial rates.  That this is coming in a winter on top of extortionate heating and electricity costs is too much.  Those affected are now facing an existential crisis.  We had very good measures in the budget to protect and support them but if commercial rates are to go up, we are taking away from them yet again.  There are legal provisions for deferring a rate revaluation.  We saw it happen in 2020 in the depths of the Covid pandemic.  The last rates valuation happened in Clare in 1862, or 160 years ago.  If we were able to kick the matter 160 years down the road then, we could surely decide that October 2022 is not the time to burden struggling businesses and kick it further down the road.</p>  <p>  This is good legislation.  I hope it will pass quickly.  Moneypoint is central to all this.  There will come a time when we have more offshore capacity but we are not there just yet.</p></speech>

We still do not know the reason.  It was a real wake-up call for people in Cork to realise the Government has failed to secure energy despite warnings.  People are concerned.  Rushing this Bill through the D&aacute;il is fooling no one.  Once again, the Government, having ignored the warnings, is now trying to react at the last minute.  This should have been planned over the summer.  My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, has been raising concerns about the rushed nature of the Bill.  He is right.  We need a Government that plans and does not leave everything to the last minute.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said a number of weeks ago that prepay customers would not be cut off.  Now, weeks later, over 400,000 people are waiting for clarity from the Government as to how they will be protected.  It is not right for the Taoiseach and other members of the Government to make statements and then not deliver.  The onus is therefore on the Government.  A statement needs to be made to all the prepay customers.  Thankfully, the weather has been good so far but people are worried about the winter.  They fear their heating bills, and that needs to be sorted out now.</p></speech>

This is setting a very bad precedent, in particular for the Green Party.  At the first sign of the crisis, the Government essentially abandoned the mini safeguards relating to planning and development, and even climate action measures that are already on the Statute Book.  This Bill sets aside the environmental impact assessment and several directives in order to fast-track these developments to facilitate gas-fired generators to be ready for next winter because we are told we will face great threats to our power supply if we do not move fast.  Every reason under the sun is given for that potential outcome - from Ukraine, to &quot;We failed to generate enough offshore wind&quot;, to &quot;There are a lot more people coming on the grid&quot;, and so on, but the very obvious one is being ignored.  We will park the obvious question, because it is a longer debate, as to how this wonderful market system for the supply of electricity was to usher in a new and great era of competitive energy and leave us all sl&aacute;n abhaile with energy at low prices.  The neoliberal model that was introduced in the early 2000s utterly failed.  Not only are people faced with massive bills, but they are also now being told - we just heard the evidence of the Deputy from Cork, that we may be facing blackouts unless we ignore all the environmental and climate legislation that has been put in place heretofore.</p><p>It is a tall order for the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to ask Deputies to pass this Bill.  People Before Profit will not support it.  We will vote against it.  One of the reasons we are doing that is because what I really hate more than anything else is the idea that the Minister of State thinks that we are stupid, that we are eejits, that we would swallow the diatribe about Ukraine and the shortage of supply for the reality, which is that data centres are gobbling up something like 15% to 17% of the power from our national grid.  It is an outrageous scandal that we are a total outlier not just in Europe but on the planet in terms of how we deal with the national grid and the facilitation of data centres.  We are putting that aside because we are told that this is most important to our economy.  Without the multinationals, we would all drop down dead.  If they did not have their data centres, the multinationals would flee the country.  This big hammer is held over political opposition and over the people of Ireland as if there is no alternative in this world but to facilitate Google, Microsoft and LinkedIn - all of the giant multinationals whose head offices are based here because they get access to a low tax regime.  Now we are facilitating them to the hilt, with whatever amount of data centres they want.</p><p>I was not in the Chamber when the Minister of State made his contribution, but I was listening.  He stated that we discovered somehow in 2021 that we were going to run into trouble in the winter of 2023 and so now in 2022 we have to pass this emergency legislation.  I will tell the Minister of State what I think happened.  I think in 2021 we discovered that there was going to be a problem and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State sat down and did what they always do.  The Minister always says that what needs to be done is this, this and this.  They went to the top civil servants and they went blah, blah, blah like Greta Thunberg expressed many times about COP.  I have seen it in action in the climate committee.  The amount of blah, blah, blah when it comes to dealing with reality is astonishing.  They blah, blah, blahed the Ministers to death and they got to 2022 and they realised that, Jesus Christ, we now have eight mega data centres to be connected to the grid, which already have planning permission, that were not part of the moratorium that we insisted on and that they are going to gobble up 1.5 GW of energy, never mind the 450 MW the Government is buying in.  This has all been documented in replies to parliamentary questions we asked and in evidence which we have got back.  Despite what we are being told at those committees, that Ireland is not an outlier and growth of 9% in demand for energy is not unusual, even the CRU came back to us and told it is unusual.  It said that no other country in Europe has had growth of 9% in energy demand in the past five years.  That is what we have had, and it is due to the growth in the number of data centres.  All of the other big economies in Europe &ndash; all 26 of them or whatever the number is; I always get mixed up with the number &ndash; have had zero growth in energy demand, in particular when we include the two years of the Covid crisis.  We are an outlier for reasons, and now we are passing legislation that flies in the face of environmental and climate concerns in order to facilitate giant multinationals at an obscene level.  It is not just about energy; it is also about water.</p><p>It is unusual.  In fact, it is most extraordinary to see that this is being done under the guidance of the Green Party, who got into power saying they were going to be the saviours of the environment and they would drive a green agenda.  The Green Party got its carbon legislation passed, but now it is unwinding it bit by bit in order to facilitate the economic powers that drive decisions in this country.  We are tearing up the Planning and Development Act because we want to introduce a clause that will lift the constraints that may be imposed on data centres.</p><p>We will table amendments to the Bill.  I have no doubt they will probably be rejected by Minister.  If they are not rejected, there are other elements in this House that will vote against them.  I am telling the Minister of State that this is a charade.  It is a charade mainly because the Government is treating us like we are thicks, as if we do not see the reality of what is coming down the tracks.  It is nothing to do with the war in Ukraine.  We do not get our gas supply from Russia.  We get our gas from Norway, from the North Sea across the interconnector from Moffat, and from Corrib.  We are not under threat of gas shortage because of the reasons the Minister of State gave in his speech or that are continually spewed out to us, with passion, from Ministers and, in particular, from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.</p><p>This is not good enough.  Despite all of the arguments we have made and all of the attempts by ourselves and others to pass Bills and motions to ban the proliferation of data centres in this country, we are continuing with the same old policy.  Members can mark the words of those who predicted it, the scientists and even the data centre industry itself.  The year 2030 is a big cut-off date for what is going to happen in terms of climate mitigation.  We will have 1 million electric cars by 2030, and a reduction in emissions by 35% to 40%.  We will cut the herd by 2030.  Everything is <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>.  It is for the next Government or the next part of the climate plan.  It is kicked down the road and kicked for touch, but by 2030 if we keep going down this road data centres will be consuming not 15%, not 17% of our national grid, but 30%.  The Government will have to fool the people and say: &quot;Oh Janey Mac, we need more back-up generation.&quot;  We are going to have to change the laws again and again.  We are going to have to ignore environmental impact statements and our climate targets.  We are going to have to go back on everything we said and continue our reliance on fossil fuels, not because we are not good enough at renewables, people are not playing their part or because a carbon tax has been imposed on them but because the Government is craven and bowing down, it cannot do enough for the multinational corporations that is it rolling out the red carpet for, who really do not give a damn and who are not playing their part because they are not paying the proper taxes in this country.  The Government will do anything; it will bend over backwards to facilitate them in this pitiful little republic.  No other country in the world does it, but we manage to do it.  Albeit that we intend to attempt to amend the Bill, we are totally opposed to its passing.</p></speech>

Regrettably, there is a need for urgent action, including additional generation of power.  For that reason, we do not oppose the legislation, but we have some concerns about the manner in which it is being processed.  I accept that it is frustrating when we see the situation, we are in.  It is due to Government policy in recent years.</p> <p>We are here because of a failure of the Government to plan to ensure we would have adequate capacity.  I attended a briefing this morning given by Wind Energy Ireland relating to the potential of wind energy independence for Ireland and zero carbon electricity generation by 2035.  It was very positive stuff but it seems, although I hope it is not, far removed from this winter and the current situation we are in.  Think of the position we could be in now had more been done over the past ten years in terms of the national grid and how we generate energy.</p> <p> If we are to grasp the benefits of what is coming down the tracks, we need to ensure the grid is there to match it.  Both EirGrid and the CRU and any organisation that is connected to this need to lift their game to ensure, first, in the here and now this winter, that we will have adequate capacity, that the lights will stay on and that the most vulnerable will not end up facing hardship by way of dark, cold and all the rest of it.  Moreover, we need to ensure we will seize that opportunity for energy independence, reduced emissions and significant employment.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill.  I share the concerns that have been articulated and echo them.  This is not the way to do business and I think both the Minister of State and the Minister will appreciate that.  There is little time for debate or scrutiny when a Bill is due to be guillotined.  We are being asked to set aside important planning legislation and environmental assessments.  It reeks of a certain degree of chaos on the Government benches.  This is not the way to do business in government.  The State should be run in a smooth and composed fashion but I do not see this judging by the activities this evening.</p>  <p>  That said, I recognise the context of the war in Ukraine, and while it is not directly linked to what is going on in this country, there is an issue relating to energy security and gas supplies.  We have gas-fired energy plants here and it is important we have an alternative source available for backup if required.  There is also a mismatch between supply and demand in regard to energy.  I appreciate that context and recognise the fact these two generators, with an additional 400 MW, are for backup only and will be used only from a backup perspective, or so we are told.</p>  <p>  In my brief remaining time, I will ask a few questions and the Minister or the Minister of State might be kind enough to address them in their closing remarks, for which I will yield some of my time.  There was mention of diesel fuel being used.  Is that the fuel that will be used to fire these two generators?</p>  <p>  A cost of &euro;350 million was floated.  Is that an accurate ballpark figure?  Who is going to pay the &euro;350 million if it is indeed the cost?  Is it going to come directly from the State or will a levy be put on electricity bills throughout the country?  Tarbert and Shannonbridge were mentioned specifically.  It is ironic we only recently shut Shannonbridge and now it looks as though, like Lazarus, it will be brought back to life.  Looking at it from a positive perspective, does either the Minister or the Minister of State have any idea as to whether additional employment will be brought to Shannonbridge, and Tarbert in particular, because of this?</p>  <p>  Most important, what is the Minister's assessment of whether this will actually work and plug the gap, or whether we will be back here this time next year trying to ram through more emergency legislation?</p>  <p>  I recognise the imperfections of the Bill and of this process.  However, being a responsible member of the Opposition, I want to keep the lights on and, on that basis, I will not oppose the Bill.  Nevertheless, I will look in great detail at the amendments with a view to strengthening the legislation and take it from there.</p></speech>

As for exceptional measures, it looks as though the D&aacute;il has to afford exceptional powers to the Minister, given the Bill seeks to disapply the Planning and Development Act.  This is necessary safeguarding legislation to protect against unwarranted development and citizens' rights being trampled on by planning developments.  It is being proposed to reflect the significant concerns relating to energy supply and, in the main, seeks to facilitate the development of electricity-generating capacity through new generator deployment at Tarbert and Shannonbridge power stations.</p>  <p>  We in the Regional Group recently tabled a motion requesting the repurposing of Shannonbridge as a generating station but using a different fuel supply.  We brought forward a thesis whereby it could be fuelled by biomass, which would be redirected from the forestry export market, where it is sold at present for little money.  This could have been used as an inward feedstock to develop indigenous electricity generation, but it is obvious the Government has other thoughts on the subject.  It would have benefited both the security of supply and two indigenous, domestic sectoral industries, and I would hazard a guess it would also generate additional employment.  It appears the Government has other ideas, and what has been proposed by the Bill, it appears, is now the outcome, namely, the purchase of additional large generator capacity to be deployed.</p>  <p>  The Bill the Government is proposing also speaks to the capacity of legislation to consider other site generation outside of these two capacity sites where the planning Act and the safeguards could, again, be disapplied.  I am concerned, like other colleagues who have spoken, about that type of power and I believe that if such actions are being considered, they should be brought back before the D&aacute;il for approval.</p>  <p>  Much has been made of the electricity supply concerns we face because of the Ukraine war and the effects that is having on supply pricing due to Russia's actions in turning off the supply of gas to the European market.  It is true Europe has become far too dependent over many decades on Russian gas and this was flagged, but onward we went on our merry way.</p>  <p>  We can acknowledge now that we are facing significant supply constraints and spiralling price inflation, but we might also look to our own actions relating to generating electricity capacity and distributive solutions over the years.  Despite much talk of offshore wind potential and wind energy generation, we are still awaiting the formation of the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, to assist in offshore wind licensing approvals.  This regulatory regime is needed to provide assurances to financial investment, primarily in future offshore wind development, and we are way behind where we said we would be with the development of this institution.</p>  <p>  In addition, opportunities to develop solar farm energy have been left in limbo up to now.  There are no specific regulations concerning them and no safeguards for those wishing to invest in the area, and there is a lot of difficulty arising from planning constraints.  We spoke about many farm sheds that have been identified for years and that, with the support of grant aid, could now generate solar electricity.  Instead, the Government has sat on its hands, having been repeatedly asked to provide funding to this area, while the funding and farm grants for this ran out almost two years ago without being properly replaced.  It was only in recent weeks the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage made solar arrays on roofs free of planning constraints, but accessing funding remains a key difficulty.</p>  <p>  We have heard much public discussion regarding the possibilities of anaerobic digestion and the production of biogas.  These eminently proven technologies have been implemented as part of energy mixes throughout the Continent for a number of years, yet we - the Government - remain agnostic to supporting these technologies.  We also continue to turn our back on any consideration of liquefied natural gas, of using the potential of the Kinsale gas line to import it from associated shipping or of examining the technology of sequestering gas within the existing closed wells.  Again, these technologies are being deployed elsewhere but, for some reason, our climate agenda cannot extend itself to them.  It seems we will not burn fossil fuels under any domestic technology development or enhancement, but we have no difficulty in buying generator capacity that will have to run on fossil fuels to provide the 450 MW of added energy security the Bill will entail.</p>  <p>I expect this Bill to pass largely because the country has no choice.  We cannot risk electricity brownouts or blackouts and all the difficulties that will bring to our population, industry and economy.  I have significant concerns regarding the trajectory of energy policy in this country, which encourages additional data centre development while at the same time taking knee-jerk reactions to offset the lack of action that Government could have and still can take to expedite additional indigenous electricity generation.  Like other colleagues, I will not oppose this legislation.  However, I believe we need to be doing, and can do, much more in terms of indigenous electrical generation.  I hope to see the Minister maybe becoming more activated to that extent.</p></speech>

I will read from a small bit from the speech delivered by the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth.  First, he told the D&aacute;il he would discuss the generation capacity shortfall that exists.  Welcome to the real world.  Second, he said, &quot;I will reaffirm the urgency of this Bill in order to enable delivery of emergency capacity to maintain a secure electricity supply for customers&quot;.  My goodness, what a mouthful.  Wakey, wakey.  Is this <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>?  Did the Minister finally wake up?  My goodness.</p><p>We were told by EirGrid two years ago that there were going to be power cuts.  Then, the Minister went on with his folly of closing down Lanesborough and many other peat stations.  That caused havoc in the midlands.  The Minister talks about just transition.  It was the most unjust transition I ever heard of in my life.  We are now spending money as if it were snuff at a wake.  We are spending hundreds of millions to buy aircraft engines to run emergency generators.  Did you ever in all your days hear the like of it?  I know people who bought generators a long time ago because they knew where the Minister was going by bringing them down a cul-de-sac.  Householders and businesspeople went to a lot of expense.  In fact, a person could not get a generator now if he or she wanted it.  The Minister is going to do this now but what is he going to run them on?  Will he run them on air or petrol?  What about altar boys' wine?  The Minister is going to run them on fossil fuels.  Imagine that: the fossil fuels he has such hatred towards.  The sooner the Minister is removed from this position, the better.  The people will have their say.  The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will not say anything because they have cobbled up the Government.  The people will ultimately have their say, however, and I hope it will not be too long.</p><p>I will ask the Minister again.  I have already asked him twice.  We met<b></b>Mag Mell Energy today in the audiovisual room, which gave a briefing for anybody who wanted to come.  Did any of the Minister's party come?  Not at all.  They knew their questions would be answered by experts who knew the facts.  They did not have to refer to a notebook or mobile telephone to look at this and tell the Minister the folly.</p><p>The Kinsale gas pipeline is lying empty in perfect condition off the Acting Chairman's county.  The proposal under the closing down of the pipeline involves a situation where concrete must be poured into the pipe to render it useless.  I want the Minister to answer this question.  Is he going to go ahead with that act of vandalism, State terrorism and national sabotage?  Is he going to allow that to happen?  I want him to answer that tonight above anything else.  Will he please answer that?  Will he get ready-mix concrete and pour it into that pipeline?  He could not possibly do this because if he did, the men in white coats would be here.</p></speech>

God only knows what he wants.  The Government Deputies themselves certainly do not know.  Every day since the Government closed down Bord na M&oacute;na, the cost of electricity has gone up.  The Government has sabotaged the country.  It has left the people not sure whether they will have electricity despite the savage bills they are paying.  Old women are afraid to boil the kettle at present because they are afraid they will cause a strain on the electricity grid.</p>  <p>  Like Deputy Mattie McGrath said, the Government is thinking about pouring concrete into the pipeline at Kinsale.  We will need gas for many years.  The wind does not blow all the time.  No matter how many more turbines are put up, the wind does not blow all the time.  We will need gas into the medium to long-term future because the Government will not even keep the turf generation stations it closed down.  The Minister talks about just transition.  There was no just transition.  The Minister closed those stations down the minute he got power.</p>  <p>  It was a sad day for the people of the country when the Minister became part of the Government.  I have no bother in the world in telling him this because he has blackguarded the people with the way he is carrying on, charging them any amount for electricity and talking about coming back with a windfall tax.  Where is the regulator?  Why does it not control what companies are charging?  Now, we hear the Minister is going to bring jet engines, something he knows an awful lot about, of course.  They are not going to be running on fossil fuels at all but aviation fuel.  What are the emissions going to be out of that?</p>  <p>  Does the Minister realise that, back in the 1930s or 1920s, the one ambition of &Eacute;amon de Valera and the first Taoiseach was to be self-sufficient.  Where are we now?  We have our fingers stuck inside every other fellow's mouth all over the world.  Even as late as last year, we were buying coal from Putin to keep Moneypoint power station going and the Government thought people would not find out.  That is what they are doing, however.  The Government has no respect or regard for the people it is representing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.345" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="18:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600060#NNN00500"><p>I was horrified to read that if Ireland had any difficulty with the pipeline off Moffat in Scotland, our gas would be gone within 20 minutes.  Did the Minister hear that?  If there was any problem with that pipeline, our gas would be gone within 20 minutes.  If our gas was reduced by as little as 20%, and if the wind did not blow on the same day, we would have to switch our electricity to diesel, which would mean we would only have enough fuel in the country to run the generators and no fuel to run our transport network.  Did the Minister hear that?  There would be no fuel to run the transport network if there is an issue with the pipeline.</p>  <p>  Some 60% of our rural homes are run on a fossil fuel known as kerosene or, as people call it, home heating oil.  They have no alternatives at present.  Twelve months ago, kerosene was 70 cent per litre.  Now, it is &euro;1.40 or &euro;1.50.  A woman told me today her family is not turning on the heating at the moment.  Her family is coming home for Christmas and they are saving the oil so they will have the house warm for their family and their grandchildren.  It is not even November yet and this is what they are doing.</p>  <p>  What has the Minister done during his term?  He closed down Bord na M&oacute;na and our peat plants.  Now, we are going to pour concrete into the pipeline off Kinsale to make sure we have no alternatives in this country.  The Minister said, "I will tell you what I am going to do.  I am going to buy jet engines to run the electricity power in this country."  If those jet engines run on gas, we would have enough to keep this country going for 12 months from the gas that is coming out of the Minister's mouth.  He is an absolute disgrace and so out of touch.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="18:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600060#NNN00600"><p>The proposals here today are quite shocking, to be quite honest with the Minister.  As far as I can see, some of these generators are going to be run on fossil fuels, apparently railroading all planning guidelines, waiving pre-legislative scrutiny and guillotining the debate.  These are the most important values in any democracy.  We must give the people the right to speak.</p>  <p> The opportunities this country has are phenomenal.  We are surrounded by sea and wind.  We have fabulous opportunities with the floating LNG terminal off County Cork.  That strong possibility was put before the Minister.  Obviously, loads of proposals are put before him.  Representatives from a company called Mag Mell Energy gave a briefing in the audiovisual room today and more or less talked about the same thing, that is, a floating LNG terminal.  Certain Members had the honesty to come in, which I appreciate, but not one of them would not agree with the experts.  The experts were able to take their questions apart quite clearly even though most of them were asking questions they got from telephones or whatever.  Still, however, I appreciated that they did come in because we need to have a very strong debate going forward.</p>  <p>  We are totally dependent on the UK for gas in this country and even fracked gas, if we are being honest about it.</p> <p>Of course, that will not be said.  We could have our own clean liquified natural gas, LNG, here.  The Minister has refused continually to make moves on that.  Instead he has some kind of wild idea of bringing in generators run on fossil fuels.</p> <p> We have had little opportunity down through the years to invest in the future.  I was in Northern Ireland recently and saw so many farms with solar panels on their roofs.  It is quite a success in the UK.  Why have we not gone down that road ourselves?  Unfortunately, we left ourselves running behind.  There is talk now that the Government is going to pour ready-mix into the pipes in Kinsale.  That is an astonishing situation we find ourselves in.  If that is the case it will be an absolute disaster for this country, continuing on from many more disasters.</p> <p> The Government has not looked at the data centres.  There is a possibility there.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said, with Moffat in Scotland, all it takes is one thing to go wrong there and it will cease this country's operation.  We can look at Barryroe, and we have to look at these things going forward because we are importing everything.  We are quite happy, and there are a lot of Deputies shouting and roaring in this Chamber while knowing this is going on, but they are not willing to open their mouth about it.  When we decide to see if we can source our own little bit of fuel to make sure we are energy independent, there was not a word about it.  What we will now have is a load of generators set up all over the place and run on diesel engines.  The man who mentioned the white coats was talking right here in the D&aacute;il a while ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="18:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600061#OOO00200"><p>The challenge for Ireland's energy security is in the present, not the future.  That is where we find ourselves this evening.  I agree with what was said at the beginning of this debate.  We need short-term, immediate measures to help guarantee energy security.  The Minister is proposing one of those measures here this evening.  That is to exempt the provision of emergency generation of 450 MW of electricity from the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 for designated developments and to exempt it from the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive which covers assessments of the effects of these developments on the environment and on the development of habitats.  In place of these provisions we are being asked to substitute ministerial approval.</p>  <p>  The habitats and EIA directives were the source of much of my work in the European Parliament and I never expected to be voting for legislation that would disapply the requirements of these directives.  In politics, I suppose, nothing should surprise us.  In that context, has the Minister already communicated his intentions to the Commission and has there been any response?  I am pleased the Minister is dealing with this matter with the necessary haste.  Of course it can legitimately be said that such emergency legislation would not be needed if Government policy over the past decade had ensured sufficient energy supply be generated for our own needs, particularly in the context of the number of data centres that were given planning without ensuring they could supply their own energy needs.  That is a most legitimate criticism.  Equally, nobody could have predicted Putin's invasion of Ukraine and the cutting off of Russian gas supply to Europe.  Russia supplies 40% of the gas to Europe.  What we are seeing is Ireland's inadequate future planning for energy security and supply since 2000 being compounded by a poor EU decision some time back to rely on Russian gas.  Another factor is the illegal invasion of Ukraine and the destruction of its energy infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In any emergency legislation it is important that certain checks and balances are introduced.  While I have tabled no amendments myself, I believe the Labour Party amendment would go a long way towards achieving them and I ask the Minister to consider accepting it.  The Bill designates two locations, Shannonbridge and Tarbert.  Given that the Minister has the power to designate other locations, has he any earmarked or does he consider that this will not be necessary?</p>  <p>  I support this legislation because it is essential.  None of us here wants to do anything that might contribute to blackouts.  However, I also want to say that because we are in the middle of this energy supply emergency, now is the time not just to put this emergency legislation in place but also to take emergency steps to help provide a more secure supply of energy in the short, medium and long term.  We have heard of the potential for offshore floating LNG terminals but the problem is there are only 37 of these floating terminals in the world.  How feasible and doable is it that we could manage one of those in the short term?  One Deputy after another has listed all the different actions we can take, but in the few seconds I have left I want to impress on the Minister the potential for anaerobic digestion and the production of biogas to help supply some of our energy needs.  I am asking the Minister why we are not pursuing the generation of electricity using anaerobic digesters.  It is small scale but would be ideally suited to generation at a co-operative level.  It is a win-win for the farmer and the environment.  I support the legislation but it is not sufficient to deal with our energy security needs.  I want to see the same commitment, speed and level of determination to ensure alternative supplies of energy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="18:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600061#OOO00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this.  I remember the song "Leaving on a Jet Plane" but now we are going to be using jet engines to try to keep the lights on.  We might not agree with everything the Minister is doing but I do not think there is a person in the country who wants to see the lights going out.  Any port in a storm, that is what we are left with at the moment.  It is ironic though, as was highlighted earlier, that under this emergency legislation the Minister can disapply the habitats directive and EIA regulations with his buddies in Europe.  They can do one thing one day but it was different two years ago when Bord na M&oacute;na had a court ruling under the same habitats directive.  We have raised it with the Minister many times that there is a massive amount of tree bark being exported that could be used for producing electricity in Shannonbridge and Lanesborough, but nothing is possible.  Then, when the Government wants to do something itself, everything is possible.  That is one thing that I just do not admire about this legislation.</p>  <p>  We have to come to reality.  We have followed nearly everything Europe has told us down through the years and we have become like the birds in the nest - we do not have anything.  We are reliant on the gas and on nearly every single commodity coming in.  We are told it might be dirty or it might be this or that.  Ironically enough, I am after reading on my phone in the past half hour that Germany is taking down a full farm of wind turbines and opening a coalmine under it.  That is fairly unusual for a country that is in the same Europe as we are.  We have to face up to realities in times of need and times of war.  We will need gas for a long time into the future.  We might not like an LNG terminal or putting the gas back down in Kinsale again, but we have to make sure we do that.  There are a few things we need for our country.  We must keep people warm, keep the lights on and keep food.  Those are the most basic necessities for anybody in any country.</p>  <p>  There is opportunity being lost as well.</p> <p>Farmers will move on the solar panels, which will be a huge help.  There needs to be a system whereby they will get paid for putting back into the grid.  They are well used to getting charged the opposite way.</p> <p> I understand there is &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million a year in the budget for the next three or four years for anaerobic digestion.  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong on this.  That would not build even one anaerobic digester because they cost &euro;8 million to &euro;12 million to build.  Again, we are relying on the private sector to act.  We will have to go through the whole planning process if they are to be located anywhere near a town, as I have seen happen time and again.</p> <p> I heard the Minister saying the other day that he is going to put pipes through Dublin and heating infrastructure here and there.  He would have to be a magician to get pipes into some parts of Dublin, given the number that are there already.  I do not know when that will happen.  To be frank about it, I think it is a dream.</p> <p> I cannot understand what is happening with the Derrybrien wind farm.  Senator McDowell, who is a former Attorney General, has spoken about this.  There are solutions that can be found to ensure it is put back up and running.  I have no problem with the Minister putting the jet engine in Shannonbridge but he should have looked at biomass being used in those places.  It would be a solution.  What we have to do now is bring bits together and have different ways of generating electricity to make sure we do not leave people with the lights out.</p> <p> I am fully behind the likes of offshore wind down the road but I think the Minister is going ahead of himself.  However, I may be wrong.  If offshore wind is the solution down the road, that is great.  People are talking about hydrogen and one would swear it was around the corner.  It is &euro;22 a litre for the hydrogen that is being put into the buses in Dublin at the moment.  You would want to be a millionaire to drive a vehicle that runs on hydrogen.  That is the price of it.  We are going to put in 17 l of it and it is pressure you put it in on because we do have the gear to fill the bus fully.  That is the reality.  It has to be done at night and it takes a long time.  When we consider all the things people are talking about, we need first to analyse what can be done and then how feasible it is.  The price of these buses, at &euro;800,000, is twice as dear as an ordinary diesel or electric bus, which costs &euro;400,000.  We need a bigger budget if we are going down that road.  I am not against it but I am saying you have to dance according to your music or the money you have in your pocket.</p></speech>

I was not here for the start of the debate, unfortunately, because I had another meeting.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, for opening the debate and I am happy to be here to respond and answer some of the queries that were raised.  We will return later this evening for Committee and Remaining Stages.</p>  <p>  Deputy Berry and others made the point that we should not be putting through legislation in such a manner whereby we are dealing with all Stages on the same day.  We do not want to do so and are doing it for only one reason, which is to keep the lights on next winter.  It is next winter we are talking about here.  If we do not deliver this legislation and sign the contracts for the delivery of the generators, which I expect EirGrid to do within the week, we will not have the time to put those generators in place.  They are needed because our auction system going back to 2019 did not deliver the quantity of power we know we will need.  It is a very clear, direct and immediate need.  We were not able to get those generators in the auction process for a variety of reasons.</p>  <p>  The former Secretary General to the Government, Mr. Dermot McCarthy, is reviewing some of the circumstances around that but, primarily, generators that had been contracted were not able to be delivered.  People know that happens in the world today.  A significant part of the generation was not able to be developed and delivered within the necessary planning timelines that exist.  That is primarily the reason we are engaged in this emergency purchase of generation of 450 MW, having already agreed previously to do 250 MW on a similar procurement basis and in a longer timeframe.  That will give us an additional 750 MW.  Next winter, on an emergency basis only and if all other power supplies have been fully exhausted, it will give us additional resources to ensure we keep the lights on.</p>  <p>  If we were not to pass this legislation, it is clear that applying the existing provisions in the planning system means we would not be able to start construction or deliver the turbines until after next winter.  Based on the analysis by EirGrid, next winter is when we will have a particularly tight pinch point.  We have one this winter as well.  There is no guarantee this winter in the event that certain conventional power plants become unavailable, there is a protracted cold spell or our import capacity from the UK interconnector is not available.  In a variety of circumstances, we could be in a tight situation.  We are introducing this Bill for the very good reason, and no other reason, that we want to keep power available to our people.</p>  <p>  Deputy Harkin, having been involved, as she says, in discussions on the habitats and other directives at the European Parliament, asked a valid question.  This is not about disapplying provisions but rather applying some of the provisions that allow for this process to be taken in exceptional circumstances.  It is not ignoring European law; it is the exact opposite.  It is applying one of the provisions within the directive to allow, as I said, for this planning approach to be taken in exceptional circumstances.</p></speech>

I first mentioned to the Commissioner earlier this year that we were aware we would have to take these sorts of measures to deliver the power the auction system did not deliver.  At every stage in the process, we kept the Commission informed.  The officials will meet tomorrow to discuss this.  As the Bill sets out in section 7(3), if the legislation is approved by the House and if we apply for the various measures, that is, if we are making a decision under subsections 7(1)(a) or 7(1)(c), then "the Minister shall give notice to the European Commission stating that the designated development is exempt from the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive".  This is being done under European law.</p>  <p>  We need to be clear on the legal context for this.  Our system is maintaining the market regulatory systems on which the EU insists.  To my mind, it is correct in so insisting.  There is a lot of discussion at the moment within the Council and elsewhere as to whether we should give up on all our market regulatory systems and move towards something different.  I do not believe we should.  The process we are following is set out in that European legal context.  It is the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, that has issued the direction to say we need this power.  In response to that, with the assistance of State financing and revenue that will come from the tariff of some &euro;40 per household, EirGrid will contract for the generators with the power generation companies.  EirGrid itself is a transmission grid company, not a generator.  It cannot go into the generation business.  It has discussed and negotiated with all power supply companies here and all potential generators.  We are open to all sites, to answer a question put by one of the speakers, and we have come up with two sites, Shannonbridge and Tarbert, which, for technical and other specific reasons, EirGrid sees as the optimal locations for this generation to be developed.  At all stages, we have done this in compliance with European law and in full view of the Commission and the other regulatory authorities, as required.</p>  <p>  To answer one of Deputy Berry's question, it is distillate, as I understand, that is used on these two sites.  The machines can also run on gas.  In the future, and I believe they will have a future value after the period of this exceptional measure, the approach of the CRU, EirGrid and the Government is that the generators will be sold back into the market.</p> <p>I believe "made whole" is the legal term.  That will include the potential refunding to the Irish public of some of the money spent on the original purchase.  I believe there will be a significant contribution there.  All the expert analysis of how we move to a high renewable zero-carbon energy system shows that backup is needed.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath said very astutely, sometimes the wind does not blow.  In those instances we need backup power supply.  As I understand it, the generators also have the capability to be switched to hydrogen fuel supplies, so they are future-proofed.  They will not be stranded afterwards, in my mind.</p> <p> Deputy Berry asked if what we are doing here is enough.  The answer is "No".  In this emergency process we are trying to close the gap that emerged because of a failed auction back in 2019, which only became apparent after a year and a half or so.  In my mind, we will need at least another 1.5 GW of backup gas-fired generation, as well as the additional solar battery storage, offshore and onshore wind, interconnection and other balancing supply, including pump storage and a whole range of other investments.  We need a whole variety of investments to be delivered.  We will also need additional gas generators.  They will come through the T-4 and T-3 auction systems, which are currently progressing.  We will have to continually review what those needs are.  Indeed, that is what the EirGrid capacity statement does.  We will have to respond because we are in a tight situation.  We have a lot of older plants that we need to shut down.  We have to shut down older fossil fuel plants, such as Tarbert and Moneypoint, which are at the end of their lives.  Therefore, we need a significant amount of new generation capacity.  That will come through the standardised auction system, and not this emergency procurement process.</p> <p> I am sure I have not answered many of the questions, but we will be able to come back and discuss the legislation in what I accept is a truncated timeframe.  We need this legislation in place.  As I said, the contracts will be signed within days.  That gives the board and the Minister the capability of actually delivering these measures next autumn.  We need them next autumn.  It is absolutely appropriate for the Government to act, which is what we did when we realised that there was a shortfall.  We have done that in procuring the 250 MW, engaging in this emergency purchase and making sure we can deliver it in time, which this legislation allows us to do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="19:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600063#QQQ00600"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 3, line 20, to delete &ldquo;2023&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2024&rdquo;.  </blockquote>  <p>The eviction ban, or the deferment of termination dates for certain tenancies, to be more accurate, is a belated concession on the part of the Government to the long-standing demand of many of us here in the Opposition that it should ban no-fault evictions at least for the duration of the housing emergency.  It should be noted that the D&aacute;il declared an emergency in housing, again, in response to pressure, most notably the Raise the Roof demonstration that happened in 2018.  A housing emergency was declared.  That housing emergency is very much still with us.  In fact, it has very considerably worsened, and the number of people being evicted into homelessness has increased.  It is our view, therefore, that a ban on people being evicted into homelessness when they have done nothing wrong should last at least until the housing emergency is over.  We think that is constitutionally sound.  It is the fact of an emergency that deals with any concerns that there might be about the constitutionality of such an eviction ban.  Just in the same way as unprecedented measures could be taken during the Covid emergency, the housing emergency is something all of us have accepted exists.  Therefore, extraordinary measures are justified, in my view.  I think any fair-minded person would say that the Constitution allows, in those circumstances, for action to be taken in the interests of the common good.</p><p>This amendment is proposing that as an absolute minimum, the ban on evictions should be for at least a year.  Indeed, we would say that beyond that it should be for the duration of any emergency, but for at least a year.  Otherwise, we are going to be back to where we were before the ban in the summer, starting at the end of March 2023, at the end of the emergency period in this legislation.  By June, any protections that it affords will be gone and evictions will restart.  The Government has helpfully identified the numbers that might be homeless just during this emergency period, which is well over 2,000 people.  That gives us an indication of the scale of the problem.  We think the ban should be longer.  We also think it should be more comprehensive.  I do not even know whether we will get to most of the amendments in the time that is available to us.  In fact, we will not get to most of them.</p><p>When this legislation was published last week, we and others immediately pointed out that it does not afford the protection from the possibility of eviction to all those who deserve that protection.  If you have already passed the date for the termination of your tenancy and you are overholding, this Bill will not protect you.  To cite one example, and I am sure others will cite their examples, there is a working couple in my area with two children, who passed the date for the termination of their tenancy on grounds of sale last Friday week.  They have nowhere to go from a house that the family has lived in since the 1950s.  They were born in the house, yet they are being evicted by a landlord who has multiple properties and they have nowhere to go.  They are trying everything.  They are over the income threshold so the council is humming and hawing about the possibility of buying the tenancy.  That is something that also needs to be addressed.  Just because you are over the threshold does not mean you do not face the prospect of being homeless.  The council should step in and secure this family's tenancy by buying that property.  At the very least, families like that, who are overholding - and there are many of them - should be protected by this ban and they are not.  I would like the Minister to respond to that and explain why that is the case.  </p> <p>Before anybody whispers to the Minister that we cannot have retrospective legislation or something of that sort, I remind him that he did just that during the Covid eviction ban.  Nobody could be evicted from their home, full stop.  It was not a matter of a deferment of termination dates.  Rather, nobody could be evicted.  There is absolutely no fairness or reason not to protect people who are overholding.  Most of the people who are overholding are doing so on the advice of the local housing department in any event.  Those people go to the local housing department and say they are being evicted on grounds of sale having done nothing wrong.  They ask for help and ask if there is social housing available, the answer to which is "No".  They are told they are over the threshold or will be waiting 20 years.  There is no emergency accommodation available.  There is nowhere for such people to go.  What does the council say?  It advises tenants to overhold their tenancy.  It happens informally but the Minister knows that is true.  It is happening in every local authority housing department.  Housing officials suggest that tenants overhold because something might become available in a few weeks or months.  That is what happens.  Those people should not be put in that position and the Bill should protect them.  That protection should last the full duration of the housing emergency.  The Government should use the intervening months to take the sort of measures that will mean we will not be hit with an avalanche of evictions next year.</p> <p> We have proposed many solutions to the Minister this evening.  We have encouraged the Government to buy up developer property on a bigger scale than we are doing now.  It should buy up properties where people are threatened with eviction.  I know others want to come in so I will finish on the following point.  People who are over the thresholds but are faced with the possibility of homelessness should also be protected.  Local authorities should be willing to step in and buy the properties in question.  They do not have to be eligible for social housing.  Someone who is over the threshold should be eligible for cost rental or affordable housing and, therefore, public funds should be available to purchase those houses as well.  That should be done to prevent more people ending up in homelessness or emergency situations.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.  Beyond that, I hope he will take up and respond to the points I have made about those who are not protected by this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="19:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600064#RRR00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  I will keep my comments brief because I want to ensure that everybody gets an opportunity to talk to as many of the amendments as possible.  As the Minister knows, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill but there are a number of small changes that he can make to it today and tomorrow or that he can consider immediately afterwards.</p>  <p>  My amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are a part of this group.  The particular problem with the section of the Schedule those amendments seek to change is that if someone receives a notice to quit following the introduction of the legislation but their tenancy is of such a length that they would get, say, 196 or 224 days' notice, they do not get any additional protection from the legislation.  I know from talking to the Minister's officials that there is a logic to that.  Those who have shorter tenancies and, therefore, might be more vulnerable because of an inability to secure alternative private rental are getting more protection.  There is logic and a rationale to that argument.  The problem, however, is that it will be difficult, given what has happened in the private rental sector, even for those with 196 or 224 days' notice, to find alternative private rental properties by the new deferred notice dates in the two Schedules I am seeking to amend.  That needs to be examined.  The Minister needs to try to ensure we are not back here in April, realising that, in fact, there was a group of people who did not get any additional protection to what currently exists under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  I urge the Minister to consider that point.</p>  <p>  In respect of Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendments, I also urge the Minister to consider some mechanism for those people whose due date falls before this legislation and, therefore, cannot be covered by it because it defers the due date, which has passed for those people.  Is there some other mechanism whereby when dealing with an overholding dispute case and someone whose due date falls before the passage of the legislation, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, can be given an additional level of discretion so where somebody genuinely cannot access emergency accommodation or alternative private rental, the board can give them at least some of the protections that are provided for those tenants whose due dates fall after the legislation?  I appreciate that is beyond the immediate scope of the narrowly defined Bill.  I had an amendment to that effect but it was ruled out of order.  However, something could be done in that respect.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister to remove the overcrowding exemption.  There is no requirement for it.  I am taking a liberty here because we may not get to these amendments.  The Minister's officials made it clear to us that this applies in only a small number of cases, and we appreciate that.  However, with respect to large families, particularly Travellers, Roma and some African nationalities, the Minister introduced a measure which we supported in August 2021.  He gave local authorities the opportunity to buy vacant four-bedroom homes because those large families, when they enter emergency accommodation, are the most difficult to move on.  The Minister is providing the overcrowding exemption from the delay, which would mean a landlord could move to evict such people at the worst possible time.  I see no reason for that exemption.  I do not believe any argument was made for including it in his discussions with his officials.  Perhaps it was more the case that no argument was made for not including it.  That also creates a loophole.  A small number of unscrupulous landlords may use that provision in the absence of, for example, a sale of property or other loophole.</p>  <p>  When the Minister introduced a Covid-19-related ban on evictions, he issued a circular to local authorities.  Local authority tenants get no protections from this Bill, nor do Travellers on local authority sites or other sites.  He issued at that time a good circular to local authorities to say that they should follow the spirit of the ban to ensure that local authority tenants in similar circumstances were not in any way affected.  I acknowledge the circumstances of this ban are slightly different but there needs to be some clarity and protection for local authority tenants and, in particular, for Travellers on local authority sites and on some unofficial sites on which local authorities may consider taking action over the emergency period.  If those people are forced into it, they are the ones who spend longest in emergency accommodation and whose cases are the most difficult.</p>  <p>  Those are the four areas about which I am appealing to the Minister.  Even if he is not going to accept our amendments, he can take action on those points today, tomorrow and in the coming days to give those people the protections that other tenants are securing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="19:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600064#RRR00300"><p>The Labour Party very much welcomes the fact that the Government is moving to introduce the winter eviction ban or at least the deferment of termination dates.  Many of us in opposition have been pressing for that for some time.  I also support the amendments put forward in this grouping.  At their most basic, what they seek to do is to ensure that an effective eviction ban will be in place for longer because the longer we can uphold the eviction ban legally and within the terms of the Constitution and the more we can limit the scope of any exemptions to it, the more households we can keep out of homelessness.  Given there are now more than 10,500 homeless individuals, of whom 3,000 are children, it is clearly long past time we sought to address the Government's failed policy of over-reliance on the private rental sector, which is the underlying cause of the housing crisis.  The Bill, while welcome, represents only a part of the overall package of measures needed to address the more long-term issues.</p>  <p>  Like my colleagues, I am conscious that we have a shortened time in which to debate these amendments.  The Labour Party has proposed amendments that seek to strengthen the protection for renters and limit the scope of exemptions to the eviction ban in the Bill.  I am conscious we may not get to those amendments and I will not speak for long on this group of amendments because I want to ensure there is time for contributions on all the amendments.  I support the amendments in this group.  We are all conscious of the need to abide by the terms of the Constitution but nobody thinks the homelessness and housing crises will be addressed in the immediate term and, therefore, it makes sense to extend the timeframe for the application of the legislation.  It would also give greater clarity to households and renters who are currently unclear about whether, and when, their notices to quit will take effect.  The day after the Government made the announcement of its intention to introduce this legislation, I received correspondence, as many of us did, from renters in my constituency telling me it would give them breathing space.  One renter told me that his family of three is facing a notice to quit that will take effect on 1 February.  That notice to quit has been issued.  He is hopeful that this legislation will provide him and his family with breathing space.  Even with income available to them to pay up to &euro;3,000 rent per month in the Dublin area, they simply cannot find any accommodation to rent.  I know the Simon Community and others have pointed out the lack of any accommodation available in the Dublin area.  There were 700 applications for one property my constituent sought to rent.</p> <p>As he said, it is Lotto odds to try to get accommodation to rent now in Dublin.  The Labour Party put forward the Residential Tenancies (Tenants Rights) Bill which would have addressed some of the issues here on a more long-term basis, in seeking to ensure greater security of tenure, that enhanced supports are available for those renting, and to limit the scope of exemptions to ensure that tenants cannot be evicted for spurious reasons.  The Minister did not oppose the Bill at that point and indicated that he would support some of the provisions in it.  I appeal to him again to ensure more protections for renters and ask that he would support us in moving this Bill forward further.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="19:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600065#SSS00200"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Social Democrats are supporting this Bill and the amendments in this group.  I have said to the Minister before that we really need to move away from these kinds of temporary and reactive measures in order to bring in long-term permanent reform into the private rental sector to give it stability.  There have been 21 legislative changes in the sector since 2009 with piecemeal reforms and this will be the 22nd.  That is not what we need to give the sector stability.  We need permanent reforms and changes.</p>  <p>  Let us be very clear, this legislation and what is happening in this country now simply would not happen in most European countries.  It is not possible in most of Europe for renters who are paying their rent, who are upholding their end of the tenancy agreement, are not engaged in antisocial behaviour, to have their tenancy ripped to shreds and their home life completely upturned and destroyed because a landlord wants to sell the property.  It is not possible.  Legislation like this could not be brought in because there is a permanent ban on such evictions.  That is a humane way of treating people and respecting their home life.  The fact is that the value of a property is not just created by the owner of that property, but is created by the community around it, together with the public services, public investment and the public infrastructure that this State and society puts in with regard to roads, water, community facilities and everything else.  The violence that is happening against people who are being evicted into homelessness now is not possible in most of Europe and should not be possible here.</p>  <p>  I completely welcome that this Bill will provide temporary relief to some people who need it.  Unfortunately there are others for whom it will not provide any protection and who will not benefit from this Bill.  We need, however, to have that long-term permanent reform which will actually change the dynamic where people pay their rent, have a home and do not have to have that constant worry of what is going to happen to them and their children if they get an eviction notice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="19:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600065#SSS00300"><p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Deputies for their contributions.  At the outset I also want to thank all of the Deputies for their support for this very important legislation which needs to come in expeditiously and urgently.  That is the reason for the truncated nature of the Committee and Remaining Stages, which the Members understand.  I need to get this legislation into the Seanad and into law.  I did not want to give too long a lead time in flagging it either because that could have other unintended consequences in signalling that something was happening, leading to a further flight.</p><p>There were a number of comments on a general basis and I will keep my remarks short, because I appreciate that people want to get to other amendments.  </p><p>We actually had a good debate this morning on housing policy, on the provision of social homes at a scale that we have not seen in decades, as well as on the need to increase supply.  The debate was also on the need to have a functioning private rental sector and to expand cost rental.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues brought forward that motion and I believe that the debate was a good one where we outlined the issues.  I am not going to replay that debate by referring to what we said already, which is that we know we are delivering more stock this year.  </p><p>I also want to address the notices to quit and the purchase of homes with tenants <i>in situ</i>who are HAP or RAS tenants.  I have instructed all 31 local authorities to activate that function, with full devolved powers for these local authorities.  They do not need to refer back to me for the purchase of those properties and I want them to do it.  Since July we have seen that ticking up quite extensively.  I will review that again early in the new year because it is a way of securing a home for people while we are building more social homes, with more people coming in and getting vacant social housing stock back into use.</p><p>I am also looking at measures we can take with larger properties and I inform Deputy Boyd Barrett that we try to pursue them where we can, to ensure that we are bringing that stock into use.  I am for social and public housing, and for affordable housing, but I also want to ensure that we afford protection in an unprecedented time right now, where there are pressures on our emergency accommodation, for reasons that all of us are aware of.  This ensures that we can give some breathing space while we expand those other programmes.  </p><p>On the extension of the period itself, and specifically in respect of amendment No. 1, in any measures I bring forward, I must be and am acutely aware of their legality and constitutionality.  I must also be aware of the impact that that could have on a private rental sector from which we are already seeing a substantial exit since 2016, as we were not providing the additional homes in that period, and in particular, social homes.  We are catching up on that but that is going to take some time.</p><p>I know that Members have seen some public commentary regarding this legislation, because they have a particular interest in it.  It has already been said by some that they intend to challenge it.  I need to fully ensure, therefore, that the legislation we pass as an Oireachtas is robust and will withstand any potential challenge.  That means that the measures we are taking have to be seen to be appropriate and proportionate for the time we are in right now.  That is not to say that one could go broader, but I understand what the Members are suggesting in the amendment in respect of an extension of the date.  Addressing Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, the last thing I want is that if we do something like that and have a situation where the legislation would be challenged, we would have an issue with the protections that we are trying to afford.</p><p>I will address amendment No. 1.  I will not speak to the rest of the amendments as they are grouped.  Should I speak to the rest of the amendments in this group, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle?</p></speech>

While I am dealing with the amendment specifically, I will also deal with some of the points that have been raised.  I will certainly look at a local authority circular, as raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I know, and the Deputy has acknowledged, that it is a different time and is a different measure we are taking.  I am already engaged, however, with our local authorities on how social housing tenants who may fall into arrears are dealt with.  This is by way of repayment plans and all of the various things we can use.  We have been very careful in that regard, indeed as we also have been with HAP tenancies.  If there is anything by way of further clarification, particularly in respect of our Traveller community, I will look at what instructions or a further circular we can issue.</p><p>Specifically on the extension of the date, I believe I have explained, to address Deputy Boyd Barrett, what my serious concern would be.  We would be open to potential challenge and we would also have an impact, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan has referred to, in another way in respect of the regulatory changes that have been made over a period of time.  This is not the only reason people are exiting but we also need a functioning private rental sector.  We need to ensure that what we do does not impact upon it. </p><p>I cannot accept amendment No. 1, nor amendments Nos. 11, 12, 13, 14 or 21, which propose to extend the duration of the winter emergency period and to push out the deferred termination dates which apply to relevant tenancy terminations affected by the Bill.</p><p>We made changes from 6 July of this year extending notice to quit periods for shorter tenancies and tenancies of less than three years, in particular.  These changes were accepted by the House.  Those changes have been made and we have good notice periods right the way through.  </p><p>No one wants a situation, and I certainly do not, where we know the impact the shrunken rental market is having and the difficulties that tenants are experiencing in securing further tenancies.  That is why we want to transfer people out of HAP tenancies, which we are doing.  In September, the last full month for which we have figures, 600 new HAP tenancies were created in that period with Pathfinder teams in place.  We are doing everything we can.  We are also ensuring that we are purchasing homes with tenants <i>in situ</i>where notices to quit are issued.  I am active on that question every single day of the week.  Where Deputies have instances where they believe that is not happening, or specific examples, I would ask them to bring them directly to me.</p> <p>Deputies from across the House have been doing that.  This is a relatively new initiative but we want to see it done.  As was outlined on Second Stage and as I have already said, so I will not repeat my arguments, the Bill is calibrated to balance the rights of the tenant and the property owner.  We cannot just disregard the rights of one in favour of the other.  That is not feasible.  Under this Bill, tenants facing notices of termination will receive protection to allow them to stay <i>in situ</i>over the winter emergency period, which will allow time for housing supply to increase.  I have also made changes with the local authorities in respect of retenanting, particularly with regard to shortening the retenanting period.  In some local authority areas, it takes too long to get some of that stock, and even new stock, into use and to get people into those homes.  I have seen that myself.  I have issued a directive to local authorities in that regard.  I want to put in place a new system that will speed up the process of doing up retenanted properties and of getting people into them and into new properties.  I have written to every local authority chief executive in the last two weeks on that specific issue and I addressed it with them in the housing summits I held the week before last.<br/><br/>Section 1 defines the winter emergency period as running from the date of the Bill's enactment, which I hope to be 1 November, to 31 March 2023.  As I have said, I cannot accept the amendment that proposes to push that out by a further year.  The Bill seeks to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants and the residential tenancies market itself during the coming winter months.  The increasing number of people experiencing homelessness and the significant number of new presentations in that space are combining to create significant difficulties in the provision of emergency accommodation.  That is for many reasons that we will all know and which were discussed earlier today.  As a result of migration due to the war in Ukraine and other people seeking international protection, there are immense pressures on emergency accommodation.  I do not want people to be in emergency accommodation for long periods and I am thankful that people are still exiting from it but we are entering into new contracts to provide further emergency accommodation while we increase our supply.  This Bill gives us a period of time, some breathing space, to allow for that.<br/><br/>I cannot accept amendments Nos. 11 to 14 either.  These also propose to push out the deferred termination dates.  The table in section 2(3) of the Bill sets out how the deferred dates of relevant tenancy terminations will operate.  These are staggered right up to 18 June 2023 to ensure there is no cliff edge at the end of the period, which would put unmanageable pressure on the private rental market and homelessness services.  We must do everything we can and redouble our efforts in this period of time to provide more properties in that space.  The timing also operates so as to provide proportionally greater protection to those tenants who have shorter termination periods, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to earlier.  The aim is to provide additional time to those most in need of extra time to secure alternative accommodation.  This legislation takes into account the very clear advice we received from the Attorney General and his office on enhancing those tenancy protections over the winter and carefully managing demand in the rental market after that period and right up to 18 June 2023.  <br/><br/>I fully understand and respect the thrust of the contributions that have been made and of the amendments, particularly Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment No. 1.  However, that amendment would present difficulties in respect of this legislation.  These protections are real and we need to get them in this week.  I thank Deputies and parties for their support for this legislation but I cannot accept amendment No. 1.</p></speech>

I heard the Irish Property Owners Association representatives humming and hawing on "Morning Ireland" when they were asked whether they were actually going to take legal action.  They did not sound to me like they were going to take action because they do not have a very solid base for doing so.  That is the truth.  The association could not challenge the measures taken during the Covid pandemic and there is a very sound basis for such measures now.  The Minister did not respond to this point but this House has declared an emergency.  Is the Minister is now going to stand up and say that emergency is over?  No serious person would because the housing emergency has got worse since everybody in this House, across the board, agreed that there was one.  I do not believe anyone is suggesting the housing emergency has receded since this House said there was one.  That is a basis on which to delimit property rights.  Some people do not understand that this is provided for in the existing Constitution.  Some want to bring such a provision into the Constitution but it is already there.  I mention that for the sake of some of the social media trolls out there.</p></speech>

The existing Constitution allows for a delimiting of the rights of private property holders in the interests of the common good.  That is what we did during the Covid pandemic, what the Minister has done with his very limited rent controls and so on and what he is doing here.  Given that this House has declared an emergency, there is a very sound basis for maintaining the ban on evictions until that emergency is over.  That is constitutionally sound.  I do not believe any judge would entertain an argument that this House does not have the right to declare an emergency and to say that emergency measures are therefore constitutionally justified.  I will just say that.</p>  <p>  We can deal with this on section 2, but the Minister did not comment on the people who are not covered under the Bill.  Perhaps we will get to that on section 2 but I am worried we will not get that far.  I refer to the people who are overholding, those who are already past their termination date.  Those people will not be protected which means they could potentially face being evicted over the winter period.  People whose termination dates have passed are every bit as deserving of the protections the Minister has accepted should apply for this period as others but they are not protected and could therefore be evicted.  That needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

Whether he likes it or not, we have to balance the rights and protections of the tenant and the rights of the property owner.  This is a very significant short-term intervention to provide needed protections.  I believe the balance has been struck correctly so that the legislation cannot be successfully challenged.  This is not a silver bullet.  There is no question of that.  We know that we are living in absolutely extraordinary times not just in Ireland, but all across Europe.  I do not want to replay the earlier debate on housing but, in this context, it is important to note that we are providing more social homes this year than we have in decades.  We are increasing housing supply again, providing affordable homes and bringing back vacant homes.  We need to do a lot more of that and I intend to do so.  This period of time gives us some breathing space in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned those who are above limits or thresholds.  I refer to people who are in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP, or in rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenancies, tenancies supported by the State.  Many people have been critical of the over-reliance on HAP over the years, as I was when I was on the other side of the Chamber.  It is not sustainable to have so many people dependent on HAP.</p> <p>That is why I have reduced the dependency on HAP over the last two years, since I have been Minister, and why we are increasing the building of permanent homes.  We need to do that.  I am open, where we can, to purchasing properties in order to bring them into public housing stock.  We have been doing that.</p> <p> While I do not want to delay as I know there are other amendments people want to get to, I would respectfully say to the Deputy that I have outlined the reasons I cannot accept the amendments in this grouping, and why I specifically cannot accept amendment No.1, which would extend the period of these further protections.  Let us remember what we have all done as an Oireachtas since July.  We have extended notice periods.  This is the sixth or seventh piece of tenancy legislation we have brought in to further protect tenants since this D&aacute;il came into being.  We have responded to pressures in that regard and where there are urgent situations like this.  I do not take initiatives like this lightly but we have to make sure they stand up, that they are constitutional and that they will not be challenged or overturned.  I would not underestimate the potential challenges.  Who knows?  I am not willing to gamble on that.  I want to bring in protections now that will see people through the winter period and will see many others right through to 18 June 2023.  I will not say any more than that because I know people have other amendments they want to get to.</p></speech>

I wish to speak in particular in support of the three amendments the Labour Party is putting forward, namely, amendments Nos. 3, 7 and 20.  We are also supporting the amendments from other colleagues.  The effect of our amendments would be to restrict the scope for no-fault evictions further.  Amendment No. 3 would place a higher burden on the landlord to prove that there is no other way to renovate the property.  We are conscious that the aim of this Bill is to ensure the scope of no-fault evictions will be limited beyond the temporary eviction ban.  There should also be further restrictions on no-fault evictions.  This is something we believe is essential in order to make the legislation more effective beyond the term in which the deferment is to take effect.</p><p>I listened carefully to what the Minister said.  I welcomed his comments about the tenant<i>in situ</i>scheme and the fact that he is looking to strengthen that.  We heard last week from the Taoiseach that 650 houses had been purchased or were in the process of being purchased under that scheme across the country.  Clearly that is still a very small number.  It is therefore important that the duration of the eviction ban is used not only to afford renters breathing space but, as the Minister said, to afford the Government breathing space within which to bring forward more innovative strategies to tackle homelessness and to prevent evictions.  Strengthening the tenant <i>in situ </i>scheme and strengthening the powers of local authorities to purchase properties are important measures to take during the duration of that eviction ban.  I hope that will be the case.  The Minister also said that the over-reliance on HAP and the private rental sector is not sustainable.  Last year, &euro;893 million, or nearly &euro;1 billion, was spent by the State on HAP.  I think that is the right figure, obtained by our housing spokesperson, Senator Rebecca Moynihan.  That is clearly not sustainable investment by the State.  It is simply paying private landlords.  It symptomises a broken housing sector when such a large amount of money is being spent with no real return on investment by the State, other than a temporary deferral of homelessness.  Renters are temporarily kept in rental properties rather than returning housing stock into State ownership.</p><p>The amendments we are putting forward, Nos. 3, 7 and 20, as well as the other amendments, seek to strengthen the protections for renters and restrict the scope for no-fault evictions and to ensure no-fault evictions will not be able to take place even beyond the duration of the eviction ban that this legislation is going to put in place.  Amendment No. 7, for example, would give effect to enhanced support for those in rent arrears, as recommended by Threshold, and would also limit evictions on the grounds of overcrowding.  As my colleague, Deputy Ged Nash, said on Second Stage, it is clearly not ideal for people to live in overcrowded accommodation but we have to recognise the context of the housing crisis, or the housing disaster as our President has described it, and ensure we limit as far as possible any of the grounds for eviction.  Beyond the temporary ban eviction, which is very welcome, and we welcome this Bill, we also want to strengthen protections for renters.  We want to ensure we will not see no-fault evictions taking place.  In other European countries, such evictions are heavily circumscribed.  We want similar protections for renters built into our legislation to ensure more long-term protections.</p></speech>

We were all expecting that there would be exemptions.  We have all made very clear that if somebody is wilfully not paying their rent, is damaging the property or engaging in antisocial behaviour, they should not get the protections other renters will get following the passage of this Bill.  Many of us were surprised when we saw that ground No. 2 in the table in section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act was included in the exemptions.  This afternoon, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, said this ground is hardly ever used.  He is correct in that.  It is a very rarely used provision.  However, if the landlord has not issued a notice to quit on the grounds of overcrowding prior to the enactment of this legislation, you would really have to ask why they would do so afterwards.  There are two consequences to this inclusion, which I think are unintended.  That is why I am urging the Minister to accept this amendment either now or when he has a second chance to consider it in the Seanad.  First, many of the families we are talking about are families with large numbers of children.  They would predominantly be Travellers, Roma or families from a number of African nationalities.  The Minister knows that if these families enter into emergency accommodation, they can spend three or four years there, or more.  Why would we put them in that set of circumstances at this point in time?</p>  <p>  Landlords who have a very limited volume of overcrowding in their property, who would otherwise have issued a notice to quit based on sale of the property or some other grounds but are not allowed do so, will now be permitted do evict under this provision, which is clearly not the Minister's intention.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, today made an unfortunate remark when he suggested that there was some link between this provision and fire safety.  That is not the case.  Wherever there is a fire safety risk to tenants in a property, that is a matter for the fire brigade and for fire safety enforcement, as the Minister well knows.  As the social housing waiting lists are so long and because families wait many years for their social housing allocation to come through, families will start off in a rental property of a particular size but may grow over a period of time.  Therefore, there is no need for the overcrowding exemption in this legislation.  If somebody allows a sublet contrary to what the tenancy agreement permits, that can be dealt with more generally.  I ask the Minister to please not put large families at risk of notices to quit over the winter period where there are no grounds for such notices to be issued in real terms.  I am urging the Minister to remove that reference in section 2 of the Bill.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 23 covers the main issues Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about with regard to removing the ground of a dwelling no longer being suitable to tenants' needs.  Having this as a ground for eviction, when in fact the worst thing that could probably happen in terms of the tenants' and renters' needs is for them to be evicted and potentially evicted into homelessness, does not make sense.  It certainly does not make sense given the intention of the Bill and what the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is seeking to do with it.</p>  <p>  On amendments Nos. 18 and 22, I touched on this in the previous round of amendments.  These amendments seek to remove the grounds of sale as a reason for renters to be evicted.  To be very clear, in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Romania, one cannot on these grounds evict renters who pay their rent.  All of these countries have functioning rental markets.  The landlords get their rent.  If they sell the property, the landlords get a fair price and a fair return, and the sky has not fallen down on the rental market there.  The difference is that renters get to stay in their homes they have contributed to and stay in the communities to which they have contributed.  I have met renters, as I am sure all Members have, who have been in place for 12, 16 or 20 years who have paid, through their rent, almost the entire mortgage - if not the full mortgage - and loan cost of the property in which they live.  That is some contribution to have made.  Then they get an eviction notice, which is completely unnecessary.  They have paid, in their rent, the cost of the repayments of that home, yet they are getting thrown out.  They have done everything right.  This is something that could be changed in our legislation.  It would simply bring us in line with all of those other European countries.  In fact, some of the European countries that are not on that list would have some ability to evict but it is under restricted circumstances.  That is all I ask for in this amendment to bring us in line with most European countries and to have a bit of human decency in respecting renters who pay their rents and respecting it being their home.</p></speech>

The Minister, however, has defined it as relating to the winter.  Why is it limited from November to March if it is not to do with the winter?  Clearly that is the basis on which the Minister has decided the period, which is completely arbitrary.  We would like it for longer and for the duration of the emergency.  Given that he has done that, it is clearly linked to the cost-of-living crisis in his mind, and rightly so.  People are oppressed with extortionate cost-of-living increases and, therefore, somebody who might fall behind with the rent because he or she is having difficulty paying the extortionate increases in the cost of living, the cost of heating, and the cost of electricity, might be evicted.  It is a different matter if it is wilful non-payment of rent but in the situation I describe it is somebody who is just falling behind in the payment of rent.  The legislation should not allow for somebody to be evicted in those circumstances.</p>  <p>  On the overcrowding issues, again it is self-evident, as other Members have underlined.  It makes even less sense to evict people who are in overcrowded circumstances.  I am sure that they do not want to be in overcrowded circumstances but almost invariably people are in overcrowded situations because they cannot find anywhere else affordable to live.  It hardly seems a reasonable option to then say, "I can evict you because there are too many of you in the house."  So, this appears to be okay and they are not afford the protections of the legislation.</p>  <p>  Finally, for reasons I cannot understand my amendment No. 2 was ruled out of order.  I asked and I am not sure if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows why either, frankly.  I do not see how it could be a charge on the Exchequer.  It was simply seeking to extend the protections of the Bill to those who have already been given termination dates.  How that could be a charge on the Exchequer is beyond me.  It is just a mystery.  I do not understand how it has been ruled out of order, but could the Minister please answer the question?  I have asked three times now.  What is he going to do for people who have already passed their termination date and are overholding?  Could he just answer the question?  Is he going to do anything or is he going to allow a situation where people could be evicted who have passed the termination date and are overholding but have nowhere to go, and who have done nothing wrong?  Deputy Callaghan has pointed out an example.  There is the couple that I had mentioned with their kids in my constituency.  They have lived in the house since the 1950s.  They were born there.  They have probably paid the value of that house twice or three times over, yet they are being evicted.  They have done nothing wrong.  On the next point, the Minister did not answer either.  He looked as though he was going to answer, for a minute, and then he veered off into something else.  They are a working family and, therefore, they are over the threshold for local authority housing.  The council will not entertain them for emergency accommodation, and it is not that they want to go to emergency accommodation.  The council will also not entertain them for social housing.  When such a family is over the threshold, would they be entertained for the purchase of the house to prevent them going into homelessness?  A purchase is what should happen.  What could the Minister do for a couple like that? Why do the provisions of the Bill not protect them against eviction even for the limited period it is doing for others?  I acknowledge that this may be beyond the scope of the Bill, but if we are going to use the intervening period to start buying houses, which we should do, can it not be limited just to people who are within the thresholds?  Can it also be for people who are above the threshold if they have nowhere else to go?</p></speech>

Building a house is less common in urban areas than in rural areas but these are people who built or bought a house and find that they are no longer living in the area.  Perhaps they had to move to another part of the country or leave the country temporarily.  If they are not living in them, we want those houses to be rented or sold to somebody else because we want as many houses as possible in use.  If those people cannot get their house back when they return to the country, or if there is any suggestion that they will not be able to take up occupation of the house again, then they simply will not rent it, regardless of what incentives are brought in such as increasing the amount for housing Ukrainian people, tax penalties or tax incentives, or vacant house levies, which are relatively paltry.</p>  <p>  If I had a vacant house, I would take my chances on the vacant house tax before I would rent it in circumstances where I thought I would not get it back.  The difficulty is that the Minister has removed, for this period, the option where a landlord can serve notice that he or she needs the house for his or her own use or for the use by a family member.  I am not talking about people who may have a huge portfolio of property; clearly that is an investment portfolio.  If I am wrong on this, I am happy to stand corrected if that is what the Minister is doing.  I do not believe that this will come to an end, unfortunately, and I did not believe that other restrictions would come to an end.  The problem is not going to go away by next March.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and I might disagree about some of the solutions, but I agree with him that the problem is not going to go away.  I do not believe that even the Minister thinks the problem is going to go away by next March.</p> <p>If it is proportionate to bring in these restrictions now, then there will be an argument that it is proportionate to extend them in March because if anything the problem will be even greater.  The Minister is saying he will not extend it beyond March.</p></speech>

The Minister could bring in an amendment Act through the Houses even faster than this was brought through.  There was a lot of talk about this for two weeks and then we are going through all Stages in a couple of hours, so the Minister could bring through amending legislation as well in a couple of hours.  I do not buy that argument.</p>  <p> It is important that people are not disincentivised to rent out their home if they need to move home.  That is what this does, in my view.  It is also not a provision that is of any benefit, that you can serve notice on somebody.  I appreciate it might be tightened up to cover people with a huge portfolio of five, 20 or 30 five homes which they buy as an investment fund.  It certainly does not apply to the international funds because they do not have a family member that will need the home and they will not need it for their own use.  If they argue they can avail of that, then it could be tightened.</p>  <p>  In circumstances where somebody has left another country to come back to Ireland, is looking forward to moving into their home or has a family member who is returning from another country and they have told them they will move into a home owned by the family on such a date, the Minister is now telling them they cannot.  I question whether he will be able to get that through the courts.  It will take much longer than six months to get it through the courts, and that might well be what the Minister is banking on.  Regardless of what happens with the courts, the Minister is disincentivising people from renting out their home in future in circumstances where they are an accidental landlord.  I ask him to look at the legislation and amendment in that context.</p></speech>

The only elevation, Deputy McNamara, is the success of this policy.  When I advocated it in this House a number of weeks ago, I said I thought we had reached the point where it would be possible to do it.  It is important for us to say there are legal constraints on this.  The points made by Deputies McNamara and Boyd Barrett outline the extent of the parameter.  Ultimately, we are siding with the most vulnerable here, in the case where we know it is not a zero-sum game.  We know there are knock-on effects on landlords and on the market.  We are desperately trying on every front in Housing for All to increase supply at every level with every tool.  This is one measure we are taking and we take it on the basis of siding with people who were going to face eviction over the winter in the context of all that is going on internationally and domestically.</p>  <p>  It is a balance but we should not ignore the fact that many of us in this House called for a right to housing to be inserted in the Constitution.  We do that so that we can make more macro interventions and more aggressive interventions in the market where the right to housing can be balanced against private property rights.  The Attorney General advised Government more would be possible in this space.  I look forward to the commission on housing bringing forward recommendations on the changes we could make to the Constitution to allow governments take stronger measures in housing.</p>  <p>  Opposition Deputies ignore the fact that when they call for a right to housing and also call for us to go further in this area, they are being hypocritical.  Those two concepts are not compatible.  Opposition Deputies want the right to housing inserted so we can go further but equally criticise us when we do not go further.  This is a balance and I think we are doing it in the right way.  </p></speech>

The briefing on the Bill states that section 2 provides that specific electricity generation projects can be designated developments for the purposes of the Bill and that these developments are to be located at Tarbert and Shannonbridge.</p> <p>Even the briefing note says that these developments will be located at two specific sites.  However, the Bill mentions those two sites and also refers to other sites.  There is no reason that needs to be expanded and that sort of blank cheque needs to be there.  I am asking the Government to remove that, not only to be more specific about this Bill but also because I do not believe that this general provision will comply with the EU's requirements.  The EU is very specific.  The guidance on Article 2(4) says that "exceptional cases" is interpreted narrowly by the EU and that exemptions should be applied on a case-by-case basis and would not allow, for example, for an exemption for an entire project category.  Not only is it intended that the Bill will apply to an entire project category but it is actually saying that it could happen at any site across the entire country.  I do not believe that is in compliance with the directive.  Not only do I believe that should be removed from environmental and good governance perspectives, but I also believe the EU will have issues with the broad definition of how the Government will apply this Bill.</p></speech>

I want to make a point about some of the other amendments in the grouping.  I support all of them, especially amendment No. 5 in the name of Deputy Bacik.  It does what a number of other amendments seek to do, namely to increase transparency, accountability, scrutiny and the assessment of the particular projects that are to be delivered.  I have tabled an amendment relating to a review and I notice that another amendment relates to assessing and identifying the climate impact of these projects.  These are entirely sensible, reasonable and practical proposals from the Opposition and I really believe the Minister should take them on board and act on them.  I am sure that in 30 minutes we will not get to all of them but I think the Minister should support them.</p></speech>

I would like to speak in support of amendment No. 1.  I indicated earlier that I would support it.  There is a lack of clarity with regard to how other sites might be deemed appropriate and what criteria might apply for deeming them appropriate.  I asked earlier that the Minister might give a reason for the clause referring to &quot;alternative appropriate sites&quot;.  I did not hear a compelling reason.  I want to support that amendment on behalf of the Labour Party.</p><p>I want to speak particularly to our own amendments within this grouping, amendments Nos. 4 and 5.  Amendment No. 5 is the substantive amendment.  I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke for expressing his party&rsquo;s support for it.  It is an amendment that we bring forward in a constructive spirit to ensure more democratic accountability for the provisions in the Bill.  I explained the rationale behind it earlier.  Clearly the central thrust of the Bill itself is to disapply the Planning and Development Acts and to substitute a ministerial approval process for the development on a temporary and emergency basis of electricity generation projects.  We understand that a roughly similar approach was adopted on a non-temporary basis under Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007 in relation to the construction of new prisons.  The key difference in that scheme was the requirement that resolutions would be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas as a final step in the approval process.  We have used that model and mechanism in proposing to insert a similar provision in section 7 of the Bill through our amendment No. 5, which provides:</p> <blockquote> 	If the Minister proposes to approve a designated development, whether subject to conditions or otherwise, he or she shall before doing so move a draft resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas ... </blockquote>  <p>This simply seeks to ensure more transparency is provided for in the process and there is democratic oversight of the ministerial approval process.  In no way does it seek to undermine the Minister&rsquo;s power to make an approval of this nature.  It simply seeks to ensure there is adequate scrutiny.  When we are debating Bills in such a truncated timeframe and on such an emergency basis, and given that this is the second emergency energy Bill we are being asked to debate and rush through this year, I think it is reasonable to require that there would be that level of democratic oversight within the provisions of this Bill.</p></speech>

On amendment No. 1, it has already been said that it looks like we are effectively tearing up the Planning and Development Act by pushing this and scrapping environmental impact assessments and habitat directives.  At the very least we need to be sure that this applies only to the existing suggested industrial power generation sites that are named here and that no blank cheque is given for the future.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 2 seeks to include in the Bill a provision clarifying that a project is "not likely to have significant effects on ... another state".  We are meant to signal to any bordering state anything that might affect it in terms of pollution or environmental impact, etc.  To simply remove that provision would go too far.  We are pushing a law too quickly to track any development and we are giving a blank cheque in saying that it is unlikely to harm the environment anywhere else.  That is why we are opposed to that.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 3 proposes to delete "or any other person" in section 4 of the Bill.  We have been told that this is being controlled and arranged by EirGrid and the sites mentioned are operated by SSE and ESB respectively.  This suggests that it may be under EirGrid's control or another company's control.  It is too open-ended, considering the ground-breaking nature of what we are doing in this legislation.  We are conferring on the Minister, EirGrid and SSE the right to pursue a development in a way that tears up the Planning and Development Act and its various checks and balances.  We do not want a clause as open-ended as this with regard to who may control it and use these generations.  It is a step too far.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="20:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600070#XXX00500"><p>First, I cannot accept amendment No. 1.  I understand the Deputies are concerned that the proposal may appear to be open-ended and as such could be used to approve other developments.  To be clear, what I am asking the House to approve is the delivery of up to 450 MW of electricity generation for installation by next winter.  That is considered an exceptional case for the purposes of Article 2(4) of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive.  The alternative assessments can be carried out by the State.</p>  <p>  The individual component developments, which themselves are the subject of a procurement procedure run by EirGrid on foot of the passing of the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022, will be the subject of a further assessment by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and approval by myself.  Therefore, the Oireachtas is not approving any development or granting a development consent.  There is an inextricable link between the preferred sites and the procurement process currently being concluded by EirGrid.  Given that this legislation is passing through the Houses while that process is concluding, it is only prudent that we would ensure it will not be necessary to go back to the House again with further emergency legislation in the event that an alternative site might be needed should that process not be concluded.  What is important here is that we have sites available to accommodate this temporary generation and that we can move on those sites in the quickest way possible.  The removal of the reference to "alternative appropriate sites" would unnecessarily restrict the application of the processes provided for in this Bill to the two named sites and would provide no back-up options for the State.  The sites brought forward would be the subject of further assessments and public consultation.  What is critical here is time.  I cannot concede to an amendment that would tie the State's hands to the detriment of its citizens.  I am satisfied that this approach is compliant with the EIA directive and have sought the Attorney General's advice in this regard during the preparation of the Bill.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.  </p> <p>I understand the intention of each of them.  With regard to amendment No. 2, I fear the Deputies may have misinterpreted the intention of the provision in section 5(3).  That provision is being inserted to confirm that no obligations arise in respect of transboundary impacts.  In effect, the Deputies in their proposal are concluding that the designated development is not likely to have a significant effect in this or another state.  It is in effect making conclusions in respect of the environmental impact assessment.  When it comes to the prospective sites, there are knowns and unknowns that should be assessed by the relevant competent authority.  We know, given the site locations, that impacts on other member states are not likely, and consequently the transboundary requirements can be considered early and satisfied.  With respect to effects internal to the State, we have provided for an assessment of those effects in the law as proposed.  By replacing subsection (3) with the conclusion as to the significance of the impacts, the Oireachtas would be supplanting the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la as provided for here, which would not be appropriate.</p> <p> I am not saying there will be significant environmental impacts on the receiving environment in the locations but rather that I wish the relevant competent authority would review the information presented to us and provide me with a reasoned opinion in advance of approving the proposed development.  This is not an unreasonable ask.  I ask the Deputies to consider the effect of their amendment, if approved, on the approvals process.  The formulation as proposed would not be appropriate, so I ask that the Deputies withdraw the amendment.  In the absence of that, we on the Government side cannot accept it.</p> <p> On amendment No. 3, I appreciate again the Deputies' intentions but cannot accept it for reasons related to flexibility and adaptability.  It would seem to be unnecessarily limiting to restrict the applicant to a particular class of person.  That said, and as explained before, the sites are known.  We know what needs to be done, and where.  While we have built some flexibility into the legislation, this is not unlimited.  It is directly related to other processes being undertaken further to the aforementioned EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022 and directions issued by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and me.  This is not a free-for-all; this is a targeted set of measures aimed at ensuring security of electricity supply for the winter of 2023-2024.  It is limited in scale by reference to the 450 MW, and it is limited in location as there are only a very limited number of sites that can technically accommodate the proposal.  The scope of any development to be carried out is limited also by section 8, and I cannot therefore accept the amendment.</p> <p> Amendments Nos. 4 and 5, in the name of Deputy Bacik, complement each other.  They relate to the insertion of an additional Oireachtas approval between the assessment of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the approval to be issued by the Minister.  I propose to reject these amendments as they would add an unnecessary step to the process that could delay the commencement of on-site works.  Amendment No. 4 requires a Minister to only approve the designated development further to an additional process set out in amendment No. 5.  That process requires the movement of a resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas, with additional reports and conditionality over and above what is set out in the legislation.  I reiterate that the purpose of the legislation being proposed is to remove unnecessary administrative steps so the relevant approvals can be issued as soon as may be possible.  There is already a process available to the Minister to approve a proposed development to address an emergency under section 181(2)(a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  I have done this already for a development at the North Wall power generation station.  What the Deputy is proposing goes beyond the existing provisions, and it would seem counter-productive to concede to such an amendment where time is of the essence.  The process I am proposing is shorter than the one already in the Statute Book.</p> <p> I want to address some of the potential concerns of the Deputy.  The proposed legislation requires me to arrange for an assessment of the proposed development in advance of approval.  This goes beyond the strict requirements of the environmental impact directive, whereby member states are required merely to consider whether an alternative form of assessment would be appropriate.  Therefore, an assessment will be carried out, although it may happen in a phased manner, something that is suggested in the commission guidance on this matter.  Moreover, I have included provisions to comply with the birds and habitats directive to ensure Ireland complies with its obligations under the two directives.  These are set out in section 6.  It is my intention to ensure there is public consultation on these assessments, which will allow for some of the public scrutiny the Deputy wants.</p> <p> I draw the Deputy's attention to section 7(1), under which I am required to take into account the assessments of the board and any conditions recommended by it when approving a development.  It is my intention to do just that.  In this regard, it would appear that the Deputy's proposal would not only add an unnecessary step to the process where time is of the essence but would also serve as a retrograde step in terms of powers already available to a Minister under the planning Acts.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

He referred us to section 7(1), but our concern in this regard is that a Minister is not required to take into account the assessments and conditions.  Rather, it states "The Minister may".  That is the basis for amendment No. 4, which would insert "Subject to subsection (2), the Minister may".  We felt the legislation could be strengthened to give another layer of scrutiny in the decision-making process.  We just want to ensure transparency within the process given that it is overriding normal processes in the interest of urgency and because there is an emergency.  We accept all that.  I take the Minister's point on public consultation and the sunset clause that we discussed on Second Stage but section 7(1) is somewhat weak and does not quite live up to the Minister's indication that the legislation ensures another layer of accountability within the process.</p></speech>

This is done having taken into account the assessments carried out by the board under section 5(2) and section 6(1).  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is independent in this.  It will carry out the assessment.  It has the independent inspectors.  If, according to section 7(1), it sets out conditions or recommendations, these would limit or affect what a Minister would consider doing in approving or refusing a development subject to conditions.  The ministerial powers are very much framed within the context of getting the assessment from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is appropriate.</p></speech>

Already, this Bill is giving a significant amount of leeway and power to the Minister and this is pushing it a bit, if the Minister does not mind me saying so.  What is happening is the Green Party and the Government are tearing up the Planning and Development Act and gutting the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act by trying to bring in this clause.  We want to see some constraints, even if they are nominal, to have regard to certain things that are effectively being cast aside in the rush to get these gas-fired generation plants through to keep the data centres humming.</p></speech>

I agree with her that the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act and the provisions therein for public bodies must be followed in a manner which is consistent with the latest climate action plan.  That is very important and I fully agree with it.  This particular legislative provision was inserted on the advice of the Attorney General in response to recent decisions that could have an impact on the delivery of this much-needed electricity generation infrastructure.  I was not willing to take the chance that this measure would be subject to legal challenge that would see it in judicial review proceedings or other mechanisms, which would mean we would not be able to deliver it in the necessary time.  While I have every intention of acting in a manner consistent with the climate action plan, I will do so in a practical way, having regard to the seriousness of the current situation and the compelling necessity to deliver these projects.  The proposed provisions merely provide clarity as to what will feed into that decision and, as I indicated, have been devised on the advice of the Attorney General to protect from further delays, which is the last thing we need.</p></speech>

It is important that we get some measurement of the CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from the temporary 450 MW emergency electricity generation plant.  A report should be provided as soon as practicable, detailing the actual CO<sub>2</sub>emissions for however many years they are produced.  The Minister will probably say this is unnecessary as all emissions must be counted, but we must count these emissions separately to determine exactly what damage we are doing as otherwise we are acting in a vacuum.  The emissions must be measured.  We need to know that they will not be part of the carbon trading scheme in the European Union.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.  It is a simple request for a report on the level of CO<sub>2</sub>emissions that will emanate from this extraordinary project.</p></speech>

My amendment is on the same theme.  As I mentioned, there is a need to measure emissions.  This Bill is emergency legislation introduced in exceptional circumstances.  There are significant risks associated with it and the opportunity for increased scrutiny, accountability and review is an important one that should be taken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-26a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="20:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022102600072#ZZZ02500"><p>I appreciate that there are concerns with respect to the impact on the environment, in particular on CO<sub>2</sub>emissions, but I consider the proposed amendment to be unnecessary and potentially restrictive given its construction.  I have provided sufficient latitude in the Bill on the timing of the alternative assessments that will be required, as it is likely, further to the guidance published by the Commission on Article 24 of the directive that the assessments will be carried out in a phased manner.  Consequently, it would be preferable not to require specific reports at specific times and to unnecessarily restrict the next steps of the process.  There will be environmental assessments and the impacts on air quality and climate will be assessed.</p><p>I note, however, that these units will only be used occasionally during times of peak demand coinciding with low wind and interconnector availability.  They are not expected to have a significant impact on carbon emissions.  In addition, the units are likely to be more efficient and to operate to a higher emissions standard than older fossil fuel generators in the system currently.  It is possible, therefore, that they may have a slightly positive benefit on carbon emissions when compared with the <i>status quo</i>, although that is something that must be assessed by the relevant competent authority.  While I consider the impact on climate and CO<sub>2</sub>emissions to be important considerations in any new development, the overriding interest in this case is served best by providing the greatest flexibility in the type and times of the assessments.  For this reason, I will be rejecting this amendment.</p><p>It is important to add that a low-carbon trajectory for electricity will require us to back up fossil fuel for the next decade and switch thereafter to hydrogen and zero-carbon gas systems.  Any accurate assessment of how we meet our renewables and climate targets shows that we need this sort of back-up power generation.  I believe it is fully in compliance with the climate plans and the emissions reductions trajectory on which we are set.</p></speech>
