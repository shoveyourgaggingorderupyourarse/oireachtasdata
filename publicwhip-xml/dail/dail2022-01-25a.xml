The Taoiseach will recall the election was brought about by the crisis in health.  It was an election in which workers and families, frustrated and fed up with repeated failures of successive Governments in housing and healthcare, voted for change in huge numbers.  Now, two years on and in the cold light of day, people see that these crises in housing and health have only gotten worse.  We have record rents, soaring house prices and 1 million people on treatment waiting lists, and if that was not enough, households struggle to keep up with the cost of living that is out of control.</p>  <p>  People are under huge pressure as they are hammered by non-stop price hikes in every area.  The living standard of workers and families is squeezed by the highest rate of inflation in 20 years and a lack of Government action.  For far too many people, being ourselves again means the stress and struggle of trying to keep up with soaring costs while wages stay the same.  The yearly cost of putting food on the table is to go up by nearly &euro;800.  The cost of running a car is to go up by an average of &euro;500.  Record rents are up by 8.1%.  Families are paying the equivalent of a second mortgage in childcare costs.  The cost of lighting and heating a home is up a massive 53%.  It is never ending.  All of this adds up to a cost of living that is unbearable.  The Government must urgently deliver a plan that gets these costs down, but this urgency is sorely absent.</p>  <p>  People have been hit with 35 energy price hikes in the past year and the Government has been far too slow to react.  The &euro;100 credit for energy bills comes very late.  The Government did not deal with this in the budget.  It refused to sit on this matter in December and now the &euro;100 credit will come into force only in March or April.  Costs are now so far out of control that this will not be a game changer for families paying thousands just to light and heat their homes.  It should be borne in mind that families pay these off-the-wall bills today and the benefit of the &euro;100 will likely be cancelled out as costs increase further.  Workers and families stretch themselves to make it to the end of the week and they deserve better than this slack response from Government.  They want they need real action.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; an costas maireacht&aacute;la imithe &oacute; smacht.  T&aacute; daoine cr&aacute;ite mar gheall ar an ard&uacute; m&oacute;r ar phraghsanna at&aacute; imithe &oacute; smacht.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am ag an Rialtas gn&iacute;omh a dh&eacute;anamh agus faoiseamh a thabhairt do dhaoine.  Does the Taoiseach accept that we need great urgency in dealing with this cost-of-living crisis?</p> <p>Does the Taoiseach accept that there needs to be a step change in the Government's approach?  Has he engaged with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities on this worsening crisis?  Has he directed the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to get the heads of energy companies around the table to devise solutions for hard-pressed customers?  Without Government action, things will get worse for families that are just keeping their heads above water.  This is a vicious cycle.  It is never-ending.  It is no way for our people to live or build a future.  The Taoiseach's lack of urgency cannot continue.  It is now time for Government to do its job and protect workers and families from being fleeced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-25a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012500004#B00200"><p>In her opening remarks, the Deputy made reference to the situation with regard to housing and health before raising the issue of the cost of living.  Without question, this Government has embarked on a step change in respect of housing through its Housing for All strategy.  There will be investment of more than &euro;4 billion per annum from the State alone in addition to private sector investment.  The largest social housing programme ever to be concluded will be under way in 2022.  There is affordable housing, the Land Development Agency legislation has been passed, and so on.  This will make a difference.  There have already been over 30,000 housing commencements to the end of 2021, with a higher outcomes expected for 2022.  We are making progress on housing but I acknowledge that there is a long way to go and that there are significant challenges.</p>  <p>  On health, the Deputy completely omitted any reference to the fact that our health service has stood up to a one in 100 years event, the Covid-19 pandemic.  This posed a great challenge to our health service.  We resourced our health service to an extraordinary degree to combat the challenges presented by Covid-19.  With regard to mortality and levels of illness, we actually did better than most countries across Europe.  The bottom line is that, without question, the pandemic had an impact on waiting lists.</p>  <p>  With regard to the cost of living, n&iacute;l aon amhras ach go bhfuil an costas maireacht&aacute;la ag dul in airde.  N&iacute;l an t&iacute;r seo freagrach as sin.  Is rud &eacute; at&aacute; ag tarl&uacute; ar fud an domhain, mar is eol don Teachta.  T&aacute; dl&uacute;thbhaint idir sin agus an polasa&iacute; at&aacute; ag an R&uacute;is &oacute; thaobh praghsanna g&aacute;is agus d&oacute;thain g&aacute;is a chur ar f&aacute;il.  Is &eacute; sin bun agus barr na faidhbe maidir leis an gcostas maireacht&aacute;la at&aacute; ann ar fud an domhain faoi l&aacute;thair.  That is to say, inflation has picked up across the world.  In her analysis, the Deputy ignored the global impact.  Almost all of these inflationary cycle issues have been occurring across the globe.  As the Deputy will know, Europe receives the majority of its gas supply from Russia.  Lower flows of gas from that country have been a major factor.  The current geopolitical tensions with regard to Ukraine could exacerbate that and make things even worse if there was to be any military incursion, with all of the consequences that would flow from that.</p>  <p>  In addition to that, there were supply chain issues relating to Covid.  These global supply chain issues also had an impact in increasing inflation.  The Government responded in the budget through the &euro;5 increase in the fuel allowance and the good social protection initiatives we introduced.  We also announced a tax package worth about &euro;520 million to assist people with their disposable income.  The welfare package was worth approximately &euro;558 million.  This year, 1.8 million working families will benefit from the tax package alone.  I note Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget did not include indexation of income tax bands and credits, which would have meant an increase in tax for workers across the board.</p>  <p>  With regard to another intervention we made, extending GP cover, the Vincentian model shows that this can often be very impactful for those on minimum incomes and for the disposable incomes of people more generally.  We introduced some targeted measures with regard to the social protection approach which will help people on low incomes in particular.</p>  <p>  The European Central Bank has said that this inflationary cycle is related to the pandemic.  That remains to be seen.</p> <p>The Government took a decision today, however, in respect of the legislation that will be required to give everyone a &euro;100-plus deduction from their electricity bills, which will help in addition to budgetary measures we took.</p></speech>

The proof of that is that house prices are up 14% and rents are up 8%.  The truth is that the Government has continued with the same approach.  Rather hearing an answer from the Taoiseach, he reached for excuses.  I am well aware of the international context and of the inflationary pressures.  By the way, the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland has made it clear that this is not a momentary phenomenon.  This is going to be with us for the next year.  I want the Taoiseach to listen to people.  I want him to listen to the experiences of families who are telling us and him that they are struggling to keep the lights on and to keep up with their bills and other costs.  I want him to make clear what his Government proposes to do about that.  They are introducing the &euro;100 relief for energy costs, but that comes very late and, in truth, it will not be sufficient.  I want to know what the Taoiseach will do in addition.  I have suggested that he and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, should act to ensure that there are solutions for customers and families struggling today.</p></speech>

We all know international factors are at play, but that is not the whole story.  It is the Taoiseach's job to deal with them international factors impacting families and workers in this country and with what is real.  The &euro;113.50 credit that has been announced is a joke.  It is tokenistic and is actually insulting.  Inflation is at a 20-year high of 5.5%.  Let that figure settle in, and its impact, especially the impact it will have over the next four to five months.</p>  <p>  The Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland yesterday described recent energy price increases as "spectacular".  I do not think the word was chosen lightly.  The December consumer price index, CPI, was published last week, and over the past 12 months electricity prices have gone up 22%, gas price by 30% and home heating oil by 50%.  This will add &euro;1,300, or more, to bills annually.  How many families can honestly absorb that?  </p>  <p>  Those higher prices are now also coming through in food bills.</p> <p>The prices of bread, milk and butter have gone up by 10% to 30%.  These are household staples.  Even pasta has gone up 5% in the past two months.  The day-to-day essentials that families rely on to feed themselves are also going up.  <i>The Irish Times</i>estimated yesterday that if a weekly shop climbed by &euro;15, it would cost households &euro;780 more a year.  Add on to that diesel prices and the cost of petrol.  This time last year a litre of diesel was &euro;1.20; now it is &euro;1.60.  Adding all of those together, we have a range of &euro;3,000 to &euro;4,000 extra for families.  How many families can absorb that?  This is the question the Taoiseach has to answer.<br/><br/>There is no point in coming back to me and saying it is all international factors.  I accept that a percentage of it is down to international factors.  The Taoiseach still has to deal with it, even if it is.  It is not an excuse we want; it is solutions.  What the Taoiseach has proposed is not going to have an impact.  The Government proposal on flexible working, which we do not believe is flexible enough, will ensure more people are commuting, spending on fuel and having to move into cities again.  This will lead to an increase in rents and the Government refuses to bring in a rent freeze.  It is not all about international factors.  They are a component but ultimately the people of Ireland need solutions from the Government one way or the other.  What are the Taoiseach's solutions?  Will he look at a rent freeze?  For some time we have pushed for a derogation on VAT.  The Taoiseach should not tell me the Government cannot do it because I know it can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-25a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012500006#D00200"><p>On the VAT issue, if we reduced VAT temporarily for a couple of months, ultimately we would create higher electricity prices because Ireland would lose its special derogation from the European Union and the rate of VAT on energy products in the new year would rise from 13.5% at present to the standard rate of 23%.  I have explained that to the House on a number of occasions but the Opposition keeps coming back suggesting things that cannot happen or that, if they did happen, would be damaging to the country.</p>  <p>  Let us go back to the Deputy's broader point.  I accept that he acknowledges the international factors.  The budget did target low-income families in terms of a range of measures.  There was not just the fuel allowance but also the increases in the qualified child payment, the living alone allowance and the income threshold for the working family payment.  The total cost of those targeted interventions was approximately &euro;146 million.  Some &euro;520 million was the cost of income tax changes and reductions, again to give families some degree of disposable income.  Today's measure will help 2.1 million households in respect of a &euro;100-plus reduction on electricity bills.  As I said earlier, we have also taken measures on childcare and in respect of the extension of the GP visit card to children up to eight years of age.  That will really help families in terms of disposable income.  </p>  <p>  I accept absolutely the Deputy's right to come in and seek further measures.  However, we have to avoid a wages spiral that would just create a further inflationary spiral.  We have to think intelligently as a country as to how we protect families and people in terms of the daily necessities of life-----</p></speech>

We have to engage with the social partners as well and work our way through this, and take further measures, if required, at the appropriate time to deal with what is happening and what is likely to happen for the remainder of 2022.  However, we must do so in a way that does not just add fuel to the inflationary cycle, which is in no one's interest and would only result in putting people through more hardship.</p>  <p>  Initially the ECB was of a view that this international increase in inflation was temporary.  I always said we would have to keep that under review.  It seems to me it could be a bit longer than we might have anticipated.  We are going to have to adjust, as we have adjusted so far in terms of budgetary policy.</p> <p>But we need to think our way through this in an intelligent way and not just reduce it to a sort of political sparring for the sake of it.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach keeps repeating that the Government cannot apply for a derogation but it can apply for a one-off derogation.  Of course it can.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spoke about inflation.  Workers have every right to look for pay increases to deal with inflation because the Government will not deal with it.  He cannot sit there and say that they should not.  They will, they can and they must because the Government will not deal with it.  They will need those wages to pay for these cost increases.  The Government does not have the will.  It needs to rethink that because the people who are watching and who will be getting bills this week, next week and the weeks and months after are looking to the Government.  If it does not come up with measures, they will suffer because this issue is not going away anytime soon.  It will go on for a significant time.</p></speech>

The Government will be up for that in terms of how to do that, but it has to be done in a manner that protects disposable incomes and enables people to be in a position to access the necessities of life in terms of food, shelter, fuel and all the basics.  That is why in the health area this year in the budget we increased eligibility for GP care from 6 years of age to 7.  That means a lot to families.  The drugs payment scheme, DPS, threshold is going from &euro;114 down to &euro;100.  There is free contraception for particular cohorts.  Children's hospital charges are being reduced.  There are mechanisms by which we can help people in terms of their everyday expenses, but we also had a tax package in the last budget of about &euro;520 million.  We also did social protection measures that were targeted.  We look at the Vincentian model, for example, as a mechanism.  There are ideas there that could help us to target whatever resources we have in the right direction.</p></speech>

We are only weeks away from the leaving certificate mocks, yet students still do not know what they are going to face this year.  They might be less than six months away from what will be one of the most stressful exams of their lives but they do not know what the Government is planning for them.</p>  <p>  Even in a normal year, more than half of students experience mental or physical health issues as a result of the leaving certificate, but this year's students have also had to deal with two years of disruption to their studies.  It is stressful enough already without the added fear of having to miss exams or lose out on a college place due to catching Covid in the middle of them.  Students have not even been able to have a traditional education.  They cannot be expected to sit a traditional leaving certificate.  It is way past time to give clarity to this year's students.</p>  <p>  It is not just about that, though.  It is time to scrap the Irish version of the squid games, namely, what we call the CAO points rat race.  It is not necessary and is based on an artificial scarcity of third level places and dog-eat-dog market competition.  It translates social inequality into education inequality, with those who can afford grinds and private education having a major head start.  The result is that 99% of young people living in Dublin 6 go on to higher education while only 16% of those from Dublin 10 do so.</p> <p> There is an alternative to this system.  We need to remove the barriers to education, open access to third level to all, and ensure there is a college place for everyone who wants one.  The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, has proposed open access to third level as the only fair and equitable alternative.  We agree.  What that means is a place in third level for everyone who wants one together with massively expanded apprenticeship schemes.  The CAO offers roughly 55,000 places for 80,000 applicants, so it means making another 25,000 places in first year available.  That can be done.  The staff, for example, are already there.  There are already 11,000 staff, primarily women, on short-term or part-time contracts who should immediately be offered full-time contracts.  All of this requires an immediate increase in investment, a scrapping of the fees and the provision of living grants.  We know that the wealth increase exists in this country to do it.</p> <p> First, will the Taoiseach please give clarity to this year's students as to what will happen?  Second, this time last year the Taoiseach himself said the leaving certificate was too inflexible and that we needed a new system.  Does he still believe that and, if he does, will he act now to abolish the points rat race?</p></speech>

This Government has been in office for one year and a half, not three years.  We had to deal with the leaving certificate last year.  Already there are differences between what we did last year and what we are doing now, or could do now.  For example, I remember that last year Deputy Murphy was robustly against historic profiling as a basis for standardisation of students' results.  A total of 25% of this year's leaving certificate cohort did not do the junior certificate.  As for the statisticians and those involved in this, we met the chief inspector yesterday evening.  I also met with the Secretary General along with the Minister for Education.  If Deputy Murphy wants to go for the accredited grades model, such a model this year would involve the use of historic profiling, and that is problematic.</p>  <p>  The Minister is meeting with the advisory group.  She has met with all the stakeholders collectively and is meeting with them bilaterally.  Let us not pretend to everybody that this is simple.  It has to be worked out for the benefit of students, ultimately, not just in the context of the leaving certificate but also in the context of progression to a variety of courses, be they apprenticeship, further education or third level.  We have a qualifications framework, and one of the benefits of that is that it puts the learner, not the institution, first.  There are opportunities this year and there will always be opportunities within the context of that qualifications framework for students to progress to FETAC, HETAC and right on to postgraduate education.  That is the key thing to remember.  The decisions the Minister has to arrive at, following consultation with the stakeholders, have to be about the overall best interests of the students, not just today but right through this year and next year.  There are challenges this year because 25% of this year's leaving certificate cohort do not have junior certificate results against which benchmarking can be done, and that needs to be put out there.  That is just a fact.</p>  <p>  In addition, we have one of the highest participation rates in third level education across Europe.  It is one of the benefits that has happened in this country over the past 50 years.  We have progressively increased second level completion rates, to our credit as a country, and we have very significantly increased third level participation rates.  It never gets said in this House but it remains a fact.  The idea that you just throw open the doors and say everybody can come in and we will provide high-quality, targeted higher education is illusory - deliberately so - not possible and not doable.  It is certainly not doable next June, and we need a dose of reality in respect of those kinds of proposals.  It is not fair to students to suggest that type of approach, which is just not possible.  I accept, however, the need for clarity, and that needs to happen quickly.  The Minister is very much possessed of that reality also and will bring this to a conclusion within the next week.</p></speech>

It is not.  We currently have open access to second level education.  Is that illusory?  No, it is not.  Everyone is able to go from first level education to second level education and we are able to provide it.  Could we say that absolutely everyone who wants to go to third level education can do so?  Could we do away with the huge mental health pressure on second level students of the leaving certificate?  Could we make the investment in education?  Could we unleash the potential of many of those who do not currently manage to get to third level education and the benefit to our society by doing so?  Absolutely, it could be done.  Would that benefit our society as a whole?  Absolutely.  Is it a choice by the Taoiseach's Government to ensure the billionaires who have 60% extra wealth get to increase their wealth year on year, instead of investing in the education of our young people?  That is a choice the Taoiseach's Government chooses to make.</p></speech>

That is where I would put the extra investment - into early childhood education and childcare, where the full development of the child can be realised much earlier and the potential of the child can be developed much earlier, irrespective of background or circumstances.  It is not all about going to college for the sake of it.  Looking at the first year results in some courses in some areas of third level, there is a high attrition rate.  It is not in anyone's interest for people to enter into a programme with high attrition rates.  We need to be sensible about this.</p>  <p>  One of the best things that has been happening in the past two years is the dramatic increase in apprenticeships.  You do not have to go to third level to do good quality apprenticeships.  They are happening.  Our role is to ensure there is as wide an availability of options for students as possible.  We should increase those options at second level.  That was one of my criticisms of second level.  The Minister for Education is committed to reforming the leaving certificate, not in some knee-jerk reactionary way as occasioned by Covid but rather in a more sensible and informed way in terms of the need for continuing assessment into the future and so on, and having more varied leaving certificate options for students.</p></speech>

However, for thousands of men, women and children, their homes, especially during lockdown and restrictions, have been places of daily terror.  In recent days, the Department of Justice has furnished Aont&uacute; with statistics on domestic violence.  There has been a dramatic increase in the level of domestic violence in every county in this State.  In my own county of Meath, for example, in 2021, 1,518 reports of domestic violence were made.  That is in stark contrast with 2019, which was pre-pandemic, when 1,217 such reports were made.  There was a 20% increase in those two years.  Each call to a helpline is a crisis in a person's life.</p>  <p>  The trend is replicated throughout the country.  According to Safe Ireland, there were 57,277 calls to its helplines in 2020.  There were 23,785 incidents reported to the Garda, of which 7,600 involved charges.  There were 4,000 breaches of protective orders in the same year.  Shockingly, 19 new women and three new children contacted the local services every day.  Those are incredible figures.  For every single woman who contacted the Garda, there were those who felt, for whatever reason, unable to pick up the phone.</p>  <p>  Domestic violence is getting worse in this State.  The Covid restrictions have played a significant part in that.  I have been told that with each new lockdown, there were significant spikes in the number of people who contacted those services.  According to the Council of Europe, Ireland has only one third of the refuge support accommodation that is necessary.  We currently have 144 such places in this State.  We should have 450.  There are nine counties in this State with no domestic violence accommodation whatsoever.  In counties such as Cavan and Monaghan, it is left to activists such as Councillor Sarah O'Reilly to fight for that accommodation.</p> <p>Because of the lack of spaces, it is estimated that 1,351 women did not get access to accommodation between March and August 2020.  It is a scandal.  It is happening at a time when people are rightly shocked at the level of violence there is against women in the State.  I have been told we need a &euro;9 million investment right now for increased service provision.  We need &euro;112 million right now for increased capital investment to build units where families can take refuge.  Will the Taoiseach guarantee that this year this funding will be made available?</p></speech>

The level and scale of domestic violence is shocking and unacceptable.  The funding will be provided to deal with it.  Tusla will soon publish its review of the provision of accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  This will assist in developing a plan to address the shortfall of adequate refuge provision and the building of centres.  The Minister for Justice, as we said last week, is bringing to a conclusion a national strategy to combat domestic violence, sexual violence and gender-based violence.  That should be ready by early March.  It will focus on prevention, protection, prosecution and co-ordinated policies.  The Minister will lead the policy and the development of services.</p>  <p>  We want to streamline the provision of centres in particular in terms of capital and current provision.  Zero tolerance for domestic violence is the object of the strategy.  This involves the provision, which I acknowledge is not there in some counties.  Under the Cabinet committee that I will chair we will follow through on meeting the objectives that have been set and that will emerge from the Tusla review, and in terms of making sure we can do it in a more streamlined, faster and more effective manner.  Resources will not be the issue in getting this developed.</p>  <p>  There will also be a strong legislative arm to this.  The Minister is creating a new criminal offence of stalking, which Senator Lisa Chambers has been progressing with others in the Seanad.  The Minister and Senator Chambers are working together on this and on non-fatal strangulation.  A new hate crime Bill will be published by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in the summer.  This will introduce new specific aggravated offences with enhanced penalties for crimes motivated by prejudice against certain characteristics, including gender.  The Minister will also publish a new sexual offences Bill involving many important changes.  The Minister will shortly sign an order to bring into operation the Criminal Procedure Act 2021, allowing for pretrial hearings that will reduce delays in the trial process that might re-traumatise victims.  I reassure the Deputy this is getting top priority from the Government and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

We can stack strategies to the ceiling of the D&aacute;il.  Will the Taoiseach commit to making sure that, on the day of the strategy being published, he will also publish the funding that will accompany the strategy?</p>  <p>  It is not just domestic violence that has received a spike.  Yesterday, I received information that there was an increase in the number of babies born with alcohol and drug addiction in the State.  Just before Christmas, I received information that 70,000 children were referred to Tusla last year.  This is more children than do the leaving certificate in a given year.  There has been a major spike with regard to the mental health of children.  The development of children with special needs has reversed over recent years.  Hospital waiting lists have ballooned.  Cancer diagnosis screening and treatment have collapsed.  On Friday, the Taoiseach mentioned the Government would conduct an investigation into the measures taken over the past two years with regard to restrictions.  Will the Taoiseach give us a date as to when that review or investigation will take place so we can learn from what happened over the past two years and make sure the damage that was done is not replicated?</p></speech>

First of all, significant additional funding has been provided this year through the Department of Justice and Tusla and funding to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in respect of all of the strands of the issue around domestic violence and addressing it.  Additional funding was provided this year but the strategy will outline and indicate the necessity for further funding, particularly in respect of the centres.  The resources will be provided to fulfil the targets and the commitments within the strategy itself.  I have always said that there has to be a full evaluation of how the country performed in respect of Covid-19.  We need to do further research, certainly, on the domestic violence implications that arose from Covid-19 and the lockdowns, in particular, and get a further evaluation.</p></speech>

The AA has now done a survey to say that we are one of the highest countries in the world for petrol and diesel prices.  We had over 32 increases last year.  The miserly &euro;100 that is promised for later on in the year, perhaps March or April, will not go anywhere near helping people.  The cost of everything, including groceries, is affected by the fuel that is needed for trucks, factories and everything else.  How will we recover our economy with this spiralling crisis?

It would be churlish of me not to recognise the sense of relief and excitement felt by many people.  Equally, many people have wondered what the context of this is, with a decision made outside of the D&aacute;il, with no discussion and with a cl&aacute;r oibre anseo gan Covid-19 luaite beag n&aacute; m&oacute;r.  I am asking for a full debate on the context of Covid-19 and on the lifting of restrictions.  We are all getting phone calls from nursing homes, for example, where people still cannot go in to visit their loved ones and where day centres are not operating.  None of this has been put in perspective in respect of when the indemnity with the pharmaceutical companies comes to an end, or in respect of the compensation scheme.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to answer now on all of these issues but I am asking for a full and frank discussion on an informed basis on the floor of the D&aacute;il this week or next week, or as soon as possible.</p></speech>

There may have been a few dragons in it in terms of the public health decision.  I believe that a D&aacute;il debate on this matter is a very good idea.  Perhaps it can be facilitated next week because we need a reflection and an analysis on people&rsquo;s inputs on the advices we received from NPHET on the decisions that we subsequently took as a Government, and on the broader position as we move out now in the next number of months with policies that we need to embed within our health service, and so on, in dealing with any further surges, iterations or new variants of concern.  I would be in favour of that.</p>  <p>  We had a discussion earlier on the issue of energy prices.  The legislation governing the rebate from electricity prices should be coming into the House next week.  Maybe that will give an opportunity on Second Stage for a debate on the issues that Deputy Mattie McGrath has raised.  That would make sense to me.</p></speech>

He will make an announcement this evening, but he is meeting with the group later this afternoon.  I do not wish to pre-empt that meeting or the Minister's decision.

What many want is to continue the flexible arrangements that were put in place.  With the flexibility over the last two years, statistically more women were in full-time employment than ever previously, moving from part-time work to full-time work.  This is an important factor in the Government's decision today.  The Government has outlined 13 reasons whereby employers or bosses still have the upper hand.  What has emerged from the Government does not take any account of the changed circumstances workers have had over the last two years.  The power is still with the bosses.  The idea that somebody can go to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, where there is a 15-month waiting time and no legal aid, is just a joke.  Will the Taoiseach not guarantee workers, particularly women who have benefited hugely from this statistically, a real right to flexible work and continued flexible work into the future?</p></speech>

While we laud ourselves as a country with high completion rates in mainstream education, as has just occurred in the debate between the Taoiseach and Deputy Paul Murphy, the fact is that many students are being left behind every year.  The DEIS retention rate for the leaving certificate is 84.8% compared to 91.5% nationally.  This has left alternative education providers and centres, such as the Cork Life Centre in the Taoiseach's constituency, to provide a second chance at education.  They have been doing this with great, but often unrecognised, success.  In 2018, the then Department of Education and Skills conducted a formal review of alternative education under action 88 of the DEIS plan.  It is still not published, although we know it has been completed.  That plan is with the Minister and the Department.  When will the review of alternative education be published?  We cannot move forward with strategies for a sustained future for alternative education without this report being released.</p></speech>

He seemed to indicate he was against the idea of workers submitting claims for pay increases that would be in line with inflation, leaving aside the fact that he did not seem to express the same concerns when Robert Watt got a pay increase of &euro;81,000.  It is one rule for the top people and another for ordinary working people.</p>  <p>  Let us look at the matter at hand.  We are told the consumer price index is up 5.5%, and that does not include many costs, including rent.  The real rate of inflation for working people is higher.  It seems that what the Taoiseach is saying in reality is that workers must accept a pay cut or suck it up and not put in for higher wage increases.

That is down to our scientists, many of whom were inspired to go into research through their engagement with Science Gallery Dublin.  Science Gallery Dublin has gone international, with offshoots ranging from the United States to Australia.  Next month, however, the original gallery here in Ireland is set to shut its doors for the last time, undermining our strategy as a country to position itself as a world leader in science and technology.  Reading between the lines, it seems the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media are in dispute as to which will contribute to the operational shortfall.  This short-sighted internal bickering must stop and the doors of the gallery must be kept open for Ireland's sake.</p></speech>

I want the Taoiseach to commit, please, and to tell me that he is going to act in accordance with what we have asked for in three separate motions over the past nine months.  The Government has accepted those motions on each occasion.  There might have been a nuanced difference, but that was all.

I spoke to the Taoiseach privately about this in the past, and I have spoken about it publicly here in the D&aacute;il.  At present, small villages outside the city of Cork, such as Dripsey, Farran and Berrings, have three, four or often five ASD classes.  Unfortunately, larger urban settlements in those areas sometimes have one or two such classes, if any at all.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when we are going to implement a policy that ensures every child in this country has the opportunity to attend an ASD class in their own locality?  At present, the ratio is 3:1 primary versus secondary school with regard to ASD class provision.  That is not sustainable, and we need urgent action.</p></speech>

The recent "Crimes and Confessions" series has shone a spotlight on the interrogation and investigation of innocent people by some members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na: people including Nicky Kelly, Osgur Breatnach, and the Hayes family in my own constituency.  We have heard allegations of bullying, assaults and torture.  We heard about statements that were tailored or, in the words of the Hayes family solicitor Mr. Patrick Mann, "dovetailed" to fit the information that they had.  I ask the Taoiseach to support an independent statutory public inquiry into the investigation and prosecution of these people, compliant with international human rights standards and under a recognised judicial figure.</p></speech>

He is now aged 35 and has progressive symptom of numbness and dragging his right foot.  He cannot drive a vehicle unless it is modified.  His appeal to the board was unsuccessful.  Naturally, he feels aggrieved and discriminated against.  Evidently, the board was correct in its assumption that people who are worthy are not being included in the scheme.  Given that almost 400 cases have to be heard, when will a new board be appointed?  Will the criteria be amended to include people such as Dwayne who need and deserve a primary medical certificate?</p></speech>

When a person receives a diagnosis of cancer, I humbly ask him, the Minister for Health and the Department of Health that for a three-month period an emergency medical card would be given to that person.  This was the case in the past.  It was not a law or a rule, but unofficially the diagnosis of cancer equalled a medical card for a period of time to allow the person and their family to come to grips with the enormity of what they were facing in their lives.  I think we should look at it again.</p>  <p>  At this time the message should go out from here to our hospitals to allow a proper phased reintroduction of visits to people who are suffering from illnesses like cancer in our hospitals because they desperately want their visitors to come in.  I would be very anxious for the Taoiseach to help.</p></speech>

There was no mention of nursing homes.  Residents in nursing homes have suffered disproportionately during the pandemic.  Will the Government issue specific instructions to nursing homes ensuring that our older people have appropriate access to family visits, as some nursing homes are still denying these?  We need clear guidelines to ensure that a balance between physical and mental health.  I note that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, are present.  If the Taoiseach cannot answer, perhaps they can.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-25a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012500017#P00400"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Education Act 1998 to grant additional functions to the Inspectorate to examine and report to the Minister on the prevalence and standard of individual educational plans for children with special educational needs on an annual basis; and to provide for related matters. </blockquote>  <p>I am sharing time with Deputies Guirke and &Oacute; Laoghaire.  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act was passed in 2004 to ensure that children with additional educational needs could be educated in an inclusive setting and that all children would have the right to be educated in a mainstream school unless it would not be in the best interest of the child or the effective provision of education for other children in mainstream education.  Yet 17 years later, many sections of the Act have not been implemented and one such section is the requirement for individual education plans, IEPs.  Under the Act each child assessed with a special educational need should have a personal education plan.  However, there is currently no date for the implementation of IEPs.  In many countries this is underpinned by law.  I am aware many teachers prepare IEPs for their students but that is not compulsory and not inspected.  There are guidelines on how to prepare a plan on the National Council for Special Education website.  They have been there since 2004 when it was fully expected that the Act would be implemented.</p><p>An IEP is a written document prepared for a named student and it specifies the learning goals that are to be achieved by the student over a set period of time, as well as the teaching strategies, resources and supports necessary to achieve those goals.  This should be prepared by the school in consultation with the student, if possible, and with the parents and other stakeholders such as a therapist the student may be attending.  This Bill asks that this section of the EPSEN Act be implemented as soon as possible.  We seek to amend the Education Act 1998 to grant additional functions to the inspectorate, to examine and report to the Minister on the prevalence and standard of IEPs for children with special educational needs annually, and to provide for related matters.</p></speech>

Almost 17 years later, we still do not have dates for when the implementation of the section relating to IEPs for children with disabilities will be implemented and made compulsory.  In many schools where it has been implemented, it provides teachers and parents with the opportunity to have a practical and realistic dialogue about the student's needs and to develop creative ways to meet those needs.  The IEP directs the student with special educational needs on his or her school journey.  It also allows for a certain amount of structure that is essential to the students' families and educators who are dealing with learning disabilities.</p>  <p>  Students know what to expect from their programme each day, how they will be taught and what milestones they should reach.  If implemented, it would also help the individual in a post-secondary school context in the forms of training, employment, independent living skills and so on.  We all know that students with special educational needs should be placed in the least restrictive environment, thus keeping them involved with general education and letting them prosper.  We should not have to wait any longer for this part of the Act to be implemented and help these students to reach their full potential.</p></speech>

He was the Minister at the time.  With its signing into law came great hope for children with special educational needs and their families.  It contained many useful provisions but the reality is that in 2022 we are still waiting for the Act to be fully implemented.  Children born in 2004 will turn 18 this year.  Some of the supports they might have expected during their lifetime in school they will now not receive and they will have finished in the education system.  It is a failure of the political system.</p>  <p>  One of the key provisions that was not implemented relates to individual education plans.  These play a vitally important role.  They are being provided by many schools but there is no obligation on them.  It is not mandatory and many schools do not provide them.  The other element of this is that the quality of such plans varies significantly, as do the standards involved.  It is a vitally important tool in these children's progression, in transition, and in being able to tailor their educational needs and the plans that are necessary over their lifetime.</p>  <p>  The Government has a long way to go to heal the relationships between families of children with special educational needs in the State.  When I speak to them it is always the case that they have to argue and fight for everything.  They have to fight for an IEP as things stand; they have to fight for an assessment of need; and they have to fight for an adequate school place.  Everything is a fight.  Everything is a battle.</p>  <p>  I urge the Government to support this Bill to provide children with special educational needs with a thorough and timely individual education plan and to go some say to healing these relationships and to make that uphill battle for educational resources a thing of the past.</p></speech>

The experience of the past number of years has brought home the importance of work in the area of risk management and preparedness.  By promoting an open and inclusive discussion on the major risks facing the country, the national risk assessment plays an important role in this work.  A draft national risk assessment was published in July last year for public consultation thus providing opportunities for stakeholders and Oireachtas Members to contribute to the development of the report.</p>  <p>  More than 50 organisations, public representatives and individuals participated in the consultation process.  The final version was published by the Government in early December.  Climate change, biodiversity loss, and social and economic inequality emerged as the most significant concerns highlighted in the submissions received, and risks across each of these areas are captured in the final report.  Many of the risks included in the report had been identified in previous assessments, however, there are a number of new risks related to Covid-19 and a number of other previously identified risks have evolved significantly.  For example, new risks identified in the report include inflation, economic scarring and digital exclusion.  The combination of the pandemic, Brexit and supply-chain constraints have also exacerbated previously identified risks, including skills shortages and the supply and affordability of housing.  This is at the same time as major risks, in particular climate change, are taking on even greater importance.</p>  <p>   The national risk assessment also references emerging international views on lessons for risk governance from the Covid-19 experience, in particular an emphasis at EU level on improving resilience.  There will be scope in the months ahead for further consideration of lessons learned for risk management.  It is important to note that the national risk assessment is just one element of the overall system of preparedness and resilience planning for Ireland and is not intended to replicate or displace the detailed risk management and preparedness carried out across Departments and Government agencies.</p> <p>However, it is an important opportunity to reflect on strategic risks facing the country in the years ahead.</p></reply>

Has the Government quantified the cost of the cyberattack economically and, more importantly, in terms of health and fatalities in our hospital system?  For example, is the number of appointments that were cancelled known?  Have the delays in the delivery of health services been quantified?  Before the attack, the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, was funded to the tune of &euro;5 million.  To put that in context, the Taoiseach's Department spent three times that amount on PR during that period.  As a result of the queue of crises that have developed in the State over recent years, the D&aacute;il has taken its eyes off this particular crisis.  It is really important that an update be provided on the damage that was done and the steps taken by the Government to make sure such a thing does not happen again.</p></speech>

There is also an issue here in our own territorial waters regarding the activities of Russian submarines and the manoeuvres of the Russian military.  I listened quite intently to Mr. Patrick Murphy, CEO of the Irish South and West Fish Producer's Organisation.  I spoke to him before I came into the D&aacute;il today.  This could have serious consequences for the environment, for fish stocks, including stocks of tuna and blue whiting and, possibly, for our communications cables.  As the Taoiseach knows, this group is going to take a flotilla of boats out to the waters where they fish next month when the Russian manoeuvres are under way.  As Mr. Murphy put it, this is their farm.  Will the Taoiseach update the House on any communications he has had with the Russian embassy?  Even though it is down four ships, will he send the Irish Naval Service to accompany the group that is going out to fish in these waters while the Russian manoeuvres are taking place?</p></speech>

To what extent are the Taoiseach and his Department continuing to identify the best way to offset any negative impacts now emerging?  The supply of fuel, an issue that has already engaged the House today, is obviously a very pressing issue and one that is becoming more important as time goes by.  Is sufficient provision being made to provide alternative energy from this country's own resources and capabilities?  What is being done to determine the availability of such energy resources at an earlier stage and to address issues in respect of offshore and onshore electricity generation?</p></speech>

Ministers argued that this was due to the power of the virus, but this was only partly true.  It was also down to the weakness of our public health service infrastructure.  There were not enough beds, including ICU beds, and there were not enough staff.  We got through it thanks to the heroic efforts of the health staff but we were also lucky.  The result of this was that society was locked down for considerably longer than would otherwise have been necessary.  Another result is that the Government ended up paying money to private hospitals for bed capacity, amounting to &euro;115 million at the pinch points.  I put it to the Taoiseach that, if we are to learn the lessons of the pandemic to date, two key changes need to be made.  The first is that the public health service needs to be significantly expanded, with particular attention paid to bed capacity, ICU capacity and staffing levels.  We also need a single-tier public health service.  We need to nationalise private hospitals and integrate them into a fully public health system.</p></speech>

It is beyond question that, when a public health emergency hits, it is already too late.  I commend those who work on the front line in that system.  Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, we had the longest waiting lists in the EU.  We had a series of some of the longest and strictest lockdowns because we had so little spare capacity in the health system.  Today, more than 800,000 people are on some form of waiting list.  This includes 96,000 children.  Last week, when the end of Covid restrictions was announced, six ambulances were lined up in front of Mayo University Hospital.  Some of those patients had already waited five hours for an ambulance.  We just do not have the capacity required.  It is an enormous risk.  I spoke to a woman last week who had been urgently referred to the breast clinic by her GP.  Despite this, she was told she would have to wait three months.  This also presents an enormous risk.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that healthcare capacity will be front and centre in our risk assessment?</p></speech>

Every winter, 1,500 to 2,000 people, most of whom are elderly and less well off, die as a result of the impact of winter, the cost of heating and so on.  That situation will get exponentially worse in light of the current price hikes.  I again ask whether the Taoiseach will use the powers available to him under the Consumer Protection Act 2007 to control the price of energy, including electricity and heat, and to expand the financial assistance available through the fuel allowance to cover more households.  Of course, there is an international context to this matter but this country lining up with NATO in a conflict between it and Russia is not a very sensible strategy to address that wider international context.</p></speech>

The question for now is how not to waste the breathing space we have been afforded.  We should use that space to make our society more Covid-resilient and pandemic-resilient rather than just forgetting about it all.  The question for the Government is whether it is going to ensure that workers have the right to clean air in their workplaces.  Will it proceed as quickly as possible to implement our Workplace Ventilation (Covid-19) Bill 2021, which has passed Second Stage, to ensure that everyone has the right to clean air?  Will it provide needed HEPA filters to schools and ensure that every worker has the right to a high-quality, high-grade FFP2 mask or equivalent like those provided to Deputies and Senators?  If we are to avoid more variants of concern, we must scrap patents on vaccines.  We should support the People's Vaccine campaign to ensure that vaccines are distributed to the 40% of the world's population who still do not have a single dose.</p></speech>

Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised the issue of cyberattacks.  These are a clear risk to the country.  Cybersecurity is vitally important to our economy and to wider society.  The attack on our health system last year had a devastating impact on health services, particularly on front-line services with regard to access to scans and so on.  It also had an impact on patient care for that period and on senior HSE staff who worked around the clock to try to deal with the issue.  Additional funding has been provided.  The national cybersecurity strategy sets out a framework and a range of measures for protecting the State from cyber threats through building up infrastructure and capacity in that area.</p>  <p>  The NCSC is responsible for a range of measures to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure and public sector ICT.  It also manages the State's incident response process.  It works with the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is now working on a detailed risk assessment of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities in the State.</p> <p>We are prioritising expanding our cybersecurity and resilience infrastructure and increasing resources in that regard.  The Government has agreed a package of measures that will ensure the continued development and expansion of the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, including increasing its staff complement to 45 by the end of this year.</p> <p> Regarding the point made by Deputy Kelly on territorial waters, the broader issue concerning the situation with Russia and Ukraine is a serious one.  We appeal for a de-escalation of tensions in respect of the massing of thousands upon thousands of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border.  There are fundamental principles at stake here as a country, including a rules-based international order, which is what Ireland is about.  Deputy Boyd Barrett said we are about lining up with NATO.  We are not.  We are for a rules-based international order, first and foremost.  That is Ireland's principle, and Russia should acknowledge that too, as well as the territorial integrity of states, democracy and peaceful co-operation.  Ireland wants a diplomatic resolution not just to this situation but also to the illegal annexation of Crimea.  That is the Irish position.  We have updated our travel advice.  We are recommending that citizens avoid non-essential travel to Ukraine.</p> <p> Regarding the proposed Russian activities within our exclusive zone and territorial waters, legally and technically they are entitled to do that.  This is not, however, a regular occurrence at all, despite what has been said.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, has spoken to the Russian Ambassador and made it very clear that the Government is very unhappy and does not welcome this development.  The Minister attended a meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, yesterday, where Russia's continued aggression and threats against Ukraine was condemned.  I like to think that is something on which the entire House could agree unanimously.  Russia was called on to de-escalate, to abide by international law and to engage constructively in dialogue through the established international mechanisms.</p></speech>

We are working on an ambitious and whole-of-government basis, and through all-island partnerships, with the Northern Ireland Executive, the United Kingdom Government and with local authorities and civil society across the island.</p>  <p>  Progress in 2021 included the allocation of &euro;50 million from the Government's shared island fund to move ahead with key cross-Border investments; new phases of the Ulster Canal; the Narrow Water Bridge project; a major new North-South research programme delivered by the Higher Education Authority; commencing an all-island strategic rail review, in partnership with the Norther Ireland Executive; setting new shared island investment priorities across virtually all sectors as part of the revised national development plan, backed by a total all-island investment commitment of more than &euro;3.5 billion for the decade ahead; the roll-out of the shared island dialogue series, with participation by more than 1,000 civic representatives across all regions, communities and sectors in seven events, which have also fostered exciting new civic initiatives, such as an all-island women's forum; and a comprehensive shared island research programme - working with the Economic and Social Research Institute, the National Economic and Social Council, the Irish Research Council, and other partners - which is now publishing a stream of high-quality work to inform discussions.</p>  <p>  On 9 December, I addressed a shared island forum event, which more than 3,500 representatives attended online.  I outlined the Government's priority investment projects and policies for the shared island initiative in 2022, implementing our national development plan and programme for Government objectives.  I also launched a report by my Department on the shared island dialogue series over the past year, which highlights issues and suggestions from civic society for the future of the island across a wide range of themes, of which the Government is taking account.  A copy of the report has been sent to every Member of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The dialogue series has provided an inspiring view of our shared island society - diverse, dynamic, hopeful and ready to write a new chapter of reconciliation on this island.  We are continuing the shared island dialogue series this year to foster deeper civic engagement regarding how we can work in practical and meaningful ways across all communities for a shared future.</p>  <p>  The first shared island dialogue of 2022 took place last Thursday, 20 January, on the theme of tourism on the shared island.  More than 150 stakeholders from across the island joined the discussion, and the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, participated in the dialogue on behalf of the Government.  The next dialogue on sport is planned for late February, and the series will continue through this year, with in-person and regional events convened when possible.  The participation of so many people from a range of backgrounds has been encouraging, notwithstanding the limitations imposed by the impact of Covid-19.</p></reply>

I was struck by the remarks of the Taoiseach at the engagement in December and by the pertinent remarks made by Patrick Kielty that went viral.  We must be honest about the shared island initiative and unit having great potential but that, due to the impact of Covid-19 or a need for a wider buy-in, it may perhaps not be reaching that potential as much as it could be.  I was very taken by the last comments made by the Taoiseach when he said the plans for the roll out of the series are already afoot, including the engagement last week on tourism.  We must, however, be extremely ambitious this year to make up for lost time.</p>  <p>  Let us be frank that politics in London are chaotic, while politics in Northern Ireland are getting sharper as every day that passes brings us closer to the assembly election.  The shared island dialogue series has an important role to implement and show people across this island the benefit of closer co-operation in every aspect of life.  I would like to know more about how we can supercharge that endeavour through 2022.</p></speech>

To what extent can he use this shared island facility to establish a greater level of confidence between the communities in Northern Ireland and between the North and the South?  This is an important issue now, namely, the building of confidence to progress the rest of the objectives of the programme.</p>  <p>  Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the progress made to date?  Does he propose to take further initiatives to identify more ways and means of advancing the causes set out in the programme?  Is it intended to expand the debate in this context beyond the shared island initiative structures?  I refer to the addition of a citizens' assembly debate, for example, or something like that, to promote the positive elements of the structure.</p></speech>

We must be ambitious about the shared island unit and the initiative.  I do not think that it will come as a shock concerning Sinn F&eacute;in's position in this regard.  We believe that planning for Irish unity must occur.  Within that context, there must be a citizens' assembly to allow all voices to be heard.  I have had this type of interaction with the Taoiseach before as well, and he said that he did not think that such a mechanism is sufficient in the context of what needs to be done.  That is fair enough.  We must then look at the shared island dialogue as something that can be expanded.  We cannot shy away from the constitutional question, because it is happening.  It is part of the reason there is an element of chaos within political unionism and that is just the reality.  I welcome the infrastructural project work, such as the Narrow Water Bridge.  The research aspects are incredibly interesting and we have had discussions on this topic before, particularly in respect of future modelling and educational attainment North and South.</p></speech>

These tweets were shockingly derogatory, and included comments about women and Muslims.  He used incredible terms about the Traveller community.  I am not going to introduce the language used in those tweets into the Chamber today such is its severity.</p>  <p>  For generations, unionist politicians have spoken derogatorily about minorities, especially Catholics.  Ian Paisley is on the historical record as having said that Catholics breed like rabbits and multiply like vermin, for example.  Does the Taoiseach agree with me there is no place for tweets like Doug Beattie's in the modern day and will he join me in calling for his resignation as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party?</p></speech>

Can he tell the House that his successor, the current T&aacute;naiste, is going to continue it?  Is that agreed?  As regards the North-South Ministerial Council, with the DUP not participating even though it has been declared illegal by the court in Belfast, what work is under way in trying to ensure that the DUP participates?  This cannot go on forever.  What projects does the Taoiseach expect the shared island initiative to fund?  There is &euro;500 million in funding proposed up to 2025.  One was an all-island strategic rail review which recently closed for submissions.  There is an idea of a high-speed rail link between Belfast, Dublin and Cork.  Is this one of them, for example?  Is it going to go the way of Boris's bridge?  Genuinely, what projects are going to be funded in the next year or so?</p></speech>

With domestic violence at a 15-year high in the North, it provides accommodation and support services for up to 200 women a year.  Many residents are vulnerable women who have left abusive relationships or struggle with substance abuse.  The Legion of Mary has decided to close the building, stating it cannot afford the cost of necessary repairs.  I salute the workers, mainly women, who have decided to fight the closure and are occupying the premises.  I support the demand of their union, Unite, that the Legion of Mary hand over the facility to the state.</p>  <p>  If I could, I would like to ask Deputy McDonald whether Sinn F&eacute;in's Northern Ireland Minister for Communities, Deirdre Hargey MLA, will instruct the Housing Executive to take on the facility.  Seeing as this is Taoiseach's Questions, however, I ask the Taoiseach, in light of all the fine words spoken in this House last week about gender-based violence, if he will make defence of this facility a real priority for the Government in its dealings with the Northern Ireland Executive.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach did not have a chance to respond in the last round of questions but I hope he will this time.  Fuel poverty in the North is 22%.  It is only 13% in England.  The ESRI estimates one in six in the South suffers from fuel poverty.  A RED C poll last year found that 19% of people turn the heat off because of fears of not having enough money to meet other bills and the cost of food.  We share, North and South, a failure of government to deal with energy price hikes that are impoverishing working people, the vulnerable, pensioners, disabled people and so on.  Will the Taoiseach take a lead in taking some measures to address this?</p></speech>

This hostel is the only one of its sort in the North, providing for women who have suffered from homelessness, drug addiction or domestic violence.  Now they have been told by the Legion of Mary that it is to close.  The workers have refused to accept it.  They have occupied the building.  A petition by Unite the Union has gathered in excess of 11,000 signatures.  People are demanding the relevant Minister, Sinn F&eacute;in's Deirdre Hargey MLA, intervene to save the hostel, bring it into public ownership, save the 12 jobs and defend this important service.  Will the Taoiseach join us in urging the Legion of Mary to hand it over instead of shutting the doors and urging the Minister, Ms Hargey MLA, to intervene to ensure this happens?</p></speech>

Deputy Richmond raised the broader issue in terms of potential.  The Patrick Kielty contribution was an extraordinary one.  It certainly struck a chord with many people who watched his contribution over and over again.  It went viral and was very widely accessed by people.  It illustrates the potential of ideas through the context of the shared island dialogue having an impact, getting people to think and reflect.</p>  <p>  The research programme undertaken by the shared island fund has been quite comprehensive, in respect of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  For example, the ESRI has done a very good piece of research on enhancing the attractiveness of the island in terms of high-value FDI, and on FDI intensity.  There are a number of FDI projects in high-value sectors.  Ireland ranks fourth and Northern Ireland 17th in Europe.  Northern Ireland is above Scotland, north-east England and Wales.  It goes through the different complementarities North and South and the different strengths.  The advantage of the protocol for Northern Ireland has clearly been confirmed by evidence in the report that the European Union market potential has been a major driver of the location of choice of high-value FDI, including in manufacturing, which is a particular sectoral strength for Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Shared island research was published in June on collaboration on healthcare on an all-island basis.  There was a shared island dialogue on health participation with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and more than 120 sector stakeholders.  There will be 11 publications under the Irish Research Council shared island programme in 2022, from June onwards, across a range of themes, and two reports on educational underachievement issued at the standing conference on teacher education in October.  These are just illustrations of the kind of very detailed research underpinning a lot of work which we are funding.  We are on the cusp of awarding up to &euro;40 million in research projects between third level institutions in the Republic and in the North.  Deputies will remember a call went out.  It has been oversubscribed, which is a great illustration of the fact all in our third level community on the island are working together on projects that will be of benefit to the entire island, addressing challenges the island as a whole faces.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will be in a position to announce that shortly.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kelly raised issues about other projects, including the railway and so forth.  The &euro;40 million is the most immediate, the Narrow Water Bridge.  We are looking at greenways, the north-west industrial development potential between the north-west development partnership group and Donegal County Council in terms of industrial centres on both sides of the Border to create attractions for employment.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Durkan, the confidence in this is strong, particularly in the non-political field if I am honest.  Many people want to get on with this and there is a lot of buy-in.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I have had the discussion before, as he referenced.  The full potential of the Good Friday Agreement has never been realised, in my view.  The shared island initiative is a very good mechanism and avenue to realising its full potential in that respect.</p>  <p>  I will come back to the hostel in Belfast.</p></speech>

Ireland and Germany are close partners and friends, and I was therefore pleased to have the opportunity to talk to him by phone on 1 December, prior to his formal appointment.  I also subsequently wrote to congratulate him and to express my commitment to working with him on shared challenges the EU faces in the period ahead.</p> <p>In our call, we discussed some of those challenges, including Covid-19.  We noted the importance both of our Governments attach to climate action and the need to achieve a green transition.  I also took the opportunity to brief him on the importance of the Northern Ireland protocol as a means of mitigating the negative consequences of Brexit and protecting the Good Friday Agreement.  I expressed our appreciation for the solidarity the previous German Government had offered Ireland throughout the negotiations on Brexit, and he was very clear to me this would continue under the new Administration.</p> <p> I had the opportunity to meet him in person, along with other European leaders, at the meeting of the European Council on 15 to 16 December.  Our meeting had a wide agenda, including Covid-19, crisis management and resilience, energy prices, security and defence, migration and a number of external issues, including Belarus, Ukraine, our southern neighbourhood and Ethiopia.  Ahead of our meeting, the EU 27 leaders attended an eastern partnership summit, which was also attended by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.  Belarus has suspended its participation in the partnership, and at our meeting we left a symbolic empty chair, which we hope will be filled by a representative of a democratically elected government in Belarus in the near future.</p> <p> I also attended a euro summit on 16 December at which we heard the economic assessment of the President of the European Central Bank, ECB, Ms Christine Lagarde, and the president of the Eurogroup, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  We also considered progress on banking union and capital markets union.</p> <p> I most recently met the President of the European Commission at the meeting of the European Council.  The Commission has played an important role in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic, including in relation to vaccines, and I am in regular contact with the President by phone on this and other matters.</p> <p> I wrote to the newly elected President of the European Parliament, Ms Roberta Metsola, this week to congratulate her on her election and I look forward to working with her on the challenges Europe faces.  I also welcomed her tribute to victims of gender-based violence, including Ashling Murphy, which resonated so strongly with everybody here.</p></reply>

There is always momentum coming from that axis for further European integration, which has been given a new impetus during the current French Presidency of the EU.  For many reasons, Germany is important for Ireland and Ireland is a friend of Germany.  Germany is Ireland's largest market in the eurozone, for example.  Mr. Olaf Scholz is Germany's new centre-left Chancellor.  I hope the Taoiseach will be able to develop a good relationship with him.  The Chancellor has a significant issue to deal with just now, that being, the Ukrainian crisis and the threat of war on Germany's doorstep.  It seems Chancellor Scholz has adopted a more critical, robust and pragmatic policy towards Russia.  Now he has to decide whether to issue an operating permit for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach confirm that Ireland and the EU support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity?  Does he believe the EU should unite in solidarity with Ukraine and that all member states should, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, said, support the most comprehensive and severe range of sanctions and restrictions on Russia in many decades should Russia invade Ukraine?  Does the Taoiseach agree every effort should be made to bring about a negotiated settlement of this dispute and avoid a military confrontation in the region and that this would be far more preferable to military action by Russia and NATO-led countries?</p></speech>

Some difficulties have emerged regarding the operation of the protocol and concerns have been expressed by the British Government, but I hope whatever obstacles exist can be removed.  From speaking to my constituents as well as to people north of my home area, businesses there want to ensure there are no impediments to trade or to people going about their daily business.  We have seen the transformation that has happened since 1998 with the development of the all-island economy.</p>  <p>  I have been engaging with members of the Ukrainian community in my constituency.  They have expressed to me the concerns they are hearing from their people at home.  They are very concerned about a possible invasion by Russia and are anxious the EU sends a clear message that, if Russia takes such action, severe sanctions will be put in place.  They also ask that we clearly express our concern about military training in the Atlantic.  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that Ireland will raise these critical issues at Security Council level in the UN?</p></speech>

In the Taoiseach's interactions at the European Council but also in any other engagement he may have had, be it with the Commission or ambassadors, what has been the Irish Government's position on the matter?  What conversations is the Taoiseach having?  To some degree, people are wondering where the EU stands on this question.  I accept this situation is the outworking of a serious geopolitical play between NATO and the Russians.</p>  <p>  We all know Ireland has certain radar system failings.  There is a possibility that Russian operations, which should not be undertaken, will be carried out off Cork.  Mr. Tom Clonan has spoken about the need for Ireland to build up our peacekeeping capacity.  In saying that, we all accept we are not going to war with Russia, but this is an incredibly serious situation that needs to be resolved.  What conversations has the Taoiseach had, particularly at EU level?</p></speech>

There is a massive problem with prices increasing across the State, especially for fuel.  Farmers are being hit significantly by large increases in nitrogen and input costs.  The Taoiseach has indicated in a number of replies that some of that price pressure is coming from the actions of Russia and other external factors we cannot control.  He has also stated he does not believe we can get a derogation on VAT to ameliorate the damage being caused by price increases, but has he asked the new President of the European Parliament?  Has he requested a derogation?  What have been his efforts to push for that?  Is it the case the Government is putting its hands up, surrendering and saying it cannot do any more, or is it the case we have an active Government that is fighting for the needs of citizens, including farmers and families, throughout the country in seeking a derogation?</p></speech>

Why does the Government correctly condemn Russian military exercises in Irish waters but allow the US military to use Shannon Airport every single day of the week to prosecute wars across the world and kidnap and torture people in its rendition programme?  We do not condemn that.  Why is the Government saying nothing about the fact NATO wrote to EU foreign ministers before Christmas asking them to increase military expenditure and align more closely with the NATO military alliance, which is a US-led and aggressive military alliance?  Neutrality means not taking sides in dangerous conflicts and game-playing between major imperial powers.</p></speech>

The move started with a strike of oil workers in Zhanaozen and became widespread general strikes and protests across much of the country.  It was put down with incredible brutality by an incredibly brutal dictatorship.  The military and police were given orders to shoot without warning.  They did so, killing well over 160 protestors.  More than 8,000 people were arrested and many remain in prison.  It was horrific brutality.</p> <p>The response of the European Union was to call on protestors to avoid any incitement of violence and to make a similar call on authorities - in other words, to blame both sides.  Why?  The reason is that the European Union is interested in protecting western oil interests because the Kazakh regime is happy for western as well as Russian oil interests to exploit the massive natural resources that exist there.  I call on the Irish Government and the Taoiseach to condemn what happened in Kazakhstan and to condemn the Kazakhstan dictatorship and the brutal repression of the protestors.</p></speech>

Good man.  I got that out of the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey spoke about the Franco-German axis and the more pragmatic approach being adopted by Chancellor Olaf Scholz.  Ireland accepts Ukrainian territorial integrity.  As I said earlier, our principles in our approach to the Russian-Ukrainian situation involve, first of all, acceptance of and adherence to that fundamental, rules-based international order.  That is the essence of Ireland's independent foreign policy.  We are not politically neutral but we are militarily neutral.  It is an important distinction.  We are members of the European Union.  We work with our European Union colleagues on rules-based multilateral approaches to international disputes.  We want a diplomatic resolution to this.  We want this de-escalated.  We do not believe it necessitates the massing of so many hundreds of thousands of troops.  It does not necessitate a war or an invasion or the violation of Ukrainian territorial integrity.  That is clear.  Holding military exercises in international waters off our coast is not welcome and not helpful.  There is an ecological issue here, which Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan has highlighted, in that there are other implications for marine life, biodiversity and so on that may flow from the Russian military exercises off the west coast.  Ireland, along with its EU colleagues, will support comprehensive sanctions if an invasion takes place.  I earnestly hope it does not.  If the de-escalation of the aggression could happen, I think the world would breathe a collective sigh of relief.  The world is trying to come through Covid-19 and all its implications, and now to go through another crisis, which could occur as a result of an invasion, would, I think, be very difficult for the world as a whole to deal with.</p>  <p>  The European Union Commission has been very supportive on Brexit, and I hear what Deputy Brendan Smith has said.  Ireland will play its part at the UN Security Council as a voice for peace, a voice for reason and a voice for the de-escalation of violence.</p>  <p>  I have responded to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s points about the radar and so on.  We have to be realistic and proportionate about the issues here.  Ireland is not in the league of the big powers militarily and never will be.  There are issues.  The defence commission we established will come forward shortly with a view to the more medium-term strategy for the building up of our Defence Forces into the future and according to our needs as a country.</p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised the issue of inflation, which has been a constant theme today.  It is very clear to us in terms of the VAT issue, but we do think there are other ways.  We have already taken measures in the budget and-----</p></speech>

Although nearly two weeks have passed since this tragic occurrence, there remains a palpable sense of shock in every community throughout the country.  The outpouring of grief, support and demonstration is a very clear indication to us that the issue of violence against women has been simmering beneath the surface of our society on a much wider scale than had previously been recognised.  Although Ashling Murphy's immediate community in County Offaly has closely felt the harsh brunt of this trauma, the chilling effect on women has rippled out to every corner of our island.  As a national community, we are now facing the harsh reality that many women in Ireland are, unfortunately, living in fear of violence.  We must reflect deeply on this and the picture it portrays of our so-called "modern society" if women do not feel safe in their own communities.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the comments of the Minister for Justice in this House last week on the development of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has been working on this strategy for over a year and has listened to those in the sector and those who work on the front line.  The work, support and contribution from the front-line cohort will prove invaluable to this process, as will the input of victims and survivors.  Obviously, it can be very difficult for victims and survivors of domestic abuse, sexual assault and other forms of violence against women to relive the traumas they have suffered, but they have done so with the greater good in mind, and I commend them on their heroic efforts.  There is a whole-of-government approach to the development of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The process will receive input from the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; Housing, Local Government and Heritage; Education; Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science; Social Protection; Transport; and so on.  There will also be input from our State agencies, and I am truly encouraged that the all-embracing nature of this approach reflects a tenacious determination from all of us in government to make a lasting impact on this issue.  I am reassured that this strategy will be underpinned by clear actions, timelines for reform and robust accountability mechanisms.  Having discussed such matters with my Government colleagues this past week, I am also confident that this process will be provided with the necessary resources.  It will be built on four pillars, namely prevention, protection, prosecution and policy co-ordination.  The goal, as stated by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice last week, is very clear: zero tolerance of violence and abuse against women.</p>  <p>  Everyone has a contribution to make to this movement, which needs to start from the ground up and requires not just a whole-of-government approach but a whole-of-society response also.  We must not and cannot accept a situation by which fear, harassment and violence towards women is normalised to any degree.  We cannot be bystanders.  We must call out all misogyny, intimidation and violence against women by men when we witness it.  As I stated last week, men can make a huge difference in this process in leading by example, showing our younger boys and men that such behaviours are no longer acceptable and need to be replaced by an enhanced level of respect for women.  The men in our society need to be more active and understanding about the issues which face women in this country each and every day.</p> <p>I believe there is a strong willingness among the majority of men to be part of the solution and this is a positive starting point.  However, we have an awful lot to do if we are to see the mass culture shift which is obviously required to better all facets of our society for women.  We need to remind ourselves of all the women in our lives, who are so close to our hearts, as we strive for the monumental shift in culture that is required within our society.  The mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, partners, nieces and friends we rely on in our everyday lives are the women we should look to for motivation on this journey toward meaningful change.</p></speech>

It was the start of the new year for the talented musician and much-loved beautiful young woman.  She never made it home.  Ashling's tragic and horrific death shocked the nation.  I wish to convey my deepest sympathy to Ashling's family; her partner, Ryan; her friends; her colleagues; her pupils; and the community in which she was so loved and had an active part.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam d&iacute;lis.</p><p>Ashling's death did indeed stun the country.  It also brought us together to say that enough is enough and violence and abuse of women will not be tolerated anymore.  Where we see it or hear it, we should call it out.  We should call out whoever is involved in it.  Whether that abuse or threat is in the workplace, in a person's home or online, we should it call the abuse out.  I agree with the Taoiseach that it is time for a zero-tolerance approach to violence against women.</p><p>When I attended Ashling's funeral in St. Brigid's Church, close to her home in County Offaly last week, I was struck by the little notes placed alongside the candles in the nearby community centre which recalled Ashling in all her brilliance, youth, happiness and talent.  The commitment of friends and fellow musicians was so evident at her funeral.  I will never forget the tearful faces of the players, strumming on the guitar or playing the bosca ceoil, united in grief on that cold morning at the cross in Mountbolus as Ashling's remains passed.  Scores of musicians later attended the graveside where she was buried.  That moment showed how Irish rural communities rally round each other when there is pain or suffering.  </p><p>Equally, as a society we can build support to ensure that violence against women ends.  Violence against women is not a string of random, freak or isolated events.  They are frightening to hear about and it is perhaps more comforting to think of them as individual.  However, we will never move to a truly equal society until we admit the depth, breadth and pattern of gender-based violence.  Whether in the most private or public of settings, the fact is that women and girls are less safe.  As the House knows, work is progressing on a new whole-of-government strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Work by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is nearing conclusion.  The crux of the strategy is what we talked about: zero tolerance of violence against women.  There are legislative improvements, too.  The commencement of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 on 1 January 2019 created significant improvements, including the creation of the offence of coercive control.  The Minister of Justice also prioritised the enactment of Coco's Law, which outlawed image-based sexual abuse, and she is committed to working on a Bill creating new criminal offences for stalking, an area on which Senator Chambers is also working.  However, preventing abusive behaviour also requires an end to certain attitudes held by men.  Misogyny in our society must stop.  There is no easy way to end domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It will take a combination of new, well-resourced services, robust legislation, fresh thinking, dynamic new strategies and above all, education and awareness.  </p><p>Briefly, I will outline areas that I am progressing under my responsibility as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  In relation to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, an online safety commissioner will devise safety codes to ensure services minimise the availability of harmful content.  This includes reducing the availability of criminal content that disproportionately hurts women, such as image-based abuse, revenge porn, threatening content and harassment, and reducing the availability of material used to bully or humiliate people.  In relation to the protection of women in the arts, my Department recently funded the Irish Theatre Institute's report on bullying and harassment, Speak Up: A Call for Change.  It found that 70% of those surveyed in the arts experienced some type of harm, including sexual harassment or assault, and women were three and a half times more likely to experience sexual harassment than men.  In response, the allocation of public funds in arts agencies will now be in line with work safety and reporting rules.  Counselling has also been extended for artists and work-based training has been improved.  My Department is also funding vulnerability training courses in the night-time economy.  The objective of six recent courses was to enable workers in the night-time economy to identify issues around vulnerability management and violence against women.  Hundreds of staff across 70 venues took part and training was delivered with the support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, vintners groups and practitioners in night culture, such as Give Us The Night.</p><p>Whatever sphere of life violence enters through, it pierces the heart of every corner of life.  One woman described it to me:</p> <blockquote> 	[It is] a source of great pain that it happened to me when I was a young woman.  That scar never gets to truly heal over.  It opens every time I hear of another woman who has been raped, assaulted or worse.  The edges widen when that violence is diminished. </blockquote>  <p>T&aacute; mn&aacute; agus cail&iacute;n&iacute; ag &eacute;isteacht liom inniu at&aacute; ag fulaingt de bharr for&eacute;igin agus fanann s&eacute; leo ar feadh a saolta.

Equality for women and girls, as our end goal, must start with the elimination of violence that has a basis in gender. </p></speech>

There is so much hurt for her family to endure.  I wish to express my deepest sympathy to her family, her boyfriend, her friends, her school and her community.</p>  <p>  Ashling's death has brought the country to its knees in grief and has sharpened the political focus on violence against women in our country.  Last October, Mary McDermott of Safe Ireland made a very comprehensive and chilling presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice in relation to the lack of joined-up thinking and inter-agency co-operation that is a glaring gap within our Government Departments.  That needs to be addressed and changed.  There are so many arms of the State that are required to provide a comprehensive response to this societal issue.  New relations need to be forged between the Departments to respond swiftly to the crisis.  Yesterday, we heard Chief Superintendent Colm Noonan from the Garda National Protective Services Bureau reference some really staggering figures.  I am sure all Members listened to that interview on the news.  In 2021, there were 48,000 incidents of domestic abuse, an increase of 10% on 2020; there were 8,600 charges for crimes involving an element of domestic abuse, up 13% on the previous 12 months; and there were 4,250 charges for breaches of the Domestic Violence Act, up 6% from 2020.</p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to remember the women who have lost their lives across the Cavan-Monaghan area through violence.  They are Sheila Lynch, aged 44, who died in December 1998; Sr. Philomena Lyons, who was 68 years of age and died in December 2001; Jamie Farrelly Maughan, aged 13, who died in July 2004; Amy Farrell, who was 21 years of age and died in January 2006; Patricia Kierans, aged 54, who died in September 2013; Antra Ozolina, who was 49 and died in June 2014; and Clodagh Hawe and her three boys, who died in 2016 in County Cavan.</p> <p>I do not want any more names added to the list and I know that neither does the Minister.  I want a comprehensive, compassionate Department that responds to the needs of women and their children who find themselves in these terrifying circumstances.  I want safe environments throughout the country in refuges that provide highly specialised facilities.  We know that at present nine counties are without these.  Refuges should be designed to respond adequately to domestic violence.  We do not want places that do not provide the facilities we need.  They need to be innovative.  We need to rethink and make sure we do not reinvent existing problems.  I thank Siobh&aacute;n McKenna from Tearmann, which does heroic work in Cavan and Monaghan protecting, supporting and advising women who find themselves in aggressive and violent situations.</p></speech>

In recent weeks all of us have received phone calls and emails in our offices from members of the public wanting to know where we stand on the issue of zero tolerance of domestic violence and gender-based violence and how we can do more to ensure we stamp it out forever.  Many the issues we speak about particularly are with regard to sentencing.  The guidelines relating to gender-based violence are a serious problem that many people in the general public have identified as an issue we can do something about.  I implore the Minister to ensure adequate sentence guidelines are in place along with training for the Judiciary and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who deal with this on an ongoing basis.</p><p>An issue that comes up all the time is overcrowding in our prisons, which leads to many violent offenders often being left out on bail.  It is widespread in all sectors of criminality but it is certainly a problem when it comes to violent offenders of this nature.  We want to see the Government move to a zero-tolerance approach.  We do not want it just to be a discussion.  We need to see it happen.  We all want to work together to ensure it happens.  At present we have a situation whereby a judge has to impose that a sex offender will not work with children or vulnerable people and it is not automatically part of a sex offender's order.  We need to ensure it is made an automatic part of it.</p><p>This weekend the <i>Irish Examiner</i>had an interesting article.  We all know the courage and evidence required for a judge to issue a domestic violence order.  We found out that a number of garda&iacute; have these orders in place.  This is quite alarming.  There is no restriction on the duties of these serving members of the Garda.  They can often be called out to scenes of domestic violence.  This is something on which we need to reflect.  I encourage the Minister to speak to the Commissioner in this respect.  It is something that has alarmed people.  Garda&iacute; are the guardians of the peace and to have no restriction on duty in this regard is quite alarming.</p><p>The Minister is aware of the reports this weekend of an incident in Sligo in my constituency of two very young women, in fact they are children, who were sexually attacked.  I do not want to get into the case but many of us are thinking about it.  If the DPP and Garda do a good job and there is a prosecution, we wonder what will happen when it goes to court.  In many of these cases we see situations where it is the victim who is put on trial rather than the perpetrator.  There are issues with questions such as what a victim was wearing and how she ended up in the situation.  All of this needs to be dealt with adequately.</p></speech>

It has also shone a light on what women in this country have had to live with forever.  Last night I watched a programme on television that highlighted the case of the Kerry babies.  Joanne Hayes is another woman whose life was destroyed by a sustained campaign of institutional violence against her that lasted almost 40 years.  The State apologies while trying to sweep our shame under the carpet are not good enough at this stage.  Gender-based violence is endemic in our society.  It is time we were mature enough to recognise it and, more importantly, to do something about it.</p>  <p>  One crime that saw reports skyrocket during the pandemic is domestic violence and this has been mentioned by many speakers.  It was seen in every county.  However, the budgets for 2021 and 2022 failed to address it in any meaningful way or to prioritise domestic violence as a Statewide problem.  Official Ireland ignores the reality while women live in fear and suffer appalling violence.</p>  <p>  A 2020 report by Transport Infrastructure Ireland found that more than 50% of women would not use public transport at night.  One in 10 women surveyed in Dublin had experienced sexual harassment on public transport.  This is unacceptable.  Only last year we found out that garda&iacute; had cancelled more than 3,000 999 calls relating to domestic violence.  Women are crying out for help and the calls are ignored and not even logged by the authorities.</p>  <p>  There are only 144 spaces in refuges throughout the State.  Safe Ireland received more than ten times as many requests for accommodation in the first half of last year alone.  Dublin has 31 beds for its population.  At least Dublin has beds.  We know there are counties that have no beds whatsoever for victims of domestic violence.  Austerity era cuts have not been reversed in many sectors and many projects have less money year on year and find it impossible to provide the level of service required by those who rely on them.  The domestic violence Bill of my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, is being discussed in committee as I speak.  Domestic violence dominates a person's life.  It follows them from home to the workplace.  Workers need greater protection.  If anything happens following these debates, it is that we need to see action and not just words.</p></speech>

The horrific events that happened in Tullamore served as a wake-up call to all of us in this country about how the scourge of gender-based violence continues and the need for adequate measures to address it.  This is why it is important that we have been discussing this matter at length in the House.  Every one of us has a duty to ensure that no longer will violence against women slip off the agenda until another horrific event acts as the next wake-up call.</p>  <p>  The truth is that gender-based violence is happening far more often than official records suggest.  Everyday sexism, harassment and misogyny is systematic throughout society.  It has been allowed to continue as in large part it has been swept under the carpet over the decades.  This has led to a situation in which lives such as Ashling Murphy's are lost and women are subject to everyday limitations in terms of where they feel safe.  This is not because women are afraid of their surroundings.  It is because they are afraid of violent and abusive men.</p>  <p>  Ashling was in a public place in broad daylight when she was attacked and her short promising life was taken from her.  Practically every woman has a story to tell about how they have encountered sexism, harassment and misogyny.  They are our daughters, sisters and mothers.  As legislators we have responsibility on a number of levels to address this inequality in Irish society.  Unfortunately this has not been done effectively to date.  We need to address this through education, legal sanction, adequate investment in support services and a comprehensive set of wraparound supports for women.  Overall, we need a zero tolerance approach to male violence against women and a political attitude to making these changes that does not cut corners or delay rolling them out.</p>  <p>  As Women's Aid has pointed out, we need a policy change in education systems to ensure the casual sexism that girls and women experience is unacceptable.  We need stronger legislation on street harassment and stronger enforcement of legislation on harassment in the workplace.  We must also see an end to the fragmented approach taken towards gender-based violence.  This approach is inefficient as it is spread across a number of Departments.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the establishment of a domestic and gender-based violence policy.  We have nine counties with no women's refuge.  There has been no increase in the capacity of women's refuge centres for the past seven years.  It is crazy that we are speaking about this and there has been no increase in the numbers.</p></speech>

They are all in our thoughts and prayers.</p> <p>I considered seeking speaking time on this subject because after having listened to the National Women&rsquo;s Council, Women's Aid and to my female colleagues here I felt it was important that I sent out a clear message that the men stand firmly alongside women when it comes to looking to end gender-based violence and having a zero-tolerance approach. </p> <p> I am a father with two daughters, a husband with a wonderful wife, a brother with two great sisters, I have family and friends and I am a coach to women.  They are not just my daughters, my wife or my sisters but they are people in their own right.  Each of them deserves to feel and to be safe.  When I go out at night for a walk, I do not worry about, or tell someone, where I am going.  I do not skip areas because they are unsafe or unlit.  I do not have to carry my keys in my pocket because I do not feel safe so why should my daughters and my wife have to do that?</p> <p> I do not think that apps or segregated areas want to bear the burden of male violence.  I want to say that it is time to teach men, and boys in particular, that they need to stand up and call out sexism when they see it.  If they do that I know that I and everyone in this Chamber will stand with them.  I say that to every teacher, coach and every man and woman in the country.</p></speech>

There are no adequate words of comfort that I can provide except to say that we are thinking of her and her family.</p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to remember a young woman called Karen Buckley.  Karen was murdered in Scotland in April 2015.  She was a postgraduate occupational therapy student from Mourneabbey, Mallow, County Cork.  I do not want us to forget about Karen; I want us to remember her as a person of great character and intelligence and as a warm and caring person.  Our thoughts go out to Karen&rsquo;s parents, John and Marian, and her brothers and wider family as we approach the sixth anniversary of her death.  </p>  <p>  It is important that we remember Karen and Ashling, what their families have lost and what we as a community have lost through their absence.  The common thread that binds Karen to Ashling is the great love that their families had for them and they for their families.  They were both young women, forging career paths in professions that are by their nature caring ones and that says so much about their individual characters.  Today, we remember them and we must ensure that we do not forget them.  </p>  <p>  If there is one practical measure that people in our profession, the profession of politics, can support, it is the Bystander Intervention programme operated by University College Cork, UCC.  I acknowledge the work of Professor Louise Crowley of UCC and the bystander team.  This programme aims to educate and empower young people to speak up as a bystander when they notice sexual harassment and violence and demand a zero-tolerance approach.  It is not enough that we merely remember these young women.  It is our responsibility to ensure that we fund and support programmes such as the bystander intervention programme, which seeks to shift attitudes and the culture of sexual harassment and violence against women that seems so endemic in our society.  I am grateful for this opportunity to speak for a few moments and to reiterate again that the families of Ashling Murphy, of Karen Buckley and of so many women are in our thoughts.</p></speech>

While I welcome the fact that two weeks later we are still having this conversation and discussing the issue in the D&aacute;il, we have to ensure that we continue to discuss this issue and focus on the issue of violence against women and that we do not let the cry for help from women right across Ireland just fade into the distance.  I ask that it becomes part of everything that we do from now on.</p>  <p>  It never enters my head when I leave the front door and go for a walk to have a key in my clenched fist in the event that someone might attack me.  I never think about or consider texting friends or family to tell them where I am going.  I do not do these things because I am a man and I feel safe.  Women, unfortunately, do not feel safe in those circumstances.  As men, it is of great importance that we wake up to that fact and that we begin to have a conversation with ourselves but that we also begin to have a conversation with each other as to how we behave and act towards women.  Unless we have that conversation, we cannot make Ireland a safer place for women and girls.  </p>  <p>  We need to listen to women and I mean listen properly.  We cannot just nod our heads and pretend that we understand but we need to listen to what women are saying.  Part of that and probably the most important part is education.  We need to educate men, young and old, that we have no right to interfere emotionally or physically with women.  We need to educate ourselves as men as to how we can become allies to women.  I firmly and fundamentally believe that if we can become allies to women, that is the best and most important way that we can ensure that women and girls are safe in this country.</p></speech>

There was a spontaneous groundswell of support and solidarity shown to Aisling&rsquo;s family in the vigils that took place right across Ireland and further afield in the aftermath of her death.  I attended a number of these vigils in County Clare, two of which took place in Ennis and another in Clarecastle.  I pay tribute to all of the organisers of these special events and to those who attended them.  The brutal killing of Ashling has shocked the entire nation and the fact that this extremely tragic event took place in a popular recreational space and in broad daylight continues to stun the nation.</p>  <p>  These shocking events have led to a wider debate about women and their personal safety.  For far too long violence and fear have been part and parcel of women&rsquo;s lives.  Women have a right to be safe, full stop, on our streets, in our homes and throughout our communities.  Far too often, this is not the case.  We all have a role in changing this situation.  We as a society must educate our children, especially our young boys, that we need to look out for and protect women and girls.</p>  <p>  Violence in any form is not acceptable.  We must educate our children in our homes, schools and colleges that there must be respect and equality for everyone, irrespective of gender, sexuality, religious ethos, race or age.  I welcome the strong stance of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on violence against women and her general work in this area.  We must all move as a nation towards zero tolerance of domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence.</p> <p>I understand that the Minister intends to have a new national strategy by this March.  The Oireachtas must work together to ensure that this happens, and that the issue of violence against women remains a priority.  We owe that to Ashling Murphy and the other women who have died violently in this country.</p></speech>

It is so sad that we are speaking on this subject this afternoon.  Ours is supposed to be a more civilised society as time passes.  We expect that we have learned from the past, but I am not so certain.  What is emerging now is an increasingly aggressive and violent society.  We should be able to understand this from dealing with our constituents when they come to tell us about the things that have happened to them, whether people are of a different religion, sexual orientation, race or whatever the case may be.  They are entitled to their rights.  Individuals, be they men or women, have their rights.  That is being challenged daily now.</p>  <p>  Yes, we must go to the schools and impart the knowledge to the upcoming generation that these ways and means are not acceptable and that it is not acceptable to be misogynist, to be violent towards women or to be violent towards anybody.  Incidentally, a number of my colleagues have mentioned that the male population can fend for themselves.  Unfortunately, I have dealt with a number of cases where that did not happen and where very young teenagers attacked an older, seemingly stronger person, brought the person down and damaged the person for life.  There are also those situations.</p>  <p>  I believe this a wake-up call.  The movies, pornographic videos and so forth that are available are unfortunately influencing our younger generation.  It is creating a problem.  If a problem was not there, it certainly will be there.  We need to address that and try to ensure that people are not influenced by what they see on pornographic videos or any other type of video, for that matter.</p>  <p>  I wish to make a final point.  I believe we must now address the issue as a nation.  We have to call a halt and make it quite clear to all and sundry that what has happened in this and other cases of attacks against women or attacks against anybody is completely unacceptable and must come to a stop.  It is said that people can be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  The wrongdoers can be in the wrong place at the wrong time as well, and this is what we have to create.  I congratulate the Minister on the initiatives she is taking in this area.  I hope she is successful and that the progress through the House of the legislation she is proposing is rapid.</p></speech>

It is an abuse that can manifest itself in many different ways, be it through physical violence or coercive control, and is not reserved for any particular age category.  In 20% of detected sexual violence incidents, both the victims and the offenders are under 18 years of age.  Unfortunately, we are not witnessing the dying embers of a misguided misogyny of a bygone era.  Gender violence is as prevalent now as it ever was.  Some of the weapons have changed, such as the use of social media and the sharing of intimate images, but the intent of power and control remain the same.  Unfortunately, too often in this country such violence has led to the violent death of women at the hands of men.</p>  <p>  I realise that many of the women watching the proceedings today, and I am sure many women in this Chamber, will have been targeted by the everyday sexism, harassment and misogyny that is present in every aspect of Irish life, ranging from the workplace through recreational and social pursuits to, perhaps worst of all, the home.  We have an obligation to prevent another generation of women and girls experiencing misogyny and gender-based violence.  There are many things that we can do as legislators, but there is so much more that we can do in our everyday lives.  For too long we have ignored or downplayed misogynist comments and sexually aggressive language.  Zero tolerance cannot just be a call made to the courts.  Zero tolerance of misogyny must be the clarion call to all of us, particularly men and boys, as we go about our daily lives.  As a society and as legislators we must do more to end this scourge.  Recent figures provided by the Garda in Limerick show that in the Limerick Garda division there was a year-on-year increase of 21% in reported domestic abuse incidents. </p>  <p>  Ashling Murphy's death united a nation in grief.  I send my deepest sympathy to Ashling's family, her friends and her pupils.  From Belfast to Limerick, people attended dignified vigils.  The message was clear that they have had enough.  An average of almost ten women have died violently each year over the past 25 years in this State, which is a truly shocking figure.  The onus is now on all Members in this Chamber to do more.  In November 2020, Safe Ireland issued a report stating that between March and August of that year, 1,970 women and 411 children each month were receiving help from a domestic violence support service.  People have talked about this being a watershed time.  Hopefully, on a cross-party basis, we can ensure that by working together we can bring about the seismic change that is needed.</p>  <p>  There are many things that must be done as a priority.  One that we can do immediately is introduce a provision for domestic violence leave.  In November 2019, I and my party leader, Deputy McDonald, introduced the Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill.  It has been reintroduced in this D&aacute;il by Deputies McDonald and O&rsquo;Reilly and was before the committee on children today.  I hope it can be progressed as fast as possible.  The Bill proposes to provide for paid domestic violence leave days for those experiencing domestic abuse.  The intent is to provide the space for those experiencing such abuse to take time out of work to put in place safeguards to protect themselves without the fear of losing pay.  This legislation is an important addition to existing workplace rights.  The provision of a statutory entitlement to paid leave would be an acknowledgment by legislators of the challenges workers may face when trying to escape an abusive relationship.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s legislation provides for up to ten days paid domestic violence leave.</p>  <p>  If we are to end the epidemic of domestic abuse in Ireland we must have a whole-of-society response that both supports and protects women.  Research tells us that abusive partners often do not give a damn about the split between home and work.  Stalking, persistent telephone calls and threats in or around the workplace can often occur.  Coercive control, now recognised under the Domestic Violence Act 2018, can lead to abusers focusing their efforts on a partner&rsquo;s workplace for the purpose of ending the employment.  Legislators and employers have a responsibility to respond to this avenue of abuse by putting in place the necessary workplace and employment rights and protections for victims.</p></speech>

Like everyone else in the country, I have had time over the past couple of weeks to reflect on the type of society in which we live in Ireland.  I have used the time to imagine what kind of country we would live in if women were not afraid of so many things, such as going for walks or runs by ourselves or being out at night by ourselves.  If we had an Ireland where women could live with the same freedoms and rights as men in this country, it would be a very different country.  We would have vibrant cities, public transport that women could avail of and use, more women in public roles and, probably, more women in politics who were free from the fear of online abuse.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, no woman in this country has ever lived in that type of country.  We have never lived in a time in which we have not been afraid and never lived in a time in which we have not tried to make ourselves smaller or invisible as we move within our lives and from work to home.  We spend an awful lot of our time and energy monitoring and restricting ourselves in how we behave and what we do.  In fact, it has become such a normalised part of our lives that we do not even know that we do it anymore.  That is a sad state of affairs and speaks volumes about the type of country in which we live.  We have a unique opportunity now to use not only what happened, the lessons we have learned and the reflections we have had over the past couple of weeks but also all the experiences of all the women who have suffered.</p> <p>There is a responsibility on us to build a much safer country for women, including our daughters and sisters, as well as all those who will come after us.  If we create a safer society for women, there will be a safer society for every person in this country.</p> <p> To do this we will need a transformative cultural change and that will be difficult; it will certainly not easy.  It will mean changing how we look at schools because there must be a holistic approach.  We must change the culture and curriculum in schools, bringing programmes into sporting institutions, youth services and third-level institutions.  It means ensuring casual sexism is tackled in all aspects of society and it means we must have stronger legislation to tackle street harassment, as well as stronger enforcement of measures against harassment in the workplace.  This is possible but it will take time.  It could take generations for us to enjoy the full effects of such measures.</p> <p> We can act in the meantime.  There has been much talk about what we need to do and there are needs that must be met now.  I welcome the work being done by the Minister on the national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It is really important and I welcome that she is doing that, along with all the other initiatives she has progressed in her term in office.  There are elements that could be put in place immediately.  I have been reviewing all the issues and I was shocked to learn it can take more than a year for some women to get the counselling services they need if they have experienced sexual violence.  I raised this with the Taoiseach last week and he said he would speak to the relevant Ministers.  There is a need for an emergency fund for those services so they can provide that very immediate wrap-around support that those women need.</p> <p> I was struck by an article I read in which somebody from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre said it is so difficult when a woman is brave enough to bare her soul and tell what happened to her when it could be a year before they can get her the help she needs.  If the Minister considers that, it would be a very positive step forward.  We also heard a great deal about all the different refuges and the lack of supports and funding.  Before Christmas I did a fundraiser for the Bray women's refuge in Wicklow.  The community was fantastic and raised a lot of money but these services and supports should not rely on the charity of local residents.  Will the Minister look at providing immediate funding while she is progressing the strategy?  If immediate emergency funding was provided to those services, it would go a long way in helping.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak to this important matter.  I used some time last week during the Order of Business to raise related matters.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to the important elements of developing stand-alone legislation related to stalking and non-fatal strangulation.</p>  <p>  Much has been said and I just want to add one or two elements to the discussion.  Given the weekend just gone by was the anniversary of the murder of Ms Urantsetseg Tserendorj.  Deputy Hourigan and I, along with others, attended a memorial ceremony and spoke with the family afterwards.  This highlights the vulnerable position of many migrant women in this country with regard to violence, and they are over-represented in the femicide statistics.  There have been warnings that we have been failing to reach vulnerable migrant women so it is important that in the forthcoming strategy and the work we do, we should think about these vulnerable women, who may have difficulties arising from their migration status, language and literacy difficulties.  They may have difficulty accessing online services.  This applies not just to migrant women but many other women fall into those categories because of poverty or literacy issues.  We need to think about all women but especially these vulnerable women, and we must reach out to them.</p>  <p>  Last night, I watched the RT&Eacute; documentary on the Kerry babies case and what struck me was the structural violence often inflicted on mn&aacute; na h&Eacute;ireann.  Anyone watching the show last night would have seen that.  The Kerry babies case is not recent news but the structural violence and mindset that informed that case is still very much around.  It is something of which we must be conscious and one of the ways to address it is certainly to get more women elected and in here talking about such matters so it is not just me and my male colleagues doing it.  We should be able to hear directly from women.</p>  <p>  We must ensure the legislation we pass in here does not contribute to structural violence.  I looked at this morning's report from Amnesty International on the violence suffered by sex workers and the conditions they face.  They are asking that we keep them safe.  There is also the question of human trafficking.  We have tumbled from tier 1 to tier 2 to now being on the tier 2 watch list, according to the US State Department Trafficking in Persons report for 2021.  Again, this is an example of structural violence we are not addressing.  As well as a cultural shift and personal responsibility, we, as legislators, have a special responsibility relating to those structural elements to ensure we are not contributing to the problem with the legislation we pass.</p></speech>

Since 1996, Women's Aid has reported the murders of 244 women, along with 18 children who have died with their mothers.  Of the resolved cases involving those women, 89% of the victims knew their murderer, with the balance being strangers.  Thousands of women are in supportive care, such as refuges, on a daily basis because of the nature of the violence perpetrated on them by men.  As some of those statistics have shown, the vast majority of the women in question know the men who are violent towards them.</p>  <p>  As a society, we require significant changes to prevent this chain of events from continuing from decade to decade.  The men in this room and in society are entirely responsible for that change.  We have it within our authority to change the way in which we treat the women we are fortunate to have in our lives.  We must also ensure that change is passed to the next generation.</p>  <p>  The disgusting and horrific murder of Ashling Murphy has struck a chord in society.  Like my colleagues who spoke before me, I offer my deepest and heartfelt condolences to her friends and family, her colleagues and those who loved her.  I was listening very carefully to Deputy Whitmore, and although I know many colleagues said it previously, as a man the idea of sending a text message to a loved one or family member before getting home or minding what street we take is almost unheard of; it is a daily occurrence for the women in our lives and we must ensure that changes.  The onus is on us to change our attitudes and tackle gender-based violence, coercive control and all the other attributes of what is a horrible societal norm.</p>  <p>  If we are committed to tackling this matter, we must do so in almost every aspect of society.  It should start in education and in every house.  As I have said, the misogyny, including derogatory remarks, behaviour and even elements of television programmes we are subjected to, is being normalised when it should not be.  We must take the necessary steps to eradicate it.</p>  <p>  As others have said, I welcome the initiative from the Minister in the forthcoming publication of the policy for the removal of gender-based violence from our society.</p> <p>That strategy will be published in the coming months.  It is a very important step in the right direction that Members of this House can get their teeth into, suggest improvements to, and try to work towards implementing those policies.  It is not just a policy from this House, however, and it is not just a policy from the Government.  It must be something of which every man in Irish society is aware.  I listened, as we all did, to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's recent comments and those of my colleague Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, in her remarks about the othering that went on by certain men in Irish society following the murder of Ashling Murphy, which I am pretty sure all of us were appalled to hear.</p> <p> I echo statements made by others before me.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has made the access to rent supplement a permanent attribute of the supports offered to women seeking to escape violence against them.  We must do more in this House and we must do more in government to ensure the access to supports necessary for those women is much faster.</p></speech>

I stood with hundreds of people in Dublin West at the Dra&iacute;ocht Theatre when Ashling was remembered.  People expressed their horror at the violence she had experienced.  We also remembered those women in Dublin West over the years who were murdered by men.  They were Miriam O'Donohue, Eugenia Bratis, Anne Colomines, Jean Eagers, Linda Evans, Michaela Davis, Bente Carroll, Anna Finnegan, Marilyn Rynn, and Anastasia Kri&eacute;gel.  We also remembered the many other women throughout Dublin West who are experiencing gender-based violence daily at the hands of men and who are unable to leave due to the lack of services and the lack of places in refuges, with the housing crisis being among the barriers to women leaving violent and abusive relationships.  If we are serious about this being a watershed, which so many people have talked about, then we need to get serious about the services that provide pathways to women.</p>  <p>  On the day I was asked by a man "What can I do to make a difference?"  I told him we need men to stand up and be counted on, to be the ones who call out verbal and physical violence against women, who call out the misogynist jokes, videos, and social media posts, and who stand up and call it out for what it is when men in the pub, in work or in a football stadium are making comments or chanting.</p>  <p>  We also need to start with schools and education as early as we possibly can around gender-based violence.  We as legislators need to ensure we put in place laws that treat gender-based violence with the seriousness it deserves.  I hear constantly in this Chamber that we are going to do this, and I genuinely hope it happens.  The Government needs to ensure that when women need a safe place, it is available. Today we heard the shocking statistic that in 2015 there were 142 places in refuges, but in 2022 this has now dropped to 137.  This is not acceptable and it needs to change.  We need to ensure refuges are resourced and supplied with an adequate level of support in each and every county.  I note there are nine counties that do not have a refuge.  This also needs to change.  We also need to ensure there is appropriate access to step-down and transitional accommodation so that women can move on from their time in refuges, feeling safe and supported to do so.  I have worked with families and with women in domestic violence and this was one of the biggest barriers we faced constantly: trying to get a place in a refuge and then trying to get somewhere to live after that when the time in the refuge had finished.</p>  <p>  We call on the Government to correct the historical underinvestment in domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services in the State and for genuine political action to improve outcomes for survivors and victims.  "Enough is enough" is what we heard throughout the State, from Cork, Belfast, Dublin and Galway.  Enough is enough.  We all need to stand up against gender-based violence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-25a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012500028#AA00300"><p>The murder of Ashling Murphy was an absolutely unspeakable and horrific act.  I can only imagine the grief the family must be feeling.  I pass on my deepest sympathies to her family, her friends and her community.</p>  <p>  Against that background of an utterly unspeakable senseless murder and tragedy, it has been very heartening to see the amazing response of people throughout the country, coming out on vigils and insisting we must address the reasons our society continues to produce this phenomenon of violence against and murder of women because they are women.  Violence of any description needs to be stamped out, but violence against women and the murder of women because they are women is a particularly horrendous thing.</p>  <p>  On the vigils, it was brilliant how so many people were saying that of course the wheels of justice will have to grind out an explanation and a punishment in the individual case, but everybody insisted we must also look at ourselves and our society to ask how it is our society continues to produce this phenomenon.  I certainly do not have all the answers, and I do not believe any individual does, but there are a few things we can say.</p>  <p>  There is an urgency demanded by people in addressing this phenomenon and for taking measures to stamp this out and to change the culture - whatever it is about our society that produces this violence - to get to the root of it quickly and change things.  Some of these have already been alluded to.  First of all, if a woman is in such a relationship, and given we know most domestic violence takes place among people who know each other and in the family home, it is self-evident that if she has nowhere to go, cannot get out of where she lives, and therefore does not have the ability to escape violence, there is a greater likelihood the violence could end up with tragic consequences.  It is a matter of absolute urgency we provide the refuge places.</p>  <p>  I am aware that in my area there is no women's refuge in the whole of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The Government has now committed to it, but it is worth saying that people have been talking about it and campaigning for a refuge in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for as long as I have been in representative politics since I was first elected as a councillor, which was 12 or 13 years ago.  We still do not have a refuge.</p>  <p>  It is not just about refuge spaces, however.  It is also about alternative accommodation and the housing situation more generally.  I will highlight one issue with Minister, which is that, even now, of the cases I am dealing with this minute, there are women in domestic violence situations who cannot leave those situations because they are joint tenants with their partners and therefore there are bureaucratic obstacles to them getting onto the housing list due to them already being tenants.  This means they do not want to leave the house even though they are in a situation of domestic violence.  This is crazy.  Those barriers must be removed.  As long as we have a housing crisis and until we address it, women will be left trapped in these violent or abusive situations.</p>  <p>  The other aspect is the question of objective sex education.  I do not have all the answers for where this came from, but in Irish society the State for much of its history prevented people from having divorce and getting out of bad relationships.  The State also did not want women to have control over their own bodies.  We have had the horrific organised institutional abuse of women and children in the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes.  Against that background, it is crazy that religious institutions with particular views of women, sexuality and so on, still control 90% of our schools, and have any control whatsoever of the sex education that is taught to our young people.</p> <p>That issue has to be addressed as a matter of urgency so that people get factual and objective sex education, and we do not have religious bodies that are not giving people the proper education they need running our schools.</p></speech>

People have been alarmed by the death of Ashling Murphy.  The serious realisation that violence against women is an endemic and serious problem in this country has dawned on us all.  For most men, we react with anger, guilt and confusion to this because there is a chilling realisation that at the heart of the violence women are suffering is an attempt by men to abuse power.  The statistics are alarming.  Ten women in Ireland die violently every year.  Sexual assault has increased by 60% in the past five years.  Less than one tenth of serious sexual assaults are reported and the detection rate is the lowest of all crimes.  Even after two years 80% remain undetected.  Other assaults are four times more likely to be detected and more than one in ten women have said in private surveys that they have been victims of the equivalent of rape.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the strategies the Minister, Deputy McEntee, is developing.  They are badly needed.  We need top-down strategies, including legislation, prosecution and prevention.  We need strategies in education.  Lord knows, SPHE is badly in need of updating to modernise it so that it can address the challenges of the toxic masculinity that continues to be prevalent in Irish society.  We may well need a Cabinet level position to co-ordinate some of this work.</p>  <p>  I fear all of these measures risk signalling that the responsibility for this is to fall to a Minister, garda&iacute; or teachers and not to ourselves.  If this is to be a watershed, we cannot bundle in a new curriculum for SPHE and assume the responsibility has been dealt with.  We have to shift the culture of toxic masculinity that exists which tolerates the sort of abuse that is so widespread.  We need to do more.  All of us, as men and boys, must become involved in an active response to the culture if it is to change.  It cannot be done by a well-intentioned Minister or teacher.</p>  <p>  To enable men to make this step forward, we should seriously consider a requirement that every public body develop a justice for women statement.  This would mean there would be a mandate for every organisation, initially every public body, to address this and provide a platform where people could discuss and think about this issue.  It is encouraging to see universities and other bodies seriously examine the way they develop policies internally.  That approach needs to be much more prevalent.</p>  <p>  When child safety first statements were introduced, they made a huge difference.  They impinged on our consciousness.  I agree with others that we need to encourage men to step forward and take a lead in this.  It cannot be left to women's organisations to lead.  It is the responsibility of men and we need men who are influencers to be part of the dramatic shift in culture if we are to achieve change.</p></speech>

It is probably only in recent days that the realisation of her loss has begun to settle in her community and county of Offaly.  I offer my sincere condolences to her family.  What happened in Tullamore two weeks ago has brought about an incredible sense of national solidarity.  We must also be respectful of the fact that many other communities have experienced similar losses and shocks over the years.</p>  <p>  However, the tide has changed strongly and our communities have come together to say that enough is enough.  We want and need a zero tolerance approach to violence against women.  This will require all of us as a society to commit to lasting change.  We need to ensure our communities feel safe and that people of all ages can go about their business without fear for their personal safety.  We need sufficient supports and services available throughout the country, appropriate legislation, an effective policing response and a cultural shift within our society.</p>  <p>  We all know there is no single solution to ending domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Tackling it will require a multifaceted approach, with genuine engagement and partnership.  I am confident the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is leading the way in developing and implementing an all-of-government strategy to prevent and counter violence against women.  I look forward to working with colleagues in the House to make sure we can reach that end goal.</p></speech>

Like everybody else in the House this week and last, I am horrified by what happened.  It is now important we allow the family privacy to grieve.</p>  <p>  There is no place in our society for violence, in particular violence against women.  The safety and security of women should be at the core of our society's values.  I spoke to some of the women in my life about this issue at length in recent weeks.  I spoke to my wife, who told me there are certain parts of Cork city where she does not feel safe and that she carries keys in her fist.  I did not know that until this incident triggered these types of discussions.  My sister is a regular walker, and I knew she always walked with her friends.  I thought that was for social reasons rather than the need to feel safe or due to a fear of being attacked or apprehended on the road or whatever the case may be.  When I was younger, I remember we always left a key on the latch or hidden inside a pot in the front garden.  My mother always made a point of that and the door in the family home was always open.  Sadly, my mother said those days are long gone.  Unfortunately, this horrific incident has triggered discussions throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The consensus from those discussions was that we need an end to violence against women and the approach must be multifaceted.  For example, we need to prioritise a public education campaign to raise awareness of gender-based issues and have a stronger justice approach when women come forward to report attacks.  There simply must be tougher sentences.</p>  <p>  Sexual harassment needs to be taken far more seriously, especially when people come forward to report it.  Many women have expressed concerns about coming forward, about the system for reporting, and the action, if any, that will be taken.  Many felt it was part and parcel of everyday life.  This narrative is very damaging and must change.  I would like to note the work Senators Lisa Chambers and Fiona O'Loughlin have done on their Bill in the Seanad dealing with the issue of stalking.  They have worked with victims such as Eve McDowell and Una Ring.</p>  <p>  Many women feel they must regulate their behaviour rather than society addressing the problem.  We must ensure we have a criminal justice system that works for victims at every stage of their journey.  We need to take practical steps in our local authorities to ensure public spaces are well lit, monitored and conducive to being an exercise amenity.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice is leading the development across Government of the third national strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I commend the Minister on her action to date regarding this.  She is putting a lot of work into it.  In her reply to the debate she might confirm whether it is still the intention that the finalised strategy will be brought to the Government in March.</p></speech>

It knocked us for seven.  At times like this, we become aware of numerous cases of violence against women in our towns, some of which end in absolute tragedy for those women and their families.</p> <p>This struck a nerve across the board.  I was in Strasbourg for a meeting of the Conference on the Future of Europe at which there were numerous meetings.  The matter was raised by a Cypriot colleague at one meeting, and by Deputy Niamh Smyth, me and others.  It was noted that this was a requirement for a strategy not only here but also across Europe and that there is a failure across the board.  Like many issues that relate to women, violence against women is an issue that is often left to one side from time to time because something else takes precedence.  We cannot allow that to happen here now.</p> <p> When I first became aware of this brutal crime, like many other people, I said this needs to be marked locally even though I am not always sure that does justice.  I, like others, offer my condolences to the family of Ashling Murphy.  As I said, this should not be something that just makes it into the television programme "Reeling in the Years"; this must be a point at which we actually do something.  That applies at every level, including obviously at a national strategy level.  There is an absolute requirement on the Minister and the Government to ensure that work is done.</p> <p> We all know the difficulties relating to people trying to flee domestic violence and we all know the financial constraints.  We need changes at local authority level.  We need to look at multiple means.  We need to look at means of de-escalating really bad circumstances that garda&iacute; come across.  In some cases, a person does not necessarily need to leave, the situation just needs to be de-escalated so that terrible things do not happen.  All these things need to occur.</p> <p> When we spoke in Dundalk about the need to mark this, as a man, I said I did not want to look like I was politicking.  I did not want to look like I wanted ownership of it.  Whether it was right or wrong, I and others felt it needed to be a woman who does it.  We all contacted Women's Aid.  Anne Larkin from Women's Aid in Dundalk came back to us.  She was obviously very busy at that time dealing with the regular issues with which she needs to deal.  A number of us determined that there should be a meeting of stakeholders involving the Garda, local authorities, NGOs and State agencies to discuss what can be done at a local level.  Cases need to be escalated to the State and non-State bodies that need to deal with those issues.  We need to give space for that, accepting that we all need to look at how we deal with everything regarding WhatsApp groups and so on.  There is a particular onus on men.</p></speech>

First, I would like to convey my deepest condolences to the family of Ashling Murphy, her boyfriend, her school community and the wider community in which she played such an active and important role.</p>  <p>  Her needless death has touched everybody in many ways.  It has raised many questions that need to be addressed: about our justice system; about gender-based violence; about women's safety; and about men and their attitudes towards women.</p>  <p>  Over the course of this debate, we have heard from many female colleagues about their own experiences.  It brings home to me that this issue affects us all.  We all have a responsibility to ensure that the violent death of Ashling and the deaths of 244 other women who have died violently since 1996 result in changes being made that will ensure society becomes a safe place for women.  The bottom line is that we need to have an attitude of zero tolerance when it comes to violence against women.</p>  <p>  In my opinion this is simply not just a criminal justice issue.  Preventing abusive behaviour towards women will require the eradication of certain social and cultural attitudes held by many men which contribute to women feeling unsafe.  I agree with the Taoiseach when he stated that we need a sea change in culture and attitude in our society.  As men we need to listen to women.  Misogyny is not acceptable and needs to be eliminated from our society.  To put a stop to violence and abuse towards women in Irish society we must eradicate the societal and cultural attitudes that make women feel unsafe and threatened.  To do this requires a change in our cultural attitudes so that we are not all bystanders and look the other way when we see behaviour that is not acceptable to women.  We must call it out for what it is.  It must be no longer ignored.  The bottom line is that all women bar none have a right to be safe no matter where they are or what they are doing.  We all have a responsibility in this, not only society but also Government.  This terrible tragedy must bring about real change.</p>  <p>  We need to have adequate services that allow women to reach out when they are victims of domestic violence.  It is absolutely wrong that nine counties have no women's refuge centre.  As has been pointed out here, Government funding has been cut in many instances.  This is wrong and must be corrected as a matter of urgency.  Women in desperate need of help must be supported.  We must ensure that at the very least every rape crisis centre and refuge centre in the country is fully funded.</p>  <p>  The Istanbul convention standard requires that at the very least we must have one refuge space per 10,000 people.  The Government must immediately put in place measures to ensure that at the very least we comply with this convention.</p>  <p>  We also need to look at our justice system and how it deals with sexual assault and violence.  The statistics are not very encouraging.  There is significant under-reporting of sexual assault and violence, and detection rates are as low as 10%, the lowest in any of the categories recorded.  We need to ask ourselves why this is the case.  There must be reforms in this area.  Women must feel safe when reporting these terrible crimes and supported in doing so.  It must be remembered that they are the victims in these circumstances.</p>  <p>  Another area that needs to be addressed is the type of violence that is played out on our television screens almost daily.  I have spoken on this before and made the point that children are now seeing this type of violence nearly as normal behaviour.  They are seeing it on television, on the Internet and on their phones.  It is as though this violent behaviour is part of normal day-to-day life.  This is where education needs to step in.  It must be shown that violence is not normal and is not part of day-to-day life.  It should never be glamorised.  Children having easy access to porn is another issue that needs to be addressed.  Children are growing up seeing porn as normal behaviour.  Again, we need to challenge this and show that it is not real life.</p>  <p>  Aggression and bullying on social media also need to be addressed.  Abuse online is getting nastier all the time.  We need to tackle this.  Healthy debate is good but when it starts to get nasty, personal, insulting and threatening then it becomes an issue.  Many female colleagues have in the past week described the abuse they receive online, which is not acceptable.  Education is the key to eradicating this sort of behaviour.  We must show our younger generation that this type of behaviour is not acceptable and that it is wrong.  We need to demonstrate the damage it can cause.</p>  <p>  Once and for all we must address the issue of gender-based violence.  It starts with us as legislators, we must have legislation that is fit for purpose.  Men must also address issues relating to misogyny.  We must have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to violence against women.</p>  <p>  The tragic and needless death of Ashling was a terrible tragedy and must never be forgotten.  It is our responsibility as a society to ensure this marks a point in time where we all say enough is enough.  Violence against women must end.</p></speech>

First, like others, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the family, friends and boyfriend of Ashling Murphy and all those in this country who have been touched by the brutal effects of that tragic murder.  Unfortunately, it is yet another example of a woman being murdered at the hands of a man in this country.  Once again, it is utterly unacceptable.</p>  <p>  Like many, I spent the last few weeks listening to women share their experience of male violence and intimidation.  I have listened both to my colleagues in this Chamber and to the women in my life.  In doing this, I have been exposed to another side of the lives of my friends and colleagues, a side I simply can never and will never experience.  While I believe all men must continue to do this listening to try to understand what our female friends, family and colleagues go through on a daily basis, I welcome that beyond this listening there is an opportunity for us to continue to act more fervently in this area.</p>  <p>  I welcome the progress the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has made ensuring that a new domestic sexual and gender-based violence strategy will be introduced into the D&aacute;il before Easter.  I welcome that stalking and non-fatal strangulation will be made criminal offences in the sexual offences Bill which will extend victim anonymity and ensure legal representation for victims.  While this legislative work is crucial in creating a zero-tolerance of violence against women, we cannot rely on legislation alone to solve this issue.</p>  <p>  Within the last year we have had a very sincere debate on domestic violence in this Chamber.  A number of people made very important contributions and I was struck by one by my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, from the Labour Party about the need for us men to be role models in our communities at every level.  That is something we need to think about and we need to take our work here in the Chamber and more widely in society more seriously and we need to be more thorough.  We all have a part to play in improving our solidarity.  All of us in the Chamber can and must do our bit.  It is the least we can do for Ashling and her family.</p> <p>The brutal murder of Ashling Murphy shook this country to its core.  It was a callous taking of a young life.  It behoves us as legislators and as a society to ensure we act now and act decisively to address the deficiencies in the supports for women at risk of violence.  What shocked most people was that Ashling was murdered in the early evening on the banks of a canal in a small provincial town.  It was not the stereotypical location for a violent murder, but perpetrators of violence against women know no geographical boundaries.  The threats are just as real in rural Ireland as they are in large towns and cities.</p> <p> In County Longford, we are very fortunate that Longford Women's Link has managed a dedicated a domestic violence support service since 1995.  Last year, it dealt with 400 women and children and a similar number in the previous year.  I acknowledge the ongoing support of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, for the service and her recent statements of intent on the issue of gender violence.  If we want to do right by Ashling Murphy's memory, we need to address the inadequacies and shortcomings in the service.  Arguably, the biggest issues include the lack of safe accommodation.  Not only are refuges needed but also appropriate and secure housing is also needed into the future.  In rural areas, transport to access domestic violence support is a huge problem.  Obviously, women cannot bring their children with them when they go to the Garda station to make a report and, equally, childminding is as big an issue.</p> <p> We need to build local networks using services and local knowledge to create an holistic structure to support women and children.  In other words, we need to build a one-stop shop structure so that women do not have to access multiple points for support.  One of the significant issues arising from Covid is that we are expecting more women to come forward who have been unable to do so until now.  People who have experienced intense trauma during the past two years, but have not accessed any services, will need highly specialised support.</p> <p> It would be a key contributor to a suitable memorial for the late Ashling Murphy if we could say in 12 months' time that we have enhanced and improved domestic violence support services across this country.  Anything less than that and we will do Ashling and the grief of a nation a serious disservice.</p></speech>

I agree with those who have welcomed the detailed set of proposals that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, wishes to introduce with the help and support of both Houses of the Oireachtas to deal with some of those matters.  I will limit myself to a couple of issues.</p>  <p>  I listened to last week's debate and I listened to Deputies Bruton and Whitmore earlier today.  The issues around violence against women fall into many different categories.  Deputy Whitmore mentioned the casual sexism that we all see from time to time in social groups, in social media groups, on the bar stool or wherever.  We certainly need to adopt a zero tolerance approach to that.  More institutionalised versions of this exist within various types of organisations and in workplaces.</p>  <p>  On the issue of violent crime, I ask the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to look strongly at the issue of sentencing.  I have spoken about this previously in the House.  On a fairly regular basis, we see instances of men who are convicted of some of the most heinous acts against women, sometimes involving sexual assault or very violent assaults, not receiving custodial sentences.  They receive suspended sentences or other orders.  That type of sentencing system cannot remain in place.  It is time for the Government, with the support of both Houses, to act to ensure sentences for such offences are much stronger.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-25a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1556" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012500031#DD00300"><p>It is evident that we need an immediate strong, political and societal response to the increasing rates of violence against women in this country.  I welcome the statements by the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, last week in regard to a new strategy, new administrative structures and additional supports.  When I attended the vigil in memory of the late Ashling Murphy in Cavan town, I saw at first hand the groundswell and passionate support for a proper, full and comprehensive response to this pressing societal issue.  That evening, we had the opportunity to pass our sincere condolences to the Murphy family and, indeed, to other families of female victims of violence who died in similar horrific circumstances throughout this island.  People want effective measures to be put in place without delay.</p>  <p>  For far too long, I have been strongly pushing for a dedicated refuge centre for Cavan-Monaghan.  The nearest refuges in which victims of domestic abuse in the Cavan-Monaghan area can be accommodated are in counties Meath, Louth or Sligo.  It is horrendous for people to have to leave their home.  When there are children involved and they have to travel a distance, in many circumstances those children cannot go back to their school because of the distance involved.  In the review of accommodation that is to be published shortly, I sincerely hope counties like Cavan and Monaghan will be catered for.  We do not want accommodation alone.  We need a suite of services and proper supports, both legal and financial, for those women and for male victims where that occurs as well.</p>  <p>  It has been demonstrated that the best outcomes arise for children when they are close to their own school.  Some level of normality is retained when they can go to their own school and maintain friendships with their friends.  There are significant emotional consequences for children who have to leave the home, generally with their mother, and who are cut off from normal day-to-day activities such as attending school, playing and participating in games.  It is essential that in the most difficult circumstances when a mother and her children have to leave home, the children can retain some semblance of normality by attending their school, meeting their friends and continuing with the games they participate in.  I ask the Minister to give urgent consideration to the provision of a refuge centre in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  It is urgently needed.</p></speech>

This death has shocked the country and rightly so.  Her family, or any family, should never have to go through this horrendous pain.  I heard many strong words from outside this House and within, much of which I fully support as they were meaningful and needed to be said.  Sadly, some of the commentary in this House last week was distasteful, to say the least, pointing at churches and church-run schools, which we now know had absolutely nothing to do with this shocking happening.  Their statements show that they will use any mechanism possible in the House to get their sad points of view out there and, by God, some of their points of view are beyond sad.  I suppose an apology from these Deputies is beyond them.</p>  <p>  We must look for major improvements in sentencing.  Yesterday, we learned of the sentencing of a man with 4,000 child images on his computer.  He received a suspended sentence.  When so many people who hurt women or families in such a terrible way get small sentences, it does not show a deterrent to those monsters out there who need to be shown up for what they do.  Another area where parents and schools have to take better control is the mobile phone.  Tablets, laptops and computers in the hands of children are like a loaded gun that the child cannot handle and lead our younger people to building up some terrible thoughts.  If we cannot start with how we work with our great young people, how do we expect them to grow up and respect women and each other?</p>  <p>  The events of the past week will never leave the minds of so many.  Words are one thing, but action is needed.</p> <p>People need to see this fast.  It would send a message that no one from this country, or from outside this country, should think for even one second that they can get away with perpetrating a crime like this, or even a lesser crime, against a woman or any other human being here in Ireland.  </p> <p> Another area improvement is needed in is that of CCTV.  Quite a lot of improvements in this regard have been made down through the years.  Communities have set up CCTV systems.  I have seen it in places like Schull and Bantry in west Cork in my own constituency.  It has acted as a brilliant deterrent.  It is a great deterrent and should be installed in every community.  Nobody should be able to refuse a community such a system.</p></speech>

I compliment, and give my heartfelt thanks to, Ms Vera O'Leary, the manager of the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre, and her excellent staff, who are kind, caring and considerate.  I ask the Minister and her Government for assistance with the service the centre provides.  We need more resources.  The centre provides an absolutely brilliant service.  I have seen the refuge where people are helped when there is a crisis at home or when they need urgent protection and a safe space to stay.  In dealing with constituents, I have seen at first hand the kind and caring consideration and practical assistance they get.  However, we need more resources.</p>  <p>  There has been great support shown here by Government and Opposition Members but I need to see action on the ground in County Kerry.  When people contact the rape crisis centre, they are referred to other agencies for assistance with different aspects of their problem but they have to go on a waiting list.  My goodness.  After all of what the Minister and other Government speakers have said and the very kind words they have spoken, why should a person, for instance, a lady, who rings the rape crisis centre in Kerry be told that she must be go on a waiting list for up to two months?  That is totally wrong.  No Government can stand over somebody in a crisis situation having to wait eight weeks.  I plead with the Minister.  </p>  <p>  In case anybody thinks that this issue is being blown out of all proportion and that it is not a problem, I became aware of a completely new case only today and I am trying to assist in it.  A very young vulnerable person had been sexually abused by a family member.  That is hard stuff to deal with and to assist with.  Imagine how hard it is for the young person who is told they must wait up to two months before they can be dealt with.  I ask the Minister to please give the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre more resources to deal with the waiting list it has but should not have.  I am sure every other rape crisis centre around the country is facing the same types of problems but I am obviously highlighting the issues in the county I am here to represent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-25a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012500032#EE00300"><p>As the Minister will know, this is my third time speaking on this subject.  I do so with a sense of utter frustration.  I have said that.  I will try to use my time positively.  I have heard many statements to the effect that this is a watershed moment, that a light has been shone on the issue and that we know now.  We have known for a very long time.  On the last occasion, I had two minutes.  I have a few extra today.</p><p>I will refer to the report of the task force chaired by the former Deputy, Eithne Fitzgerald, which was issued in 1997.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The Task Force&rsquo;s aim is to ensure women experiencing violence can have real options, that when they disclose what is happening they are listened to and believed, that public services are in a position to offer practical help and an assurance of safety.  Women and children who have lived with violence need counselling and support </blockquote>  <p>Interestingly, it also states:</p> <blockquote> 	Working with women and children only addresses one side of the problem.  Programmes for violent men that confront violent behaviour must be developed and expanded.  A society where women are not<br /><br />regarded as equals, or which sees violence as a legitimate way of resolving conflict, is one where violence to women can flourish.  Work with young people has an important role to play in preventing violence and abuse in a new generation. </blockquote>  <p>That was written in 1997 following the first refuges having been set up 20 years previously and following the work of the organisations on the ground, particularly Women's Aid.  We are now waiting for the third national strategy, which was promised before Christmas.  We are also waiting on Tusla.  I would really like the Minister to tell me tonight what the delay in publishing the completed report is.  I understand it has been with the Government for a very long time.  It has certainly been with Tusla for a very long time.  I have repeatedly said that I believe in the Minister's bona fides.  I respect what she is doing but why are we still saying that it will be published soon?  The Taoiseach said so this morning.  It is unacceptable to say that any more.  Will it be published tomorrow?  If not, why not?  What has it shown up?</p><p>With regard to our knowledge about violence, you can pick any time.  I have picked 1997.  I could have picked the case of Sophia McColgan, subject of a book by Susan McKay that was published in 1998.  I could have picked the case of Kelly Fitzgerald or the Roscommon case.  I could have picked the Kilkenny incest case, a report on which was published by Catherine McGuinness SC, who subsequently became a Supreme Court justice.  What jumped off the page in that report, which was published in 1993, was that it stated that the level of violence in that family was not atypical, or words to that effect.  It was not unusual for the area.</p><p>In every single year of every single decade, we were fully aware of the extent of violence, not just domestic violence but also violence outside of the home.  Everybody is hurt and diminished by that, as is our economy, the consequences of domestic violence having cost it &euro;2.2 billion at a conservative estimate.  Nobody who has been subjected to that level of abuse, particularly a woman, can participate as an active citizen in a democratic society.  It simply cannot be done.</p><p>I am beyond statements.  I am using my few minutes to say that I will work with the Minister.  There are practical actions to be taken.  The Minister should publish the Tusla report.  She should make that most basic accommodation, which is necessary, available and she should make it multifunctional for the future.</p><p>I have heard a lot of talk about education.  I do not know what the Department has done with regard to the Manuela Riedo programme.  It was run on a pilot basis and evaluated in Galway.  The pilot programme was run by the Galway Rape Crisis Centre along with Tusla and other rape crisis services.  It is exactly what Deputies are asking for.  The Minister should mainstream it.  She should meet the people involved and mainstream the programme if she considers it right to do so.  I do.  I have read it.  There has been a report and an assessment on it.  Is the Minister aware of it?  Manuela Riedo was a beautiful young girl.  All of the women who were murdered were beautiful.  That murder happened in 2007.  It was never to happen again.  The rape crisis centre in Galway and a number of others throughout the country worked closely with Tusla and the Manuela Riedo Foundation to make sure that change would be brought about.  It has not happened even though the pilot project was extremely successful, if that is the right word.  It probably is not when talking about such horrific violence.  However, the result of that pilot programme was very positive.  </p><p>Last year, the Citizens' Assembly reported and wrote to every single Deputy in the D&aacute;il to point to its recommendations but those recommendations have been ignored.  Again, they related to dealing with the perpetrator as well.  What is interesting about that is that we in this D&aacute;il, of which I was part, were so out of touch with the Citizens' Assembly when it was set up that domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was not included in the terms of reference.  Can the Minister imagine that?  It was not even included.  The assembly and its chairperson, Dr. Catherine Day, had the sense to change those terms of reference or to at least interpret them differently.  I am over time.  Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputies for their contributions, including those who have contributed a number of times.  This is also my third time to discuss this issue in the Chamber in less than a week.  It is clear from the very fact that we had to extend this debate and discuss this issue numerous times just how important an issue it is for colleagues because it impacts each and every one of us.  It also shows a clear determination to do better.  There is no one thing we can do or no one law we can pass.</p> <p>No one policy, organisation or grouping has responsibility for this.  We must all work together on this issue.  It will involve all of us in this House, in the Seanad, in the Government and in all our Departments working with our State agencies and our community and voluntary sector.  Most importantly, this will involve working with the victims and survivors who have lived experience.</p> <p> What do we do from here?  How do we achieve the goal of zero tolerance of any kind of violence or abuse against women?  We must first build on the work that has been done.  In that regard, I appreciate that we have had many reports and recommendations over the years.  Progress has been made and many structures and new laws have been put in place.  The question now is how we can build on those developments.  It is my intention that this third national strategy will be the most ambitious strategy to date.  It will be built on four key pillars coming from the Istanbul Convention.</p> <p> Prevention in that context will concern looking at education.  We must ensure we implement the programmes we have that work, not just at primary level but also at secondary level and in higher and further education and college as well.  We must also ensure that education takes place in our homes and that parents have conversations with children.  Partners, work colleagues and friends should also have these difficult conversations.</p> <p> We must also maintain public awareness of the programmes we have at national level.  This means ensuring that programmes like Still Here and the programmes we are going to run on consent are clear and visible and that people are aware of the challenges that we face.  Protection also means ensuring that women take the difficult step to come forward.  When they do so, the requisite supports must be in place, whether that involves a refuge or the wraparound supports, including housing needs separate to a refuge, health needs or financial supports.  It must be ensured that all those supports are in place when women come forward.</p> <p> The prosecution aspect concerns the criminal justice system.  The work I am doing on the Support a Victim's Journey policy will be a key part of this strategy in respect of how we improve the criminal justice system, most importantly to encourage victims to come forward.  In addition, they must know they will be supported and treated with respect if they do so.  Again, this facet is about education, new laws, strengthening the laws we have and introducing new measures to provide the supports and the wraparound service required.</p> <p> Then there is policy co-ordination, which involves bringing all these efforts together and making certain at Government level that we are working with those on the ground and on the front line to ensure we have a co-ordinated approach and response.  In that regard, we have given a clear commitment in recent weeks that I will be responsible not only for policy and co-ordination of the third national strategy, but also for the delivery of services and wraparound supports as they exist.</p> <p> In addition, as we continue to develop this strategy and as it continues to evolve and we continue to live and learn from experience, it will be important that we take on board the lived experience and learn from the information and data that we gather.  In recent years, we have seen that by listening to victims and survivors and by understanding the situations they find themselves in, we have been able to bring about new laws and new policies in this context.  I am thinking of the law on coercive control, for example.  Until recently, that was not seen as an issue, as a criminal offence or as something that impacted women.  That type of behaviour, though, is just as damaging as the physical violence that so many women experience.  This strategy is about making sure that all our policies and laws, and the supports they provide, work.  We must ensure that all those aspects encourage people to come forward and that there are clear ways to prosecute those responsible for these types of crimes.</p> <p> All the Deputies' recommendations, suggestions, proposals and ideas will be taken on board and listened to.  I intend to strengthen and improve the third national strategy in any way possible.  There is still time.  I never committed to presenting or publishing the strategy before Christmas.  What I had said was that we would have a draft in my Department and that there would then be further consultation, not just with the sector but also with the public.  As part of this process, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I had committed to exploring collectively all those points raised in the context of the audit undertaken in my Department to examine how all this was co-ordinated and structured in line with the refuge spaces.  That was to ensure that when we presented the strategy and the new structure, we would have answers to all the questions which would arise concerning refuge spaces, such as how they would be delivered, by whom and what kind of resources they would have.  Therefore, we are not delaying the presentation of anything in this regard.  It is important that when we make the presentation, it is clear what the goals and objectives are, what is being done by whom, what the timelines in that regard are and that the whole endeavour is properly resourced.  We intend to do exactly that in the coming weeks and months.  I look forward to working with all my colleagues in this House and in the Seanad to ensure we achieve the goal of zero tolerance of any kind of violence or abuse against women or girls.  </p></speech>

We have all heard the stories of people having nightmares about the examinations many years later and that reflects the urgent need to reform the leaving certificate examinations.  The pandemic has highlighted this urgent need.  It is not a fair and equitable way of evaluating students.  It is not without its merits entirely, but it is a form of evaluation that places too much pressure in the context of relying on a final terminal examination.  I refer as well to the pressure that comes from the leaving certificate not evaluating all skills and not having the flexibility we should have for modern students.  It is vitally important to bear that aspect in mind as we discuss what we will do in this pandemic year to respond to the challenges that students face.</p><p>I say that because some of the arguments made against the hybrid model neglect to consider several things.  They neglect the extent of the disruption and absences.  They also neglect the extent to which those facets have impacted on education, and I will return to this point later.  The other thing neglected, and Dr. Gerry McNamara of Dublin City University, DCU, made this point in <i>The Irish Times</i>at<i></i>the weekend, is that some of those criticisms imply or forget that the leaving certificate was never truly equitable in any event.  To some extent, it reflected existing inequalities and injustices in Irish society.  There are, undoubtedly, ways in which people can gain an advantage through the current leaving certificate examination system.</p><p>When I speak to leaving certificate students and their families, and many teachers as well, they tell me that the anxiety, stress and uncertainty are becoming unbearable.  Therefore, the first thing they need is clarity and an early decision on this year's leaving certificate examinations.  It must be made as early as possible.  The students need and deserve to know what kind of leaving certificate examinations they will be facing.  They deserve to know what it is they are preparing for.</p><p>I am also tabling this motion because the students need a choice.  I am certain that this is entirely warranted and that it is the fairest manner of evaluating these students in these circumstances.  I am hearing the same story from many students, families and teachers across the State.  Let us consider that school buildings were closed for more than two months and that when students did return to school, they were not the highest priority at the time.  Since then, a great deal of time has also been lost because of the self-isolation of students and staff.  There were also many other disruptions.  Many students are caregivers and have other responsibilities.  They are struggling to cover the course.  This is about the stress and pressure involved, but it is not just about that.  It is also about how much time has been lost and how difficult it is proving to cover the course.  Many students are telling me that their teachers have decided not to organise mock examinations or pre-examinations in a subject because they are not far enough advanced in the course.  I note, in particular, that the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, has called for a hybrid model to be used again this year.  The Minister listened to the students last year and I welcomed that.  I urge her to do the same thing again.  She valued the voices of students on that occasion, and I ask her to do so again.</p><p>Given that we need to listen to the voices of students, I will quote from some of the comments I have received from students.  One said, &quot;It&rsquo;s just so tiring [...] waiting for a decision to be taken&quot;.  Another said:</p> <blockquote> 	I am dreading this year&rsquo;s exams.  I am not sleeping recently.  I usually do really [well] in school but I&rsquo;m not prepared to sit the LC this year.  We have so much of the course still to cover, as well as [struggling] to catch up on work because I was a close contact.  I just want the stress to end. </blockquote>  <p>Yet another said that, &quot;As a Leaving Cert student my anxiety levels are sky high and we still have no clarity&quot;, while another put it like this:</p> <blockquote> 	Many students struggled to cope with the pressure of a lockdown, myself included [....]  On top of the pressure and stress of school work and the pandemic, it was a tough year to say the very least [...] we came back to school after the lockdown many teachers were out sick and there were not enough substitute teachers for classes which meant that we didn&rsquo;t get all of the work done. </blockquote>  <p>Since the weekend people all over the country are celebrating the lifting of restrictions and there is a sense of relief as the country can start to get back to some kind of normality.</p> <p>It is upsetting that most leaving certificate students cannot enjoy this in the same way as everyone else because unfortunately they still feel like they cannot breathe.  One sixth year student said that the Minister should have a phone call with all the leaving certificate students so she can hear their stories; I agree.  Students' voices need to be at the heart of this.</p> <p> According to the Irish Second&ndash;Level Students Union, ISSU, since the Christmas break 49.5% of students have missed one to three classes on average a day.  Some 9% of students have missed four to five classes a day.  Of those who missed classes, 54% only had substitutes for some classes.  Disruption is absolutely enormous.  They are struggling to cover the course.  It may not be the same as last year but it is not a normal year.  It is a pandemic year.  It is absolutely required to have that hybrid model and choice for students this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-25a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012500034#GG00200"><p>It is not too late for the Minister to do the right thing.  Over the past two years, more than 6,000 people have died with Covid in the State and 9,159 on the island.  In excess of 1 million have contracted the virus.  Millions more have been close contacts.  Leaving certificate students and their families are not immune.  They are not different.  They are part of society and what society had to endure.  I do not think anyone would argue the fact that the high levels of absence among students and teachers, through no fault of their own, have had a significant impact on the ability of leaving certificate students to prepare thoroughly in the way they need to for what is probably the most important exam in their lives.</p>  <p>  Leaving certificate students faced significant disruption to their learning when school buildings were closed between January and March 2021, particularly those without access to electronic devices or a stable Internet connection.  I deal with issues every day in County Mayo and there is not a single home yet that has been connected under the national broadband plan.  One mother wrote to me saying her daughter has been a consistent hard worker throughout her school life but the distractions of the past two years have knocked her confidence and she is struggling to get by from day to day.  They live in a rural area of Mayo with an extremely unreliable Internet connection and, therefore, online learning presented its own challenges.  Whenever the connection failed, there was a process of trying to catch up with other students.  The  constant loss of class time due to teacher and pupil absences, the freezing conditions in the classroom and the constant uncertainty have all wreaked havoc.  She goes on to say that words cannot express how much it would mean to have an option of a hybrid model leaving certificate giving students the choice they are rightly entitled to, given the trauma that they have suffered.</p>  <p>  A student wrote to me saying they had recently contracted the coronavirus and were extremely ill for a number of days.  While the school was extremely supportive, the student did miss out.  The student wrote to me as they are sure they are not the only leaving certificate student who has been in this situation.  The student did not contract the virus through carelessness but through a parent who was a front-line worker.  Many of the students I have heard from are sons and daughters of front-line workers who have been going through extreme pressure for the past two years as well.  I ask the Minister to take that into consideration.  There are many more emails and calls and I know every Deputy has received them as well.  The accounts are far more convincing than the Government's justification for not offering the hybrid leaving certificate.</p>  <p>  I fundamentally reject the idea that a hybrid model is to blame for grade inflation.  Grade inflation can be a problem or it can be managed properly in any examination system.  I believe it can be managed properly.  The fact that grade inflation has been allowed to balloon two years in a row has created real damage to the system and caused stress and hardship for many students.  This does not mean giving students the option of a hybrid model last year was wrong.  It was exactly the right thing to do and was something I, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and other colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in called for and supported.  Grade inflation can, and must, be managed better to ensure we do not have a repeat of the past two years.</p>  <p>  Government constantly pats itself on the back for increasing the number of college places but without proper funding to underpin it, it just means the third-level sector is bursting at the seams.  Funding and resources need to be targeted, particularly for high-demand courses.  The small numbers in medicine go nowhere near addressing the shortage of doctors, nurses, psychologists, physiotherapists and all of the healthcare disciplines.</p>  <p>  This year's cohort of leaving certificate students should not be punished due to the mistakes in the management of the hybrid system last year.  We should learn from that experience to ensure it is executed better this time around.  Being decisive and making an early decision will help.  It will give staff, the Department and all stakeholders who have been through an extremely challenging time more time to prepare.   </p>  <p>  I speak as a mother of a leaving certificate student.  I am fortunate because we can get extra grinds or help if we need it.  Inequalities are being created within the system by not giving a choice and this has led to stress and mental health problems.  I am talking about really resilient youngsters who have gone through a terrible time in the past two years.  I am asking the Minister to take that into consideration.  We have time over the next couple of years to bring back the system to the way it should be through the reform of the leaving certificate as well.  I ask her not to make this cohort of leaving certificate students carry the can for everything.</p></speech>

Their leaving certificate cycle has been repeatedly interrupted with many teachers struggling to cover the course because of the significant disruptions.  Teachers and students have had to self-isolate with some having to isolate multiple times.  There are cases of students not having access to the Internet due to many parts of the State still lacking basic broadband infrastructure.  For a lot of young people these are seen as the most important exams they will do in their lives.  The reality of the past two years has to be acknowledged.  It would be completely unfair to expect these students to sit a normal leaving certificate exam.</p>  <p>  I am sure there are some students who have managed the past two years well and feel prepared; that is great if they do.  On the other hand, I know there are many students who have had the opposite experience.  We need a system that treats people fairly and is mindful of how hard the past two years have been for our students.  The survey of students that was conducted by ISSU shows that students want a choice.  Just under 70% of the 40,000 that responded said they would favour a hybrid model.  Their voices should not be ignored.</p>  <p>  Students need clarity and they should not have to wait any longer for it.  After all the disruption the last thing that is needed is further confusion.  I hope the Minister takes this on board and does the right thing for our students.  They deserve it.</p></speech>

One of these certainties is that pupils will be sitting their leaving certificate this year in one form or another.  The Minister has had more than enough time to get her house in order and prepare for the situation in which leaving certificate students now find themselves.  The students want a clear message from the Government that they will be able to sit a hybrid leaving certificate this year the same as the class of 2021.  The message from leaving certificate students could not be any clearer: they need a choice between written exams and calculated grading in recognition of the significant disruption that they have experienced in their learning over the past two years due to Covid-19.  The findings of a poll this week by ISSU, the largest representative body for second level students on the island of Ireland, show that more than two thirds of leaving certificate students want a hybrid exam.  These voices must be listened to.  The Minister's proposal of traditional exams simply must not go ahead.  Leaving certificate students, particularly those without access to devices or a stable Internet connection, faced significant disruption to their learning when school buildings were closed between January and March 2021.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and I are calling on the Government to give students a choice this year.  It is not too much to ask.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has shone a bright light on the failings in our educational system and the years of chronic underinvestment by successive Governments.  My phone has not stopped ringing since last year with calls from parents concerned about getting secondary school places for their children.  I have raised this matter with the Minister previously.  Parents from Clondalkin and Lucan are seeing their children being placed on waiting lists for secondary schools with little assurance that they will get any.  The youth population of Dublin Mid-West has increased over the years but Governments have failed to plan for this in terms of school provision.  The Department of Education only recently decided not to build a school in Kilcarbery despite the council allocating land and the fact that there will be a further 1,000 houses in the area.  The people and pupils of Dublin Mid-West are feeling ignored.</p></speech>

I am being contacted by parents from Celbridge, Maynooth, Leixlip and all the way down to Naas who are worried about their children because of the patchiness of the past two school years with so many of their excellent teachers out sick or isolating because they were close contacts.  Students have been affected in the same way.  They have had a disruptive two years and are now facing into more uncertainty around the exams.</p>  <p>  The students who have contacted me are an absolute credit to their parents, families and schools.  Not only are they so articulate about the academic and points issues they are facing, but they have also shown an incredible maturity as well as insight into themselves in their concern for one another and their mental well-being.  When it comes to the leaving certificate, they want and need choice.  This has not been life and study as usual, so when it comes to exams, there can be no business as usual this year.  They are worried about doing their mocks and not having the course work covered.  They are worried about the gaps in teaching and learning, about their points, about their health and about their futures.</p>  <p>  At the stroke of a pen, the Minister could remove that worry and give the students and their families not just the peace they want and need, but the choice they want and need, namely, the choice of calculated grades and exams.  That should not be done at the last minute, but right now so that the students can take a breath, steady their nerves and plan ahead.  They have been isolated by infection and quarantine.  Now, the Government should be insulating them against future anxiety and future shock.  Choice is not rocket science; it is common sense.</p>  <p>  Our young people have been putting their lives on hold for their families and communities for the past two years.  They have gone above and beyond.  It is now up to us to show our appreciation by giving them back their head space and giving them choice.  The Department must listen to the students.  They are telling the Minister what they need and want.  After the past couple of years, this is the least they deserve.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak to the House on the important matter of the State examinations.</p><p>I understand the sentiments and concerns underlying the motion and I appreciate that examination year students have faced significant challenges in their learning as a result of the disruption caused by Covid-19.  I also acknowledge that these students are eager to have certainty about the approach to be taken to this year's State examinations.  The Department of Education and I are currently involved in a process of engagement with education stakeholders regarding the 2022 State examinations.  It is important that this process be allowed to conclude to inform the decision that will be taken.  Consequently, the Government is tabling an amendment to allow this process to conclude.  I welcome the opportunity to update Deputies on the progress of the engagements to date.I also want to advise of measures that have to date been put in place by my Department and by the SEC to help address the disruption to teaching and learning caused to leaving certificate students as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>I am keen to lean on the wisdom of all in the education sector in helping to provide certainty to our examination students as soon as possible and to allow them to focus on their preparations for the 2022 leaving certificate.  It is important to hear and understand all voices and perspectives in respect of the most appropriate approach to the 2022 State examinations.  Most important is the need for clarity for students.  In this regard, I welcome the opportunity this evening to hear the views of Deputies on these important issues.</p><p>My Department and the SEC have been progressing planning for the 2022 junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations.  This has been done in close consultation with the advisory group on planning for the State examinations and, of course, with public health.  The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers and school leaders as well as representatives from the SEC, NCCA, higher education and my Department.  I acknowledge the significant contributions made by all members of the advisory group to the work on planning for the examinations.</p><p>I pay tribute to the extraordinary and unstinting efforts being made every day by school communities up and down the country to support the continuity of learning for students during what has been a challenging time.  I am aware that the leaving certificate experience for the class of 2022 has been disruptive.  The SEC, working with the Department of Education, has sought through a range of measures to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by these students.  Adjustments have been made to the assessment arrangements that were announced in August 2021 for the 2022 state examinations.  These adjustments were designed to take account of the disruption to learning experienced by students in the early part of 2021 as well as provide for some possible further disruption in the 2021-22 school year.  They are considered proportionate to the students' experience and loss of learning and are educationally appropriate.  They also ensure that the overall structure of the examinations remains intact but will allow for greater choice for students.</p><p>Just before Christmas, I made an announcement regarding the arrangements for leaving certificate oral examinations in Irish and modern foreign languages and the practical performance tests in leaving certificate music.  These examinations will take place outside of school time over the first week of the Easter holidays with the examinations running in schools during the six-day period from Saturday, 9 April to Thursday, 14 April, inclusive.  Holding these examinations over Easter and outside of school time will minimise disruption for schools and students.  Timeframes for certain assessment elements of the leaving certificate applied examinations have been pushed out.  There has also been a reduction in the amount of preparatory time required for some practical exams in order to give more time for tuition.  Schools have been reminded of the available flexibility in terms of the dates for the completion and authentication of leaving certificate course work.  I also announced that an alternative set of leaving certificate examinations would be run in 2022 shortly after the conclusion of the main set of examinations.  This will be for students who are unable to sit the main set of exams for specific reasons.</p> <p>In addition to those measures focused on exam year students, I have announced a series of broader measures to enhance teaching and learning in our schools.  With a view to increasing the supply of substitute post-primary teachers to cover teachers absent from school for Covid-related or other reasons, I have introduced a range of emergency measures to provide increased numbers of substitute teachers.  These include the release of student teachers from their college programmes to enable them to support schools; the cancellation of all teacher continuing professional development that gives rise to substitution needs; the deployment of teachers currently serving with the school support services to work in schools; requests to retired teachers to return to teaching duties; the ending of the abatement of salary payments to retired teachers for substitution work for this school term; a relaxation of career break and job-sharing restrictions for substitution purposes; and permission for post-primary teachers to work more than 22 hours per week, working extra hours to provide substitution cover, up to a total of 35 hours.  The capacity of the school system to provide for remote tuition has improved significantly in recent times.  While schools were closed as a result of Covid-19 from January 2021, all students, including students who are due to sit the 2022 leaving certificate examinations, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools from 11 January 2021 until their return to in-person tuition.  Fifth year students were also prioritised for a return to school following the return of sixth year students in spring of 2021.</p> <p> I have introduced measures to address the greater impact on the education of some students and the learning loss suffered by them.  These include the opportunity provided to primary and post-primary schools to offer summer provision, at a cost of up to &euro;40 million, in addition to the &euro;10 million allocated to a supplementary education programme, aimed at students with complex educational needs.  In addition to this, provision of up to &euro;52 million in extra teaching hours was made by the Department for the Covid learning and support scheme, under which a block of additional teaching hours is provided to each recognised school, from which schools can provide additional teaching support for students who have experienced difficulties in settling back into school and engaging with learning.  Information has also been provided on well-being supports for leaving certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing well-being, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in the Department, to support students.  My Department has worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure that the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.</p> <p> As I have outlined previously, I continue to engage with all the partners in education on all matters relating to the leaving certificate 2022 examinations.  At the most recent meeting of the State examinations advisory group a number of updates were received from group members, including reports of emerging and final results from surveys of their members which were conducted by some bodies.  The meeting was positive and collaborative, with all parties committed to continued engagement in the short period ahead to provide clarity on the State examinations in 2022.  It was agreed that the members of the group would reflect on the contributions made at the meeting and that engagement would continue between me and the various stakeholders on a bilateral and intensive basis.  This bilateral engagement has continued since last week, over the weekend and into this week, with a view to reaching an appropriate solution that responds to the concerns and issues that have been raised by students and other stakeholders.  A further meeting of the advisory group will be held and I am working towards a decision on the State examinations in 2022 being made as soon as is reasonably practicable.  I am mindful that, under Standing Order 59, I am permitted to speak only once to the motion.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will close the debate on behalf of the Government.</p> <p> I commend once again all those working in schools to support students.  The work of those who support students - teachers, school leaders, SNAs, bus escorts, secretaries, caretakers - has never been more important or more challenging.  Those in examination years face added challenge beyond what is faced in normal years.  My Government colleagues and I appreciate the need to bring clarity to the position for these students as soon as possible in order that they can focus on their preparations for the upcoming exams.  I will continue to engage with stakeholders with the aim of reaching an appropriate solution as quickly as possible.  I commend the Government amendment to the House.</p></speech>

The students currently in sixth year missed out on three months of schooling this time last year.  I acknowledge that online teaching was provided and commend all the teaching staff who went to great lengths to ensure that teaching was provided.  Many teachers to whom I have spoken would have much preferred to be in the classroom setting to trying to teach online, which was very difficult to do.  We have to be realistic, however.  Not all students engaged in the learning process, and there were reasons for that, many to do with poor broadband, some to do with difficult family circumstances and others to do with the type of learner.  Not every student is capable of engaging remotely.</p>  <p>  Then the students returned to school.  Since September in particular, however, students themselves have been absent due to contracting Covid or being a close contact and having to isolate.  Teachers have been absent for the same reason.  Students inform me that teachers were often absent for weeks at a time and occasionally longer.  Substitute teachers were like hen's teeth.  One parent told me that her daughter attended school and attended six periods without a teacher in one day.  In some instances the class was not even supervised.  This is not a level playing field for students this year.  As for teacher absences alone, some schools suffered more than others, but also some classes within a school received different levels of teaching due to some teachers being absent and others not.</p>  <p>  The overwhelming number of students want to see a hybrid leaving certificate similar to last year's.  I believe the SEC is saying that this may not be possible as many students did not sit a junior certificate exam.  If I recall correctly, however, and if I am incorrect the Minister can correct me, in 2020, teachers were told not to judge students on their junior certificate results.  I also believe that teachers know their students well enough to be able to judge them.  Last year, many teachers told me that the accredited grades and the results their students got in the written exam, if they chose to sit it, were very similar, while the grade allocated by the SEC was below that which the teacher gave.  Students have had to contend with freezing cold schools and wearing masks all day, which is not easy.  They are stressed enough.  We can help them by ensuring there is a hybrid leaving certificate.  Covid restrictions have impacted significantly our young people and we could arrange for one less thing for them to worry about.</p></speech>

I know how hard they work and have been working over recent years in extremely difficult circumstances.  As a parent of a leaving certificate student, I can tell the Minister that this is a very stressful period for both the students and the parents of many of those students.  She can take it as a fact that I have been getting a large number of emails from students who say time and time again that what they have experienced over the past year has been extremely difficult and they are very concerned about own leaving certificate results and how they will then progress into college.  The Covid pandemic was an uncertain time for us all.  As adults, we had to navigate it and its uncertainty when it came to our employment and our mental and physical health.  These students have lost out on a huge chunk of their social life.  I refer to junior certificate students and those who have lost out on a lot of the milestones they would have otherwise had.  They now have to cope with all these things alongside the leaving certificate and the exams.</p>  <p>  I will give the Minister an example.  My son's maths curriculum will not finish until March.  It should have been finished before Christmas in order that the students could revise properly.  They cannot revise something they have not learned.  There are, therefore, huge difficulties because, as was explained earlier, there are teachers who have not been in because of Covid.  One Irish teacher, because of long Covid, was not in for six weeks.  There are other teachers getting Covid; there are students who had Covid.  They are sitting in classrooms in the freezing cold.  They are wearing jackets, hats and scarves.  It is not an environment for children to try to learn in.  Let us imagine us sitting in this room with all the windows open, in the freezing cold.  We would not be happy with that experience.  We would not be happy to sit an exam in those conditions.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to consider a hybrid model and to listen to the students.  Tomorrow I will meet students in Col&aacute;iste Pobail Setanta, Ongar, Dublin 15.  They have asked us to come out there to listen to them.  If the Minister has time tomorrow, I urge her to come out to the school to listen to those students, to listen to their experiences and to take them on board.</p></speech>

Our students and our teachers have to be creative in their learning.  They faced massive disruption throughout the senior cycle, from remote learning to long school absences due to Covid or being identified as a close contact.  It has been an incredibly disruptive senior cycle, I am sure the Minister will agree, for our current batch of leaving certificate students.  Some have been unfortunate enough to have to isolate more than once; others not at all.</p> <p>The learning experience has varied from student to student, often dramatically.  I am particularly concerned about the impact it is had on DEIS schools. When all were in remote learning environments between January 2021 and March 2021, the difference in the learning experience was compounded by such issues as Internet access and the ability - or inability - of parents to support their children.  I say that not to assign blame but rather so that we can appreciate that not every household has a stable Internet connection or an abundance of devices to enable workers and students to work and attend classes, respectively.  Unfortunately, some parents were unable to cope with homeschooling themselves.<br/><br/>These students want clarity.  They deserve choice.  I am sure my constituency office is not unique in having been contacted by numerous local sixth year students and parents who are seeking a hybrid leaving certificate examination model this year.  These students have had the time to outline their legitimate concerns regarding the June examination.  Their desire is to have a hybrid examination to reflect the hybrid learning experience they have had over recent years.  These students have made the argument as strongly as any of us in this Chamber can.<br/><br/>I would like to quote from an email I received from one of the many students who have contacted me.  It states:</p><blockquote>	We are not taught when we are absent from school, as none of the teachers stream classes online.  We are just told to try and catch up on work we missed and we get the notes from other students.  I was absent from school for a week.  Thankfully, my PCR test was negative, but I was quite sick so I was unable to keep up with my school work and study plan for that week.  My teachers messaged me what was covered in class, but I was not taught any of the material that was covered.  I have tried my best to teach it to myself, but it is not as good as being taught by a teacher. </blockquote> <p>A recent survey undertaken by the ISSU was clear: students want the choice between the calculated grade and a written exam.  These young students have faced huge disruption over the past two years, and alterations to the leaving certificate are not good enough.  The issues need to be resolved pressingly, so I ask the Minister to support the motion.</p></speech>

From emails to petitions and student councils, I have been inspired by the passion and organisation displayed by Wexford pupils to ensure their voices and those of their peers are heard on this topic.  I am glad to add my voice to that today.  I also thank my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for all his work on bringing this motion before us today.</p>  <p>  The uncertainty of the past two years has been incredibly difficult for both teachers and students.  The leaving certificate is a most stressful time in any young person's life without the added pressures and strains of a pandemic which has seen unprecedented pupil and teacher absences, delays, disruptions and stresses.  I wonder, and indeed I have submitted a parliamentary question on the issue, if there has been any central logging and collecting of data on teacher absences due to Covid-19 over the past two years.  Between illnesses and close contact restriction rules, we know students have had their curricular continuity broken and have faced disruption to class rotas and modular activities.  Surely, the Minister agrees the 2022 leaving certificate students are going through the same difficulties as the students of 2020 and 2021.  Despite this, the students of 2020 and 2021 were offered the choice of taking written exams or calculated grades.  I put it to the Minister that a precedent has been set.  Over two thirds of students this year want to be treated in the same manner as their predecessors before them.</p>  <p>  There is also an economic downturn aspect to this issue, too.  When schools were closed, some rural pupils faced the reality of having no Internet, tech devices and no place they could access them.  These students may very well be our future doctors, teachers, nurses and innovators.  They deserve to have a leaving certificate that takes into account the reality of trying to keep their studies up while struggling with a pandemic that disrupted every facet of their normal lives for almost two and a half years.  This is why it is only right and fair students this year are given the choice and a definite decision is made between calculated grades and written exams.  It is what students want.  They have made their voices abundantly clear in respectful, passionate and inspiring ways.  I urge all Deputies to support their calls by supporting this motion today.</p></speech>

However, I must say I do not believe the Minister is the problem.  In fact, I believe the Minister has always acted correctly when it comes to the leaving certificate.  In 2020, when the Minister inherited the assessed grades system from her predecessor, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, we in the Labour Party encouraged her to delete the school profiling element of leaving certificate 2020.  The Minister did so, and did it for the right reasons.  Quite a number of students got a fairer leaving certificate as a result.  Last year, we appealed to the Minister to listen to the students because of what was happening 12 months ago.  Again, the Minister did the right thing.  When others were walking away from the table, the Minister was encouraged by the advocacy of the students who were at the heart of that campaign for a hybrid leaving certificate, found the solution and delivered it.  I was the first to congratulate her on that occasion.</p>  <p>  Now, the Minister has the opportunity to stand up in the face of those who sound like Shirley Valentine's husband, Joe, who said they always had steak on Thursday, when it comes to the leaving certificate.  I do not understand why so many voices in education are so wedded and married to the traditional leaving certificate.  What is so glorious about it?  As the Minister is aware, we in the joint committee are listening to testimony after testimony about the leaving certificate as it currently stands, why it needs to be radically overhauled and reformed, how it is completely out of date, how it has not really changed since I did it or from the 1980s, when people older than me did it.  We have heard how it is effectively the same, how it is far too much of a burden on young people at the end of their senior cycle and how it does not really reflect the abilities of young people as they go into the next stage of their lives.  We have heard what they are asked to be assessed on and how they are assessed is completely out of date.  All of these things are effectively being accepted by anybody who has an objective look at the leaving certificate.  It is brutal and cruel.  It may be transparent and fair, but it is very unfair for anybody who has ever had to go through it.  I am quite sure that if you ask any Irish person whether they still have nightmares about their leaving certificate, they will say yes, and they will know that subject gave them nightmares.  For me, it was biology.</p>  <p>  Even now, with this national education conversation happening about the leaving certificate being unfair, I ask the Minister to imagine what it is like for students going through this unbelievably unfair and brutal process this senior cycle.  Add into the mix the fact they are doing it in a pandemic, they missed a load of months in fifth year, they have effectively since October been facing issues with teachers and students being out because they are sick, and there is no guarantee that is going to change anywhere between now and June.</p>  <p>  Others have mentioned the advocacy of the ISSU.  I think the ISSU has been central to the change in the way education is being talked about.  As the Minister knows, far too often in education, we have heard from everybody else except the students, young people or the children.  We have heard from all these other people.  We have heard those who have made these "we always have steak on Thursday" type remarks.  They are married and wedded to the system they cannot move away from.  They are rigid.  They are the voices that rejected or were resistant to change in the junior certificate a number of years ago.  They are the voices that are still resistant to change in the leaving certificate.</p>  <p>  I must say, in this Chamber as a Labour Party politician, I am disappointed by the response of the teacher unions to this debate.  I think they could be more imaginative and responsive to the needs of their students.  They advocated for schools not to open a number of weeks ago because they asserted the teacher personnel would not be available to keep the schools open.  They must realise that if the teacher personnel was not there to keep schools open, then surely the teacher personnel cannot be there to properly empower, instruct and teach the students between now and June.</p>  <p>  I know of all the arguments that have been put forward about the lack of data from the junior certificate, even though the majority of students actually have done a junior certificate.  I know all these arguments about grade inflation.  I understand the pressures the third level institutions are highlighting.  However, if we are genuinely trying to put the student at the heart of the discussion, then we can always find solutions to these issues and stop problematising all the time.  We can find solutions, as we did last year and in 2020.  How many debates do we have in these Houses, in committee rooms, in this Chamber and in the Seanad, and in Irish society about the mental health of young people?  We have exhaustive debates on the mental health of young people, the stresses on young people and the heavy burdens of living in modern society that are placed young people's shoulders.</p> <p>Despite this, when it comes to the leaving certificate, which is probably the most stressful thing they will do in their young lives, they are doing it in the middle of a pandemic when they are worried about their relations, older people and possibly themselves and the effects on their health that Covid could have.  They have gone through all of this and missed out on in-school learning.  They have had to do remote learning.  If they are in a disadvantaged situation, it is doubly compounded.  They now face a situation where they are unsure about their teachers being in.  They have all this uncertainty about the leaving certificate.  We will say in our response with regard to mental health that we have to go back to the traditional leaving certificate.  It is like saying we always have steak on Thursdays.  What I say to the voices in education is that they should try to broaden their perspective on what we are trying to achieve.  This is not a quick fix.  It is not necessarily an easy thing to do.</p> <p> I am quite sure the Minister has her view on this but she wants to make a comprehensive announcement.  There is not really any point in the Minister saying she believes in a hybrid model and then for all the questions to be asked of her and for the answers not to be readily available.  I absolutely accept this.  She needs to have the teacher unions on board if she is going to pursue a hybrid model.  She needs to be able to answer questions on grade inflation.  She needs to be able to answer questions on places in further education and third level education.  I absolutely accept this.</p> <p> We had an online petition and between students, teachers and parents we received almost 10,000 names.  The Minister knows exactly what the ISSU has done.  It has taken the time to survey its members and 68% of those due to sit the leaving certificate advocate for a hybrid model.  The Minister knows what the Ombudsman for Children has said.  The job of the Ombudsman for Children is to assess situations even-handedly and independently to see what is best for young people.  Many leaving certificate students are technically still children.  In this pandemic and time of national crisis it is his perspective that the best thing for students and for the system is a hybrid model.  This is also the perspective of the National Association for Principals and Deputy Principals.  With all of this I accept it is not a quick and easy decision.  I suggest it probably should have been made before now.  If we had had this decision in November, and perhaps if the Minister had listened to me in July, we could be well along the way.</p> <p> I repeat what I said at the beginning.  The Minister has always made the right decision.  Whatever criticisms I or the Opposition have of the Department or the Minister, and we have had robust exchanges in the House, I have to say I will be steadfast in my view that the Minister has always done the right thing by leaving certificate students and junior certificate students.  She inherited an unfair mess in 2020 and justifiably changed it.  She changed lives in the way she approached it.  Last year, when others were walking away from the table the Minister listened to those who were still there advocating for the student voice and she made the right change. She has the exact same opportunity this year to listen to those putting students at the heart of the discussion, who want what is best for them in this most anxious and uncertain time and who want to deliver to them what they need, which is a hybrid leaving certificate examination.  I believe this is the decision the Minister wants to make.  If she makes that decision, the Labour Party and other parties in the House will work with her as closely as we can to make it a success.  We urge the Minister to conclude her deliberations as soon as she possibly can and make an announcement, if possible this week, that the leaving certificate students who have been advocating so brilliantly in writing emails to their local representatives will get what they have campaigned for, which is the fairest result of a hybrid leaving certificate in 2022.</p></speech>

I have absolutely no issue with the substance of the motion and will fully support it.  It has already been referenced by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire in his contribution that a further debate we could be having on this is on the model of assessment that would be fair not only for 2022 but beyond it.  A large part of my contribution will discuss this.  To speak on the motion as it is, this year's students simply cannot sit a traditional form of leaving certificate.  Even if, as is the hope, we will have returned to some degree of normality by late May and June, the opportunity for a normal leaving certificate experience has already passed this cohort of students.  Therefore, we need to be adaptable and compassionate and, potentially, to be innovative.  There is still time for us to do this.</p>  <p>  It has already been said by every speaker, because every speaker has had the same level of engagement with leaving certificate students, that this year's students have missed a huge swathe of time because they or their teachers have been out of school.  In some cases, and my sympathy really lies with them and it is an issue I have been raising since the very start of the pandemic, students have an underlying health condition or have a family member at home with an underlying health issue and simply have not been able to engage a constructive form of education and simply have not been catered for.  There are a variety of reasons this year's cohort have been impacted and cannot have a traditional leaving certificate experience.</p>  <p>  There have been obvious complications, not least the fact a percentage of this year's cohort did not sit a traditional junior certificate examination.  There is a lack of data that will skew the hybrid model that was used last year.  It means we might have to resort to historical records, which none of us want.  All of this is a very real and relevant issue.  It is certainly not insurmountable.  It is absolutely not the fault of the leaving certificate students who were not able to experience a traditional junior certificate.  They certainly should not be doubly punished as a consequence.  Rather, the very fact the students did not sit a traditional junior certificate examination is further reason they should not sit a traditional leaving certificate examination.</p>  <p>  I will say it again, and repeat the statement made by the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals: we may need to get around the table to find solutions to this.  No one is coming in here to say exactly how the model would work.  I do not expect the Minister to do so during this debate.  I do expect stakeholders to be around the table and to be innovative and solution oriented.</p>  <p>  I have said time and again, and I believe it to be so to the very essence of my being, the leaving certificate fails students every year.  I want to make this very clear.  There has been a creeping narrative in recent years, and I have particularly noticed it in recent months, that the leaving certificate examinations, the CAO system and the points race are pristine.  We are told the leaving certificate is transparent and an upholder of equality and that students will be robbed of this system of equality if other methods of assessment are considered.  I reject this completely.</p>  <p>  Not to nitpick in any way, I refer to a contribution of the Minister from May 2020 prior to her becoming Minister for Education.  The issue being discussed was what form of leaving certificate the first cohort of Covid students would have.  She stated she profoundly regretted the plan B option of hosting the traditional leaving certificate did not come to pass.  She stated that although it is flawed in a few respects, there is an essential fairness and equity at the core of the leaving certificate that is unmatched in any other type of exam.  She stated it is independent and anonymous.  This is the narrative we tell ourselves.  We tell ourselves the leaving certificate rewards hard work and not privilege.  This trickles down into individual narratives of success and failure and they become internalised.  It is an everyday form of history being written by the victors.  It is very important that those of us who have benefited from a traditional leaving certificate and those of us who have not hold up a mirror to ourselves to see why we value the system.</p>  <p>  I often think of students who receive high points who never recognise the privileges that aided them in obtaining those results.  These include the grinds they received, the fact they have parents who went to college and understand the system and the time and physical space they dedicate to doing well.  I certainly do not begrudge anybody this.  Likewise, there are students who face significant barriers, such as those whose parents left school early and never went to college, those who work part-time to try to help the household and those who do not have their own bedrooms or a quiet place to study.  If these students fail to get the points they require they may think it is a personal failure and not a systemic failure.  It is often easier to disguise privilege then to face oppression.  The leaving certificate replicates privilege every year.  Either the world opens up or it closes in for a student after the leaving certificate.</p>  <p>  I believe the evidence year on year backs up that the leaving certificate is a postcode lottery.  I will point to several Dublin postcodes.  Dublin 6 is a wealthy part of the country.  It has a 99% progression rate to university and college.  In Dublin 17 the progression rate is 15%.  I accept these figures are from 2014 but I guarantee the figure for Dublin 6 is exactly the same, with that for Dublin 17 increasing by a couple of percentage points, if even.  Higher Education Authority data from 2017 found that students from affluent areas achieve an average of 446 leaving certificate points compared to an average of 368 leaving certificate points achieved by students in disadvantaged areas.</p> <p>That is based on the Pobal HP deprivation index.  It also showed that 72% of students from affluent areas achieved over 400 points and 29% achieved over 500 points.  In comparison, 37% of students from disadvantaged areas achieved over 400 points and 9% achieved over 500 points.<br/><br/>I was very lucky in my own educational experience and in many ways my politicisation came when I was afforded the opportunity to enter the Trinity access programmes which exist to bring students from underrepresented areas into universities into colleges.  One of the questions Dr. Cliona Hannon, the director of those programmes, asked me during the session was whether it was simply the case that we keep the very intelligent people in Dublin 6, where 99% of people get to go to college, and the non-intelligent people in the community I grew up in, Dublin 1, where a mere 21% of people go on to college.  It is simply not the case that we do so.<br/><br/>The leaving certificate is flawed or else it purposely replicates privilege.  That is borne out every single year.  One only has to look at <i>The Irish Times</i>feeder school list to see which schools get the best places in college.  This happens by design.<br/><br/>We also know that the leaving certificate causes an enormous amount of stress.  In 2016 the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child recommended that Ireland reform the leaving certificate as the terminal exam was found to be imposing a disproportionate level of mental stress on young people.  How did this committee find this out?  It simply listened to the students and was compassionate in what it heard.<br/><br/>I also want to acknowledge that there is an alternative to the traditional leaving certificate that happens every year, which is the leaving certificate applied programme, which despite its benefits, including increased positive relationships between teachers and students and autonomy for students, is often ignored to the point that there is no pathway from the leaving certificate applied directly into our universities at the moment.<br/><br/>I had the privilege of teaching in those classes and I found students who were questioning, engaging and were very collaborative in their learning.  It is not valued, despite the fact that they learn in a different way and it is no less important.<br/><br/>I have also heard a creeping narrative coming in that students who have not been afforded the opportunity to do the leaving certificate in the traditional form over the past year may be somehow less resilient because they did not have to take the hardship that is the almost &ldquo;The Hunger Games&rdquo;-like scenario of our leaving certificate.  Let us be very clear.  Every one of us who has been engaged by students over the past three years has encountered a cohort of students who are not only resilient but are holding themselves as accountable as Deputies and Ministers and in a way that I do not believe has happened previously.  That has been a learning experience in and of its own, and one which we should not underestimate.<br/><br/>We are also told that not every student should go to college.  The conversation then turns to stating that apprenticeships are equally valuable.  I fully agree that is the case but it should not be the case that it is predominantly people from working-class areas who are expected to take up these apprenticeships.  I fully believe that 99% of students in Dublin 6 going to college is too much.  Perhaps we need more doctors from DEIS areas and more plumbers from more wealthy and affluent parts.  If we are talking about more apprenticeships and saying that not everyone needs to go to college, let us also acknowledge that there are areas and communities where people have not had the same opportunities that people in other areas have had.<br/><br/>While I welcome the opportunity to speak on the leaving certificate today, and I fully support what this motion is trying to achieve, I also feel that it is important to look beyond it.  I want to conclude by acknowledging that we need more than one type of educational model.  Alternative forms of education are something that I raised with the Taoiseach earlier today.  Very specifically, there is a report in the Minister&rsquo;s Department on alternative education that started in 2018 and we need that work to be concluded and published because the leaving certificate is not the be-all and end-all.  <br/><br/>I support the motion and thank Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire for bringing it forward.  If the leaving certificate in its current form is proven to be unfit for purpose, I believe it will be unfit for purpose long into the future.  It does not set up our students for progression on to university, does not develop them emotionally to deal with the stresses that come with being a young person and does not provide pathways into work.  We place importance on it because, culturally, we have always placed importance on it.  Many people in positions of power and influence have benefited from it and those who have not, simply, have not had a voice at the table in order to call it out for what it is.</p></speech>

People Before Profit is happy to support it.</p><p>The very least we can insist upon in the particular situation of Covid-19 is that the voices of leaving certificate school students, as clearly expressed by them and their representative organisations, should be heard.  They want a choice with a hybrid exam.  They have been through enough and they need that clarity soon.  They want the Minister to listen to their voice.  We are happy to support that.  As the Minister is aware, we wish to go further.  We brought a motion to that effect to the D&aacute;il last March, but the Government opposed it.  I am going to repeat the argument a year on, as it is even more relevant now.  We have tabled a short amendment which does not delete anything from the Sinn F&eacute;in motion but adds that we should have open access to higher and further education and apprenticeships, and that we should scrap the leaving certificate.  We should get rid of it because it is a way of limiting access to higher and further education and it is irrational and unfair to do that.  It forces people into a rat race for points which is extremely detrimental to the well-being of our young people.  It is completely pointless.  It is damaging and reinforces social inequality, is long past its sell-by date and should go.  We are very clear about this.</p><p>School students who have led the way, by the way, on climate - we should bear that in mind - say that they want system change, not climate change but system change.  System change is what we need in education and we need it now, not some time in the future with little bits here and there of tinkering around with the existing failed and unfair system.  The unfairness of this has been magnified in the context of Covid-19 but it was always an unfair system.</p><p>Deputy Gannon has already referred to something that was in our motion last March.  It is shocking that the Government can maintain that the leaving certificate is fair.  It is ridiculous to say that unless one is not looking at the context of the leaving certificate.  Some 99% of people from Ranelagh - I have nothing against the people of Ranelagh - go to university but 15% or 16% of people from working-class areas do so.  Is that fair?  It is grossly unfair and something has to be done about it.  If one does not start by recognising that there is a problem, quite frankly one is defending the indefensible.  I am delighted that the ASTI has now endorsed the view that open access is needed.  We should listen to it, even though I do not agree with everything the teachers' unions have said on this issue, because it is absolutely right in saying that we need open access.  That is about responding to the pandemic.  We have gone on and on about where there is going to be a new normal.  That is the expression.  We are going to learn from Covid-19 but what we are actually trying to do is to drag ourselves back to the stuff before Covid-19 and to return to the <i>status quo</i>.  We do not need that <i>status quo</i>when it comes to the leaving certificate; we need a revolution in education.  We need the imagination to remember that once upon a time people thought it was fair and reasonable to limit access to second level education.  We think that would be utterly preposterous now, but once upon a time that is the way it was looked at.  Once upon a time significant numbers of people did not imagine that they would ever get past primary education.  Now, equally, we think that is preposterous.</p><p>Why on earth would we ration and have a gatekeeping exercise for access to further and higher education?  When we brought this motion forward last year, the T&aacute;naiste said it was a nice idea but was totally impractical and asked where we would get the buildings.  If one walks down Aungier Street, one will see a third level institution that has been sitting empty for the past two to three years.  It is outrageous.  If one goes along by the Merrion Gates, one can look at the Seamark Building in which a college could be fitted.  It has been sitting empty for ten years.  There are multiple buildings like that around the country.  There is no problem with the physical infrastructure if we are serious about this.</p><p>The other comment I love is that everyone will want to be a doctor.  This is the sort of nonsense that is wheeled out.  We are defending a situation whereby in order to do the thing one would like to do, one has to be subjected to a regime of studying many things that one does not want to do, in order to get to the thing that one does want to do.</p>  <p>Is it even the thing the student wants to do, given it is just a hierarchy of points to get into particular courses?  Surely it is a little more logical to let people do the thing they really want and are enthusiastic to do in third level.  Would that not be imaginative?  Imagine the type of creative potential that could be unleashed if people were given the opportunity to do the things they are really keen to do.  I believe that might produce better graduates.  It might contribute better to our society to unleash the creative potential of the many people whom the system at present deters or to whom it denies access to education and the things they want to do.</p> <p> It is entirely practical.  The gap between the number of higher education places and the number of applicants is about 25,000.  That gap can be filled.  There are many part-time academic staff who would love a full-time job but who are on crappy part-time contracts or are paid by the hour.  We have the people who could do the teaching and, believe me, we have buildings in which we could put the students.  We just need the imagination of the Government to take this leap, and now is the time to take it.</p></speech>

I understand students are discussing the possibility of protests on a bigger scale.  I sincerely hope such protests will not prove necessary.  However, if the Minister and the Government choose not to listen to students and decide instead to drive forward with the traditional leaving certificate examination, there is a real possibility of large student protests to bring the Government to its senses.  The Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il today that students will have certainty within a week.  If the Government fails to meet this deadline, sizeable student protests will also be a possibility.</p>  <p>  These students have lost massive amounts of classroom time due to Covid-19.  This is not a normal year and there can be no normal leaving certificate examination.  Last week, the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, issued a public statement calling for plans for a traditional leaving certificate examination to be abandoned.  This statement deserved more attention than it received.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to go against the wishes of 68% of leaving certificate students and the wishes of the Ombudsman for Children when he is addressing an issue affecting 60,000 young people.  I warmly welcome the decision of the ASTI's central executive council last Saturday to pass a resolution stating the ASTI formally proposes open access to third level education as the only fair and equitable alternative to the leaving certificate examination of 2022.</p>  <p>  Our society is crying out for more nurses, teachers, doctors and apprentices.  Rather than forcing school students to compete against each for limited college places, the State should be creating more such places.  Rather than having to throw money at employment agencies to scour the world for workers, the State should be training them here at third level.  The State should invest heavily in third level education and provide a college place for all who want one.  I would love to see the Teachers' Union of Ireland adopting a pro-open access stance as well, and to see both teachers' unions join forces with the school students' union to fight for college places for all.  The leaving certificate represents the past.  A college place for all on the basis of open access represents the future.</p></speech>

As a result, it is not fair to ask the students to sit a normal leaving certificate examination.  The leaving certificate examination is specifically designed to allow for two years of preparation for it, and this obviously did not happen.  Many students have lost at least three months of their face-to-face teaching and many teachers have been absent for significant periods of time during the period when the schools were open as well.  Teachers will tell us that much of their core content is delivered in fifth year.  Traditionally, very little new content is done in sixth year in the period after Christmas.  Truth be told, many classes around the country at present still have new content to deal with in the months ahead.</p>  <p>  The last two years have been a very difficult period for students.  However, it has been different for different students.  Some students have had a far harder experience than others.  The technology disadvantage students have in respect of broadband access hurt many students in particular parts of the country.  Many students, thankfully, come from backgrounds or households with high educational motivation.  Those students are very lucky.  When they did not have a teacher in front of them to motivate them, guide them or put pressure on them to do the right thing with regard to keeping up with their studies, they had a parent at home who was able to fulfil that role.  Many of these students will do well as a result.  However, for the students who do not have a background of high educational motivation, the loss of the teacher in the face-to-face, in-person setting was significant.  It is a loss that will not be made up in the intervening time.  It is very important to recognise some students will be significantly disadvantaged in the traditional leaving certificate examination setting if we continue with that.</p>  <p>  I heard the Government mention that the junior certificate examination has not been sat by about 20% of students.  As a result, there is less concrete guidance for teachers in predicting grades for students.  However, the truth is students can change dramatically in the period between being a junior certificate student and a leaving certificate student.  Many boys, especially, do much of their maturing in the period after the junior certificate examination and have a completely different set of emotional skills, maturity levels and circumstances when doing the leaving certificate.  Using the junior certificate to judge the examinations of an individual will not be the right way for many to decide upon a predictive grade.  To be honest, it is important to take into consideration that we need to make a decision on a student's ability, attitudes and focus now.  In what other walk of life would we make a life-changing decision for a person on the basis of something the person did three years ago?</p>  <p>  There is no doubt there are problems.  There is significant grade inflation happening within the current system.  The number of students achieving six H1 grades in the leaving certificate examination increased almost fivefold between 2019 and 2021.  That is an incredible level of grade inflation.  Grade inflation does not help anybody.  It may well be the case the leaving certificate grades of the past couple of years will be trusted less by future employers because of the grade inflation.  It may devalue those results in the eyes of employers.  We must ensure the grades in the coming year are not outliers historically in terms of previous years' grades.  I have also heard people in the university system say they felt that, due to grade inflation and the lack of examinations and practicals, the intake of first year students was not as well prepared for university last year.  That is a problem as well.  The lack of practical examinations and serious examinations weakens a student's ability to deal with the challenges of university.  In Aont&uacute; we believe all practical elements of the courses should be completed.  Most courses have a practical element so we must ensure that happens.</p>  <p>  Finally, I give credit to the Minister for making sure the education system started in January after Christmas.  When a lot of the world was looking for schools to be put on vacation for another two weeks, the Minister kept the schools open from the start of January.  Maith th&uacute;.</p></speech>

However, it is also important students quickly get absolute clarity on the format of this year's leaving certificate examination.  They acknowledge the provisions that have been made in the form of more choice in the examination papers.</p> <p>They do not feel it is enough to reflect the additional challenges they face as a result of Covid-19, which they experienced throughout their senior cycle.  It is important that this is reflected in an alternative leaving certificate presented to students.</p> <p> I have received correspondence from St. Cuan's College in Castleblakeney, which points out that over the past two years there has been significant disruption from Covid-19.  The students point out they have missed important in-class learning and are continuing to miss valuable class time due to contracting the virus, waiting for PCR tests and having to isolate themselves due to being close contacts.  It is not just students but also the teachers who have missed out, which affects in-class interaction.  In that particular school, which is a small, rural secondary school in east Galway, there were multiple positive cases last November and the school had to move to teaching the leaving certificate class online as a result.  That is over and above some of the experiences in other schools.</p> <p> Another student who wrote to me points out she is now rushing against the clock to complete projects and portfolios, as well as finishing coursework assigned for sitting this year's leaving certificate.  That is as well as trying to prepare for the mock exams.</p> <p> The Minister knows that last May I raised concerns about the class of 2022 with her on the floor of the House.  I pointed out that approximately a fifth of the students had not sat a junior certificate exam and that this should be taken into account with the provisions to be put in place for an alternative leaving certificate this year.  In November, I raised the matter again with the Taoiseach on the floor of the House, indicating that leaving certificate students contacted me at that time because they felt they were completely forgotten about by the Department of Education and the true impact of Covid-19 was not being recognised.  That was last November, never mind the disruption we saw in December and January.  At that point students were saying they were incredibly behind and stressed out as a result of the impact of Covid-19.</p> <p> Students are now facing into oral, practical and mock exams so they need absolute clarity quickly on this.  I accept that last week the Taoiseach indicated here that there may be challenges for the third year in a row if a predicted grades process has an impact on capacity within the third level system.  That was reflected at the weekend when Mr. Jim Miley, director of the Irish Universities Association, again flagged issues with the hybrid system.  None of us wants to see a position where students must get into college based on a system of random selection.</p> <p> I accept there are challenges from grade inflation and a fivefold increase in the number of H1s since 2019 highlights problems with the existing system.  There is a discrepancy in that if a student is sitting seven exams and is competing with another student sitting three exams and taking predicted grades in the other four subjects because the teacher has indicated the grade that will be achieved, it leaves that student at a distinct disadvantage.  I accept we cannot have the leaving certificate we had last year.  We need an alternative mechanism, however, and surely we can work with some imagination to provide a fair and balanced system for the students this year.</p></speech>

In 2020, I asked the then Minister, Deputy Joe McHugh, the very same question and he responded.  I believe I was the first to ask that students be given a choice.  The Covid-19 virus is not yet finished and teachers and pupils could miss more time.  This set of students missed three months last year and they also missed time in the autumn because teachers and pupils were missing.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to please give these students a choice this year because they have been through a tough time.  We should remember that these students did not sit the junior certificate exam.  They must be given a choice now to either use a predicted grades system or sit an exam because they have been through such a tough time.  They need that chance so the Minister should please give that to them.</p></speech>

I know she has had a tough time and a baptism of fire.  I wish her well in the post and I support her.  These students, however, had no junior certificate and no proper schooling for the previous two years.  They have had an awful time because they could not have fun or enjoy themselves.  This is so important and their future careers depend on this.</p>  <p>  The predicted grades system operated last year and we beg the Minister to operate it again this year.  Those pupils who get high marks must be examined to tidy this up but we need clarity now.  The entire school community, from management to parent councils and teachers, needs to be supported and get a clear roadmap of where they are going.  Above all, students, parents and families are pleading with the Minister to understand this.  She is a m&uacute;inteoir herself and should understand it.  It is not an easy role and although it has never been easy, teachers have had a torrid time throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  We in the Rural Independent Groups are pleading with the Minister because we have been listening to mothers, fathers, guardians and students.  We have received emails from sixth year students that are heart-rending but they are so eloquent and well put together.  I have great hope for the future.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Please look after them.  </p></speech>

We can look at the current cohort of leaving certificate pupils but for the past three years there has not been any kind of normal for them.  Covid-19 affected three years of their education and now they are expected to go back to "normal".  What is normal for them?  They have never sat a State exam and they did not get to do their junior certificate exams because of Covid-19.  They have been tutored on Zoom if they were lucky enough to have broadband and had the finances to purchase a laptop.  If there were two or three children in the house, they may have had to share a laptop.  What was going on in their homes?  Was it a good learning environment in which to study?  How can anybody talk about "normal"?</p>  <p>  We also had absentees resulting from Covid-19 in both the student and teacher cohorts.  There was a grave shortage of substitute teachers.  How is that normal?  This cohort of students have a right to a hybrid model because there has been nothing normal about their past three academic years.</p>  <p>  I am the father of a leaving certificate student.  I have seen first-hand what this means.  He and his student colleagues even go to after-school services until 9 p.m. to try to catch up.  He has never sat a State exam.  These students are trying day and night to catch up and different teachers do not know what they have already learned.  The Government argues that this is normal but it is not normal.  The normal course of action would be to give these students the option of a hybrid approach or the choice of either a predicted grade or sitting the exam.  It is the right thing to do.  For my child, his friends and all the other students around the country, the Minister must be responsible and make this normal for them this year.</p></speech>

This includes lost tuition time, adverse classroom environments and a burden on their mental health that cannot be accurately measured.  The combination of these factors has undoubtedly affected the education and well-being of these students in ways we cannot fathom.  Therefore, it may come as little surprise that the Irish leaving certificate students are calling for a change in direction and have pointed to a hybrid model as the new way forward.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Education cannot ignore the collective voices of student representative bodies, including the ISSU, and she must act without delay to give all these students the clarity they deserve.</p> <p>My office is inundated with emails from students, mostly looking for clarity.  The education system cannot continue to be in wait-and-see mode.  The calls for the delivery of a hybrid leaving certificate must be acted on by the Minister for Education and the Government.  Where does the Government stand on this issue?  Is the Minister seeking a return to the traditional exams?  Will steps be taken to make further adjustments to the exams by having fewer questions, or by placing a greater weight on students' projects, and so on?</p> <p> The Taoiseach said two weeks ago that the possibility of a hybrid leaving certificate had not yet been ruled out, and that a decision would be made soon by the Government.  How long will the wait go on for students, teachers and parents?  Many parents and students are not at all happy with the Government for the current situation.  It is a wait-and-see game but it is not good enough.  There must be action today, and no later than today.</p></speech>

I thank very much the students in County Kerry.  I thank their parents, their teachers, the students' unions and the teachers' unions who, through no fault of their own, have had to endure a horrendous two years.</p>  <p>  Following on from the meeting last week, which was all about getting clarity for everybody, I ask the Minister, Deputy Foley, to try to deal with this as a matter of urgency.  Our students have had a horrendous time.  They have been very disadvantaged during the whole Covid situation, again which was no fault or making of theirs.  We are trying to give them an assurance that we will put in place a system that is most beneficial to them, and which would give them the greatest advantage of being the best that they can be, despite the upset in the tutorial programme and despite everything that has happened.  These are our young people and we want them to have the best in life that they can have.  We want them to achieve the best result they can get.  The Minister comes from County Kerry and I know that she has nothing in her heart and soul only to take care of the students, but I ask that the Minister would come out please to clarify it and give us the clarity that we need.  The teachers, the parents of the students and students themselves need clarity.  They are the most important people of all.  Any one of us here tonight does not matter.  It is for the students.  Their results mean so much to them.  We want them to do the best that they can be for themselves.</p></speech>

An approach that involves ongoing assessment, accredited grades and a written exam has a role to play in this process.  We must listen to the student voice.  We have all received correspondence from the ISSU, which tells us quite clearly, on the basis of a report it carried out, that the student voice is very clear and it is obvious that the students want a hybrid model.  The report refers to the stress, anxiety, uncertainty and fear of students.  We are hearing the voices of students themselves and we certainly must act on what they are telling us.  As a former teacher who worked with disadvantaged pupils quite a bit, I feel that the fairest way forward, to ensure no student is disadvantaged, is to make sure a flexible model is put in place for leaving certificate students.  We must bear in mind they will have had three years of disruption.  I have received direct reports from students who have told me that they are cold in classrooms in prefabs.  This is also having a bearing on their concentration levels and everything else.  I feel that we must be fair with them.  As the Irish saying goes, "mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;".  Listening to the student voice is paramount in this whole debate.  I am aware that the Minister is doing her best with this difficult situation but I call on her and appeal to her to do her best and take on board the students' voices.  The majority of students, 85%, are telling us in the report carried out by the ISSU that they want a hybrid model.</p></speech>

As a former maths teacher at Mercy College Sligo, and as somebody who corrected State exams for more than 15 years, I am not an expert but I do have some insight.  We are having this debate for very valid reasons, because of the very significant disruption for all leaving certificate students over the past two years.  Some students suffered more than others, and for different reasons such as access to the Internet; the ability of 15- and 16-year-olds to manage self-learning and discipline their study; their space at home; their levels of maturity; and the fact that many of the students and teachers caught Covid or were close contacts who had to isolate for significant periods of school time.  There is no uniformity here.  One student might have had less disruption, while another would have had very significant disruption to their education and learning.  Some students had to limit their time at school because of their underlying conditions, while others might have been living with vulnerable people.  Some students might have had to take on certain extra responsibilities in the home that were Covid related.  The students may have suffered long Covid.  There is a very long list of valid reasons for students seeking a hybrid leaving certificate.</p>  <p>  I listened carefully to what the Minister, Deputy Foley, said, and I am happy to accept that the Government significantly supported schools.  I fully agree with the Minister's assertion that teachers, principals and boards of management put the education and well-being of their students first, and ensured that the system kept working despite very significant challenges and some very scary days.  I listened to what the Minister said, and while I appreciate that various adjustments are being made to the leaving certificate exam for 2022, I am gravely concerned that they will not be enough, and that the adjustments the Minister referred to will, unfortunately, not be sufficient to take account of the different experiences of Covid disruption that different students had.  For example, the Minister referred to greater choice.  That is not enough.  It could easily happen, and will happen for a percentage of students, that they must answer three out of six questions.  They may have only covered three of the questions.  This gives them no choice.  Other students might be lucky enough to have covered five out of the six, which gives them a real choice.  The Minister and I both know that this can happen by chance.  It can happen that a student was absent in a particular week.  It can happen because some parents can afford grinds to cover the gaps in the course.  It can happen because some students are capable of self-learning.  If it happens, and it will happen again and again, then some students will be disadvantaged and, despite the Minister's very best efforts, they will lose out.</p>  <p>  The Minister also spoke about the rearranging the exam timetables, and holding oral exams during holiday time and out of school time.  Many students use their Easter break for revision, to catch up, or indeed for a short break.  All of that time will be eaten into and students will find their backs against the wall if they must sit oral exams then.  In many ways, I believe that holding oral exams out of school time is a retrograde step because it puts students under further pressure, and this is the last thing that I want or that the Minister wants.</p>  <p>  The Minister also said that she would increase the supply of teachers and substitutes, and she has.  This is good, but we all know that this is a stopgap and that, in general, retaining one's own teacher is what makes the difference.</p>  <p>  There will be time for a debate on the future of the leaving certificate when we have evaluated the current system and properly assessed the alternatives.  We need to do that and we need to do it quickly but tonight we have an immediate and pressing issue to deal with.  As a former teacher, as someone who loved who her job, and as someone who corrected exams, I strongly support maintaining the integrity of the exam system we are operating.  We could change the system but while we are using it we must maintain its integrity.</p></speech>
