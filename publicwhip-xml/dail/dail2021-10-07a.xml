As I understand the first phase is now complete, I seek an update on where that is at as we move to phase 2.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700003#A00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  My Department is at an advanced stage in its first phase of the two-phase procurement for regionally based employment services.  The procurement has two key goals.  First, it will see a significant expansion across the State of employment services for those furthest from the labour market.  The regional employment services will have a strong focus on local and community linkages and will help to address the post Covid-19 employment challenge.  Second, the procurement process will help to place the services on a proper contractual footing.  The existing services were first contracted for more than 20 years ago and there has been no formal procurement process in the intervening years.  This is not in compliance with standards of proper governance.  In addition, I have advice from the Attorney General's office that it is not in compliance with Irish or EU procurement rules.</p>  <p>  The procurement process follows extensive consultations by my Department with the existing service providers over the past number of years.  The Department has taken a careful and measured approach, starting with a first-phase procurement in areas not already covered by a local employment service, LES.  This minimises disruption to existing service providers and enables learnings to be taken and the request for tender, RFT, to be refined for the second phase of procurement.</p>  <p>  The first-phase procurement is just about complete.  The Department will engage further with service providers in the coming weeks to listen to their concerns arising from the first phase and, to the extent possible, take these into account in finalising the request for tender for the second-phase procurement.  It is intended the second phase requests for tender will issue before the end of the year.  Given the timelines involved in finalising the requests for tender, allowing for tenders to be prepared and evaluated, and contracts to be awarded, it is likely to be mid-2022 before the new contracts will be in place. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700003#A00600"><p>The Minister said that part of the reason for the first phase of the tendering process was to expand the service significantly for those who are furthest away from the labour market.  Does she agree that the ending of the walk-in service, which I understand will not be provided in the new model, will not do that?  I do not understand how she will reach those furthest away from the labour market when people such as carers and, perhaps, people who are facing personal challenges in their lives, will not have that walk-in service and the comfort of being able to walk into an office in their local town, as is the case at the moment with the jobs clubs.</p>  <p>  I understand about the legal advice on procurement, which the Minister has mentioned a number of times, but why change the model?  If there is an issue with procurement - we take the Minister's word on that and that is fine - what basis is there for moving from the model that exists to this new model that is being proposed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700003#A00700"><p>The Deputy will agree that I recognise the good work being carried out by our LES providers throughout the country.  I take this opportunity to assure the Deputy, and to put on record, that the Government recognises the great work being carried out by many of our LES providers.  They do great work in helping people with career guidance, CVs, interview preparation, upskilling and training supports.  I see that in my county too.</p>  <p>  The reality is, however, that the Government has to follow the legal advice it is given.  These contracts have been rolled over continuously for more than two decades.  The clear advice from the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Attorney General is that the Department of Social Protection is in breach of EU procurement rules and there needs to be a competitive procurement process for these contracts.  As much as we might like to leave things as they are, the Government cannot ignore this legal advice.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700003#A00800"><p>I am not arguing with that.  As I said, I take the Minister at her word on the legal advice but there is no EU law on procurement or anything else that requires the Department to change the model.  The Minister said there was extensive consultation.  That is fine but I assume staff in local employment services and jobs clubs did not seek these changes.  I am trying to understand where the changes are coming from.  The Minister mentioned the great work they have done.  They been there for 20 or 25 years and they have a wealth of experience.  Why change the model?  If the work they were doing was so great, why change the model?</p>  <p>  Is the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General published?  I know we will not get sight of the Attorney General's advice but, specifically, where is the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Is that something that is available?</p>  <p>  Will there be a review and evaluation of phase 1 and how will that come about?  I understand a number of jobs clubs are receiving letters to tell them their service ends at the end of this year and that is it.  Will those workers get enhanced redundancy?  How many of those letters have been issued? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700003#A00900"><p>As we know, the current cost-met model is cumbersome and involves a lot of administration for everybody, both for LES providers and the Department.  It is an out-of-date model and it means significant time and effort is spent submitting evidence for all itemised expenditure.  We want to ensure the time is better spent dealing with people who need our help and working with those people who need our support to help them find a job.  That is what we have to focus on.  The purpose of all this is to help the people who need a job.</p>  <p>  The RFT published as part of phase 1 is not a low-cost model, rather, it focuses on the provision of quality person-centric employment support.  The Department is aware that this type of service comes at a cost.  The Department believes that the financial costs approach contained in this request for tender will, if applied to the existing LES contracts either match or exceed the current costs of these contracts.  Some providers were worried that by putting in a bid for this tender they would not be able to meet all their costs.  I wanted to reassure them on that.  We want to engage with them and I will meet them when this request for tender is announced.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700003#A01100"><p>I compliment the Minister, her predecessor, Senator Regina Doherty, and her very kind staff in the Department of Social Protection who administered the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, programme.  It has been a revolutionary programme and a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of people.  It is one of the reasons we have almost beaten the pandemic and the virus.  Last week, the Comptroller and Auditor General identified a few anomalies in the scheme.  I would be grateful if the Minister will make a statement on that.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700003#A01200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  Within three weeks of the PUP being launched, more than 500,000 people were in payment.  In the initial two months to the end of April, my Department processed some 900,000 claims.  The delivery of the scheme on such a scale and in such a short time represented a major achievement by my Department.</p> <p>The recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General found that approximately 9.4% of claims awarded at different points in time during 2020 did not comply with the strict conditions of the scheme.  However, he also noted that some of these claimants would have been entitled to another payment if they did not receive the PUP, so that the net overpayment rate was probably lower.</p> <p> He also noted that the Department's observations that excluding periods when there was a high level of churn when restrictions were being imposed or relaxed, the gross overpayment rate was approximately 6%.  It was not out of line with working age social welfare schemes generally.  We would, of course, have preferred if there were no overpayment, but my Department always has to strike a balance between applying tight controls and checks on claims on the one hand and not frustrating a person's entitlement to a payment on the other.  This was particularly the case in the extraordinary and exceptional circumstances of Covid-19.  Applying normal controls would have meant very long delays in processing the unprecedented number of claims received, which would have led to severe financial hardship for many people and undermined the sense of social solidarity necessary to sustain the public health restrictions and combat the virus.</p> <p> Notwithstanding those concerns, a range of controls were implemented and have continued to be enhanced over the past 18 months, including, for example, matching against Revenue records.  The matching exercise is proving effective in early detection of cases of people working while claiming the PUP.</p></speech>

That is exactly what the Department of Social Protection should be for.  It should be there to provide a safety net and safety blanket when required.  I remember processing many claims to the Department and they were dealt with expeditiously and humanely.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Comptroller and Auditor General took a small sample of the applicants and claims that were made.  Is there a plan to do a deeper dive, a wider and more comprehensive audit within the Department, or are we going to draw a line under it and move on?  Is there going to be a further audit or will there be no more investigation into this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700004#B00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  As part of the claims approval process, claims were checked to ensure the claimant had a valid personal public service, PPS, number and other identity details.  Checks were carried out whenever applications were submitted.  In 2020, over 52,000 reviews were carried out by the Department's special investigation unit, with over 17,000 claims closed, while a further 19,400 reviews were carried out by other departmental staff, with approximately 5,800 claims closed.  Claimants were asked to confirm their eligibility on a number of occasions through online declarations in July 2020 and July 2021.  All claimants were asked to confirm their eligibility and in March 2021, 122,000 individuals who were in payment since March 2020 were also asked to confirm their eligibility.</p>  <p>  In June this year, 6,000 claimants were requested to attend offices to sign on and this exercise is currently being repeated with almost 20,000 claimants currently being invited to attend offices.  Regular checks against Revenue records are being made.</p></speech>

That is reassuring information.  I think the appropriate balance was struck between proper checks and controls, on the one hand, and proper humanity, on the other.  That is important.</p>  <p>  The figures the Minister called out at the start of her response were staggering.  Some 500,000 people had their claims processed over a three-week period.  Those are incredible numbers.  The Minister did not mention one particular statistic today, although she mentioned it in the media yesterday.  Probably the most important statistic is that only approximately 100,000 people are still in receipt of the PUP.  The trend is going in the right direction, which is also reassuring.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the appropriate balance was struck, which is good.  The PUP has served its purpose.  I look forward to it ending completely because that will mean we have seen the back of the pandemic and we hope such a payment will not be required again.  The PUP served its purpose.  The health service tackled the virus head-on, while the Department of Social Protection tackled it indirectly and that is the reason we are in this good place now.</p></speech>

Everybody in this House agrees that the Department did a Trojan job to get those payments out so quickly and efficiently.  Almost &euro;9 billion has been paid out and over 27 million payments have issued.  That support is unprecedented.  It was an emergency payment at a time of national crisis.  If we find people who knowingly abused the PUP, we will apply the full rigours of the law against them.  The media have reported on a number of cases in which the Garda has got involved.</p>  <p>  I again thank all the staff in the social protection offices the length and breadth of the country.  I, of course, believe they were major workers who provided front-line services.</p></speech>

I feel there is a gap around the statutory entitlement to paid leave for parents when they lose a child.  That is probably the most horrific time in any parent's life.  There is discretion to allow leave and it is up to the employer in all cases.  Will the Minister consider this issue?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700004#B00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Of course, the death of a child is a tragedy and the difficulties that parents and families experience as a result cannot be overstated.  Within the social welfare system, there are a number of supports for people who suffer a bereavement.  In particular, there is an arrangement known as the six weeks' payment after death, which allows for certain payments to continue to be made after a person dies.  If a person is in receipt of a primary social welfare payment that includes an increase for a qualified child and, tragically, that child dies, the qualified child payment will continue for six weeks after the child's death.  In cases where an individual has been in receipt of a one-parent family payment and an increase for a qualified child, both payments will continue for six weeks after the death of that child.</p>  <p>  In the case of carer's allowance, payment continues to be made for 12 weeks after the death of the person who was being cared for, including where that person was a child.  Carer's benefit continues for six weeks.  Domiciliary care allowance continues to be paid for three months after the death of the child being cared for.  The working family payment and the back to work family dividend also remain in payment for up to six weeks after the death of a qualifying child.  Eligibility may continue beyond those six weeks if there are other children associated with the claim.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department may make an exceptional needs payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income.  An application can be made under the essential needs payment scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses where there is an inability to pay these costs, in part or in full, by the family of the deceased person without causing hardship.</p>  <p>  In 2020, approximately 2,800 exceptional needs payments, totalling &euro;5.7 million, were made towards funeral and burial costs.  In budget 2020, &euro;60,000 was allocated to the Irish Hospice Foundation to carry out a research project into funeral poverty in Ireland, together with the wider economic impact of bereavement.  The project is expected to be completed in the near future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700004#B01000"><p>I thank the Minister for her reply.  With respect to the continuation of payments for six weeks where a qualifying child payment is made, that applies when the people concerned, both the person who has, sadly, passed away and the parents, are already on social welfare and in the system.  I am asking for a bereavement leave and benefit scheme to allow for the parents to take time off work, in a similar fashion to the parents' leave and benefit scheme, including two weeks' paid leave.  England became the first country in the world to provide such a scheme two years ago and I think we should be following suit.  I am proposing a payment in line with maternity benefit.  It would be payable on stillbirth at 24 weeks up until the age of 18, at least initially, and that is a payment for workers who do not have the additional six weeks' payment after death.  I am not talking about funeral costs either, which I understand are available to some degree as part of the exceptional needs payment.</p></speech>

She is talking about a different and new type of payment.  I will look at the issue because there is merit in what the Deputy is saying.</p> <p>Losing a child is the worst thing that can happen to a person.  The heartbreak is unimaginable.  People in those circumstances need time to grieve.  Three days is in no way sufficient.  I would like to think that the vast majority of employers would show compassion and flexibility in such cases but I appreciate that cannot be guaranteed.  I am not sure what is already in place with regard to compassionate leave.  It is probably important to say that if additional leave from work is required, it is likely that legislation to amend employment law would need to be passed.  I will raise and explore that issue with the T&aacute;naiste.</p></speech>

I am sure she has read the proposals I have made in respect of social protection in our alternative budget.  One such proposal is that parental bereavement leave and benefit be introduced.  This would be a two-week payment and would come at a very small cost.  I looked at the number of stillbirths recorded by the HSE, which estimates that there are approximately 300 every year.  I also looked at the number of deaths among those under 18 recorded by the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  The cost would be small and this leave and benefit would provide great support to parents at a terrible and heartbreaking time.  Parents should be allowed that bit of time, two weeks initially.  I am not precious about age, time or anything like that but our social protection system is there to support.  When is the need to support parents greater than at times such as these?  I appreciate that legislation would be needed but it would be very similar to existing legislation such as that regarding parental leave and benefit.  I look forward to raising this issue with the Minister again.</p></speech>

There is certainly merit in what she is saying.  Anyone who is unfortunate enough to lose a child deserves support at that time.  Three days is a very short time in which to deal with such awful grief.  Off the top of my head, I believe there may be a payment for bereaved parents in the UK.  Under that system, the employer covers the cost of the leave.  I believe the Deputy is suggesting that the State should cover the cost of this leave.  Legislation in respect of employment law falls under the remit of the T&aacute;naiste's Department but I am happy to raise the matter with him.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</p></speech>

The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;28 per week for 28 weeks, from October to April, representing a total payment of &euro;784 each year.  It is paid to 370,000 low-income households at an estimated cost of &euro;300 million in 2021.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household and is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  Qualifying payments for fuel allowance are those payments that are considered long-term payments and an applicant must also satisfy a means test.  People on long-term payments are unlikely to have additional resources of their own and are more vulnerable to poverty, including energy poverty.  It is for this reason that the Department allocates additional payments, supports and resources to help this cohort of claimants.</p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the eligibility criteria for fuel allowance to include people in receipt of short-term benefit schemes or people in receipt of short-term jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  This year, funds raised through the carbon tax will again support targeted social welfare and other initiatives to alleviate fuel poverty and ensure a just transition.  In this regard, in the forthcoming budget, the Government will consider how it can support people on low incomes and those on social welfare payments.  The outcome of these considerations will be announced on budget day. </p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost that customers are unable to meet out of their own resources.  This may include exceptional heating costs.  Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></speech>

A person in receipt of illness benefit does not qualify, irrespective of how long he or she has been claiming it for.  It can be two years or sometimes more.  People do not qualify for fuel allowance if they are getting one of the following contributory payments, namely, jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit, enhanced illness benefit, occupational injuries benefit, maternity benefit or disablement benefit.  It is important to note that a person who shares a home with, or lives with, a person claiming illness benefit does not qualify for fuel benefit either, no matter how low his or her own income is.  People do not qualify for fuel allowance if they live with someone who is getting one of the payments that qualify for fuel allowance.  For example, a pensioner living with a cancer patient who is on illness benefit does not qualify for fuel allowance even though the State pension and illness benefit combined are considerably lower than the threshold of the fuel allowance means test.</p></speech>

The fuel allowance payment is &euro;28 per week and this will cost &euro;300 million in 2021.  Some 370,000 low-income households were able to benefit from that.  The household benefits package, which consists of a set of allowances to help with the costs of running a household, includes allowances towards covering the costs of electricity or gas.  Approximately 470,000 recipients are paid &euro;35 per month at a total cost of &euro;195 million in 2021.  The living alone allowance, which is targeted at recipients of certain social welfare payments who live alone and often have significantly higher costs, is paid at a rate of &euro;19 per week.  This is paid in addition to primary social welfare payments such as the State pension.  More than 221,000 recipients will benefit from this allowance in 2021, at a cost of more than &euro;219 million.</p></speech>

One example I did not get to is that of a person who has been in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for less than 15 months.  Such a person will not qualify.  That stops such people taking up part-time jobs in the summer.  That is very unfair.  I cannot understand how the Government can stand over all of these people on benefits being disqualified from the fuel allowance.  Something I did not put into the question, but should have, is that these people on benefits do not qualify for the bonus week at Christmas.  This is totally and absolutely wrong.  As the Government negotiates the upcoming budget, I beg it to address the discriminatory rules that bar people on benefit payments from getting the fuel allowance.</p></speech>

That is why we target people on longer-term payments.  The payments the Deputy has mentioned are short-term payments.  We take the view that we should help those who are more vulnerable to poverty.  The best approach in the long term is to make sure homes are warmer and to invest in energy efficiency.  The Government is committed to supporting households with their energy costs through energy efficiency measures with a total budget for retrofitting in excess of &euro;280 million.  Programmes like the warmer homes scheme are important to help those on low incomes improve their energy efficiency.  The updated national development plan provides for an expanded investment in retrofitting well in excess of &euro;1 billion between now and 2025.</p></speech>

Will the Minister consider establishing a discretionary fund to support and assist households with mounting utility costs and bills?

My Department currently provides a range of schemes to assist low income households with energy costs.  These payments include regular payments such as fuel allowance and additional discretionary payments made under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;28 per week, a total of &euro;784 each year per household from October to April.  This has an estimated cost of &euro;300 million and is paid to some 370,000 low income households.  The electricity or gas allowance is available under the household benefits scheme at an estimated cost in 2021 of &euro;195 million.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department makes discretionary payments to help people with the cost of heating their homes.  A heating supplement may be paid to assist people who have exceptional heating costs due to ill-health, infirmity or a medical condition and are unable to meet those costs out of household income.  In 2020, 1,100 people received the heating supplement and almost 1,000 people are currently receiving it.  More generally, my Department also provides discretionary exceptional needs payments, where appropriate, to people who face difficulties in meeting fuel bills.  These payments are not ring-fenced or budget limited as they would be if they were drawn from an earmarked fund, but rather are demand led.</p>  <p>  In 2019, more than 5,000 exceptional needs payments, totalling &euro;930 million, were made to assist with household bills and heating costs.  In 2020 almost 4,300 exceptional needs payments were made at a total cost of &euro;670,000.  To the end of September this year more than 1,500 payments have been made at a total cost of almost &euro;500,000.</p></speech>

The fuel allowance is a great payment and is most welcome at the rate at which it is paid because it is extremely important for households.  However, it is only extremely important for the households who actually receive it in the first place.  There are issues, some of which were outlined by Deputy Healy Rae, such as the 15-month waiting time for jobseekers and the fact that those who are in receipt of illness benefit because they are out sick from work do not qualify for these payments.</p>  <p>  In a major study this year the St. Vincent de Paul outlined that nearly 20% of working people are cutting back on fuel and electricity due to costs.  These are people who are at work.  Those in receipt of the working family payment cannot qualify for the fuel allowance.  It is very clear that we need to go beyond the fuel allowance in the budget.  A specific discretionary fund for utility costs should be considered.</p></speech>

I encourage people to contact their local Intreo centre.  Once they meet the eligibility criteria, they will be provided with additional financial support.  A helpline is available at 0818 800024, and people can get support from that.  It is important that we consider energy efficiency in homes.  One of the best ways to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to address the energy efficiency of dwellings through proper building and household insulation.  The warmer home scheme administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is designed to do that.</p></speech>

We need to make sure people's homes are warmer, which can be done through the retrofit programme highlighted by the Minister.  It makes sure that people are warm in their homes in the first instance, which is really important.</p>  <p>  My issue with leaving this to the supplementary welfare allowance and the exceptional or urgent needs schemes is the fact that we do not know the number of people who go to community welfare offices or Intreo centres to seek payments and are refused.  All we know is the number of payments that are drawn down.  How many people seek the payment but do not get it are not data we have in terms of the supplementary welfare allowance.  That data could be greatly improved by examining all of that. </p>  <p>  There is discretion with community welfare officers; some will make a payment and others will not.  The St. Vincent de Paul have argued for a discretionary fund.  I raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste a few weeks ago and he said it will be considered as part of the budget.  Given the serious situation in terms of utility costs, we should examine this issue outside of the supplementary welfare allowance.</p></speech>

There are no limits on it.  If people qualify under the criteria set out, they will get their payments.  The exceptional needs payments scheme is also, as the Deputy knows, demand-led.  As a result, the level of expenditure of the schemes changes over time.</p>  <p>  I am saying very clearly that people who have a problem paying their bills and are in difficulty should go to an Intreo office and submit an application under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  That is what it is there for; that is its purpose.  We will continue to fund it, as I said.  We do not want anybody not being able to heat their houses.  As we face into winter, many people are concerned about bills.  I understand that.  That particular fund is there to support people.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, this country faced an unprecedented shock to the labour market as a result of the pandemic.  Under pathways to work, the Government's new employment services strategy which was launched last July, my Department has put in place a wide range of measures to assist those who are out of work in finding new jobs.  Pathways to work sets out 83 commitments on a whole-of-government basis.  The strategy is in the early stages of implementation, with progress expected to accelerate as the final stages of public health restrictions are lifted and the phased transition of PUP recipients to jobseekers' payments starts from next month.</p>  <p>  The latest data on the take-up of programmes in my Department are as follows: 90,037 participants in community employment; 5,017 in T&uacute;s; 2,594 on the back to work enterprise allowance, including the short term enterprise allowance; 2,771 in receipt of the back to education allowance; 1,921 people availing of the training support grant; and 567 employers funded to support 673 employees via JobsPlus.  The new work placement experience programme has been launched and 102 individuals have started or are due to start in the near future.  In further delivering on pathways to work, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and I assigned more than 2,600 places on community employment and T&uacute;s schemes nationwide at the end of August.  </p>  <p>  In addition, I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, to ensure that jobseekers can avail of sustainable training opportunities to assist them in accessing the skills needed to make the next step in their career.  Under pathways to work the Minister's Department is committed to providing 50,000 additional education and training places, supporting the delivery of actions set out in the apprenticeship action plan and supporting 50,000 long-term unemployed persons in further education and training by 2025.</p></speech>

The real issue is what is happening to the take-up of those places by those who need them at this time.  Specifically, do we need to look afresh at the waiting times for some of these schemes?  There are waiting times for many people to participate in back-to-education, back-to-enterprise, start-up and other schemes.  Also, we need to see whether there is a network of employers engaging with programmes such as apprenticeships, where work experience and working on the job are crucial.  Could some additional effort be put into mobilising both employers and people who need placement over this tricky period, before people go at risk of becoming long-term unemployed?</p></speech>

A few months ago the projections were telling us that we would still have well over 100,000 on the PUP at the end of the year.  In fact, we will now fall below the 100,000 mark next week, which will be significant and a important milestone.  Some 500,000 people have come off the PUP since the peak.  It is our plan in the Department of Social Protection to have job fairs - we had them in the past - at which we will link people who are looking for work with employers.  I saw that work very well before.  We have a number of different initiatives.  We will have a campaign to make employers aware of what is available to them and then, through our job activation measures, we will work with people who are unemployed.  The time people spend on the PUP will be counted towards any scheme or training they go on.  It is important to say that time spent on the PUP will be taken into account when they are trying to get onto some other scheme.</p></speech>

I know there is a restart support for them, but I think we will have to look closely at those people to see whether they can survive financially and whether a second fillip can be given to that really important part of our workforce.</p></speech>

It is a really good question from my colleague, Deputy Bruton.  Has the Minister any figures as to what skill sets people who are left claiming the PUP have?  I am particularly interested in hospitality.  Does the Department have details on that?  Dublin is full of half-empty restaurants not because people do not want to book but because of the lack of capacity of the restaurants in question to meet the demand in respect of their kitchen staff.  That is why many of the restaurants throughout the city and in the suburbs have vacant tables.  It is because they simply cannot get staff.  Can the Minister break down how many hospitality people are still claiming the PUP?  I presume that is one of the gaps to which Deputy Bruton referred.  How can we fill those gaps, encourage those people to return and facilitate employers to take them on?</p></speech>

Also, the last time I looked there were approximately 10,000 from the construction sector, which is quite a lot when you think about it.  As I understand it, however, what the construction sector is looking for is higher skilled workers, and those on the PUP are probably the lower skilled workers or general labourers.  This is what pathways to work is about.  It is about upskilling and reskilling people, getting them back into the workforce and training them to meet the demands in the jobs that are now available.  I have had people from the hospitality sector speak to me about the issue that they cannot get staff.  The only problem is that I think many people have returned to their own countries and are no longer here, and I think some of them are not coming back, which creates more difficulties.</p></speech>

The facts are that, since 1996, 209 women and 16 children have died as a result of domestic violence.  Women's Aid tells us that last year over 29,000 contacts were made with the organisation, an increase of 43%.  Serious and absolutely appalling crimes are being committed and the Minister's support must continue.  What does the Minister intend to do about increasing flexibility for victims of domestic violence in respect of rent allowance?</p></reply>

This seeks to ensure that victims of domestic violence are not prevented from leaving their home because of financial or accommodation difficulties.  The arrangements in this protocol are additional and complementary to, and not a substitution for, the range of other supports already in place for victims of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  The co-ordination of the services addressing the needs of these customers is managed by the Child and Family Agency, Tusla.  The accommodation needs of victims of domestic violence are met through this joined-up service delivery model provided by Tusla with close involvement of the various housing authorities nationwide.</p>  <p>  Under the protocol, access to rent supplement can be provided on referral from Tusla or by a prescribed Tusla-funded service provider.  Rent supplement is provided for an initial three-month period without the standard means test being applied.  Financial assistance can also be provided to assist the customer with a rent deposit or towards the cost of rent in advance.  After the initial three months have passed, a further three-month extension can be made under the protocol subject to the standard means assessment and eligibility criteria of the scheme.  Under the protocol, after six months of support, it is expected that the customer will, if eligible, be able to migrate to the housing assistance payment or other social housing supports, supported by his or her local authority.  A total of 140 recipients have availed of support under this protocol since August 2020.  There are currently 52 victims of domestic violence being supported with rent supplement under these arrangements.</p>  <p>  In line with the national economic recovery plan, these special arrangements for victims of domestic abuse will remain in place until the end of 2021 at least.  A review of the pilot is under way.  It is a good scheme.  We need to support women who become homeless because of domestic violence, and I want to see the scheme continued.</p></speech>

The facts are absolutely shocking.  Women's Aid tells us that 24,800 women contacted the organisation last year about emotional, physical or sexual abuse.  It is absolutely appalling.  I know from its annual report that three women died violently last year as a result of domestic violence, 709 women were faced with the threat of murder, 148 pregnant women were abused and there were 28 miscarriages.  This is an appalling situation, and we cannot do enough to help these women.  Women's Aid requests in its annual report - and I appreciate that this request has been made of the Department of Justice and other Departments - that there be more places of safety, appropriately funded and supported, for women and children to get safety when vile, evil people are trying to kill them or abuse them in the most appalling, unacceptable, criminal way.</p></speech>

The Government has taken significant action in tackling the scourge of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It has provided additional relevant supports during the pandemic.  As we know, victims have been particularly vulnerable at this time.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, allocated &euro;30 million to Tusla, the highest allocation for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services to date.  This includes &euro;28 million in core funding and an additional &euro;2 million to address Covid challenges.  As Minister for Justice, I fully support all the supports we give to this initiative.  We have provided &euro;4.1 million in funding to support victims of crime and some &euro;3 million for raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The Department of Justice continues to provide Covid-specific funding for organisations.</p></speech>

Earlier, I heard a discussion on "Morning Ireland" about a regional rape crisis centre that is looking for a significant increase in funding.  It is well worth supporting people in that situation.  Indeed, we cannot do enough to help those voluntary organisations.  I appreciate ad fully respect the work the Minister is doing.  We must all act together in a stronger and more cohesive way to support all the people in these terrible and appalling situations.  Last year alone, I understand that more than 290,000 people accessed the Women's Aid website looking for information.  There is much pain, trouble, hurt and anger out there.  We must continue the supports the Minister outlined.</p></speech>

The work to implement all the recommendations of the O'Malley report, as set out in the Supporting a Victim's Journey strategy, continues to be a priority.  As part of the implementation of Supporting A Victim's Journey, the Department of Justice reviewed the supports and funding it provides to civil to society organisations offering front-line services.  This was done to map the journey that faces victims and identify the gaps in available support.  Work is now under way with NGO partners to fill the gaps identified, which mainly relate to training and supervision issues.  This falls under the remit of the Department of Justice and there is a lot of work going on in that regard.  We have written to all Departments to see how we can have a cross-government approach to this issue and what they need to do to feed into the strategy.</p></speech>

As he is aware, the PUP is an income support provided for employees and self-employed persons who lost employment as a direct consequence of the public health restrictions introduced in March 2020 to address the adverse health outcomes from the Covid-19 pandemic.  More than 870,000 workers have received a PUP payment in the intervening period.</p><p>  The number of people in receipt of the payment peaked in May 2020, when it reached in excess of 605,600.  The scheme closed for new applications on 7 July.  This week, just over 101,400 individuals remain in receipt of payment under the scheme, representing an 83% reduction compared with the peak.  During 2020, the number of people in receipt of PUP dropped from June, once restrictions eased and as people returned to their work, to approximately 206,000 by the end of September.  Experience from last year showed that some 400,000 people closed their PUP claims once the economy partially reopened.  This is clear evidence that the vast majority of people returned to their employment, once it was available to them.</p><p>  The number in receipt of the PUP rose again when restrictions were reintroduced at the end of 2020, reaching a new high in early February 2021, when 481,000 were in receipt of payment.  The number in payment has decreased every week since 9 February 2021, with approximately 380,000 individuals leaving the scheme.  This again demonstrates that people are returning to employment as it becomes available.</p><p>The detailed statistics requested by the Deputy, showing the figures at their peak for each county and making a comparison with the number in receipt of payment this week, are set out in a table that forms part of the reply to this question.  In May 2020, for example, Dublin had 174,939 people in receipt of PUP; this week, the number is 38,513, which is a 78% reduction.</p><p><b>Table: PUP Numbers by County</b> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>County</b></th>       <th><b>May 2020</b></th>       <th><b>This week</b></th>       <th><b>% decrease</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>7,134</td>       <td>891 </td>       <td>88%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>10,014 </td>       <td>1,336</td>       <td>87%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>14,979 </td>       <td>2,319</td>       <td>85%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>62,858 </td>       <td>8,834</td>       <td>86%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>22,726 </td>       <td>2,951</td>       <td>87%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>174,939 </td>       <td>38,513 </td>       <td>78%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>33,338 </td>       <td>5,178</td>       <td>84%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>22,352 </td>       <td>3,250</td>       <td>85%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>26,900 </td>       <td>4,587</td>       <td>83%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>11,573 </td>       <td>1,562</td>       <td>87%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>9,794</td>       <td>1,424</td>       <td>85%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>4,067</td>       <td>556 </td>       <td>86%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>22,075 </td>       <td>3,375</td>       <td>85%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>4,434</td>       <td>690 </td>       <td>84%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>17,114 </td>       <td>3,088</td>       <td>82%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>16,499 </td>       <td>2,165</td>       <td>87%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>26,830 </td>       <td>4,809</td>       <td>82%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>8,342</td>       <td>1,248</td>       <td>85%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>9,124</td>       <td>1,233</td>       <td>86%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>7,646</td>       <td>984 </td>       <td>87%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>7,786</td>       <td>1,056</td>       <td>86%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>18,627 </td>       <td>2,288</td>       <td>88%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>13,764 </td>       <td>1,895</td>       <td>86%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>11,414 </td>       <td>1,591</td>       <td>86%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>20,620 </td>       <td>2,494</td>       <td>88%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>18,629 </td>       <td>2,978</td>       <td>84%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Unknown</td>       <td>2,095</td>       <td>175 </td>       <td>92%</td>    </tr> </table> </p></speech>

It cannot be said often enough that we owe thanks to the staff and officials of her Department for responding with such flexibility and agility as each crisis phase of the pandemic demanded and ensuring people got money in their pocket quickly, which was very reassuring.  The Minister, in her reply, has helped to put a lie to the notion that there were many people scamming the system.  There is strong evidence to show that people went back to work as soon as their employment became available again.</p>  <p>  She referred earlier to people returning to their home countries and not coming back to Ireland.  Are there any statistics showing whether a portion of those people continued to claim the PUP after returning to their home countries and, if so, is there any indication of whether they intend to come back?  Gaps have opened up in some places in the employment market and data in that regard would be helpful.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that a huge number of people have not gone back to their previous sectors; they have gone into other jobs.  This is one of the reasons that some sectors are finding it difficult to recruit staff.  Employees have moved on and taken jobs in other areas.  I can get the Deputy the figures in that regard.  My understanding is that some 40% of people who have come back into employment have taken jobs other than their original roles.  I will check that figure, however, as I am not certain about it.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for his recognition of the work done by the staff of the Department of Social Protection during what was a very difficult time.  To give some figures, almost &euro;9 billion has been paid out under the PUP scheme, with more than 27 million payments issued.  It was an unprecedented support provided by the Government at a time when it was needed.  It was the right thing to do and I take this opportunity to thank the staff again.</p></speech>

I would be very interested in the data the Minister referred to, including a granular breakdown of the numbers who returned to work but not to their previous occupation.  In the case of the hospitality sector, anecdotally, the story around Dublin, including in my constituency of Dublin South-West, is that a good proportion of staff returned to pubs and restaurants but, in addition, a significant number, because of the uncertainty right through the lay-off period and the continued uncertainty arising from ongoing lockdowns, decided they had enough of hospitality.  They could not be sure of what the future holds for the sector and they need certainty in regard to their profession, career progression and income.  What steps can be taken to offset that?  Those people are clearly lost to hospitality and that is manifesting itself in restaurants, where a casual observer might think that empty tables means an establishment is not busy.  When we delve into it, however, the reason the tables are not occupied is that the kitchen does not have the capacity to serve customers at those tables.

The most important thing they have to do is reskill, which requires training opportunities.  That is why my focus, together with that of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, is on making sure people have the skills and confidence to take on new roles.  We will be holding employment and recruitment fairs around the country to match jobseekers with job opportunities that arise.  As public health restrictions ease, my Department is starting to ramp up its engagement with jobseekers.  We contacted all PUP recipients by telephone and, arising from that process, a number of webinars on employment supports were held.  We will see more of that in the coming weeks and months.  It was encouraging to see the number on the live register fall to just below 170,000 this week.</p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Those are all good signs that people want to get back to work.  The most important thing is that we give them the tools to do so, whether that is financial support via the back to work allowance or upskilling and training.  In May, one in four people on the PUP was under the age of 25.  That is now down to one in ten, which means that young people are getting back to work.  That is good news.</p></speech>

I add my voice to the voices of those who have commended the people working in social protection and the necessity of making sure those payments were made.  However, there are still certain sectors which, although they are reopening, will not do so to the degree necessary.  It is about making sure we have all the connectivity and protections that are needed.  There are certain skill sets in event management and so on that we would not like to be diverted into other work because that is an issue with which we would need to deal.  It is about making sure that the entire system is working holistically in order to deliver.</p></reply>

To date, more than &euro;8.7 billion has been spent supporting workers impacted by the pandemic through the PUP.  Since the lifting of restrictions and the success of the vaccine roll-out, the numbers on the payment have fallen dramatically - to 101,470 payments this week from a peak of more than 602,000.  It is important, therefore, as the economy reopens and in the interests of equity and sustainability, to restore standard social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s economic recovery plan, the PUP is gradually being wound down using a tapered approach over a six-month period from last month until February 2022.  As PUP customers move to the &euro;203 rate, they will be transitioned to standard jobseeker terms.  The process of moving to a standard jobseeker&rsquo;s term for the first group on the &euro;203 rate of payment was due to begin in early September.  I deferred this process until after all sectors start to reopen in line with the recent roadmap, Reframing the Challenge: Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting.  This means that affected customers will continue to receive their PUP payments until 26 October, when the process of their transition to jobseeker&rsquo;s payments will begin.</p>  <p>  The Department has written to all affected customers to outline the details of the transition and the options that will be available to them.  Customers entitled to jobseeker's benefit will be automatically transferred to this payment after 26 October.  Where an application for jobseeker's allowance is submitted, the person will remain on PUP until their entitlement to jobseeker's allowance is determined and their application is processed.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, not all people in receipt of PUP will be able to return to their former employment.  Even though we know that the economy is recovering and employment is growing strongly, some people will need support to move into new jobs or different sectors of employment.  Under the pathways to work strategy, my Department will be working to ensure that people on PUP receive all the support they need.</p></speech>

It is logical that the Minister cannot remove the PUP until, at least, all sectors are open.  However, there will not necessarily be a big bang after which every sector will have opened.  We need to avoid certain cohorts and people falling into gaps.  Similar to Deputy Lahart, I would be interested in getting granular information in respect of those who have moved sectors and so on.  That is necessary information from which we should probably learn.  All Members know that a cursory audit of the jobs that will be needed in the future would show the gaps that exist.  We have to ensure that the training provided looks in that direction.  We need to keep this under consistent and constant review to ensure that we can maintain the skill sets that are necessary in those sectors and to allow people to transition, where necessary, into new types of employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700009#G00700"><p>I will supply the figures in respect of people who have gone into different sectors.  Those figures provide us with important information to allow us to plan and help people to go into sectors where there are vacancies.  It is also important that we work with the sectors and that each sector is investing in making itself an attractive place in which to work.  That comes into the equation, and employers have to consider their situation.</p>  <p>  The original plan was to start the transition of people from the PUP to jobseeker's payments at the start of September but, as I stated, I postponed that until after 22 October, when all sectors will have reopened.  As the emergency phase of the pandemic recedes, it is important, from a fairness perspective, that we begin the transition of people from the PUP to the normal social welfare payments.  The Department has written to all those who are due to transition at the end of October and outlined the options available to them in terms of applying for jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance, whichever is more favourable.  It is important to state that persons moving from the PUP to a jobseeker's payment will have the same criteria and rules applied to them as are applied to those who are already on the live register having lost their jobs pre pandemic or since the PUP closed for applications on 8 July.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister that the sectors have to make themselves attractive places to work.  Members are aware of the difficulty caused by the fact that families cannot get home care packages because there are not enough home carers.  That is a sector we have to facilitate.  An element of work is being done by the Government in that regard, but these are the gaps that need to be filled from an employment point of view and a societal point of view.</p>  <p>  I will digress slightly, and I apologise for doing so.  All Members know the difficulties relating to local employment services.  They look after people who are not necessarily low-hanging fruit or ready for the job activation schemes that grab the low-hanging fruit.  What information does the Minister have from the Attorney General regarding local employment services?  We need to see what leeway there is in respect of the tendering process.  It may be necessary to have a conversation with the European Commission on the matter.  We have seen that the European Union has been able to bend rules during the pandemic.  That might be necessary in the context of delivering a service for people.</p></speech>

I will come back to that.</p>  <p>  Time spent on PUP will count towards eligibility for various employment supports, which is very important.  Activation measures include training, work placement programmes and employment schemes.  The time spent on the PUP by recipients allows them to qualify for all of the support schemes that are available.  As people move off the PUP, we will give them that option and suggest that they may wish to try a particular road.  We are here to help.</p>  <p>  As regards local employment services, the Deputy knows the story.  We expanded the service and put it out to tender.  I hope to announce the results of that tender shortly.  The truth is that I have the legal advice.  If I could leave this alone, I would quite happily do so but, unfortunately, the legal advice is that the procurement process cannot continue in its current format as it is against the rules.  We have to do it.  We have had significant engagement with the local employment services and will continue to do so in the context of this process.</p></speech>

A protocol to assist victims of domestic violence has been established between the Department of Social Protection and Tusla.  Under the protocol, victims of domestic violence will be able to apply for rent supplement or referral by Tusla or Tusla-funded service providers.  What measures have been taken to assist victims of domestic violence access rent supplement?  How many people are accessing this payment, particularly in my area of Carlow-Kilkenny?</p></reply>

In August 2020, I agreed a protocol with Tusla on a pilot basis to make rent supplement more easily accessible to victims of domestic violence.  This seeks to ensure that victims of domestic violence are not prevented from leaving their home because of financial or accommodation difficulties.  The arrangements in the protocol are additional and complementary to, and not a substitution for, the range of other supports already in place for victims of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  Currently, 52 victims of domestic violence are being supported with rent supplement under these arrangements.  Under the protocol, after six months of support, it is expected that the customer will, if eligible, be able to migrate to housing assistance payment, HAP, or other social housing supports supported by their local authority.  In line with the national economic recovery plan, these special arrangements for victims of domestic abuse will remain in place at least until the end of 2021.  A review of the pilot is currently under way, involving key stakeholders, to determine whether the provision of rent supplement to victims of domestic violence should be extended and to take on board any lessons learned.  The service has been successfully delivered and is available nationally with active tenancies using the protocol in nearly all counties.</p></speech>

Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, we have all seen that there were - and continue to be - issues for those experiencing domestic violence.  Indeed, in counties Carlow and Kilkenny, there has been an increase in the number of reported incidents of domestic violence.  I have worked with victims in my clinic.  I have seen their eyes.  The increase in the number of reported incidents of domestic violence is not exclusive to my area.  More than 3,000 extra incidents were reported during the pandemic.  It is important, therefore, that supports are made available across the board.  Having access to cash is an essential lifeline for victims of domestic violence, as well as having a place where they feel safe.  They must be provided with the means to afford the essentials.  We must ensure that support is there for families.  I have found that sometimes there are barriers to accessing this vital support.  Some of the barriers are administrative in nature.  I would appreciate it if the Minister could look into the matter.</p>  <p>  Another concern I have relates to accommodation services for victims.  Increasing numbers of women who are looking for accommodation are coming to my clinics.  I have raised the issue with the Minister previously, but there is no emergency accommodation for victims in County Carlow.  I acknowledge the work done by Carlow's local authorities, the local Women's Aid and all the different services in helping victims of domestic violence.  However, this is an issue that needs to be looked at.</p></speech>

The Department is leading the development across Government of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  That strategy will place a priority on the prevention and reduction of such violence and will include a national preventative strategy.  The new strategy is being co-designed in partnership with the sector.  The Department is working with NGOs on that.  It will be the most ambitious strategy to date and will radically improve services and supports for victims.  In terms of the supports available, the Department of Justice will continue to have lead policy responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  However, there is an onus on other Departments to step up to the plate.</p>  <p>  As far as the Department of Social Protection is concerned, we have made rent supplement more easily accessible to victims.  That is only right and proper.  The issue around accommodation likely falls within the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  This is about joined-up thinking.  The Government is taking this matter very seriously.</p></speech>

We need to focus on those areas.  A cross-departmental approach needs to be taken.  We must work together to support the strategy.</p>  <p>  I also wish to ask the Minister about victims of domestic violence who are seeking support.  Perhaps funding could be provided for training through Tusla or Tusla-funded services.  I have worked with victims.  Sometimes there are language barriers.  I have also worked with people who have, for example, an intellectual disability, a hearing problem or literacy issues.  Are Tusla courses available or is training provided for these victims?  It is important that we can deliver for whoever comes to our door looking for help regarding domestic violence.  I stress again that it is important that the different Departments - namely, the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Justice and Health - work together.  As the Minister said, the issue falls under the remits of a number of Departments.  If we all work together and on a cross-departmental basis, our response will be stronger.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated that 52 victims of domestic violence are being supported with rent supplement.  In the grand scheme of things, is that a low figure?  Are we doing enough to get information out there?  Perhaps we need to look at providing more information through local authorities.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth funds Tusla.  A number of recommendations in the O'Malley report have also been introduced as part of the Department of Justice strategy entitled Supporting A Victim&rsquo;s Journey: A Plan to Help Victims and Vulnerable Witnesses in Sexual Violence Cases.  There has been an increase in funding for NGOs providing court accompaniment services, related information and support services.  As part of the implementation of Supporting a Victim's Journey, the Department of Justice reviewed the supports and funding it provides to civil society organisations providing front-line services.  This was done to map the journey that victims face in order to identify the gaps in supports available.  Work is now under way with NGO partners to fill the gaps identified, which mainly relate to training and supervision issues.  A lot of work is being done, and rightly so.</p></speech>

There are graduated and more flexible rules for persons aged over 55 and, then again, for those over 62 on CE.  Participants over the age of 62 can participate on a continuous basis up to the State pension age on the CE service support stream.  Currently, up to a maximum 10% of CE places are allocated to the stream.  There are 1,400 CE participants on the stream.</p>  <p>  The number of participants who left CE on reaching retirement at age 66 on the service support stream since 2016 is as follows: 34 persons in 2016; 35 persons in 2017; 146 persons in 2018; 244 persons in 2019; 369 persons in 2020; and 329 to date in 2021.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants, CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long-term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, including those whose employment has been impacted by Covid-19.  At the same time, the eligibility criteria for CE and the length of time persons can stay on CE is kept under active review by my Department to ensure the best outcomes for individual participants and to support the vital community services delivered by schemes.</p></speech>

I feel that over the years, the Government concentrated on the job activation element of the CE schemes and did not value or appreciate the important social inclusion element of these schemes and the vital work that they do.  Indeed, I know that many stakeholders are interested in that strand, which involves retraining and expanding.  The change to the standardised condition relating to the period for which a participant can remain in the CE scheme is most welcome.  I am very aware of the social inclusion element, but what I want to know is what is the availability of places for those over the age of 62.</p></speech>

Currently, there are 1,400 service support stream participants on CE schemes.  There are 500 places available for people over the age of 62 on the schemes.  Up to 10% of CE placements are available under the service support stream.</p> <p>That limit is set on a divisional basis so there is also flexibility between schemes in a particular area.  This is important to note.  For those aged over 55 there are more flexible conditions regarding the time spent on the community employment scheme.  It can be up to three years.  Those on the scheme prior to 2017 can be on it for six continuous years.  We have flexibility to facilitate people in the cohort the Deputy has spoken about to stay on the scheme that little bit longer.  I would say that it is, by characteristic, a job activation scheme at its core.</p></speech>

I believe there are more than 20,000 participants on community employment schemes but only 30% to 40% of these placements are categorised as social inclusion.  I have come across facilities that rely on CE scheme staff for vital community operations.  They have told me any participant aged 60 and over, and not aged 62 and over, should be able to remain on the CE scheme continuously until the State pension age, with an increase in the number allowed on each scheme.  One centre in Carlow had two participants aged 60 who had to go back on jobseeker's payments although they did not want to do so.  They wanted to stay on the scheme.  They found it hard to get a job.  It can be cruel and unfriendly when we get to that age.  I ask the Minister of State to look at this.</p>  <p>  As individuals receive approximately &euro;20 per week for participating on a scheme, there should not be an added cost to the Exchequer by implementing these types of changes, while the community would benefit immensely.  I know the Minister of State supports the valuable service and much needed opportunity it provides to allow individuals who may not work otherwise to contribute to their local town or village, particularly in many rural communities such as my own.  I would appreciate it.  It is all about community and this plays a huge part.</p></speech>

In recognition of this, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I will be involved in an operational forum with sponsors and other stakeholders from throughout the country.  We will hear issues such as those outlined by the Deputy.  This is the reality on the ground and we recognise it.  We have introduced flexibility.  It is also important to state that while initially we had flagged November as the beginning of the exit from placements, we have stretched it out to February.</p></speech>

Electricity prices are way ahead of what they were in 2019 as are gas and solid fuel prices.  Families' heating bills have increased dramatically.  This has been compounded by the increase in carbon taxes and the subsidisation of data centres.  While we need to increase the fuel allowance we also need a longer term strategy to address fuel poverty.</p></reply>

The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;28 per week for 28 weeks, a total of &euro;784 each year, from October to April, to 370,000 low-income households at an estimated cost of &euro;300 million in 2021.  The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet these costs in full.  Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  All recipients of non-contributory payments are accepted as satisfying the means test for fuel.  People who are in receipt of a qualifying contributory payment must also satisfy a means test.</p>  <p>  A fuel applicant and members of his or her household may have a combined assessable income of up to &euro;100 a week above the appropriate rate of State pension contributory and qualify for a payment.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty, including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.  Any decision to amend the criteria would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p>  <p>  This year, funds raised through the carbon tax will again support targeted social welfare and other initiatives to alleviate fuel poverty and ensure a just transition.  In this regard, in the forthcoming budget the Government will consider how it can support people on low incomes and those on social welfare payments.  The outcome of these considerations will be announced on budget day.</p></speech>

The challenge is in physically achieving these targets.  One of the main measures on fuel poverty is improving energy efficiency in our homes.  There are 7,000 families in receipt of the fuel allowance who have been waiting 26 months to have these retrofits carried out.  The Minister is aware that the Oireachtas joint committee, in its pre-budget recommendations, has asked the Minister to engage directly with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to fast-track the delivery of these projects and to introduce a half-rate fuel allowance for people who are just over the income threshold.</p></speech>

In 2016, the Government launched a comprehensive strategy to combat energy poverty following extensive publication.  Deputy Naughten is very familiar with this as a former Minister who was involved in it.  The strategy was spearheaded by the then Minister with responsibility for the environment.  The strategy sets out the Government commitment to protecting vulnerable households from energy poverty through a combination of supports, investment in schemes to improve energy efficiency, and energy efficiency awareness initiatives.  The Deputy is absolutely right that the best long-term approach is to make sure homes are warmer.  We need to invest in energy efficiency.  The Government is committed to supporting households with their energy costs through energy efficiency measures, with a total retrofit budget in excess of &euro;280 million.  The Deputy raised the issue of the delays.  I expect that Covid has made the situation somewhat worse.  This does not mean we should not be addressing it.  I will raise the matter with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, directly.</p></speech>

We need to increase the fuel allowance.  We need to increase the rate and extend the period.  This needs to happen in this budget.  This will be a treadmill unless we take a long-term strategic approach to improving the energy efficiency of every home throughout the country.  We need to target those who are fuel poor.  We also need to develop clustered bungalow housing for older people in our towns and villages so they can sell up older large houses and move into far more energy-efficient homes closer to services.  The Government needs to drive this.  We also need to ensure those families over the income thresholds that cannot afford to put the capital investment along with the grant aid are able to access 0% loans to carry out the retrofits needed to their homes.</p></speech>

Recipients of the contributory State pension can claim an increase in their pension in respect of a qualified adult, subject to a means assessment.  A qualified adult is the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the pensioner who has been wholly or mainly maintained by that pensioner.  The means assessment reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of income or capital are in a position to use these resources to support themselves so that social welfare expenditure can be directed towards those most in need.</p>  <p>  Entitlement to the contributory State pension is based on a person&rsquo;s social insurance record and the personal rate of payment is not subject to a means test.  Only the spouse or partner of the claimant is means-tested.  An increase is payable at the maximum rate of payment where the means of the spouse or partner are &euro;100 a week or less, while reduced rates are payable where the means are over &euro;100 or less than &euro;310 per week.  No increase is payable where the means of the spouse or partner are in excess of &euro;310 per week.  The means assessed include income from employment or self-employment, non-social welfare pensions and the capital value of savings, investments and property other than the family home.  It should be noted that the value of the family home, regardless of who the legal owner is, is never taken into account in this assessment.  Where savings, property or other assets are held jointly, the spouse or partner&rsquo;s means are taken to be half of the total amount.</p>  <p>  It is a matter for each couple to decide how their finances are arranged and the Department has no role in this.  The current means-testing arrangements are based on the actual means of the spouse or partner at any given time.</p></speech>

In particular, I have indicated that I will be seeking additional investment to ensure providers can operate sustainably; their employees can benefit from improved pay and conditions; there is improved accessibility for children; and, as the Deputy said, there is improved affordability for parents.</p>  <p>  Early learning and childcare is a public good and brings benefits to society as a whole.  The importance of these services has become all the more evident during the pandemic we have just gone through.  We need additional public investment in order to fully realise the ambitions we have for this sector.  With this in mind, the programme for Government undertakes to fulfilling the commitment in First 5.  That will include an investment target of &euro;1 billion in childcare by 2028.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that an expert group has been working with my Department to help guide future decisions about public investment in early learning and childcare.  This group is comprised of national and international experts who have significant experience in the area of early learning and childcare, the systems it operates and its funding.  An independently chaired group, it has undertaken an in-depth programme of research and analysis and engaged in an extensive and detailed stakeholder consultation.  The group has commissioned a series of reports examining various issues, in particular international comparisons, approaches to reducing cost to parents and mechanisms to control fees internationally.  The report of the expert group is being drafted and is on track to be submitted to me in November.  I have met the chair of the group and I have been briefed on its progress.  This has very much informed my Department&rsquo;s bid in the context of this year&rsquo;s budget Estimates.</p>  <p>  I will deal with a number of closely-related questions on childcare costs and investment this morning and I hope to have an opportunity to expand further on these issues.  I obviously cannot give details of the budget at this stage but I know this is an issue about which the Deputy and other Deputies are concerned.</p></speech>

I welcome his statement that childcare is a priority and that he regards it as a public good because that is the model we need to adopt for our childcare and early years sector.  It needs to be seen for what it is, namely, an excellent public service on which everybody relies and that ultimately benefits children.  That has to be at the heart of everything we do.</p>  <p>  As the Minister is aware, we have some of the highest fees in the world.  In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, which is largely rural like many other deserving areas, people can pay in the region of &euro;650 per month for one child.  I know some people in Dublin will probably think that does not sound too bad but the area should be borne in mind and the additional cost for those with a second child.  Some people are deciding exactly when they will have children based on childcare costs.  It is crazy that we are in that situation in this day and age.  I take this opportunity in advance of the budget to ask again that the budget include something for this sector.</p></speech>

In recognition of that, very substantial investment has been undertaken by the Government to support the sector during the Covid-19 period, including through payments of &euro;34 million per month under the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  Every month, this money is invested in childcare services across the country.</p>  <p>  We have also recognised wider issues, including the very low rates of pay that staff receive.  For this reason, we introduced a joint labour committee, JLC, as an important first step in addressing that issue.</p>  <p>The Deputy rightly raised the issue of the impact of fees on families who are struggling.  It is important to see the issues of affordability, sustainability for services, pay and quality as being linked.  We have to look at them together and in whatever proposals I bring forward, I will try to link all these issues, and the overarching issue of quality for children, because they are linked and we cannot deal with one without dealing with the others.</p></speech>

I consistently make the argument that fees are an issue for parents, wages are an issue for those working in the sector and sustainability is an issue for providers.  In fairness, the vast majority of providers started out as small businesses run mainly by women from home.  All of a sudden, the whole system has gone insane in terms of paperwork and regulations.  No one has an issue with regulation, particularly in respect of children, but a common sense approach is needed.  As I repeatedly point out in this House, such an approach is lacking.</p>  <p>  One of my other questions is on those working in the sector, early years educators, so I will not discuss that aspect now.  However, these issues are linked, which is why they need to be addressed together.  </p>  <p>  While I recognise the Minister's point about what is in the programme for Government, the Government has had one budget and its second budget is approaching.  We need to start seeing that investment next week.</p></speech>

As the Deputy stated, they are primarily led by women with a passion for providing education and care for the children and babies in their care.</p> <p> While the NCS is a very good system, it has its flaws, as we discussed in the context of our debate earlier this week.  We have seen in the past that where additional investment has been put into it in order to support parents by reducing fees, it has often been subsequently wiped out in the form of fee increases.  In many cases, those fee increases are understandable in the context of an individual service struggling with expensive bills it has to pay or with wages it is seeking to pay its staff.  Looking at all these matters in the round is important.  It is an issue of investment, which is key, but so too is the additional regulation in respect of that investment.</p></speech>

People Before Profit agrees.  If we want happy, healthy and developmentally successful children, we need proper State investment in early childhood education and childcare.  The Minister spoke earlier about all the supports given during Covid and so on, but will he accept that the previous model completely failed?  It was a disaster for children, workers and families.</p></reply>

We need to achieve this alongside our continuing work to improve quality, sustainability and accessibility.  This year, my Department is investing &euro;638 million into the sector and affordability for parents is a key policy objective in the context of that investment, separate from the Covid supports I mentioned.</p>  <p>  There are two major schemes we use in regard to the direction of that money, namely, the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, and the national childcare scheme, NCS.  Together, these schemes provide for two years of free preschool education, with more than 100,000 children benefiting from ECCE each year, universal NCS subsidies of up to &euro;1,170 per year for up to 16,000 children under three years of age, and the income-assessed NCS subsidies, which can be up to &euro;11,934 per year for up to 64,000 children up to the age of 15.  This combined approach to funding seeks to provide support for all children and families while offering progressively greater supports to those who have the greatest need.</p>  <p>  I am proud the Government has committed to that increase to an investment of &euro;1 billion per annum by 2028, and I am determined to play my part in achieving that.  The new funding model, which I discussed earlier, will be a key vehicle to ensure this.  I referred earlier to the expert group established in 2019 that has been working on this new funding model based on the idea of progressive universalism, which it is seeking to achieve and deliver through its report.  Extensive research has been commissioned by the expert group, all of which is available on the First 5 website.  It covers various issues, such as a delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, model, control of parental fees and so on.  The expert group will send its report to me in November and I will publish it subsequently.  In the meantime, I am using its influence in my budget bid this year.</p></speech>

These are inadequate sums.  Families are spending 34% of household income on childcare, compared with 3% in Austria and 6% in Sweden, and that is despite childcare workers in many cases earning just the minimum wage.  There is a crisis and the Government proposes, basically, to go back to normal.  UNICEF recommends that spending on childcare and early childhood education should be equivalent to 1% of GDP.  Given our inflated GDP, we might instead use GNI*, but &euro;638 million represents just one third of 1% of GNI.  Even &euro;1 billion by 2028, and who knows whether we will ever get there, is still substantially short.  It would need to be &euro;1.8 billion to reach 1% of GNI*.  The Government is failing the country's children, something that will leave them disadvantaged for life.  At the very least, we should have a commitment to a national childcare service and to increasing funding to 1% of GNI*.</p></speech>

We have only been putting money into childcare for the past ten years, so we have come from zero investment then to this figure now, and we have to continue to increase that figure.  I do not agree we are going back to normal.  We are introducing the joint labour committee, JLC, to provide a pay structure for these incredibly low-paid workers, who tend to be women.  We understand that has to be supported by the Government and the Government will take action to ensure we do so.  We are creating a workforce development plan because when I speak to young women who have just completed their degrees, they often do not see a future for themselves working as childcare professionals even though they will have just spent three or four years completing their level 7 or level 8 programme.  Creating a clear career pathway is another essential element of retaining staff within the sector.</p></speech>

The Minister stated nobody disagrees we are underfunding childcare but, with all due respect, he is the Minister.  He can go outside, perhaps, and join a protest against his own Government, as Government Deputies like to do.  He is part of the Government and it makes these decisions.  If it increased the level of funding for childcare and early childhood education to 1% of GNI*, that would mean the extension of the early childhood scheme from 15 hours for 38 weeks a year to 30 hours for 48 weeks a year and increased funding for the national childcare scheme to subsidise costs for all parents.  It would reverse cuts to after-school services in disadvantaged areas and it could result in wages for childcare workers moving to a minimum wage of &euro;15 an hour.  The Government can make the decision to do that.</p></speech>

As Minister, it is important I listen, which is why I attended the protest earlier this week to hear from childcare professionals, people working in services daily and managers of these services.  It was not the first time I met many of these people.  I met many of them online over the past year because I listen.  Changes will be made on foot of the information we get back.</p>  <p>  As for the longer term vision for childcare, a substantial piece of work is coming to us that will map out how we can increase public investment but also increase public management of the system.  That is essential because it is not enough just to throw money at the system; we have to have increased public management.  The JLC is part of that process but there will be other elements that seek to ensure the additional money we put in delivers affordability, quality and sustainability.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, the programme for Government commits to achieving that, which would represent an investment of &euro;1 billion per annum by 2028.  This would be a very substantial increase in the voted expenditure for the sector, which amounts to &euro;638 million this year.  The new funding model I mentioned earlier will be a key vehicle to ensure the additional investment delivers those important returns for children, families and the State.  We want to ensure that when we put additional resources into early learning and childcare, we will get the best possible use from them.  The expert group, which is independently chaired, is leading on this issue and has undertaken a significant volume of research.  It has also engaged with the various stakeholders within the sector, which is important.</p> <p>The emerging findings from the national childcare scheme are also contributing to the evidence that underpins its work.  It has very transparent deliberations.  It has published the research and that is available for anybody to engage with.  The report is being finalised and will be submitted to me in November.  It is influencing my input into the budget negotiations this year, which are still ongoing.</p> <p> As regards the NCS and the issues that were raised outside the D&aacute;il earlier this week, I have engaged significantly with the Deputy about this.  We have introduced some interim changes to broaden sponsorship and to create a sustainability fund where services are in difficulty, but I have also asked for a separate piece of research in the context of how the NCS worked in its first year to look specifically at its impact on services that are disadvantaged.  I am conscious of this issue and we are getting the research to ensure that our responses are properly targeted to dealing with the problems that have emerged.</p></speech>

I have raised this with the Minister on a number of occasions and I acknowledge that he came out to meet people at the protest on Tuesday.  However, I can give a few practical examples.  There are several services, not just in my constituency but nationwide, which point out that siblings are in the old model and children coming into the system now are falling outside of that.  The service, therefore, is trying to make up the difference.  I understand the sponsorship situation, but in the vast majority of these cases people will not go to Tusla.  In general, families do not want to bring that service on themselves, so they will not go down that road.  If that is said to them, they will more than likely just pull their child out of the service.  Services are stepping up and, through other funding streams and, basically, by robbing Peter to pay Paul, trying to keep those children in that system.  They feel very guilty, even though they should not.  However, they are saying to a family whom they might know for years, "Sorry, we cannot take you in".  We really need something next week in that regard.</p></speech>

Undoubtedly, an issue has arisen regarding services in areas of high disadvantage, but we must work to fix the issue with the NCS as opposed to going back to some of the old schemes.  The future is with the NCS.  However, the Deputy is correct.  Sponsorship is not the fix.  I undertook the broadening of sponsorship to give support to services in the interim.  That was an element in assisting approximately 2,000 young people across the country to access services straight away, but I accept that it is not the overall fix.  An issue has arisen and we have to do the research to determine how exactly we can bring about a fix that is long-lasting and ensures that those services, which are often making up the differences themselves with their own resources, are properly resourced into the future.</p></speech>

What people are seeking in the interim is that the older funding be kept in place until a solution is found.  In that way nobody is paying a price and nobody is disadvantaged.  Otherwise, we are potentially coming up with a solution when many of the services for these children may have faced closure point.  In addition, at the meeting of the committee on children last Tuesday, one of the points made by the after-school services was that, while they are not a childcare service but a separate type of service, a new funding stream or model should be examined for them.  That should be considered as part of the review.</p>  <p>  I also wish to mention briefly the people who are working in the sector.  Next week, we must see something in the budget for those early years professionals.  They do amazing work and are on very low wages in very difficult situations.  They have to see something next week to give them hope to stay in the sector.</p></speech>

As long as I have had this role, I have been engaging on this issue.  The Deputy has raised it, and I give her full credit for that, but I have engaged on this issue.  I have met with the services and listened to the issues.  We have introduced some interim solutions to try to get more children into the scheme and give them the full number of hours.  We are undertaking the research and we will act on foot of that.  That is the way to go.  This is an issue that has arisen and I know from engaging with services that they foresaw this, but rather than having a knee-jerk response to it we want to undertake that research to determine exactly how we can bring a fix to the NCS to ensure that it continues to work effectively for everybody and that nobody is left at a disadvantage.</p></speech>

We have to help parents to build a nurturing and loving environment, which is critical for a child's learning, emotional well-being and social development.  However, the latest survey in 2019, conducted by the European Commission, revealed that childcare costs in Ireland are among the highest in Europe.  The survey by Eurydice on early childhood education and care in Europe studied 38 countries.  It found that Ireland had 398,000 children under the age of five years.  I am not aware of another survey since that.  What is the Minister doing at this point to address childcare costs in Ireland?</p></reply>

The major programmes funded by the Department are the early childhood care and education programme and the national childcare scheme.  The ECCE programme provides free access to early learning and childcare for 15 hours per week for the two years before the child starts primary school.  That significantly offsets the childcare costs for parents at that stage.  The national childcare scheme provides universal and income-assessed subsidies to parents.  The universal subsidy is for children up to the age of three years and the income-assessed subsidy is for children up to the age of 15 years.  They are available for up to 45 hours per week.  They are very substantial and are a vital support from the State for parents.  However, I recognise and agree with the Deputy that childcare costs for parents are still too high.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 brought major challenges for the early learning and childcare sector.  In line with many other services, those services had to close and then operate at lower capacity.  They also had to meet the important public health requirements.  We were able to support parents and children during the pandemic.  In addition to the investment by my Department, the Government provided very substantial supports to the sector to keep services open and operating safely and to ensure they are sustainable and can meet the additional costs that Covid has generated for them.  There is strong evidence that those supports have worked.  In 2020, there was no significant increase in fees for parents, which was unlike previous years in which there were very substantial increases.  In 2019, there was an 8% increase, but in 2020 and 2021 there were no substantial increases for parents.</p>  <p>  However, affordability remains a key concern.  It is an issue I am very conscious of in the context of the budget negotiations this year, but it is also an issue that is linked to the sustainability of services and the pay for staff in the sector.</p></speech>

I appreciate that he is doing his utmost as a new Minister, but when he fires all those figures at us I can give comparable figures for other countries so he will know that we are not investing enough in childcare.  The report from Eurydice in 2019 stated that the average monthly cost for childcare in Ireland for one child was &euro;771, compared with an average monthly cost in the Netherlands of &euro;572.  That is &euro;200 in excess of the cost in another country which is a very close neighbour and obviously has a childcare structure that works.  Recently, the OECD stated that this country invests the least amount in early years of any developed country as a percentage of GDP.  I appreciate the Minister's figures and that we are increasing our input into childcare, but it is not enough.  The Minister knows that too.  It is not enough when compared with other countries.</p></speech>

We are among the lowest in Europe and in OECD countries, and we need to invest more.  We have only been investing for ten years, which is an embarrassment to Governments going back over the generations.  We also need to manage how we invest that additional money.  We do not want to put significant investment into the NCS for that to get eaten up by increases in fees across all services.  These services are trying bring in additional income so they can pay their staff a living wage.  All these elements are linked and it is important that increased public investment is linked with increased public management.  We need to bring together the two elements of increased investment with increased public management a significant way over successive budgets.</p></speech>

Front-loading the investment into childcare might help avoid waiting lists, mental health issues and everything else that we endure.  Ireland has consistently remained at the bottom of the class and the lack of investment costs us all.  Parents pay the highest amount of take-home pay on childcare fees in the European Union.  Providers operate precariously in a highly complex funding model which benefits nobody.  As the Minister knows, the average pay and conditions for the employment in the sector remain poor.  I appreciate that he is trying to come to a conclusion on that so everything works together but the reality is that it is leading to serious challenges with staff recruitment and retention.  We need to look at the social benefits as well as the economic benefits down the line.</p></speech>

In response to an earlier question I said that investment in early learning and childcare is a key public good and I think we are all in agreement there.  We need to recognise what the investment, while not enough, is achieving at the moment.  We have a fantastic childcare sector in this country which, despite the lack of investment it has received, has done so much over the years and particularly during the Covid pandemic.  We need to recognise the work that the childcare professionals and providers are doing.  We need to support this sector with public investment.  We need increased public management.  We have done considerable work on how those various inputs can work together to deliver the core goal of allowing parents provide the best possible first start for their children.</p></speech>

We should be encouraging full participation in all aspects of political and social life.  What steps is the Minister taking in this regard?</p></reply>

I watched the meeting of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, which had an active conversation on the subject.  It continued to the Make Way Day conversation.</p>  <p>  I am currently advancing the preparation of the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill, which will provide for an amendment to section 41 of the Electoral Act 1992 to make it easier for persons with intellectual disabilities to stand for election to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  The national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, now extended until the end of 2022, has been one of the primary vehicles for supporting the participation of people with disabilities in public life.  It takes a whole-of-government approach to improving the lives of people with disabilities both in a practical sense and in creating the best possible opportunities for people with disabilities to fulfil their potential.</p>  <p>  My Department co-ordinates this strategy and I chair the NDIS steering group.  The steering group membership includes the disability stakeholder group, a voluntary group of individuals with expertise and lived experience of disability, who participate in monitoring the implementation of the strategy.  For that group, Covid has changed the dial of our engagement and understanding.  There has also been a complete awareness and willingness of Departments to come to the table and find solutions to break down the barriers.  I compliment those from the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Department of Education who have attended recent meetings and shown their willingness to work with the members involved to break down the barriers.  I also compliment the Oireachtas on setting up the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, which has lent a voice and put an emphasis on disability in these Houses.</p></speech>

I hope that continues because it is vital to ensure that all voices are heard, especially for a sector that makes up such a large part of our society, but unfortunately is largely hidden and not seen or noticed by us policymakers.</p>  <p>  I heard at a committee meeting that 24% of people with disabilities have difficulty even accessing their ability to vote and 52% who have postal votes have difficulties in using that facility.  Some 55% have difficulty contacting a public representative.  I have a role in ensuring we are more accessible to people and I will be working to ensure that is the case.  The Government can do a considerable amount and I am glad that it is making progress.  However, that needs to continue and it needs to be strengthened because we must make politics accessible, as the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities outlines.</p></speech>

Its ratification in 2018 marked an important milestone in the process of strengthening the rights of people with disabilities.  the Deputy spoke about electoral reform.  Dr. Vivian Rath produced a document.  He has the lived experience and he was able to bring people with him to inform our committee meetings of the barriers to understanding.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and his team have worked to ensure that access to polling would be one of the main barriers to be removed.  We also need to be ambitious and move beyond it and encourage people to participate in the electoral process at local authority level and at national level to have their voices heard.</p></speech>

Impaired people with disabilities may fear they will get lost in the party system with no avenue to ensure their perspectives are fully considered.  This is surely an indication that being an Independent is the way to go as it allows people to work independently on behalf of everybody.

I ask him to consider my voice within a three-party government.  I would like to think I have a significant advocacy role for persons with disability.  The Taoiseach put me working with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  It would not be possible to have two more open-minded people within that Department who are strong advocates for inclusion and equality for persons with disability.  I would like to think that our leaders and our parties have disabilities at the centre of their agenda at all times.  Coming up to the budgetary process, I wrote to all Ministers to ensure that they disability-proofed their budgets.  In advance of the publication of the national development plan, I wrote to ensure they proofed their budgetary submissions.  Equality and inclusion for persons with disabilities is front and centre of our role in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  People with disabilities are well represented and their voices are well heard.</p></speech>

I know he and I have engaged extensively on the matter, and as I said to other Deputies earlier, my Department is currently investing &euro;638 million in early learning and childcare, amounting to approximately 60% of the total income of the sector.  Most of the rest of the income is from parental fees.</p>  <p>  The investment of &euro;638 million in 2020 is distinct from the funding that early learning and childcare employers can access under the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  As the Deputy knows, businesses in the sector are exempt from having to prove a 30% reduction in turnover as I was able to negotiate that exemption for them.  For each month during Covid-19, that exemption has represented an additional &euro;34 million investment in the sector.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits us to the First 5 strategy and commits us to the target of &euro;1 billion being invested per year by 2028 and I have noted that for the additional public investment to work, we must have greater public management.  That is why we have had the expert group researching how to link more money being invested with better outcomes for parents, children, providers and childcare professionals as well.  The expert group has been researching the matter and it will bring its report to my Department in November this year and I am looking forward to receiving it.  I have been engaging with the group since coming to office and I have a sense of where its recommendations will end up.  The group has certainly inspired my budget bid to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform this year.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to speculate on the exact construction of the final recommendation from the expert group but I know it comprises national and international experts and they have very much looked around the rest of Europe and further in considering what models work to ensure public investment is combined with public management to get those really important outcomes for children.</p></speech>

I suppose the proof of the pudding will be in budgets in years to come because he is right in that significant investment is being made.  Nevertheless, significantly more investment must be made.  The EWSS in the childcare sector has given us a taste of what a significant State investment in the staffing costs of childcare providers could do.  I welcome its extension and I would like to see it extended further until other arrangements are put in place.</p>  <p>  The Minister is also correct that we must also have proper management and governance.  The community childcare model is the place to start in this regard.  The Minister has, very kindly, met several different childcare providers from Ballymun and Finglas, comprising a range of different models.  It was very clear that negotiating that patchwork quilt of different schemes for different sectors is a nightmare.  We must move to a model that is far simpler and more targeted at those areas that need such resources.</p></speech>

We had good online engagement and I met them face to face on Tuesday outside Leinster House when they formed part of the protest.  We had another really useful conversation.  That is really useful for me in understanding the real-life implications of the policy decisions we make in the Department.  I really value those engagements.  The Deputy is correct that the trajectory is really important and the budget this year will demonstrate that trajectory.  It is just as important to look at what we have done during Covid-19 as a demonstration, I hope, of how we can build good faith with the sector with measures like the EWSS supports that the Deputy mentioned.  There are also measures relating to that idea of public management, including setting up the joint labour committee, JLC, which has been sought for years.  We have started that process and we are also well advanced in work on the workforce development plan in order that new people coming to the sector will be able to see a clear career pathway.</p></speech>

He is quite correct in saying this is part of our commitments in the programme for Government.</p><p>The optional protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is an international treaty that establishes two procedures aimed at strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the convention.  The first is an individual communication procedure allowing individuals to bring petitions to the committee claiming breaches of their rights; the second is an inquiry procedure giving the committee authority to undertake inquiries of grave or systematic violations of the convention.</p><p>The programme for Government reiterates the commitment to ratify the optional protocol after the first reporting cycle.  At a recent sitting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Disability Matters, the Secretary General of my Department advised members that both I and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, are open to an earlier ratification of the optional protocol.  Our intention is to prepare for ratification of the optional protocol once the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has been commenced and the decision support service is operational.  This is scheduled to take place in June or July of next year.  A detailed process is needed to ensure Ireland's legislative provisions and redress mechanisms are sufficient to meet the obligations that will arise once Ireland opts into the optional protocol. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will work intensively to ensure that we can meet these obligations.</p><p>The Government recognises the importance of ensuring people with disabilities have all the appropriate channels to vindicate their rights.  I am advancing the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill, which will include provisions necessary to enable the reform of capacity law contained in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to become operational.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has separately announced a review of the equality legislation, which prohibits discrimination, including against persons with disabilities.  The review is intended to assess whether the equality legislation continues to be effective in protecting people against discrimination.  The Minister will bring forward legislative proposals if necessary thereafter to strengthen the provisions of this legislation.</p></speech>

Now, as part of the Government, she is actioning much of what she called for then.  Is there a timeline on earlier ratification or is it completely dependent on the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act being commenced?  She has indicated that this might happen by June or July next year.  Is it a firm commitment that this will be done before the end of next year's summer session or will it depend on the work being done by both the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in the Department?</p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows directly the frustration of people with disabilities and those with additional needs because we are signing up to all these charters but that does not make a difference to their daily experience of services.  While these are all gold-standard flag-waving occasions, the lived experience of people with disabilities and those with additional needs is worsening.  I acknowledge in particular the work being done by the Minister of State in clearing assessment waiting lists because children with disabilities and their parents are continuing to go through the wringer on a daily basis despite all of what we are signing up to.</p></speech>

There are three elements to this, with the first being the securing of funding last year in the budget.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, was successful in doing that and the funding ensures we can recruit staff to work on the decision support services.  That is in train and the funding, which was in excess of &euro;3 million, was secured.  That work is under way to ensure we deliver on the target of having a decision support service in place by June to July of next year.</p>  <p>  The next element is the legislation being brought forward in this session that amends the 2015 Bill.  That will put a legal footing in place.  We need to have those elements in place.  The third element is the publication of the UN report going before the Cabinet.</p> <p>We are on target, at this moment in time, for next June or July.  Once those three pathways are cleared, we then will be in a position to follow up on what the Secretary General said before the Oireachtas committee on working towards the publication of the optional protocol. </p></speech>

I also do not expect either her or the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to give us sight of the budget.  I acknowledge the extra investment but it is not being seen on the ground.  We have had this conversation.  It seems to go into a big black hole and people's lived experience continues to worsen and disimprove.  When the budget is published there will, possibly, be extra resources, but where are they going?</p>  <p>  Members of the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers tell me that it is in the worst state it has been in for many years.  They have not had the capacity to fundraise as a consequence of Covid.  That fundraising was the difference between them being able to provide a service and being able to assist families in very hard situations.  We will have massive amounts of millions and billions of euro announced on Tuesday and then, ultimately, as part of a service plan, but we need to see where that is being spent.  We need to see if that will help our communities and families.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State finalises her budget this weekend, I ask her to keep that in mind.  Billions mean nothing if people are not getting respite, if their child cannot get a place in school and they cannot go to their local town, as we saw during Make Way Day.  Billions mean nothing if they cannot get a service.  </p></speech>

My budget is not finalised at this moment in time.  I am still in negotiation with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, for my fair share for disability.  The Deputy is correct; intervention has to be the priority.  There is no point in clearing an assessment of needs waiting list if I cannot deliver on intervention.  I need more money for therapists.  I need to build on the 100 therapists I got last year and the 85 earlier this year.  I need to build on that.</p>  <p>  At the same time, we are coming out of Covid and we are still not out of it.  Respite was closed for most of that period, especially for young people.  We need to build on existing capacity.  Last year, I secured nine houses in the budget.  Eight of them are built and are going into operation, while the ninth is happening in December.  I need to double that because I saw how successful it was.  It released a valve and gave breathing space to families.  This time, my ambition is to have nine houses for children and nine for adults.  That is building capacity into the system without, at the same time, forcing people into full-time residential care.</p></speech>

I have noticed there are now villages in my constituency that were very small places 20 years ago but have grown hugely with the building of new housing estates in that time.  These places now have many young people approaching teenage years but, unfortunately, the facilities and services have not kept in train with the development of those towns.  We now have a situation where many young people have very little to do at weekends, especially at night-time.  They are hanging around the streets with nothing to do.  I would like to talk about that and how we can help that situation.</p></reply>

The work being carried out by national youth organisations through volunteer-led clubs and groups is of major importance.  It can be transformative for young people.  That is why my Department has worked hard to continue to support these services through a range of funding and other measures.  In 2021, we are providing &euro;66.8 million, through a number of schemes, to support the work of youth services and national youth organisations.  That includes an additional &euro;5 million in extra spending I got in budget 2021 in particular recognition of the work being done by these services, how they struggled during Covid and how they stepped up to support young people during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Many of the schemes funded by my Department are delivered through the education and training boards, ETBs, throughout the country and with funding from my Department, the ETBs employ dedicated youth staff and conduct needs assessments of their areas to determine their subsequent funding schemes.  The needs assessments must have regard to a number of factors, including population growth, which the Deputy highlighted as a key issue.  In my Estimates discussion for 2022, my Department is again referencing the data on demographics that affect young people.  My officials hold quarterly meetings with senior management in the ETBs throughout the country.  These meetings help my officials to identify service needs and emerging issues and, in particular for vulnerable young people, to plan how we address them.</p>  <p>  In 2021, the additional &euro;5 million provided is assisting existing youth services to deliver services and to expand their reach to additional young people.  We also used that money to set up six brand new services throughout the country.  These services will respond to the increased needs of young people in these areas and the very specific needs of certain groups.  </p>  <p>  This is a sector I value and of which I am highly supportive.  Again, in my engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I will seek to continue to increase support for the sector in this budget.  </p></speech>

It is important that he always bears in mind that population growth happens throughout the country.  It is not something that is only happening on the east coast.  Many pockets throughout the country have seen major growth in population.  For example, Milltown, which used to be a village and is now a town, is quite close to where I come from.  When I started knocking on doors there almost 20 years ago, there were two housing estates in the village.  There are now more than ten estates and the population has grown massively.  There is a great youth club locally, and other facilities, but a lot of the time there is not much for young people to do.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the great work being done by youth services in Kerry, throughout the county, and the support they get from the Department.  The ETBs also do marvellous work, but there needs to be better joined-up thinking between established community organisations and our youth services.  Rather than re-inventing the wheel, there should be greater collaboration to put on events and things that will attract young people.  That is something we could work a little more on.  </p></speech>

It is important to recognise that.  We recognise population growth occurs all over the country.  In rural areas, a youth service may often be the only outlet for young people, whereas there are other choices in highly urbanised areas.  We put significant investment into some of the big operations in Kerry, such as Kerry Diocesan Youth Services, KDYS, which is the key linchpin in providing substantial youth services across a large number of areas.  We also support the national organisations that are available, such as Scouting Ireland and the Irish Girl Guides, and those small youth services the Deputy referred to.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point on joined-up thinking.  Youth information is one of the things we have invested more in this year.  That sounds a little abstract but youth services see it as very important in trying to get information to them about funding and other ways they can integrate with other Government supports.  </p></speech>

Much of the social fabric of the country has been ripped asunder in the past year and a half.  While we need to put that back together, with that comes an opportunity.  The Minister referenced KDYS, which does marvellous and great work in Kerry but all our sporting organisations and community councils also do great work.  Rather than youth services feeling the onus is on them and them alone to look after our young people, we should have a more collaborative approach where we interact with the established clubs and organisations rooted in every community and have a more youth-focused approach, with activities that are outside the core activities of those organisations.  That will certainly be part of the solution.</p>  <p>  I welcome the investment.  Capital will also be needed to create centres in certain areas of population growth.  For example, the KDYS youth centres in Kerry, and those throughout the country, are great places but we need more of them and they need to be resourced.  That is not easy, but it something that is very worthwhile.   </p></speech>

There is a focus on that post pandemic.  We are seeing unemployment rates come down, which is very important, but there is a group of young people who are very distant from further and higher education or employment.  A youth service is often the first engagement they have with any sort of State supports.  They will not go into an Intreo office or to a social welfare office but if you get them into a youth service you can then talk to them about soft skills and, possibly, putting a CV together, just in case.  That initial engagement can be very important in getting them that first job and getting something on their CV that builds their confidence.  We are looking at how we can support those services to work in areas outside their core activities and thus broaden the influence of youth services in the country.</p></speech>

When the mother and baby homes commission report was released, many promises were made to survivors.  What is the status of the implementation of the 22-point action plan, following the publication of the final report of the mother and baby homes commission of investigation?  It is important that survivors are aware of progress on the 22 recommendations.  Where are we on those?</p></reply>

This is an issue she raises with me on a regular basis, and I thank her for her ongoing engagement.  As she said, in response to the final report of the commission of investigation, the Government approved a suite of 22 specific measures.  My Department is finalising a high-level action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  I intend to bring this action plan to Government and publish it later this month.  Once approved, the action plan will support structured implementation with defined governance and monitoring processes for each of the 22 actions.</p>  <p>  At the same time, my Department has been steadily working to develop individual measures to ensure that survivors see tangible results as early as possible.  I will outline some of those.  It is important to reiterate that there is a dedicated counselling support service available and it continues to be available nationwide for all survivors of these institutions.  I have also established a dedicated information management unit within my Department, with a professional archivist to manage the commission's archive of records and support access for individuals to their personal information.</p>  <p>  A key element of the Government's response is to develop a scheme to provide financial payments in the form of enhanced medical cards.  I tasked an interdepartmental group with developing detailed proposals with a human rights focus, informed by significant consultations and engagement with survivors.  I will be bringing costed proposals to Cabinet for proposal on the matter later this month.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, we published two substantial items of draft legislation.  The birth information and tracing Bill seeks to enshrine in law the right of access to a full and unredacted birth certificate.  That Bill is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny but, as I said to the committee last week, my Department continues to engage with the Attorney General on the issues that are arising and to bring forward early amendments.  Separately, I am considering the committee's report on the certain institutional burials Bill.  I think we are all in agreement that the children at the site in Tuam deserve an appropriate burial.  I am determined to achieve this dignity for them and their families through this Bill.</p></speech>

Communication from the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is very important.  We are working with the Minister and other Departments.</p>  <p>  Survivors speak of urgency, particularly because so many of them are much older now than when the commission began its work.  That is a concern.  Those people are anxious to receive redress.  This scheme is expected to open next year.  I appreciate the work the Minister is doing but I feel that perhaps we should try to have more communication with different groups of survivors.  History does not inspire survivors.  Look at what happened with Caranua.  Look at the Ombudsman report into the Magdalen redress scheme.  Years later, some women have yet to receive compensation and medical support.  We cannot let that happen in this case.  For decades, this State oppressed women and children.  We cannot further harm them by dillydallying on these recommendations.  Can the Minister assure me that enough urgency is being placed on this matter?</p></speech>

She has made important points.  I will try to offer her reassurance.  I hope the action plan, with each of the 22 points, and how we intend, quarter by quarter, to implement them, will provide some reassurance.</p>  <p>  The point the Deputy made about communication is really important.  It is an issue that has been raised when I have met survivors, particularly when I met survivors' groups in Tuam at the end of August.  I have endeavoured to improve the amount of communications we send, particularly through the dedicated email list, to survivors.  That has been acknowledged.</p>  <p>  I also take the Deputy's point about the provision of redress and the importance of learning from the mistakes of previous schemes.  That came through to us very strongly during the extensive consultation we did with survivors via the interdepartmental group.  It also came through in the paper from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  That is central to the scheme I am seeking to design and get Government approval for shortly.</p></speech>

He is right, I have met with him regularly and I know he is totally committed.  I thank him for that.  I also know he has met with some survivors from my own area.  I am delighted to tell him that we are working on five plaques in the County Carlow for cemeteries and buildings.  We are making that change, although it is slow change.  I am delighted to be part of my own group in Carlow.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister has been asking the local authorities to review the lands that formerly housed mother and baby homes to prevent unsuitable development from proceeding.  That is important.  We must treat sites with delicacy, as we are doing.  I am aware that the Minister is moving on many of the recommendations and associated works.  As the Minister knows, I am a delighted to be a member of the children's committee.  We are working on the adoption and tracing legislation, which is important.</p>  <p>  What is the update on medical cards?  Many survivors have contacted me about medical cards.  People are not getting any younger and it is important that we ensure we deliver as many of the recommendations as we can as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is valuable when they see that local recognition of what happened to them.  I recognise the work the Deputy has done with the group she helped to establish in Carlow, the members of which she introduced me to.</p>  <p>  The treatment of these sites, particularly in the context of development plans, is something that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I have been engaging on.  I wrote to him a number of months ago and I know he is engaging with local authorities.  I spoke to him about this matter earlier this week.  Work is continuing in terms of the guidance he will give to local authorities about how these sites should be protected within county and city development plans.</p></speech>

Further arrivals are expected over the coming weeks.  A further 13 Afghan nationals, or three families, arrived in Ireland in September on foot of Ireland's pledge to relocate refugee families from Greece following the fires in the Moria camp on Lesbos.  The cohort relocating from Greece also included 39 Syrian refugees, comprising eight families.</p> <p> My Department has co-operated with a wide range of organisations, including Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee Council, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to identify individuals and families whom we could welcome to Ireland under the Irish refugee protection programme.  We have prioritised human rights defenders, people who have been supporting women's organisations, members of the LGBTI+ community, journalists and those who are most at risk from the Taliban takeover.</p> <p> While responding to the needs emerging from the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, we continue to meet our existing international humanitarian obligations, particularly in continuing to bring Syrian refugees from camps in Lebanon and Jordan to Ireland.  I am pleased to report that the IRPP recently undertook and completed a mission to Lebanon, interviewing over 260 individuals with a view to providing them with refugee status here in Ireland.  A further selection mission for Syrian refugees in Jordan will take place next month.  The IRPP aims to transfer selected refugees from both missions to Ireland as soon as possible. </p> <p> The IRPP supports are normally intensive in nature because of the vulnerability of many programme refugees.  Programme refugees qualify for housing provided by local authorities or through community sponsorship groups.  They also have access to intensive English language supports provided by the education and training boards across the country.  Conscious of the dangers experienced by many Afghans, the IRPP has sought to respond innovatively to this crisis, including by seeking support from potential refugee sponsors and civil society organisations to enable it to maximise the number of places available on its programme for Afghan nationals.</p> <p> It is expected that not all arrivals from Afghanistan will need the supports normally extended to refugee families, such as language classes and orientation.  Refugees will be assisted to access services such as education and health services by the IRPP.  The provision of assistance with travel to Ireland is being examined, where required.  Accommodation is being sourced through a range of initiatives including, but not limited to, public pledges and community sponsorship.  This is intended to ensure that we do not place additional pressure on local authorities' housing resources, where possible, and to enable Afghan refugees to be admitted as programme refugees and to have access to employment at an early stage.</p> <p> I particularly recognise the community sponsorship model that has been used and implemented by many groups across the country.  Under Community Sponsorship Ireland, a trained group of people in a community come together and commit to supporting a refugee family with education, employment, medical supports and housing for a period of up 18 months after a family arrives in Ireland.  This helps to prepare refugee families for a new and independent life in Ireland.  It has been absolutely crucial in integrating families who have experienced absolutely incredible fear and terror in initially leaving their home countries before possibly spending many years living in incredibly precarious circumstances in a refugee camp.  These community sponsorship groups are helping to integrate these families into their local communities.  It is a really selfless act.  My Department continues to support these groups.  As I said when speaking on Afghanistan earlier this week, if any Deputies know people in their own constituency who are interested in setting up a community sponsorship group, I ask them to please get in touch so that we can provide them with all of the relevant information.</p></speech>

Like all of us, I was particularly concerned about reports of violence and coercion against women and girls, including reports of forced marriage, sexual violence and serious human rights abuses perpetrated against civilians across Afghanistan.  Ireland acted swiftly and compassionately to demonstrate our support for, and solidarity with, the Afghan people.  The Minister and his Department are to be applauded.  This is an important development.  There are many in Ireland with deep concerns for family members who have remained in crisis.  Almost 250 places were allocated on the IRPP for Afghan citizens who have worked on human rights issues.  Everything that we do to assist is of great importance.  What is the situation regarding accepting Syrian refugees under the IRPP?</p></speech>

From my direct engagement with members of the Afghan community living here in Ireland, I know that things are very bad in Afghanistan right now.  The PR savvy approach we saw from the Taliban in the initial weeks is not reflected in life in the country.  That is why, in providing for refugees, we have targeted those who are most vulnerable including women, people who support women, people who are in the LGBTI+ community and journalists.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right about Syria.  We have a pre-existing commitment to bring 2,900 Syrian refugees to Ireland by 2025.  As I have said, we accepted a group of 50 in September.  They arrived in Ireland in mid-September.  We had a mission in Beirut with a view to bringing over a further 260 refugees.  We are sending a mission to Jordan next month to organise the next group.</p></speech>

Do we have the resources?  That is the thing.  Do we have the wraparound supports?  I know the Minister spoke about them.  They are part of the solution he is working on.  I am also concerned that we are in the process of ending direct provision.  A number of issues are arising after resettlement.  That is another priority for the Minister.  It is very important.  One area I am particularly interested in is that of education for the children and young adults who come here.  My office has received queries regarding the Student Universal Support Ireland grant.  This scheme is not available to those who have not lived in Ireland for three years or more.  We are offering safety and security.  We also need to offer housing, education and opportunity.  It is very important that we give opportunities.  I know the Department is working on that.  We all have concerns.  I thank the Minister for addressing them today.</p></speech>

We do have the resources.  In last year's budget, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, provided my Department with an extra &euro;5 million that we used to specifically target unaccompanied minors.  These are young people under the age of 18 who do not have any family and who have fled.  Many such young people are on the island of Lesbos in Greece.  Between this month and last month, we brought over 28 unaccompanied minors.  We provide them with supports which are very resource intensive, but which are very necessary, in residential care centres or specifically designed foster care situations.  I recognise Tusla for launching F&aacute;ilte Care, which provides fostering designed specifically for unaccompanied minors.  I met some of the families.  They are absolutely amazing.  I recognise the work that is being done.</p></speech>

I know the Minister is committed to ending the system of direct provision.  I know that from our talks on the programme for Government.  I would like to get a sense of where we are in that regard.  Do we have a timeline for it?  I fear that the system might conspire to dilute the Minister's ambition.  Will the Minister assure me that is not going to happen?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="11:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700019#R00900"><p>It will not happen.  As the Deputy will know, we published a White Paper.  Since then, my Department has taken a significant number of steps to implement these reforms.  A staff team was established in my Department to lead the transition to the new model.  It has developed a detailed implementation plan.</p> <p>We have a programme board, chaired by my Department, which has Government and independent membership.  This will provide detailed oversight and advice to the implementation team.  At the moment it is meeting monthly to review and monitor the progress of the reports.</p> <p> I recently announced the membership of the three-person independent advisory group to monitor and report independently on my Department's work and that of other Departments in terms of implementing the White Paper.  It is made up of really eminent people, including Dr. Catherine Day, Dr. David Donoghue and Dr. Lorcan Sirr, experts in the area of direct provision, international human rights law and housing, all of whom are essential in terms of delivering this plan.  The status of those three individuals will give real confidence in respect of their independent oversight.  No doubt sometimes it will be critical oversight.  That is really important.</p> <p> I want to recognise the work my Department has done with the Housing Agency.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, opened its resources up to us and it is working with us in terms of designing specific housing needs because housing is absolutely key in addressing this particular issue.  We have access to the expertise in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in terms of designing new funding mechanisms, sourcing accommodation and designing new ownership models.</p> <p> My Department has also begun work on an integration policy.  Key to the White Paper is the idea of integration from day one.  Irrespective of whether somebody gets a final decision of status, we will seek to integrate that person into his or her community from day one.  It will take time to end direct provision.  We have always said that the date will be the end of 2024.  Some people say that is too long.  It is an ambitious timeline to make as big a change as we are setting out, but I am absolutely committed to ending direct provision and having a new international protection support service in place by the end of 2024.</p></speech>

There are 6,500 people living in accommodation provided through the International Protection Accommodation Services, IPAS, 1,692 of whom are children.  What access do they have to the various reforms?  Will their input be sought by the expert panel the Minister mentioned?  Will their daily experiences be heard?  Do they have a complaints mechanism at the moment?  As we begin the transition away from this service, how do we ensure their lives are not impacted by it and the fact that the model will change?</p>  <p>  I refer to the integration policy element.  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure it is community-led and that all communities are involved in it, rather than having a model imposed on communities which goes against what we want to achieve and provokes the opposite reaction to what we want to achieve?  We have all had experience of things that have been handled in the wrong way.  Is the timeline still on target?  Can we commit that by October 2024 we will have moved on from this system?</p></speech>

I am absolutely committed to the timeline, and my Department and all other Departments are working towards it.  The point the Deputy made on the significant of involving communities in this change is important.  We have work to do in terms of explaining exactly what the White Paper is at a national level and also at a specific local level.  If community accommodation or a reception and integration centre is being set up locally, work is underway in terms of how that communication happens.  My Department has gotten better at that.  When we opened the own-door accommodation centre in Letterkenny, I informed each local Deputy of that.  My Department engages with the local authority and various groups.  It was not perfect, but it was certainly better than what happened in other circumstances.</p>  <p>  In terms of the engagement of people within direct provision, their views were sought while we drafted the White Paper.  Someone who lived in direct provision is on the programme board and we now have new resident welfare teams to improve the quality of life for people currently in the system.</p></speech>

I am quite hopeful, on the basis of what he said, that he is keeping up to date from the point of view of ensuring that a number of issues are dealt with in the budget.  Pay and conditions are vital in terms of delivering a service in the long term and ensuring it is sustainable.  We also have to deal with the remaining issues with the NCS and others.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700020#S00700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I am conscious of the need for a significant improvement in the pay and conditions of employment for early learning and childcare professionals.  The level of pay they receive does not reflect the value of the work they do for children, families and our wider society.  As the Deputy knows, the State is not the employer.  We cannot directly determine the wages in the sector, but I am committed to doing whatever is in my power to influence that situation.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, last December I set up a pre-joint labour committee, JLC, process with the former chair of the Labour Court, Dr. Kevin Duffy, which engaged with IBEC's Childhood Services Ireland and SIPTU.  On foot of that, the chair indicated that a JLC process had been indicated as the only real mechanism of improving pay and conditions for employees in the sector.  Following on from that, I wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy English, and asked that he establish a JLC.  That has been established.  It is an important step forward.  The work on the JLC is taking place and I am looking for an employment regulation order, ERO, to emerge from that.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, an expert group is examining how we increase the level of public investment.  We also have strong public management.  It is not enough to just put money into a sector and see it disappear into fee hikes or the like; we have to manage the system.  That is really important.</p>  <p>  We have to provide clear career pathways for childcare professionals.  That is why we have the workforce development plan.  Let us be honest: it is, by and large, young women who enter the sector after doing a three or four-year degree and earn less than they did in the part-time jobs they did while in college or university.  That is not going to keep people in the sector.  The workforce development plan is essential to creating clear pay structures and pathways and making childcare an enticing profession for more and more people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700020#S00800"><p>The logic of what the Minister has said is that in the long term this will morph into a public model and that will provide a greater element of control.  Within that, pay and conditions can be dealt with, possibly to a greater degree than in the context of a JLC.  Beyond that, a roadmap can be provided for people in terms of a career path.</p>  <p>  I will digress slightly because a number of people have spoken about the NCS.  We accept that it works as a job activation tool.  There are difficulties with regard to disadvantaged children.  In fairness to the Minister, he has had a fair amount of interaction with groups.  I hope in November we have a different pot of money and solution to paying for early childhood and after-school care for disadvantaged children.  In the interim, there is still the difficulty of Tusla.  I accept most people do not want to deal with Tusla, but if we are going to use it we probably need a directive from the Minister to Tusla so that it can provide a roadmap to individual groups which can then use Tusla as a referral service.  I accept the system is far from perfect, and it is to be hoped November will offer solutions.</p></speech>

I have worked to put forward short-term solutions.  I see the broadening out of the sponsorship element as part of that.  If we need to do more to clarify roles, responsibilities and duties I am happy to do so.  We are doing that piece of work in our examination of the NCS after one year.  I specifically asked for a new element to be examined, namely the impact of the NCS on services in areas of disadvantage.  I want to use that information to structure my response.  I heard about this issue when I went to the protest on Tuesday.  I heard about other related issues as well, such as the difficulties of parents with reduced English or literacy in terms of accessing the childcare identifier code key, CHICK, code.  That is something I need to speak to my officials about and think about solutions for.  This is all part of the enhanced public management of the system.</p></speech>

I believe there will have to be, as I said, a directive and clarity because, even for groups that have a service level agreement, SLA, with Tusla, there is still difficulty.  In that regard, long-term, I think those early intervention pieces that fall within Tusla's remit may need to be nearly separated from the acute child protection issues Tusla deals with.  That is what creates difficulty, and Tusla is then not seen by many families as a fair arbiter.  We need to look at that in the long term.  In fairness, the Minister has given a comprehensive answer regarding the JLC and pay and conditions.  We have to do whatever we can to ensure sustainability, which will happen only with the correct pay and conditions.  In the long term, however, it is, as the Minister said, a case of public management and a greater element of public control to deliver a service that will deliver for our people.</p></speech>

All that coming together will deliver quality for children, which is what we are trying to achieve.  Whether the children are from the most disadvantaged backgrounds or not, quality for children is absolutely essential.  We all recognise that this will require very significant increased investment.  It will involve not just this Government; it will be a long-term project because we are so far behind other countries across Europe in the amount of investment we put in.  Regarding that additional public investment, we must have public management as well, whether it is the JLC as one example or whether there are other examples we can bring forward to ensure the additional money we are putting in is giving us those really important outcomes and, most important of all, enhanced quality for children and babies.</p></speech>

On behalf of the House, I extend our sympathies to his wife, Mel, his five children, Paul, Aidan, Yvonne, Derek and Elaine, and his six grandchildren.</p><p>Tom's career as a photographer spanned an incredible 50 years, during which time he covered both the daily national and international news for the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  For many of us, however, he will always be associated with Leinster House.  It was his beat and he was certainly a semi-permanent fixture outside Kildare Street for decades.  He was the first friendly face I saw when I was elected in February 2016.  He enjoyed a unique relationship with Deputies and Senators and had a great respect for elected representatives, and that respect was mutual.  He also enjoyed a cordial relationship with all staff and was a welcoming presence for many workers and visitors.  Tom was also a close friend of many members of the Oireachtas press gallery.  The reaction to his passing is reflective of the standing and respect he had earned and deserved.  It is also important to highlight the legacy Tom leaves behind in his record of parliamentary politics, an integral part of political journalism but one not often given the value it deserves.

He was an ever-present character, in the best possible sense, around Leinster House and he will be missed not only by his family but also by people in Leinster House.</p>  <p>  This morning, there were 451 people on trolleys in hospital corridors and squeezed into free space.  Limerick, Galway and Cork are still the worst hit hospitals, as they have been for years, with no change.  Waiting lists are spiralling out of control, with more than 900,000 people on acute lists and 200,000 people more on diagnostic lists.  This includes more than 100,000 children.  The mind boggles when you reflect on that number of people who are on waiting lists and the length of time they have been waiting.  We are back to high trolley counts, with waiting lists out of control, and the Government, it seems, has no plan to deal with them.</p>  <p>  There are real human consequences of this crisis.  Over the summer, I conducted a survey on the impact of long waiting times on patients.  The results were stark.  Long waiting times have severe consequences for stress and anxiety, with a major negative impact on people's quality of life.  The survey found that 75% of people's conditions have got worse because of their wait.  This is particularly severe for those waiting more than a year.  It is clear that care delayed is care denied and that long wait times fail patients.  There are severe consequences for mental health, with more than 70% of respondents reporting that their mental health has been severely or considerably affected.</p>  <p>  We need to see a waiting list plan from the Government.  It cannot be more window dressing, committees or talk.  It has to be about action, capacity and resources.  The T&aacute;naiste knows we need more beds, staff and capacity in diagnostic and surgical theatre space.  I know this from my experience in Waterford and I am sure he knows it from his experience as a previous Minister for Health.  We also need modern IT systems.</p>  <p>  One area severely affected by capacity has been maternity services.  We need to see real investment in maternity services to ensure women in this country have the highest quality of care.  The T&aacute;naiste may have noticed the protest yesterday outside Leinster House, where pregnant women and their families, some with young babies, had no choice but to travel to Dublin for a protest to end maternity restrictions.  Partners have been locked out of appointments and labour because of a lack of space and outdated buildings and, of course, because of infection control measures as well.  Yesterday many Government backbenchers stood in solidarity with and gave commitments to the women affected and expectant mothers.  I commend Linda Kelly and the #BetterMaternityCare campaign, who organised the protest, and the others who spoke or travelled.  We have all heard the tragic and horrific stories from women abandoned in the most heartbreaking circumstances.  These maternity restrictions need to be lifted now and the T&aacute;naiste and his Government need to act on this.  All parties and none that stood in solidarity now have to make sure there is action.</p>  <p>  What is the Government's plan to tackle waiting lists?  What is its plan to inject capacity into our healthcare system?  I heard in Cork on Monday, when I met the CEO of Cork University Hospital, that we are facing into an horrendous winter in acute hospitals of more overcrowding, more people on trolleys and waiting times getting longer.  What is the Government's plan to ensure that this does not happen?  What specific injections of capacity and resources will be put into our healthcare system?  Also, what will the Government do to end maternity restrictions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700021#T00600"><p>There were a lot of questions there, all very valid, and I will do my best to answer them as best I can in the time allowed.</p>  <p>  First, however, I join the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in paying my respects to Tom Burke, who was a truly fine man.  He was one of the first people I met and got to know when I became a Member of this House.  He was a feature of Irish politics and photojournalism, and I was really sorry to hear yesterday that he had passed away.  I extend to his family and friends the Government's condolences and those of my party.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the enormous distress and discomfort that overcrowded emergency hospitals cause patients and their families and also front-line staff working in very challenging conditions in hospitals throughout the country.  I acknowledge also the risks involved in respect of infection control and delayed care.</p> <p>The HSE reports that there were 292 patients on trolleys in our hospitals this morning.  That is up from 164 this day last year, when hospitals were largely closed due to the pandemic, but substantially down on previous years, such as 2019, when the number was 451 a day around this time of year.  A total of 292 is still 292 too many, however, and it is not acceptable that people should spend prolonged periods of time on hospital trolleys awaiting admission.</p> <p> What is our plan to deal with this issue?  It involves increasing our bed capacity, increasing staffing levels, modernising care pathways and expanding care in the community.  Since the Government was formed, and since the pandemic started, we have added more than 800 beds to our acute hospital system.  That is why the number of people on trolleys, while still too high, is substantially lower than it was in 2019, before we added those additional beds to the system.  We need to add more and we have detailed plans to do exactly that, as spelt out in the national development plan earlier this week.  We have also increased the number of staff considerably.  The HSE has recruited between 7,000 and 8,000 additional staff so far this year and has authority to recruit more.  That authority will carry over to next year, but we all understand the difficulties that exist, both in Ireland and around the world, in recruiting healthcare staff.  The addition of 7,000 or 8,000 staff this year alone is a significant increase and it is making a difference.</p> <p> We are also expanding care in the community, which is enabling more people to receive healthcare in their communities and ensuring they do not have to go to hospital in the first place.  That is largely being done through building up our GP services, particularly by giving GPs greater access to diagnostics.  We have also put huge resources into home care.  The waiting times for home care are substantially down on what they were before, which means more patients can get out of hospital more quickly.  That frees up beds, and the same thing goes for the adequate funding of the fair deal scheme.  Those are the main things we are doing at the moment.  Of course this is all done against the backdrop of a rising and ageing population and huge pent-up demand for healthcare as a consequence of care deferred during the pandemic.  It is a difficult situation but the Government is very much acting on it.</p> <p> Regarding waiting lists, as the Deputy knows, a task force is being established in the Department of Health to get waiting lists down.  The reason they are high at the moment - they were high before the pandemic and they are even higher now - is the need to deliver the care that was deferred as a consequence of hospitals being closed or partially closed for the duration of the pandemic.  That has built up a huge unmet need.  The way it is going to be managed is similar to the operation of the vaccine task force, which was very successful in producing our vaccine programme.  We want to take the same approach now to reducing waiting lists.</p></speech>

He talked about the risks involved for patients and, yes, there are risks for staff as well, as we know.  As a former Minister for Health, he knows that healthcare is, in essence, about people treating people, as well as making sure the people who work in our health services are valued but also that they have the resources.</p>  <p>  When the T&aacute;naiste talks about what the Government did last year, he needs to be a bit more straight about what was promised, on the one hand, and what was delivered.  There were 1,150 additional acute beds funded and committed to in last year's budget.  It was confirmed yesterday by the Secretary General of the Department of Health that some 150 of them will not be delivered.  The T&aacute;naiste talked about the 7,500 staff that came into the healthcare system, which I celebrate because they are needed.  However, the promise was that there would be 14,500 new staff.  The Government has managed to deliver only 7,500 of them.  He talked about community services.  A total of &euro;150 million was provided last year for enhanced community services.  The T&aacute;naiste might not know this but half of that money will not be spent to deliver the community intervention teams that were promised.  When people hear about task forces, they will judge the Government on its record, that is, what it committed and promised to do and what it has done.</p></speech>

It is the biggest health budget we have ever seen in the history of the State.  When I was Minister for Health, it was &euro;14 billion.  It is 50% higher now than it was then, and more than double what it was when I was practising as a doctor in the public health service.  Money is certainly not the issue any more when it comes to our health service.  As the Deputy pointed out, some of the money will even go unspent this year.  There is no lack of money and no lack of political will, but there are real constraints.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that adding an additional bed is not simply buying a piece of furniture; it is a whole system and that takes time to do.  Recruiting people is difficult as well.  The fact that the HSE has added more than 7,000 additional, mainly clinical, staff this year is an achievement, and one we should recognise.  The HSE has the authority now to continue that recruitment and take on more staff.</p>  <p>  Yes, we did not add the 1,000 beds we aimed for, but we did add 850 and that is the equivalent of two hospitals.  It is quite an achievement in the space of less than two years and we need to continue with that now.  Although trolley numbers are still too high today, they are not far off half of what they were two years ago.  We need to keep expanding our health service to bring those numbers down further.</p></speech>

Our sympathies go to his family and media comrades.</p><p>Back in June, I told the <i>Financial Times</i>that Ireland could live with a small increase in our corporation tax rate.  The T&aacute;naiste accused me then of walking into a trap with those comments.  He went on to accuse me and the Labour Party of damaging the national interest.  It was clear then that the writing was on the wall, when nearly every country in the world was signing up to this process.  Four months on, it now seems the Government is going to follow my advice and that of the Labour Party and sign up to the 15% rate.  Will the T&aacute;naiste accept that he was wrong in June and will he have the good sense - and, indeed, the good grace - to withdraw his patronising charge?  It is good leadership to be able to admit when one is wrong and to acknowledge that fact publicly.</p><p>We know there are two pillars to the OECD process.  Projections we have seen from the Department of Finance suggest the cost of pillar 1 will mean a &euro;1 billion impact in 2023, rising to &euro;2 billion in 2025.  Ireland has already signed up to pillar 1 but there has been a change in scope under that pillar and significant movement on pillar 2 since those figures entered the public domain.  We are all working off old figures.  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that what Ireland may lose on the pillar 1 swings, we could gain on the 15% roundabout?  Corporation tax is expected to come in at &euro;12 billion this year.  A simple straight-line increase to take it up to 15% would potentially bring in an extra &euro;2.5 billion.  This would clearly cancel out any losses under pillar 1.  However, we have not been able to get access to any costings on this.  There is a huge information vacuum for those of us trying responsibly to interpret the Government position.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that updated figures will be published today?  Will he further confirm that when the Cabinet meets today, the financial impact of these proposals will be presented to Ministers to help them to make an informed decision on this extremely momentous shift?  Will he also confirm that the 12.5% rate will continue to apply to indigenous firms?</p><p>In summation, does the T&aacute;naiste still believe that I and the Labour Party are damaging the national interest?  Is it not the case that we could gain revenue and be quids in here because we will regain on the swings what we lose on the roundabouts?  Will the 12.5% corporation rate still apply to indigenous firms operating here and, indeed, to smaller multinational corporations located here, because pillar 2 applies only to firms with a global turnover in excess of &euro;750 million?</p></speech>

It is deeply unhelpful when someone on one's side - we were team Ireland on an issue like this - makes concessions on one's behalf.  It is exactly the same thing for a shop steward or trade union official going in to negotiate with an employer and somebody from his or her team starts making concessions before they are agreed.  It is deeply unhelpful and it was damaging.  That is my assessment of the situation and I stand over it.  That is if the Deputy sees himself as being part of team Ireland.</p>  <p>  There will be a Cabinet meeting this afternoon at which we will discuss this matter.  No decision has yet been made.  Our existing projections are that any change of this nature will reduce our revenue by approximately &euro;2 billion a year, but that is only an estimate.  Nobody can know that for sure.  It is based on certain assumptions that may or may not be correct and may well be updated.  I do not know if there will be any financials published today but I will get back to the Deputy on that.</p>  <p>  Our 12.5% corporate profit tax has been a huge success.  It is a really important part of our industrial policy and has, not entire but strong, cross-party support in this House.  More than a quarter of a million people work in multinational companies in Ireland.  We want to keep those jobs and the 100,000 or so indirect jobs that arise from the direct employment.</p> <p>We take in approximately &euro;12 billion a year in corporation profit tax.  That is roughly double what the average European country takes in on a per head basis and it is evidence that in a world where capital, labour, talent, investment and money are mobile, lower taxes can mean higher revenues.  It is proof positive of that.</p> <p> What we have always tried to maintain are two things - competitiveness and certainty.  Competitiveness in knowing that our rate will be substantially lower than that of our competitors, and certainty, so that we can say to companies thinking of making a 30-year investment in Ireland and employing tens of thousands of people that the rate will not change even if the Government or the economic cycle changes.  That is something we have to consider today because if we agree to a new global minimum rate, there is the advantage of no country being able to undercut us.  Some countries have actually undercut us in recent years and that is something we would avoid if we were to sign up to a global minimum rate.</p> <p> In terms of our concerns, they relate to the issue of the rate being "at least" the relevant figure.  We want to make sure that whatever rate is agreed is certain and will not ratchet up over time.  There is the issue relating to SMEs and mid-caps.  We want to ensure that for smaller and middle-sized companies we can continue to charge the lower rate of 12.5%.  We want to make sure that our research and development tax credit is protected.  We also want to make sure that if countries sign up to this, they actually implement it.  We do not want to be the country to implement it but for our competitors then not to do so.  That would be a disadvantage to us.  Those are the issues that are currently in play.</p></speech>

The Labour Party has always put the national interest first, as history shows.  The truth is that we could have boxed off the 15% condition very early on and it was the T&aacute;naiste and his Government that created the kind of uncertainty that has dominated this process in recent months.  I have asked him the very simple question of how much extra or less it is forecast that Ireland will raise in corporation tax if we adopt the 15% rate for multinationals.  Is he telling me seriously that this has not been worked out or presented to his Cabinet colleagues who are about to make a momentous decision today that will affect Ireland's national industrial strategy?  The decision today will have far-reaching consequences for the economy, jobs and business.  Will the T&aacute;naiste commit to those figures being published and shared with Members of this House later today after they have been presented to Cabinet members, if he is prepared to do so?</p></speech>

However, nobody knows that for sure.  Nobody predicted that after the most recent range of changes we made, corporation profit tax receipts would soar.  There are so many variables that it is very difficult to know but if it is possible - it is a matter for the Minister for Finance to publish that information - I see no reason we would not publish the figures.</p></speech>

Tom was a bright presence outside the gates of Leinster House and just a very nice person.  He will be sadly missed here, although more so, obviously, by his family and friends.</p>  <p>  I was going to address my question to the Taoiseach.  I meant the T&aacute;naiste.  The co-Taoiseach, perhaps.  People Before Profit is not a late convert to questioning the 12.5% corporate tax rate.  We have done so from the very beginning.  How does the T&aacute;naiste morally justify the fact that for many months now, the Government has put, and continues to put, enormous energy and resources into preventing international efforts to have a minimal increase in the rate of tax on the absolutely staggering profits of some of the largest and wealthiest corporations in the world and make them pay just a little bit more tax?   It seems to be willing to die in a ditch on this issue, in effect.  We know that corporations are involved in aggressive tax avoidance and do not pay anything even close to the 12.5% rate but in reality pay approximately 5.5% collectively.  Some of them pay far less.</p>  <p>  Why does the T&aacute;naiste think it is okay to try to prevent a little bit of extra tax being imposed on these staggeringly profitable corporations, but to trenchantly oppose efforts to reduce the tax burden on ordinary working people in this country?  We pleaded with him last night not to impose a further tax hike through carbon taxes on ordinary working people, some of whom, such as the elderly, the vulnerable and the sick, will have to choose between food and heating their homes after the raft of energy price hikes.  Now the Government is proposing to worsen that situation by imposing carbon tax hikes in the budget.  Does the T&aacute;naiste think Jeff Bezos is going to be worried about whether he should heat his home or have food?  These people are making billions of euro.  How does the T&aacute;naiste think it is morally justifiable that workers in this country pay a minimum of 20% tax on their income but he does not think it is acceptable that corporations would pay the same amount in tax?  Does he know, for example, that workers earned &euro;130 billion last year and paid &euro;27 billion in tax?</p></speech>

In other words, workers paid 20%, on average, in tax and corporations paid 5%.  Why does the T&aacute;naiste defend the corporations instead of looking after working people?</p></speech>

I believe taxes should be low, simple and fair.  That goes for workers and companies.  I am not sure if the Deputy believes taxes should be low, simple and fair.  Perhaps simple and fair but not low.  I believe that should apply to companies and workers alike.  I hope that when it comes to budget day the Deputy will vote in favour of tax indexation, for example, where we raise the credits and bands so that people are protected from the effect of inflation on their pay packets.</p>  <p>  Our position is one of defending our national interest.  Some 250,000 people work in multinational companies in Ireland and that spins off another 100,000 jobs or so.  That is 350,000 jobs.  We want to retain those jobs in Ireland and we want more of them all over the country.  We also want to protect our revenue base.  We take in between &euro;10 billion and &euro;12 billion a year in corporation profit tax, double what the average European country does on a per head basis, precisely because we have a low tax rate.  In the modern world that we live in, labour, capital, investment and money - all those things - are internationally mobile.  If taxes are too high, the companies leave.  If taxes are low, they come in.  That is why the 12.5% rate has worked so well for Ireland and that it what this is about for us - trying to protect jobs and our revenue stream.  The &euro;10 billion or &euro;12 billion we take in every year from corporations is roughly the cost of running our entire education system.  It is that large an amount of money and we want to retain that coming in.</p>  <p>  I know this can be characterised in a very simple way as corporations not paying their fair share of tax.  They should pay their fair share of tax, whether it is here or somewhere else, but, in reality, these negotiations have been about other things.  They have been about larger countries trying to get a bigger share of the pie and taking that share of the pie from us.  It has not been about ensuring that countries in the developing world get a fairer share of the taxation; it has been about big and wealthy countries that think we are getting too much and want to take some of that off us.  That is what we have to protect and push back against.</p></speech>

As even the US Chamber of Commerce and representatives of many of these multinationals have said, the reason they are here is not primarily or exclusively the tax rate.</p> <p>It is to do with the fact that we are an English-speaking country, we are within the European market, we have an educated workforce, and we used to have - not now, because of the lack of public investment - a decent water infrastructure and a proper energy infrastructure.  The Government would be doing far better collecting some taxes off these corporations at a reasonable rate, comparable with what ordinary workers pay, in order to fund the investment in education, higher education, water and energy infrastructure and all of the things that can sustain investment and develop the economy in the mean time.</p> <p> However, what I asked the T&aacute;naiste was how he thinks it is justified to try to minimise international efforts to make these corporations to pay a little bit more tax.  He has put huge energy into that but he thinks it is okay to whack a carbon tax on the elderly, sick and vulnerable, some of whom will suffer needless death this winter because of the cold and because of the energy price hikes and carbon tax, and he thinks it is okay that ordinary workers in this country pay three times the proportion of their incomes in taxes that these corporations pay.  </p></speech>

Large and wealthy countries are looking for more revenue and they want to take it from smaller countries like ours.

Some of these countries had their research and development tax credit system protected.</p></speech>

We did exactly that.  It is what any right-thinking Government should do.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy on one point.  The offering from multinationals is, and always has been, about more than tax.  It is about talent, infrastructure, and access to the European Single Market and the eurozone, to which I believe the Deputy is opposed.  It is about commitment to free trade, which I believe the Deputy also is opposed to.  Let us not forget one thing-----</p></speech>

These concerns were highlighted in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which concluded that diabetics in the mid-west region are offered a disgraceful service.  There are 20,000 registered patients between counties Tipperary, Limerick and Clare.  There are 225,000 people with diabetes in Ireland.  Of this figure, between 10% and 15% have type 1 diabetes.  People of any age can be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, however, it is much more likely to be diagnosed in young people.  Up to five children and teenagers are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes every week in Ireland.  According to medical reports, the number of older people being diagnosed with the condition is steadily rising.  Early intervention and specialised medical support structures are key to averting an influx of adult patients with type 1 diabetes.</p><p>In addition to being given the proper medication to treat and stabilise type 1 diabetes, the condition requires expert instruction on managing both the administration of insulin and the effective control of diet.  In University Hospital Limerick, the needs of paediatric type 1 diabetics are being met by a specialist dietician.  There is no specialist dietician in the hospital to attend to the needs of long-term or newly-diagnosed adult type 1 diabetic patients.  If they are hospitalised, they can receive dietary advice and support from a ward dietician.  There is no specialist care or outpatient appointments available for adult diabetics at University Hospital Limerick.  This is not the quality of service we expect from a centre of excellence. </p><p>It is discriminatory and disgraceful that UHL does not provide pumps that deliver insulin subcutaneously 24 hours a day.  These pumps offer diabetics the benefit of the latest technology.  It is a simpler, and much less invasive, means of controlling the condition.  These devices are efficient and effective and give the patient peace of mind and a release from regular injections.</p><p>In December 2020, UHL received confirmation of funding to recruit for three new additional dietetic posts for the treatment of adult diabetes.  Nine months later, and those posts have not been filled.  The HSE, in a typical bureaucratic flourish, tells us that the recruitment process for two of these posts is at an advanced stage, while the process for the third remains ongoing.</p><p>The UHL staff currently working with diabetics are providing exemplary care to patients.  They are delivering a service under immense pressure.  They need additional support.</p><p>Adults need and deserve access to dietary services and the provision of insulin pumps from UHL, which is deemed to be the centre of excellence for the Limerick, Clare and Tipperary area.  </p></speech>

I am advised that the University Limerick Hospitals Group recognises the need for additional resources within its adult diabetic service.  This issue is a focus for the University Limerick Hospitals Group and it is committed to improving the service for its patients.</p>  <p>  Developing services around insulin pump therapy and structured education requires them to fill further specialist posts, including nursing and dietician posts.  While there is a specialist dietician working with the paediatric diabetes patients, there is currently no specialist dietician in post for adults with type 1 diabetes.  Patients are seen by a ward dietician as inpatients, but currently, there is no specialist dietetic care or outpatient appoints available for adult diabetes patients in UHL.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, the hospital group received confirmation of funding to recruit three additional dietetic posts for the treatment of adult diabetes.  This funding has been made available through the national clinical programme for diabetes.  These posts include two senior dieticians and one staff grade dietician.  The recruitment process for the two senior dieticians is at an advanced stage.  The recruitment process is also ongoing for the staff grade dietician post.  UHL has advised that it will be able to provide a more precise timeline on when it expects the successful candidates to take up post in the the near future.  A second consultant endocrinologist took up post on 1 October 2020.  Two further consultant endocrinologist posts have now been approved.  They are currently being progressed through the approved HR process.  UHL will advise when the consultants are in place.  </p>  <p>  The adult diabetes service is also supported by a dedicated team of clinical nurse specialists and staff nurses.  Four diabetic clinical nurse specialists, CNS, posts have also been approved for UHL.  Of these, three have been successfully recruited and the successful candidates will commence post in the coming months, while the recruitment campaign is currently ongoing for the final CNS post.  There are also two dietetic staff nurse positions within the diabetes unit at UHL, both of which have been filled. </p>  <p>  UHL has advised that the provision of the dose adjustment for normal eating course for adults with type 1 diabetes will be dependent on the appointment of specialist dieticians and on the recruitment of additional CNSs.  Currently, the adult service in UHL is unable to commence adult patients on insulin pumps due to service demands.  However, it does accept patients established on pumps from elsewhere.  These patients are managed under the care of a consultant endocrinologist.  The largest group of these are patients who have transferred from the paediatric service in the region.  All of the hospital group's insulin pump patients are seen in UHL.  At present, there are 51 patients within its adult diabetes service who are using insulin pump therapy.  </p></speech>

They are living with a life-altering illness and need access to the services and support to which they are entitled, in keeping with other patients attending other hospitals around the country.  I will quote one of the many patients who has contacted my office seeking help:</p> <blockquote> 	I feel, as a patient, that the HSE is letting us diabetics down as they are not providing us with the services which are very important to us to live as normal a life as possible and to avoid long-term complications.  UHL is a regional hospital that covers Limerick, Clare and Tipperary, and over 20,000 diabetics live within these counties.  It is a disgrace that we are being left behind, compared to similar sized hospitals that offer services to diabetics.  I have to go to a private hospital to access services that UHL is not providing.  I should not have to do this. </blockquote>  <p>For those who cannot afford to access private services, what is the solution?  As a medical doctor, the T&aacute;naiste will be aware that diabetes, if not managed properly, is a serious illness with life-changing consequences.</p> <p>It is a very common condition that can be successfully managed.  Patients deserve to have access to technological advances to give them every advantage in coping with the illness.</p></speech>

I do understand this.  What I can say from the Government's point of view is that funding has been allocated to University Hospital Limerick to hire the additional specialist staff that are needed.  We are committed to getting the service up and running.  I certainly encourage anyone involved in the recruitment process in the HSE and in University Hospital Limerick to expedite this and make sure the staff are hired.  I understand, as is the case throughout Ireland and the world, that there is a huge shortage of people who have the specialist skills to fill these posts at a time when demand is rising but that is not an excuse.  It may be a reason but it is not an excuse.  The funding is there and we are determined to get the service up and running as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It had been reported that this afternoon the Cabinet will make a decision on the revised text of the OECD agreement.  We have been clear that it is in the best interests of the State to be part of any final agreement to reform the international tax system.  I want to ask a specific question regarding comments the T&aacute;naiste made a number of weeks ago.  He said that the 12.5% rate would remain for the average Irish business.  He later rowed back on this commitment and clarified that this was a false assurance he had given SMEs, with no approval yet given by the Commission that we would be permitted to operate two rates of corporation tax.  As the T&aacute;naiste knows, this is an issue my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, raised with the Department of Finance a number of months ago.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether he has sought approval from the Commission to operate dual tax rates, with 12.5% for businesses that fall below the revenue threshold under the OECD agreement, and whether this approval has been given?</p></speech>

I am pretty sure that is not what I said but it may be a representation or an interpretation of something I did say.  I spoke to the Minister for Finance this morning.  He will be in a position to present to Cabinet this afternoon.  One of the things we have sought is the ability to continue to charge the 12.5% rate to small and medium-sized companies with a turnover of less than &euro;750 million.  The Minister informed me today that we have received assurance that we can do this.</p></speech>

I notice he visited the Mill Enterprise Centre.  This facility is very close to my heart as I have been involved with it for a long number of years in a range of different respects.  The T&aacute;naiste will know IDA Ireland recently purchased significant lands in Drogheda.  Would it be the preference of the T&aacute;naiste that IDA Ireland, an agency for which the T&aacute;naiste is responsible, would locate data centres on the site?  We have one already and speculation is mounting that applications will soon arrive for two additional centres.  Would the T&aacute;naiste prefer data centres or other forms of productive and more jobs-rich enterprises to be located on the new IDA Ireland site?</p></speech>

That would be an advanced building solution or if somebody wants to establish a factory or a business centre there.  That would be the preference given that the previous IDA Ireland site, with which the Deputy is familiar, already accommodates data centres.  That would be my preference but I will very much be guided by IDA Ireland in this regard.  My understanding is that its intention is that it will be used for an advanced building solution and that will be a jobs-rich investment.</p></speech>

It calls on the Government to end favourable tax treatment for investment funds and to restrict the sale of new homes to individuals and not-for-profit organisations.  Investment funds have driven up rents and house prices in Ireland to unsustainable and unaffordable levels.  Rents have almost doubled in the past decade since the T&aacute;naiste took office.  House prices have more than doubled during that time.  We now have among the highest rents and house prices in Europe.  The rent pressure zones introduced by Fine Gael have failed completely and have been breached in every part of the country in which they were introduced.  In the budget will the Government bring in measures to end the favourable tax treatment of investment funds?</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste will get me into terrible trouble with my comrades.</p>  <p>  Under this Government, thousands of students are literally surviving on rations of dry toast, dry cereal, a cup of coffee and skip dinner.  How could it be otherwise when we have the highest student fees in all of the European Union and we have students forking out &euro;700 or more per month just for a box room.  The scenes at UCC yesterday when 131 students queued at a student union food bank should cause the T&aacute;naiste and his Cabinet colleagues to blush if they had any shame.

The main way we assist students is through the student grant system.  More than 75,000 students receive a grant.  The grant levels are under review in the budget.  In recognition that some students are facing real and serious hardship, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, has doubled the student assistance fund to &euro;17.2 million.  In recent days, he has allocated &euro;596,000 of this to UCC to assist it to assist students who are in real financial need.</p></speech>

Why not?  Why is it limited to counties Donegal and Mayo?  Other counties, including County Louth, have dwellings that have been damaged due to the use of defective concrete blocks.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage tells me there is ongoing engagement with a number of local authorities and local action groups on requests for extension of the scheme to other counties.  Fair play to Donegal and Mayo but we cannot split the country in half.  We need to treat the citizens of Ireland the same.  Families have to leave their homes and keep paying their mortgages.  If a house is deemed unfit a family cannot live in it.  This is also causing serious mental health problems which I have witnessed.  We all deserve to be treated the same.

In these circumstances it would be a national scheme operated by the Housing Agency rather than schemes operated by local authorities.  If a house is affected by mica or pyrite it is affected by mica or pyrite and what county it is in should not make a difference.</p></speech>

Fear uasal ab ea &eacute;.  I received an email from a family in Tipperary who have been in business for 60 years.  The T&aacute;naiste has often frequented the place.  It cannot get staff.  We saw what Boris Johnson did across the pond in getting 10,000 work permits issued and bringing in the army.  This business started the process last February.  It advertised in May and got people from India.  It was assured by the T&aacute;naiste a month ago that it would have two within a week.</p> <p>Three weeks later he received a letter to state there are difficulties.  When is the Government going to get the Civil Service back working at full tilt to get these processes done?  Home-grown indigenous businesses are sinking and being wiped out by the lack of employees.  He requires 50 staff to reopen the business fully but this is very frustrating.  I will forward the email of my constituent to the T&aacute;naiste, which is very frustrating to read and disappointing from his point of view.  This is a man who wants to employ people and to continue his business for another 60 years.</p></speech>

As the House will be aware, businesses are reporting labour shortages across the economy at the moment in retail, hospitality, logistics, agriculture and food.  This is a real problem.  A number of different things are driving that, ranging from the impact of the pandemic to how it is much harder for people to travel into the country, or at least it was until a few weeks ago.</p>  <p>  With the phasing out of the pandemic unemployment payment and travel restrictions being removed, we will see that labour shortage easing.  The issuing of work permits is handled by my Department.  We are now at the point where staff are coming back into the offices, we would expect it to be sped up.  We also hope to have legislation before the House in the coming months that will modernise the process and make it easier for permits to be given.</p></speech>

I have raised this with the T&aacute;naiste before.  Not alone are there issues with broadband connectivity but people who nominally have a broadband connection get a poor service from their telecoms providers and there is very little that can be done about it.</p>  <p>  When I raised this with the T&aacute;naiste previously, he stated there would be a Bill to give additional powers to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to tackle those providers.  He told me last year that the Bill would be introduced in February.  I brought the issue up again and he told me that it would be introduced before the D&aacute;il rose for the summer.

We have had some briefings from EirGrid and from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities in Ireland, CRU, in recent weeks and they have developed a plan to ensure that we will have enough electricity not just this winter but for the next four or five winters and that we can cater for increased demand for electricity from industry and households over that period.  It involves more renewables but also leaving some power stations operating that it had intended to close.  These will need to continue to operate for another couple of years.

On that very issue, on the auctions that EirGrid talks about into the future, I was checking back on when this issue emerged and on the severity associated with it.  Previous auctions, for example, were won by the ESB.  On four separate occasions, when the four-year period had almost expired for the provision of these projects into the national grid, the ESB withdrew from them and paid penalties.  The grid was at the loss of 430 MW in addition to the 270 MW that was lost as a result of the closures at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough.</p>  <p>  Did EirGrid in its briefing give an indication of how it might ensure in the future that the likes of that never happens again?  Representatives like ourselves, and indeed me in my own constituency and region, were prepared to accept the acceleration of decarbonisation, which meant the closure of those power stations on the understanding that new grid projects would be provided.  They certainly were not, however.  I ask who was at the helm in EirGrid?  Where was ComReg and the energy regulator and how do they propose to respond?</p></speech>

EirGrid has acknowledged that the past number of auctions were not successful. There will be new auctions in the new year and we have asked it and impress upon it the need to reconsider their approach to these auctions because if these are operated in the same way, they may end up with the same result.  That is something that EirGrid is going to consider and take on board.</p></speech>

Every day in October an average of 80 people are lingering on trolleys in this hospital.  I have raised this in the D&aacute;il since I was first elected in 2016.  We are facing into the winter crisis where it is going to get worse.  Tomorrow, my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, and I are meeting the CEO of the hospital and the unions there.  Can the T&aacute;naiste tell me what specifically the Government intends to do to ensure that this winter is not a nightmare winter for the patients, for those who must attend University Hospital Limerick and for the staff there, who do a tremendous job in very difficult situations?  It is unfair in this day and age to allow 80 people to be on trolleys, on average, each day.  Some 1,000 people waited on trolleys in September and 80 every day so far in October.  As it obviously will get worse as we reach the winter peak, I want to know what the Government intends to do.  I as that the T&aacute;naiste please does not come back to me with statistics and figures that do not mean anything to people who are on trolleys.</p></speech>

We are increasing our bed capacity so that with more beds there will be fewer people on trolleys.  We have added more than 800 beds, which are the equivalent of two medium-sized hospitals, since the beginning of the pandemic.  That is why we have seen a reduction of the number of people on trolleys relative to where we would have been two to three years ago but that is still far too many, as I acknowledge and as the Deputy has also said.</p>  <p>  We are hiring more staff and between 7,000 and 8,000 more staff were hired this year.  The HSE has authority to hire the same again.  We are investing in home care in order that people can get out of hospital more quickly or can avoid having to go there in the first place.  There is also increased investment in primary care, such as GP diagnostics, in order that people are treated in the community, do not deteriorate and do not end up in hospital as frequently as they used to.</p></speech>

They were not even cheap headlines; they were free headlines as the &euro;10 million announced in additional funding for mental health supports in February remains unspent.  This is not good enough as there is a complete lack of urgency on the part of the Government to provide the mental health services people need right now.</p>  <p>People with mental health needs who are in need of such supports have a simple ask.  They want to access the services they need, when and where they need them.  Why was this money not spent, when will it be spent and will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment that it will not be re-dressed and re-washed and presented as new money in the budget?</p></speech>

The budget for mental health in Ireland is well over &euro;1 billion a year now and has gone up by over 25% in the past couple of years.

I ask the T&aacute;naiste to work with his Government colleagues to insist that Irish Water makes the new 15-acre landscaped area at the Stillorgan reservoir available for use as a public park, something that is desperately needed for the 5,000 immediate residents in the Sandyford business district.</p></speech>

Bureaucracy in respect of forestry licences is seriously affecting the level of afforestation.  The livestock sector feels under siege, and there are carbon budgets, eco schemes, nitrates reviews and Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform.  We are going to set carbon budgets in the coming weeks.  It is essential that these are economically and environmentally sustainable.

We have to ensure our capacity to produce food will continue into the future.  We are a world leader in sustainable production, with our grass-fed, pasture-based model.  It is important we continue that.</p>  <p>  It is also important to reduce the overall carbon footprint of the food we produce.  That is the way forward, not only to make a real contribution to tackling climate change but also to ensure that our sector is as strong as possible into the future and that the value of the food we produce is maximised on the international markets, where 90% of that food is sold.  The Deputy has been to the fore in respect of ensuring that the balance in this regard is the correct one.  I very much concur with him on that.  At Government level, there is a strong recognition of that and, in agreeing the sectoral targets, we are determined to ensure they are ambitious and recognise the importance of the economic and social role of producing food.</p></speech>

Being the parent of a child who has these difficulties or challenges is a cause of lingering and continuing stress and worry.  Early intervention can make the difference, as I know, between a full life and one that is significantly diminished.  Assessments are taking place but therapies are not available.  Training unqualified parents is not satisfactory.  Some parents who have contacted me can afford to pay the average &euro;150 per week on speech and language therapy, cognitive tests, occupational therapy, autism spectrum disorder assessments, psychologists and paediatricians and avoid three-year waiting lists.  A three-year wait is too long for a family and for their suffering child.  Will the T&aacute;naiste intervene?</p></speech>

I was going to ask a further question about the UCC students - I ask that the T&aacute;naiste follow up on the matter - but Deputy Cowen's point made a strong impression on me because I was not aware of the issue.  His point is that the ESB, a commercial semi-State company, won a bid to be one of the electricity suppliers but failed to supply the electricity.  Was the ESB ever in a position to supply it?  It seems it gamed the system, kept another supplier out and was prepared to pay the penalty of &euro;4 million to enable itself to do that.  Obviously, consumers, businesses and industry are at the wrong end of this.  This is a serious issue.  When will the Government revert to the D&aacute;il on it?</p></speech>

They were contacted and encouraged to book accommodation prior to the start of the first semester this year.  At the time, the students did not have their timetables and, due to this encouragement and the scaling-back of restrictions, assumed most of their classes would be held on campus.  When their timetables were released, they learned that the vast majority of their classes would still be online and not on campus.  They are quite angry and annoyed, as are their parents, at the additional costs they have incurred on accommodation they do not need.</p>  <p>  At what stage did Institute of Technology Sligo learn that the majority of its classes would be delivered online and not on campus?  Why was this not indicated to students earlier?  Was this the only third level institute at which this happened?  I am aware the opposite is happening, whereby students have returned to campus and cannot find accommodation.  In this instance, the students are not on campus but they were told to find accommodation.</p></speech>

As I said, that is something the Minister for Health will have to answer.</p></speech>

The march for maternity reminded us there is still an important part of society to which somehow, inexplicably, the Government has not responded and it highlighted the change in circumstances in which we find ourselves 19 months down the line of this pandemic.  Has the T&aacute;naiste read the experiences of the women detailed on the scroll that was delivered to the D&aacute;il yesterday?  If not, will he ensure he does so?  Does he understand there are far wider-reaching risks than solely those posed by Covid-19 to the health of mothers and babies?  His Government claims that radical listening forms part of the latest HSE women-centred strategy, but yesterday the women's demonstration contended that rather than experiencing radical listening, they have been experiencing selective hearing.

The Government has established an interdepartmental group on managing coastal change to scope out an approach for the development of a national co-ordinated and integrated strategy to manage the protected impact of coastal change on our communities, economies, heritage, culture and environment.

In Killarney, Michael Cronin Readymix and Thermohouse is looking for 20 people right away.  Michael Cronin tells me he could employ up to 100 more if he could get the people.  In the hospitality sector, there are places such as Scotts Hotel and Gleneagle Hotel and there is also the Roughty Valley Co-operative Society, a piggery, waiting for 50 of these.

He was a lovely man.  It was nice to see him on my first day in Leinster House and he was very kind to me.  Go raibh maith aige.</p><p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for granting me leave to introduce this Bill, the purpose of which is to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 to bring it into line with recent changes in work practices that have seen a growth in bogus self-employment.  It would also amend the principal Act to extend the terms of the Act to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, persons engaged in sea fishing or other work at sea and to trainee doctors.  Finally, it would extend certain rest and holiday rights to those who are self-employed in order to lessen the incentive for employers to engage in the practice of bogus self-employment.</p><p>The practice of bogus self-employment has been rampant across numerous sectors for a considerable time.  Indeed, we have had many discussions about it in this Chamber.  It is particularly prevalent in construction, IT, universities and the gig economy.  This abhorrent practice makes winners out of bad employers and losers out of good employers, workers and the State.  For an employer who classifies a worker who is actually an employee as self-employed or as an independent contractor, there is no employer PRSI to pay, no pension contributions to make and no sick pay, no maternity or paternity leave to pay, no redundancy payments and no annual leave or public holiday pay to pay.  For a worker misclassified as self-employed, this means less entitlement to social welfare supports if and when they need them.  It also means no access to an occupational pension, no paid sick leave, no paternity or maternity leave, no redundancy, no fixed breaks, no rest periods and no paid annual leave or public holidays, the type of benefits that would be standard in most employment.</p><p>The winner is the fraudulent employer who dodges his or her responsibilities and bypasses employment law.  The losers are the workers, who pay the price for the actions of their employer.  For them, it means lower wages, no job security, no protection from unfair dismissal and no cover for the tools of their trade, be that a drill or a bicycle.  The other big loser is the State which suffers huge losses in respect of PRSI contributions, with serious consequences for the public finances and the Exchequer.</p><p>The State should commit to outlawing this practice in every sector of the economy.  We cannot ignore the impacts this practice has on workers.  It is impossible to build a safe, secure or decent life for oneself and one's family if one's employer refuses to recognise the employment relationship that exists.  This practice must change.  We should not, and we cannot allow ourselves to, rebuild the economy on the basis of precarious work and bogus self-employment, but that is what will happen unless we take the necessary steps to stamp out the practice of bogus self-employment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700028#AA01500"><p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm labhairt leis na Teachta&iacute;, maraon leis an Aire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Naughton, faoi th&eacute;arnamh &aacute;r n-&eacute;arn&aacute;lacha turas&oacute;ireachta agus eitl&iacute;&oacute;chta, dh&aacute; earn&aacute;il a bhfuil dl&uacute;thnasc eatarthu.  I am pleased to have the opportunity, along with the Minister of State to address the House on the recovery and reopening of our tourism and aviation sectors, two sectors with close links.  The past 18 months have been incredibly difficult for everyone working in the tourism industry.  However, as our economy and society have reopened over the last few months and as pandemic restrictions are eased further, we can begin to look forward to a sustainable recovery for this vital indigenous economic sector.  The importance of tourism in Ireland cannot be understated.  It is a sector that has made a huge economic and social contribution in recent years across the country.  I am confident that, with our support, it will fully recover from the crisis and thrive again in a manner that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.</p>  <p>  In 2019, prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, tourism was worth &euro;9.5 billion in total to our economy from overseas tourists and the fares they generated, together with domestic tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has previously estimated that 23 cent in every euro generated in tourism expenditure went back to the Exchequer in tax revenues.  This equates to &euro;1.8 billion in Exchequer revenue.  Tourism supported 260,000 jobs across the country, both in remote rural areas and in our towns and cities.  It sustains communities and drives regional development in a manner that most other industries struggle to emulate.</p>  <p>  The tourism landscape changed drastically in early 2020 with the outbreak and spread of Covid-19.  It has had a devastating impact on the tourism industry in Ireland and across the world.  The pandemic struck Irish tourism towards the end of the first quarter of 2020, by which stage only 10% to 15% of annual overseas spending would have accrued.  After the first quarter there was a collapse in overseas travel, and the OECD estimates that international tourism worldwide fell by 80% in 2020.  Since the advent of Covid-19 and the consequential and necessary public health measures, many of the jobs supported by tourism have been lost or are surviving with State support, and income from the sector is a fraction of what it was in 2019.  Last year, the tourism recovery task force estimated that of the 260,000 jobs in the sector prior to the onset of the pandemic, 180,000 are either lost or vulnerable.</p> <p>The successful domestic summer seasons last year and this year have been very welcome and helpful to the sector.  However, the sector cannot begin to fully recover until inbound overseas tourism resumes in a meaningful way.</p> <p> Last year,  a tourism recovery task force was put in place to prepare a tourism recovery plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis.  The task force presented the plan to me in September of 2020 and it has been more than useful for both my Cabinet colleagues and me in considering measures that can assist the sector.</p> <p> I appointed a recovery oversight group to oversee the implementation of the tourism recovery plan and it reports to me on a regular basis with updates on implementation and the recovery of the sector.  The group has just submitted its third report to me.  I will use the report as an important policy consideration as I continue my work, alongside my colleagues, to support the tourism sector in this most challenging period.  It is clear that substantial progress has been made in helping tourism to survive and recover from the Covid crisis.</p> <p> Since the beginning of the pandemic in Ireland, it has been clear that the tourism sector would be severely impacted.  My Department, together with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Government, has responded to this challenge by providing the supports that would enable strategic tourism businesses survive the pandemic and re-emerge in a safe and sustainable manner.  In the final months of 2020, I allocated funding to F&aacute;ilte Ireland to administer a Covid-19 adaptation fund, an Ireland-based inbound agents business continuity scheme and a coach tourism operators business continuity scheme.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland also administered the restart grant plus for bed and breakfasts, on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p> <p> In budget 2021, I secured a record level of funding of just under &euro;221 million for tourism, including &euro;55 million for F&aacute;ilte Ireland's tourism business continuity scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to support strategic tourism businesses to survive through the pandemic and help drive the recovery of tourism.  In total, since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, I understand that in excess of &euro;75 million has been paid out in dedicated tourism supports.  The VAT reduction to 9% until September 2022, has also given the tourism and hospitality sector some additional breathing space, and is helping with its viability and price competitiveness.</p> <p> In addition to these direct tourism-specific supports, tourism businesses have benefited from horizontal supports such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, as well as the commercial rates waiver, tax debt warehousing and other initiatives such as pathways to work and the business resumption support scheme.  One striking statistic is that employees in the accommodation and food services sector alone have been supported to the tune of over &euro;1.5 billion from the EWSS and its predecessor the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  This is a remarkable figure which shows the Government's commitment to those whose livelihoods have been so negatively impacted by the crisis.  In the economic recovery plan, we acknowledge that continuing support for the tourism sector will be important for the coming adjustment period, as public health restrictions are lifted and international travel is restored.</p> <p> I am currently engaged with my Government colleagues in preparing for next week's budget.  We will consider both the importance of economy-wide support measures for tourism jobs and businesses and any additional sector-specific measures which may be required.  Any further measures must be directed at those businesses and jobs with ongoing difficulties and the restoration of international tourism.</p> <p> While our domestic tourism market has helped sustain the industry, it now needs international visitors to return in significant numbers in order to facilitate a meaningful recovery.  In 2019, overseas tourists spent more than &euro;5.1 billion in our economy.  Since the easing of restrictions on 19 July, overseas visitors have started to return to our shores but at a much lower level than prior to the pandemic.</p> <p> The competition globally to attract tourists will be more challenging than ever.  To this end, Tourism Ireland has started to roll out the green carpet and welcome back our international visitors, as it works to encourage as many overseas holidaymakers as possible to book Ireland for their next holiday destination.  The concept centres on creating a commitment to travel by encouraging people to Press the Green Button - green being the universal colour of go and instinctively connected with the island of Ireland.  I was happy to help Tourism Ireland launch this new campaign in both the UK and the United States recently when I travelled to both markets to engage with our industry partners in order to reassure them that Ireland was open and waiting to welcome back visitors.</p> <p> Connectivity is a major part of the picture here.  Air access for tourism is a virtuous circle.  Increased access drives tourism and increased demand for tourism helps to increase air capacity.  I am aware, of course, that aviation poses challenges for the environment and I look forward to what the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, has to say on that.</p> <p> At the start of this week, the Government launched the new National Development Plan 2021-2030.  With provision for &euro;165 billion worth of investment, this is the largest national development plan in the history of the State.  The capital investment priorities for my Department will support economic recovery and resilience in the tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sport and media sectors, while also enhancing individual and community well-being and advancing social, economic and environmental sustainability to protect our unique cultural, linguistic and sporting heritage for generations to come.</p> <p> The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on tourism.  As we rebuild this vital sector, we must do so in a way that ensures the contribution of the tourism sector to our economic recovery, providing sustainable employment across Ireland in a way that protects our unique environment.  With specific regard to tourism capital investment, I look forward to seeing the delivery of projects that will support a sustainable tourism sector - sustainable from an environmental, social, and economic perspective.  The new national development plan provides for the delivery of enhanced amenity through investment in tourism product development, including through Platforms for Growth, F&aacute;ilte Ireland's capital investment strategy to target projects that have the greatest potential to grow and foster sustainable tourism.</p> <p> I am also excited about the investments we are making in redeveloping and enhancing the sustainability of our national and regional cultural infrastructure, including significant capital projects at our national cultural institutions.  For example, the ambitious redevelopment plans for the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork will open up our national collections to even more people, enhancing the visitor experience of the gallery while also protecting and enhancing the sustainability of this historic building at the heart of the city.</p> <p> While many challenges lie ahead, the Government is committed to continuing support for tourism and to working towards its full reopening and recovery.  From a tourism perspective, a real recovery will only be possible when inbound international tourism returns.  Compared with most other EU member states, Ireland's tourism sector is highly dependent on overseas travel.  Such travel accounts for some 75% of spending in Ireland by tourists.  Since the pandemic there has been a complete collapse in overseas travel to Ireland.  That does not mean that we should not maximise the domestic opportunity over the next few years.  While the level of demand from the home market cannot compensate for the loss of overseas tourism, it plays a vital bridging role in getting the industry through the current survival phase.</p> <p> Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector, with up to two-thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages.  My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other Departments to ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages,</p> <p> A collaborative approach by stakeholders, including industry bodies, education providers, Departments and State agencies will be required to address the skills shortages in the tourism sector.  As tourism and hospitality provide significant employment in all parts of the country, this will be vital for the recovery of the sector.</p> <p> Prior to the pandemic it was becoming clear that the traditional model of tourism was changing.  As a Green Party Minister, I am concerned about the tourism impacts on our natural environment and local communities.  In this regard, officials within my Department have initiated the development of a new national tourism policy which seeks to mainstream the concept of sustainability.  The development of this new policy gives us an opportunity to set out what type of tourism sector we want up to 2030 and beyond.</p> <p> The tourism sector has proven itself resilient before.  I am optimistic that, as our economy and society begin to open up, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="13:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700029#BB00200"><p>I am glad to have this opportunity to update the House on the recovery of aviation, which is a key supporting element in the recovery of tourism that the Minister has just outlined.</p>  <p>  The Government is very much alive to the challenges faced by both sectors and has proven its commitment to their recovery through the various strategic and financial supports provided to date.  I am pleased to report that we are seeing some positive trends towards recovery in Irish aviation but there is still some distance to go.  Much still depends on the international Covid context, global vaccination rates and the return of consumer confidence in respect of safe air travel.</p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to touch upon two other key developments which will impact aviation during the recovery ahead: the domestic regulatory reform process to establish a single aviation regulator in Ireland; and the sustainability challenge faced by the sector in responding to the EU's recent commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 55% by 2030.</p>  <p>  Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, my officials and I have remained in close contact with key stakeholders in the aviation sector.</p> <p>It was clear from this engagement that the single most important factor for Irish aviation was the reopening of international travel, subject to public health considerations.  This reopening began on 19 July, following a period of extensive preparation and collaboration between Departments, industry and international partners.  Central to this was the substantial work undertaken to introduce the enhanced passenger locator form and the EU digital Covid certificate.  Under these arrangements, we have seen a very welcome recovery in passenger numbers, with throughput at the State airports in mid-September up nearly 300% on the levels of 19 July.  However, passenger numbers at Irish airports are running at around 50% of pre-pandemic levels, compared with an average of 70% at other European airports.  I am hopeful this will improve shortly and there are positive signs in this respect.</p> <p> The news that Ryanair will reopen its Cork Airport base from December, which secures 60 jobs, is very welcome.  We have seen the limited return of Aer Lingus to Shannon on the London to Heathrow route and its recent announcement of the phased reintroduction of numerous European routes from Dublin this winter is another welcome development.</p> <p> The news of the intended relaxation of US travel rules for vaccinated European travellers from November means we can look forward to an increase in transatlantic traffic over the coming  months.  The announced return of both American Airlines and United Airlines to Shannon is a further positive development, particularly as transatlantic connectivity is key to many commercial activities in the mid-west region, as well as serving as a boon to our tourism and hospitality sector.</p> <p> Much of the recovery in passenger numbers has been driven by our successful vaccination programme and those of our European neighbours.  At this stage, approximately 90% of incoming passengers completing the electronic passenger locator form are fully vaccinated.  Ireland's reputation as a safe destination is also enhanced by our impressive vaccination figures and our position at the top of the Bloomberg Covid resilience ranking.  This is a vindication of Ireland's careful approach to Covid-19 and international travel and I am confident this approach will reap benefits from here on in.</p> <p> We cannot underplay, however, the seriousness of the impact that Covid has had on the aviation sector.  The industry is emerging from its greatest ever crisis and it needed substantial support throughout this time to remain resilient.  Here again, the Government was not found wanting.  From the beginning of the pandemic, the Government has taken strong and targeted action with a broad range of unprecedented Exchequer supports to help mitigate the effects of the crisis, including a wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, a commercial rates waiver and deferred tax liabilities.  It is estimated that Irish airlines and airports will have availed of over &euro;440 million through several of the available supports by the end of 2021.  In addition, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund, DAA secured &euro;40 million and Aer Lingus secured &euro;150 million.</p> <p> In November 2020, a dedicated funding package for Irish aviation totalling &euro;80 million was announced.  This package included the regional airports programme, which provides over &euro;21 million for 2021 to Ireland West, Donegal and Kerry airports and supports the operation of our public service obligation air service between Donegal and Dublin.  The Covid-19 regional State airports programme for 2021 provides &euro;32 million to Cork and Shannon airports.  A &euro;26 million Covid supplementary supports scheme will compensate airport operators towards the losses caused by Covid-19 and the travel restrictions imposed to limit its spread.  This saw &euro;20 million in compensation disbursed to Dublin, Cork, and Shannon, providing the State airports with flexibility to roll out route incentives and charge rebates in consultation with airlines, with a view to supporting recovery and growth of connectivity.  Of the total, &euro;6 million was provided for Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West airports.</p> <p> I assure Deputies that the Government is keeping under review the need for any additional targeted supports to this vital sector.  Deputies will be aware that the economic recovery plan published by the Government on 1 June explicitly references this and recognises that additional supports may be required to support the aviation sector's recovery as it reopens.</p> <p> International travel is vital for the continued economic well-being of this country and maintaining its recovery, and it will continue to remain a priority for the Government.  Supports needed to help all regional airports, including Shannon and Cork, are being considered in the context of budget 2022.  I recently wrote to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the provision of support for the licensed travel trade in light of continuing uncertainty for that sector.  The travel trade is expected to be one of the last to recover from the impact of the pandemic.  Consumer confidence remains unstable and the industry has forecast that most bookings in 2021 will relate to 2022 and that trade will not recover to any meaningful extent until that year at the earliest.</p> <p> The availability of general wage supports undoubtedly sustained many small businesses over the course of the pandemic but the risk of insolvencies has re-emerged now that travel agents and tour operators are falling outside eligibility for the Covid restrictions support scheme since the more general reopening of non-essential retail from 17 May.  That is despite low levels of holiday booking.  Support for this sector is support for small business and I will continue to advocate for it in discussions with my colleagues, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p> As the aviation sector continues to recover from the Covid-19 crisis, we must ensure we have a robust regulatory regime to sustain the recovery.  The Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020, which is moving through the legislative process, will provide this.  Whereas the current regulatory regime was put in place in the early 1990s, and has served the sector well over time, the institutional structures no longer reflect international best practice.  This Bill therefore proposes to put in place a modern regulatory system that will underpin Irish aviation for the next decade and more.</p> <p> This Bill has three main objectives.  First, it merges the regulatory functions of the Irish Aviation Authority with those of the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  In doing so, it establishes a single, independent and strengthened aviation regulator.  Second, it establishes a new commercial semi-State company to manage the air traffic control requirements of Irish controlled airspace, AirNav Ireland.  Third, it makes changes to how airport charges are set at Dublin Airport by putting a greater emphasis on the needs and expectations of the consumer.</p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, recovery from Covid cannot come at the expense of the climate and the aviation sector in particular is conscious of the need for a sustainable recovery in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the EU's commitment to reduce overall carbon emissions by 55% by 2030.  I am happy to advise that Dublin Airport was formally designated as level 3+ carbon-neutral in December 2020 by the global Airport Carbon Accreditation programme and is the first airport in Ireland to achieve carbon-neutral status.  All Irish airports are encouraged to sign up to Airports Council International, ACI, Europe's carbon accreditation programme and, where feasible, the regional airports programme will seek to support eligible airports to achieve goals in this respect.</p> <p> In addition, officials in my Department are also engaged in the negotiation of several key files at EU level as part of the EU's Fit for 55 package.  These measures aim to address the sustainability challenge for aviation but will require efforts and investments by both airlines and airports.  I fully recognise that the need to meet this sustainability challenge is coming at a time when the sector is trying to regain its footing but the aviation sector is nothing if not innovative.  I am confident that the supports and commitments to the sector provided by the Government will position it to rise to the dual challenge of recovering in a sustainable manner.</p></speech>

The industry employs, directly and indirectly, over 140,000 people and it is vital to our economy and society as an island nation.  Many of these workers faced savage cuts over the past 18 months and the vast majority are still not on their full wages or working hours.  There are real concerns about their prospects of getting back to that point.  This has a real impact on families, communities and local economies.</p>  <p>  We should not forget the experience of these dedicated workers.  Newspaper headlines indicated that cabin crew were struggling to feed their families at a time when their employer was receiving hundreds of millions of euro in State support, all while that employer and the Department of Social Protection pointed fingers at each other over short-term work supports.</p> <p>This was the absolute worst of the pandemic.  It was shameful and it is continuing in that company, and in other companies in aviation, as the sector tries to exploit the pandemic.</p> <p> The Minister of State will be aware of very significant industrial relations issues across the aviation sector.  Last month, Aer Lingus ground staff and cabin crew both rejected efforts by the company to target their work terms and conditions in order to offset losses at the airline.  These workers already faced massive income losses during the pandemic.  Permanent cuts to their working conditions will not help the sector to recover.  Aer Lingus is seeking to take advantage of the pandemic after it received hundreds of millions of euro in support from taxpayers.  The State must intervene to protect jobs in the sector.  </p> <p> Similarly, the DAA's attempt to outsource front-line maintenance work is disgraceful and something Sinn F&eacute;in opposes.  This is a semi-State company.  Outsourcing is far too often the precursor to further attacks on the terms and conditions of workers.  This is not acceptable and it should be opposed in the strongest terms.  Furthermore, members of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications have all received correspondence from air traffic control workers highlighting a litany of concerns about the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA.  I have written to the Minister of State on this but have yet to receive a substantive reply.</p> <p> I know the Minister of State cannot comment specifically on all these cases, but it is very important that reassurance is provided in the House today that the Government is engaging on these issues.  We cannot leave these matters, and the future of our aviation sector, to the whim of the market.  If we do that, we can forget about regional balance.  The State must use its position.  We need to bear in mind we are an island nation.  Far too often, Ministers have washed their hands of transport matters and let industrial relations issues spiral out of control.  We do not want to see that happen now as the aviation sector begins to recover.</p> <p> It is also essential that the State continues to support these workers.  I hope the Minister of State will provide some insight on the medium-term supports the Government is planning.  There has been a clear call from workers and their unions in the sector for an aviation-specific employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, to be put in place to support workers until the sector recovers.  Last month, the Minister of State told me the Government is having constructive conversations on this as part of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, subgroup.  I would like an update on that.  I noted nothing was forthcoming in her opening comments.  The extension is about getting us over the shoulder.  People in the sector are saying they have missed their season, which does not start again until around St. Patrick's Day.</p> <p> The Minister of State mentioned the Fit for 55 EU-level package.  There is an opportunity for Ireland to be a leader in the transition towards alternative fuels.  We do not have a hydrogen strategy and we should have one.  There is an opportunity in that.  We are in a unique position on international aviation and we can be leaders in the field.  Otherwise, we will be playing catch-up.</p> <p> From a tourism perspective, we want to make travel as convenient as possible for people, while also having appropriate public health measures in place.  Do we have any indication of the date on which routes to the United States will reopen?  Many people are very interested in that and it has a major impact on the aviation sector.  A query that comes up time and again relates to vaccinated individuals.  Very many people in Ireland received the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not licensed in the United States.  Will it be accepted there?  Does the Minister of State have any information on that?  It is a query.  I hope the vaccine would be accepted given the number of people in Ireland who have been vaccinated with it.  </p> <p> I will speak about the coach tourism sector, which is related to the briefs of both the Minister and the Minister of State in different ways.  Representatives of that sector have outlined the major challenges it faces.  They have identified a number of measures they believe need to be taken to get them back on their feet and sustain them through this period.  They, too, have called for an extension of the EWSS and specific targeted supports for the sector.  They are facing challenges with forbearance and depreciation of assets.  This is a sector deserving of significant support and I encourage both the Minister and the Minister of State to engage with it positively.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="13:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700031#DD00200"><p>The effect the pandemic has had on tourism cannot be overstated.  It has been devastating.  It has been said many times but it is worth repeating that tourism was among the first sectors to shut down when the pandemic hit and it will be among the last to resume normal activities.  Before the pandemic, tourism was one of the most successful indigenous sectors in the State.  It had a very successful year in 2019 when approximately &euro;9 billion in revenue was generated.  Almost &euro;7 billion of that was generated by overseas visitors and &euro;2 billion was from the domestic tourism market.  This shows the reliance the sector has on overseas business and the devastation that travel restrictions have had on our tourism sector since March 2020.  This is especially true for every part of the country that has a significant reliance on tourism.</p>  <p>  Some 18% of jobs in Kerry are directly dependent on tourism.  The figure for Donegal is 13%, for Waterford it is 12% and in Dublin it is 10%.  We know that a large number of people working in tourism and hospitality had to rely on pandemic supports in the past year and a half.  Some have since lost their jobs or have left the sector.  There are many reasons for this.  Many people who are not originally from Ireland returned home during the pandemic and others left seeking more stable work or retrained to work in a new sector.  I mention also that for many years we have had problems with poor pay and conditions in some sections of tourism and hospitality.  These issues have been around for years and we need to address them to ensure the sustainability of the sector and that it grows again.  Workers in this sector need to be paid a living wage and have decent terms and conditions of employment.  These are basic rights that any worker in a modern, affluent country, such as Ireland, should expect.  Good pay and conditions will also help with staff retention, which has been a major problem for businesses this year.  </p>  <p>  The sector is not a monolith and some businesses were able to open and do business this summer, while others were not in a position to do so.  Although we are expecting to reopen fully on 22 October, it will soon be winter.  Businesses that rely on international travel will find they are still struggling.  Many businesses will not be back to normal until more travel restrictions are eased and the season begins again next year.</p>  <p>  The Government provided supports during the pandemic with varying degrees of success.  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the EWSS were vital supports.  We need to ensure the EWSS remains available in a targeted way to protect businesses that remain affected by Covid into 2022.  Other supports that were designed for tourism and hospitality were clunky.  They left out large numbers of businesses or were badly tailored so take-up was low.  There was no stimulus from the Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in put forward a sensible, fully costed plan to give every adult and child in the State a voucher to spend in the tourism and hospitality sectors.  It would have given families a hand at a time when so many people had lost their jobs or were temporarily out of work and it would have put money straight back into local tills in every county in the State.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget has made provision for a pre-Christmas voucher scheme of &euro;200 for adults and &euro;100 for children.  We have also proposed allocations for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and a fund for local authorities to improve their tourism offerings in the coming year.  Instead of a stimulus package or plan from the Government, we got the stay-and-spend rebate scheme, which was a complete flop.  Some &euro;2 million of the &euro;270 million that was set aside was claimed.  We were hoping to see a more sensible stimulus scheme in the July stimulus plan but there was nothing in that either.  After 18 months of the biggest disaster ever to hit tourism and hospitality, there is still no stimulus plan.</p>  <p>  Other areas too are still in limbo.  We need clarity on the reopening of nightlife in the coming weeks.  Businesses need to know so they can make plans now ahead of 22 October.</p> <p>Culture and nightlife were completely forgotten.  Professional musicians suffered, and continue to suffer, extreme hardship.  Artists are still waiting for clarity on the basic income proposal and what exactly it will mean.  We must ensure that the groups at the bottom of the Government's priority list are prioritised now.  The fact that the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media was this summer blocked from attending the Cabinet sub-committee tells us all we need to know about the attitude of this Government to the arts, culture and tourism.</p></speech>

Derry city is the fourth largest city on this island.  It is a part of the north west city region of Donegal, Derry city and Strabane and has a population of 300,000.  It has been battered by partition but has fantastic leaders.  No matter where people come from on the political spectrum, we have united to make the case for our region and access to it.</p>  <p>  In recent years, we have had major setbacks with the A5 project.  The legal delays to this dual carriageway project from Donegal to Derry city, through Tyrone and on to Monaghan and our capital city have been heartbreaking.  The project has hit a wall but I believe we can get it back on track in the near future.</p>  <p>  We also have no rail connectivity from Donegal and Derry directly to our capital city, or to the west, for that matter.  The map of the connectivity of Ireland shows a stark picture.  That is why it is shocking that Irish Governments continue to refuse financial support to the City of Derry Airport.  Some 40% of the passengers passing through the airport come from Donegal and our Government makes no financial contribution towards it.  Derry City and Strabane District Council has been carrying the can for the airport for years with no support from the Irish Government.  The Stormont Executive has been funding it and the British Government has been contributing.  Shamefully, our Government has abandoned the airport for ten years now.</p>  <p>  I have received responses from the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  I appreciate she has inherited this issue and I hope she will take a fresh perspective on it.  In a response to me recently, she talked about the context of the New Decade, New Approach agreement and indicated she would carry out reviews of the potential of the Belfast-Cork and Derry-Dublin routes.  I thank her for those responses and the proposed reviews.  I am sure she understands, as a woman from the regions, that it is unthinkable and unacceptable for a region of 300,000 people to have no motorway, rail or air connectivity to our capital city.  This has been going on for far too long.</p>  <p>  Like all airports, the City of Derry Airport lost a huge amount of business due to Covid, but it is up and moving again.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to directly make this statement to the Minister of State.  What has happened is totally wrong.  We talk about all-Ireland development and working together but we have abandoned Derry City and Strabane District Council to run an airport when 40% of its passengers are from Donegal.  That is wrong and must stop.  I appeal to the Minister of State to find a solution to this problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="13:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700032#EE00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue for us, as an island nation.  It directly affects several thousand workers and families in my constituency of Louth and east Meath.  There is a concentration of aviation workers in these areas.  There are people who depend for their livelihoods on Dublin Airport, and the aviation sector more generally, in Drogheda, Laytown, Bettystown, Mornington and Julianstown.  I know the Minister of State will be aware of that.</p><p>As my colleagues and the Minister of State and her senior ministerial colleague articulated, we all understand the impact the pandemic has had on livelihoods and prospects for those who are working in this critical sector.  The impact has been human and real.  Not a week passes that I am not contacted by an Aer Lingus, Ryanair or DAA worker who is worried about the outsourcing of his or her job and tells me how difficult it is to make ends meet.  These people tell me of their worries about making the mortgage payment or paying the rent and heating their home.  </p><p>The truth is that this Government has, to a degree, supported individual airlines, notably Aer Lingus, through the crisis with State support and many millions in low-cost loans.  We have, however, missed an opportunity again and again to attach any kind of conditionality to the low-cost, long-term loans and other forms of State support, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, previously the temporary wage subsidy scheme, that were given to the likes of Aer Lingus and other organisations operating in the aviation sector.  We have, in many ways, socialised the costs of bailing out and supporting the airline sector and all we have had in return is more cost-cutting, the closure of bases and the culling of staff, alongside empty claims of solidarity and tokenistic gestures from airlines.</p><p>This is a real failure of Government policy.  There was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to attach requirements around working conditions, pay and so on as a condition of State support.  That is done routinely in modern, social democratic countries, such as Germany where conditions are attached to State support.  What we got instead was thousands of short-term lay-offs, confusion around the provision of social welfare for workers who were caught in the eye of this particular storm and the reality of outsourcing and so on in a critical sector.  I proposed in some detail last year that the employment wage subsidy scheme be reimagined and placed on a firmer footing based on the German <i>Kurzarbeit </i>model.  We could have a new wage subsidy scheme as a permanent feature of the labour market to assist industries, such as aviation, to recover.</p><p>We know, belatedly, that the Government is engaging in discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with which I remain close on these issues, to seek to introduce such a measure to assist aviation, which will, as we know, be one of the last sectors to fully recover.  There is no sign of any detail on that particular scheme.  We have made provision in the Labour Party's fully costed alternative budget proposition, published yesterday, for the introduction of such a scheme.  That will become a more permanent feature of the labour market because we know that it is difficult to recover jobs when they are lost.  When a sector sheds jobs, it is difficult for that sector to recover.  We were in danger of losing decades worth of skill sets within a sector that is crucial for our country.  It is crucial that supports are provided but conditions around pay, terms and conditions of employment, upskilling and retraining should be attached to any future supports.</p><p>I turn to the issue of refunds for cancellations caused by Covid-19.  It is not only workers who have been affected by the pandemic; customers have also borne the brunt of the crisis.  We have seen airlines refuse to refund up to 400,000 customers, including many hard-pressed families who had their holidays rescheduled in good faith, in line with public health guidelines.  Some airlines have been easier to deal with than others and I think all Deputies will have represented families who had difficulties with airlines to help recover the moneys owed.  It was clear that those moneys were always owed and belonged to customers.  The process has been frustrating, to say the least.  I have raised this matter through parliamentary questions on many occasions over the past year or so.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Again, this is something that really should not have happened and it would not have if the Government was clear on the kind of conditions and behaviour it expected from the aviation industry in return for State support.  I welcome last week's decision by a group of 16 European airlines, including Ryanair, to refund passengers whose flights were cancelled during the Covid-19 pandemic.  These airlines have committed to providing better information on passengers' rights in the future.  Talk is cheap.  We have previously seen airlines renege on such promises with regards to refunds and customer service improvements, so enforcement will be essential.  I call on both Ministers responsible for this area to ensure that there is proper enforcement of this agreement and that ordinary families and holidaymakers, who save hard for holidays, are treated with respect and receive their long-overdue refunds.</p></speech>

The two Ministers represent the two sectors most ravaged by Covid.  It has been predicted by those within those industries that the post-Covid recovery could take three or four years.  That is certainly the case in respect of aviation.  There has been a little bit of a bounce back in the tourism sector as a result of domestic tourism and the whole concept of staycations.  That has been excellent but we will not see a full recovery until we see international tourists on the highways and byways of our island.</p>  <p>  There is an opportunity to recalibrate aviation in Ireland post Covid and to draft an entirely new aviation policy that ensures there is not regional imbalance.  Over the last seven or eight years, we have seen increased funnelling of air traffic through Dublin Airport.  Some might say that is what the consumer wants.  It may be what people flying into Ireland want.  There could be an element of truth to that.  Some might also say that Ireland is a small island and that two or three hours on the road will take one to the other side of the country.  However, the reality is that the dominance of Dublin Airport in the years running up to Covid has been to the detriment of Shannon Airport in my own constituency and, to a lesser extent, the airports in Cork and Knock.  There is now an opportunity to do as other countries such as Holland, Finland and Denmark have done and to grasp the nettle once and for all, overhaul Irish aviation policy and have the three airports working in tandem so that one does not dominate at the expense of the others.  The relationship between Irish airports in recent years has been rather predatory.  We are a small island and that does not work any more.  The airport chiefs and those in the industry are saying likewise.  Government needs to lead and devise a brand new policy to reflect that.</p>  <p>  Earlier today, the joint committee met with the newly appointed chairperson, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  I thank the Minister for expediting that appointment in recent weeks.  There was a very long delay which no one in the region wanted but he is there now and we welcome that.  He made an interesting point, which I had raised in the Select Committee on Transport and Communications last week.  I suggested that he should take on the role in a more executive capacity.  At the moment, he will be chairing meetings which may only happen every second or third week.  There is a feeling in the region and among those who have Shannon Airport in their hearts that P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh will be a very positive influence, working alongside the chief executive, Mary Considine.  He made the point today that taking on an executive function over the next 12 months could be a very good thing and we really believe that.  It would allow him to immerse himself in the airport as it tries to recover.  I ask the Minister to look at that.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said that this may not be the best way forward but, in light of today's meeting, it needs to be looked at again.</p>  <p>  On a further point regarding the recovery of aviation, waiving landing charges would be a great incentive.  Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh made that point in the committee room.  Having led Aer Arann for many years, he knows how airports and airlines engage with one another and what kind of offers are put on the table.  He told us categorically that many European airports are again offering free landing slots to airlines to stimulate demand and get the airlines back.  We have supported the sector but we now need to stimulate the recovery.  I hope some of these things can be looked at.</p>  <p>  Just last week, JetBlue began transatlantic operations.  Its aircraft are now touching down in Gatwick.  There is a unique opportunity there in respect of budget transatlantic travel between Ireland and the United States.  I hope we can look at that.</p>  <p>  I have also worn a path down the street to the Saudi Embassy.  There is a belief that we can run new routes between Shannon Airport and the Middle East.  I nearly said the mid-west.  We could have routes from the mid-west to the Middle East.  The airport in Riyadh is craving the hub status enjoyed by the airport in Doha, Qatar, Abu Dhabi International Airport and other Middle Eastern airports.  There is an opportunity there.</p>  <p>  I implore the Minister to appoint a mediator in respect of the ongoing Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, staff dispute.  The IAA has told us time and time again that it has an internal dispute reconciliation process but I am hearing from people I trust, whom I have known since I was knee high, with whom I grew up and who now work within the inner sanctums of the Irish Aviation Authority, that this internal dispute resolution mechanism is not working on this occasion.  We implore the Minister and the other Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to push on and put a mediator in place.  It would really expedite this process.  The authority plays a very strategic role.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister not to penalise the aviation sector in budget 2022, with particular regard to carbon tax.  We all fear that.  There is a real fear that carbon taxes will be loaded on many sectors.  Aviation cannot take that.</p>  <p>  In the last minute I have, I will raise a few points regarding tourism.  There are fantastic opportunities for tourism.  The staycation concept has worked but much more needs to be done.  Some areas I hope we could look at as budget 2022 is finalised include an extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, right up to next summer when the sector will bounce back properly and the retention of the 9% VAT rate which is enticing people out of their homes to go and spend money, to go to their local hostelries and to go on holiday to other parts of Ireland.  We need to extend that, possibly for another three or four years.  Other matters that should be considered are an extension of the commercial rates waiver and international marketing.</p>  <p>  I will ask for the forbearance of the Ceann Comhairle as I go on a slight tangent.  In my last speech in the Chamber, last week, I asked for assistance in getting an Afghan family who are neighbours of mine home.  They are now home.  I want to thank the Minister and all of his team but I also want to thank a local lady, Catherine Hickey from Westbury, on the record of the House.  Day after day, she sent WhatsApp and Facebook messages championing the family.  They are home and Ms Hickey deserves to be thanked.</p></speech>

They are working very hard in the Department in their respective portfolios.  I thank them for that work because it is very important to hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country.  I also acknowledge Maria Melia from the Department, who is here with us today.  She does great work behind the scenes.  That has to be acknowledged because, without the work of those in the Department, who do so much, we would not be seeing the progress we are seeing.  As we all know, there are enormous challenges facing tourism, hospitality and aviation in this country but I would like to acknowledge the really good initiatives that have been undertaken and the really good work that has been done, particularly over the last year and a half, since the beginning of the pandemic.  We have seen unprecedented intervention in the industry from the Government in the last year and a half.  The supports now given to the industry would have been unthinkable before the pandemic.  We have seen a massive amount of Government support.</p>  <p>  Of course, that cannot go on forever, but I urge the Ministers to listen very keenly to the representatives of the industry in advance of the budget.  They are calling for various supports to be continued and for various other measures.  These are the people at the front line and they know exactly what is needed.  They are not exaggerating when making these asks.  They are very genuine people.  I refer to people like Eoghan O'Mara Walsh of the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, and those in the Irish Hotels Federation.  Bernadette Randles of the Kerry branch of that organisation was in contact with me recently.  These people are putting in their asks for the budget.  They are asking for what is needed, not for luxuries or frills.  These measures are absolutely necessary.  I will reference the EWSS in particular.  That is very important.  We need to see that continued well into 2022.  I was looking at texts on my phone from the then Taoiseach dated 14 March 2020, when the pandemic was starting to grip the country.  We were looking at those types of ideas and how we could support industry, keep businesses afloat and subsidise them.  I am thankful that the scheme was developed and put in place very effectively and very quickly but it needs to be continued because we have seen a great loss in revenue and turnover among the businesses affected.  That is very important.</p>  <p>  The VAT rate should be set at 9% permanently.  I welcome the fact that this rate has been reintroduced but the industry needs a commitment that it will be maintained indefinitely.</p> <p>That is something that is very much worth fighting for and will provide certainty to the industry.</p> <p> What has been done regarding rates is very welcome but hat support needs to continue.  Grants and the tax moratorium cannot be taken away, but instead need to be kept in place for a long time.  There is a huge challenge with the cost doing business in terms of energy and insurance.  We need more action on that.  We need to ensure that climate action on fuel and energy is targeted and does not make things too uncompetitive for our tourism and hospitality sectors.  That is a real danger and concern for many operators. </p> <p>  Skills and staffing are massive challenges.  We need a highly innovative approach to ensure that businesses can retain and train staff, and make the hospitality sector attractive for people to work in long into the future.  That is important.</p> <p> I welcome the efforts that have been made in respect of connectivity.  On the Press the Green Button initiative, I note the Minister was in the United States recently and did her best to promote the country, which is very welcome.  We need to support Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland with stronger budgets.  The work they do is invaluable.  Every cent invested in Tourism Ireland is well invested and comes back in droves for the country.  It is something of which we need to be mindful in the budget.  We need to support that organisation and the excellent work it does under the leadership of Mr. Niall Gibbons and his wonderful team all over the world.  They have a massive global footprint but it needs to be supported with funding from the State.</p> <p> Among a number of initiatives I am passionate about is developing the wild Atlantic walkway, something that is in the programme for Government.  I was keen to have it included in the programme.  It would be a massive opportunity for this country if we could progress that.  On the other side of the country, there is a wonderful coastline from Carlingford to Cobh, which is an untapped resource.  It could contribute hugely to Ireland as an international walking tourism destination. </p> <p> We have made great progress in recent years on our greenway network.  A lot more has to be done.  I am very hopeful that the south Kerry greenway will get through the planning process and that funding will be forthcoming when it does.  The target needs to be to link up the entire network to create a single cycling destination on greenways in this country.  That is achievable but the funding and will needs to be there.  I do not doubt the will is there but it is something we all need to work on collectively.</p></speech>

They prop up and sustain other micro-economies in the county.  I will have Shannon Airport at the core.</p>  <p>  First and foremost, I want to talk about the future of Shannon Airport as we emerge from Covid-19.  I propose, as I have done on many occasions, the reintegration of Shannon Airport into something similar to what the DAA was, to be known as the national airport authority.  As we know, in 2008 Cork and Shannon had comparable footfall numbers of 3.2 million and seemed to be on an equal footing.  Fast forward ten years and there is a massive difference of 1 million after separation.  We now know with certainty that the separation did not work but failed drastically.  The proof showed itself in the name of Covid-19.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in, along with the trade unions, opposed separation.  We vigorously opposed the privatisation of Aer Lingus in 2015 by Fine Gael and Labour.  We said at the time that it would cost jobs in the long run.  Lo and behold, we were right.  The fallout in Shannon Airport above other Irish airports exposes that fact.</p>  <p>  One of my constituents who works for Aer Lingus was relocated involuntarily to Dublin in 2016 and is still expected to commute to Dublin more than once a week while subsisting on 60% of the usual income.  Constituents are being pushed to the limit and are not alone in terms of how far they are being stretched.  Shannon Airport brought in &euro;3.6 billion to GDP annually pre-Covid and directly and indirectly bolsters roughly 46,000 jobs in the mid-west.  We should aim for 2006 levels of footfall when, at its peak, the airport had footfall of 3.7 million.  That is what we would call building back better. </p>  <p>  We need to get beyond the buzzwords of balanced regional development and implement a policy that is fresh and puts in place positive discrimination to offset the unequal development of bigger players when compared to regional airports.  I had the pleasure of meeting the new Shannon Group chairperson today in the Committee on Transport and Communications.  He stated he still does not have access to documents.  I ask that this be rectified as soon as possible.  He also said that he would not put down the idea of reintegration.</p></speech>

I listened to a lot of the speakers.  We are an island that is deeply dependent on air and sea travel, but supporting the aviation sector during the pandemic was vital.  I agree that the TWSS should go forward.  I was very surprised by the number of pilots who live in my area, and heard their stories and the hardship they have gone through.  Given that I am from Cork, I might as well mention Cork Airport.  Dublin seems to be getting practically everything at the moment.  We have to regionalise and spread the influx of visitors throughout the country.</p>  <p>  We also need connectivity between airports and the main cities and towns.  There has to be a joined-up approach.  We have the best people in the world.  We probably have the best country in the world.  We have the best scenery in the world.  Why can we not promote it?  We need to invest in it.  That is the important thing.</p>  <p>  Greenways were mentioned.  They have been a fabulous initiative and I will always give credit where credit is due.  There is a lot of excitement in my area about the greenway from Midleton to Cork, even though people would have preferred a railway line along the route.  That was not a go at the time.  That is another issue in terms of connectivity. </p>  <p>  I would also like to mention the chambers of commerce in our cities and the work they do.  We must remember that.  We have to give credit to all of the other people who lost jobs, some on a permanent and others on a temporary basis, whether that was in shops, catering and other businesses due to the knock-on effect of the airport.  Thankfully, some of the ports remained open but not at the same capacity as previously. </p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister and Government to keep the supports going.  Let us try to open up our country safely.  As I said, this is a no-brainer.  We have the best country in the world.  We need proper connectivity and an organisation that can sell our soul out there.  If we get that right, the influx of money into the country will pay for itself fourfold.  I wish the Minister well in that.  I hope she will listen to the people and those who lobbied her on the budget.  It is to be hoped that by next summer, we can say that we got this right.</p></speech>

I acknowledge her work since she has gone into the Department.  I notice that she has been back on the road over the past few weeks in the US and the UK.  That is essential.  I want to endorse everything that Deputy Griffin said about Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland, two superb organisations.  There are people across the world in Tourism Ireland who sell the message very well and they need as much support as we can give.</p>  <p>  We cannot have any cliff-edge withdrawal of the supports for those colleagues that are essential to our tourism and hospitality sector, including EWSS and rates supports.  It is crucial that they are wound down on a controlled basis and continue well into next year because the market is not coming back.  </p>  <p>  However, there are many chickens coming home to roost due to a lack of investment in tourism and in particular, in skills training in the Irish tourism industry.  I am old enough to remember CERT.  It put a focus on tourism professions in cheffing, hotel management and many other areas in hotel and bar services.  That model was integrated into standard training models and we have lost many skills and talent as a consequence.  We need a focus on hospitality training in a way that CERT used to do.  It used to use hotels during the off-season to provide on-site training.  We need to once again build tourism into a career that is attractive for younger people and for those making changes in their lives.  The biggest challenge I hear about from the tourism and hospitality sectors is the inability to attract staff.</p> <p> I spoke earlier about Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Locally led tourism co-operatives such as Mayo North Tourism in my constituency, do amazing work and have developed a fantastic suite of marketing tools and social media skills for local hotels.  They have put a focus on this that Tourism Ireland cannot and that F&aacute;ilte Ireland do not.  These local tourism co-operatives need greater funding and support and need to be allowed to continue the way they are, with a continued investment in capital projects.  We had the Westport House announcement, which was very welcome and involves major investment, but we need further projects such as the proposed greenway from the C&eacute;ide Fields to D&uacute;n Briste and Downpatrick Head, which was the site of the Red Bull diving a few weeks ago.  It was a spectacular occasion, which will do wonders.  There is also the Killala Bay greenway from Killala to Ballina and Inniscrone.  I look forward to welcoming the Minister to join us in Ballina in 2023, when we will mark 300 years since the establishment of our town.  The work for that is already under way by a local group, including Mayo North Tourism, which I mentioned, Moy Valley and Ballina Chamber of Commerce.   A consortium of interests has come together, and we look forward to welcoming the Minister and look forward to her Department's support for that.</p> <p> Aviation is coming out of the most incredibly difficult challenges but doing so in a very focused manner.  I congratulate P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and wish him every success.  Is fear iontach agus &Eacute;ireannach iontach &eacute;, agus n&iacute;l aon dabht agam ach go nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; an-jab.  As Shannon and Cork airports, two State-owned airports, in whatever capacity, are pulled into the regional airports programme, I ask the Minister not to let that happen with a cost to the existing regional airports such as Ireland West Airport Knock.  We need to continue our supports for our airports such as Ireland West Airport Knock, which, before Covid, had just under 800,000 passengers per year.  We want to continue that growth.  It is essential.  I pay tribute to Arthur French, the chairman of the board, the board itself, Joe Gilmore and all the staff there on their work at such a difficult time.</p> <p> We continue to go back to tourism.  Every time our economy takes pressure, we go to tourism and agriculture.  However, we cannot keep taking from it; we have to put into it.  The Minister needs support in marketing, capital and investment in careers and training, and I hope she gets that support next Tuesday.</p></speech>

I know the Minister is a Dublin Deputy as well as a Minister, but often in the D&aacute;il Chamber there is a very unbalanced debate.</p>  <p>  I never knew I had so many cabin crew and pilots in my constituency until Covid came along.  The situation as of mid-September was as follows in respect of Aer Lingus.  The August operation - in other words, the total number of flights as opposed to the total number of passengers - out of Dublin was just below 40% of the August 2019 level.  The biggest challenge facing Aer Lingus, according to pilots, is the North Atlantic.  They say the mood music now is that the reopening of the United States to tourist traffic will not happen until at least November.  That is bad news for pilots and cabin crew and for tourism in Dublin.  This has led to a delay in starting transatlantic flights from Aer Lingus's new base in Manchester.  In Europe, as the Minister will be aware, passengers have been generally slower to come back than had been anticipated.  We welcome around Dublin city the sound of new voices, and continental voices are returning slowly to the streets.  However, anybody with the eyes to see and the ears to hear will know that the city has been absolutely decimated in the past 18 months.  We discovered when the tide went out that that tide related to tourism and business tourism.  When it went out, grass started growing on the streets of Dublin, and we need to address that.</p>  <p>  Some of the consequences I wish to focus on, one or two of which have been raised already, relate to the cost of doing business.  That has been raised so I will just reinforce it.  The food offering generally in the country has diminished, probably because of the skills that are unavailable.  I raised this with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, this morning in the different context of the need for training.  Many restaurants in Dublin are half-empty, not because they cannot get customers but because they have insufficient kitchen staff to cope with the level of demand and can organise only a certain number of covers as a result.  As Deputy Calleary said, some of the chickens are coming home to roost in respect of a complete lack of training and an utter reliance on foreign workers, including students, to come here to work part-time, which included an exploitative element.  Yet we keep building hotels in Dublin.  It keeps moving on.  It baffles me at this stage.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, our university system was reliant to some degree on the fees paid by international students.  Those international students have dried up as a source of income and a source of work.  We can see it around the city.  I refer to the displaced staff, particularly in hospitality and restaurants.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I spoke about that this morning as well.  I refer to people who left hospitality and have left it for good because it became so uncertain in the past 18 months that people could not bank on it as certain employment for them into the future.  Skilled chefs, kitchen staff and waiters have left and taken up employment in other areas.  It is not just a question of the tourists coming back in numbers; we have a big job ahead of us in re-equipping our hospitality industry and our aviation industry to face the consequences of a post-Covid environment.</p></speech>

Having listened to the contributions of Deputies all over the country, I echo the importance of tourism to the real economy and the constituency I represent.</p>  <p>  I wish to highlight the continued need to ensure that every effort is undertaken to support our regional airports, including Ireland West Airport Knock, which acts as an increasingly important gateway for the western and north-western region.  I have noted in the revised national development plan that the Government is committed to continued Exchequer support and grant aid for smaller regional airports through the regional airports programme, and that is most welcome.  Ireland West Airport Knock is an important part of this, along with other airports along the western seaboard.  It is worth mentioning that the NDP also highlights that one major project that is committed to at Ireland West Airport Knock is the upgrade of significant apron safety enhancement, which will greatly enhance operations at the airport.  I know that the capacity of aprons has been a long-standing issue at Ireland West Airport Knock.  I hope this commitment also includes increased capacity to boost the number of aeroplanes that may park at any one time at the airport.</p>  <p>  As other Deputies mentioned, our hotel sector also requires additional supports to maximise the recovery under way in our tourism sector.  An estimated 5,800 livelihoods are supported by tourism in Mayo.  I engaged this week with a number of people in the hotelier community on the ground.  This sector contributes over &euro;208 million to the local economy, and there is a need to ensure that the upcoming budget 2022 supports the sector at a level not seen previously.  Simple measures will make a real and lasting difference.  Some of these measures, as mentioned previously, are the extension of the EWSS, the retention of the 9% VAT rate until 2025, an extension of the commercial rates waiver until June 2022 and a doubling of the funding of international marketing.  This would go a long way in restoring air connectivity to 2019 levels.</p>  <p>  One final point relates to the strengthening of Ireland's inbound tour operators and coach tourism sector.  This sector will also play a key role in recovering Ireland's aviation and transportation visitors beyond our gateway cities.</p>  <p>  There is much to be done, but it remains that those working within our tourism sector are eager to step up to the plate.  Every assistance that can be provided to our tourism sector would go a long way in boosting the real economy in our towns and villages across the country.</p></speech>

Both sectors were very badly hit by those restrictions and it will take a long time for them to recover and to regain ground lost.</p> <p>In my constituency in north Kildare, I saw at first hand the financial and psychological crisis people found themselves in as diaries, rooms and venues were closed, amenities were locked up, theatres stayed dark and musical instruments were quiet.  Pilots and aviation crew were hit especially hard in a sector that, historically, was somewhat insulated from economic shocks and extreme worry about how to pay mortgages and college fees and keep the whole family show on the road.  Like Deputy Lahart, I did not realise there were so many people in my constituency working in the aviation sector.  As a new Deputy who is not a member of the parties in government, I was acutely aware that, often, all we could offer people in these sectors was to fight on their behalf for an extension of State supports and to be kind in the face of extreme suffering.</p> <p> In domestic terms, the Government's stay-and-spend tax rebate was a flop, with virtually no impact as a much-needed stimulus in the sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal to give a &euro;200 voucher to every adult and a &euro;100 voucher to every child in the State to spend in the sectors affected made much more sense and was more equitable.  Giving vouchers to citizens would provide the much-needed money and stimulus for the sectors.  It is a clever way of supporting businesses by funnelling the money through families and spreading some joy after a very dark period.  There seems to be confusion on the part of the Government as to what will be offered in this regard, but the Minister said last week that it might be going ahead.</p> <p> The Government's plan to reopen society at full capacity from 22 October, which will have a revitalising impact on the relevant sectors, is very welcome.  I look forward to welcoming our returning overseas visitors safely to north Kildare, where we have a magnificent tourism offering, including accommodation and hospitality, as part of Ireland's Ancient East.  Every second business in my home town, Maynooth, seems to be a restaurant.  One will find a welcome like no other there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700036#JJ00200"><p>One only has to look at the tourism sector's GDP share to realise its importance in this country.  On 22 October, society will reopen, with venues and attractions expected to be operating at full capacity.  The pandemic has had a devastating effect on tourism and its impact will be felt for a long time after the full reopening of society.  The sector will need significant support, including a commitment that the 9% VAT rate will be kept in place.  It also needs a commitment that the employment wage subsidy scheme will continue into next year, so that the survival of these businesses is assured.  The scheme should have a more targeted eligibility to ensure business that continue to be disproportionately impacted by Covid can be supported for the first quarter of the year, with further extensions if necessary.</p>  <p>  The Government's only tourism stimulus measure, the stay-and-spend tax rebate, was a flop and did little to stimulate the sector.  The feedback I received from constituents was that it did not go far enough, was unnecessarily complicated and required an input of 80% of the upfront costs, which people did not have.  As Deputy Cronin said, it would have been far more beneficial to introduce a tourism and hospitality voucher along the lines of the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal, which would have given &euro;200 to every adult and &euro;100 to every child in the State.</p>  <p>  In the brief time remaining, I will turn to the aviation sector.  We need an aviation recovery plan without delay and we must protect workers in the sector.  We have seen the recent attempt by the Dublin Airport Authority to outsource front-line maintenance work.  It must be resisted.  All the recommendations in the report of the aviation recovery task force, from July 2020, need to be implemented.  The most recent national aviation policy document was published six years ago.  That situation must be reviewed urgently.  We are an island nation and our aviation sector is vital.  It is time the Government gave it the help it deserves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700036#JJ00300"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Barry.  It is more than a year since I said in the D&aacute;il that what was happening in aviation was an example of what Naomi Klein calls "shock doctrine", that is, the taking advantage of a real crisis to drive through a pre-existing agenda.  In this case, the agenda is to outsource operations, drive down workers' wages and conditions and create a leaner workforce in the interests of profit.  That is what was happening in aviation back then and, in the past year, that process has deepened and extended itself.  The types of tactics that are being used by Aer Lingus, the DAA and Cork Airport amount to outrageous bullying, thuggery and terrorisation of their workforces.  Those words were all used by different groups of workers who spoke to me about what they are experiencing.  I pay tribute to the workers who have stood up to that bullying and voted overwhelmingly to reject bad deals and, in the case of the workers at the DAA, for industrial action.  Shame on the Government and the State for funnelling millions of euro to the companies engaged in horrendous attacks on workers' rights and the bullying of their workers, without any condition whatsoever and no attempt to use any pressure on them to stop them attacking their workers in this way.</p>  <p>  Aer Lingus, for example, attempted to drive through an undermining of terms and conditions, new work practices and new, lower pay scales for new entrants.  The workers bravely and correctly stood up and voted democratically, by an 82% majority, to say they do not agree with creating a two-tier workforce and an undermining of their terms and conditions.  What was the reaction of the company to that democratic vote?  It was to send every one of them an incredibly threatening letter telling them that instead of restoring them to the 80% of pay it had previously promised, they would stay on 60%.  Let the workers try to pay their mortgages and feed their children on that level of pay.  There were to be no pay increases until 2023, lay-offs from early 2022 and a series of other measures designed to intimidate those workers for exercising their democratic right to reject a very bad deal.  They should continue to reject it.  The State has poured &euro;150 million into Aer Lingus from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, as well as millions in wage subsidies.  There should be conditions attached to that funding such that the company may not attack workers' conditions in this way.  In reality, Aer Lingus should be brought back into public ownership, with democratic planning to protect workers, protect connectivity and enable a rapid and just transition to a zero-carbon economy, which will mean a change in the nature of the sector, including a reduction in the amount of aviation activity.  It is a change for which workers must not pay the price.  They should be guaranteed no loss of income or jobs.</p>  <p>  I have raised the situation at the DAA multiple times in the D&aacute;il.  The so-called new ways of working it has introduced are about outsourcing, changing rotas and undermining basic conditions and demarcation.  A gun was put to the head of many groups of workers, who were forced under pressure to accept the company's plan.  It has been a complete disaster.  Staff tell me that outsourcing is the reason there were massive queues in Dublin Airport a few weeks ago.  I have just been sent a video of the toilets in the airport, which are in a disgraceful condition.  This is a result, the workers very clearly say, of outsourcing.  It has been a disaster.  The maintenance workers rejected the proposals in a democratic vote, to which the response of the company was to outsource all their jobs.  That is what is happening.  Their jobs are being outsourced because they had the temerity to reject a very bad deal.  In response, the workers, correctly, voted for industrial action.  The latest development is a letter to the union stating that if it proceeds with industrial action, the company will be taking an injunction against it and threatening its assets.  The DAA, a semi-State company, needs to stop threatening workers and unions in this way.</p></speech>

The company saved &euro;188 million last year on employee costs, which is a 46% reduction on 2019.  Perhaps we should expect nothing less in a global pandemic.  However, this was the largest percentage cut in any airline in the International Airlines Group, IAG.  Interestingly, Aer Lingus represents approximately 6% of that group but, historically, has contributed more than 20% of its profits.  All of this goes to show that the demand for further wage cuts at Aer Lingus is not reasonable.  Not only is the company seeking to establish a new yellow-pack starting rate for ground staff, cabin crew and others of &euro;12.40 an hour, it is also pushing for a four-year wage freeze and cuts to both sick pay and shift allowances.</p> <p>The case is headed to the Workplace Relations Commission but I will take this opportunity to advise workers not to put all their eggs in that particular basket.  They should organise and make preparations now to defend their wages and conditions.  That is a cause that is 100% justified.</p></speech>

Its membership comprises companies that are predominantly family owned, with a combined fleet of more than 1,500 coaches and carrying more than 3,000 people directly.  Coach tourism operators are the backbone of the tourism industry.  Without them, we cannot get tourists to various sites or to rural towns and villages.</p>  <p>  In 2019, a record 11.2 million overseas visitors came to Ireland and coach tour operators made a significant contribution to the overall success of our tourism product.  Responsible for directly attracting 2 million international visitors every year, coach tour operators invested substantial sums of money in marketing Ireland's tourism product abroad.  The industry carries coach passengers to every corner of Ireland, giving employment not just to coach tour operators, but also to hotels, retail and hospitality outlets, visitor centres and other small enterprises.  In 2018, coach tourism helped to contribute &euro;400 million to the economy.</p>  <p>  CTTC members have done exceptionally well to survive and remain in business with their sector fully closed for the past 18 months.  The summer of 2021 was far from booming for the sector, with reduced capacity on buses, low numbers of international tourists and a general reluctance to travel on coaches due to Covid-19 fears.  As a result, many operators are now questioning both their viability and whether they will survive until the summer of 2022.  If they do not survive, the tourism industry will be in serious trouble because it will have no way of transporting tourists around the country.</p>  <p>  The Government last provided financial support to the sector as part of the July stimulus package in 2020, with an allocation of &euro;10 million that I helped to secure with the assistance of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  This was very much appreciated at the time.  It was a lifeline the industry desperately needed.  However, it took so long for the funding to be released to the industry by F&aacute;ilte Ireland - it was only allocated in March, eight months after it was signed off in the July stimulus package - that many operators had exhausted their resources trying to meet fixed costs and repayments on their fleets.</p>  <p>  The CTTC urgently needs financial funding and has two key asks in the context of the budget next week.  The Government must provide immediate funding to the sector by way of a supplementary budget allocation under the upcoming Finance Bill.  In light of the significant loss in international connectivity, which is estimated to be down by approximately 80%, combined with the dent to consumer confidence as a result of Covid, this funding is vital to keep the industry afloat.  Given the seasonal nature of the business and the long lead-in time for bookings, which are typically made a year in advance, the summer of 2021 was an extremely bad season, with 84% of businesses not recovering financially.  The industry remains severely challenged and there is a real and acute risk that fleet and talent will be lost for good if businesses are not supported and kept afloat.  Funding should be made available to cover losses in 2021.  That funding should replicate the &euro;10 million provided for coach tourism under the business continuity scheme.  The implementation of the scheme should mirror what was done in the context of the previous scheme.  This would be a significant help to the industry and assist in keeping many operators in business as we await a partial return to normality in the 2022 tourism season.</p>  <p>  Provision must be made for the resumption of the coach tourism business continuity scheme in 2022 on a contingency basis.  The CTTC recommends continuing funding for 2022 under the business continuity fund for coach tourism to reflect the real damage done to the sector.  The sector is the backbone of the tourism industry.  Without these coaches, we cannot get tourists, particularly international tourists, to particular sites and to rural areas.  The exclusion of the sector from the CRSS, its being eliminated straight away from the Covid-19 adaptation fund run by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the delay in delivering the &euro;10 million allocated to it under the July stimulus last year have meant that these businesses faced more financial pressures than most.</p></speech>

As my colleagues have pointed out, this is a very important sector for every part of the country.  In every town and village there are people involved or associated with the tourism, catering or transport sectors, as well as the aviation sector, particularly in certain areas.  We must first empathise with the sacrifices they made in the past 18 months because they were closed down repeatedly.  That reduced confidence in the industry and it reduced the confidence of those who were immersed in it in their ability to continue and to survive.  However, some of them did survive and continue to do so.  It is to be hoped that due tribute will be paid to their existence in the time ahead, and particularly in the immediate time ahead.</p>  <p>  We must recognise the scale of expertise that exists in the industry.  In the aviation sector, there is a variation of skills and good employment.  Many people decry the fact that not all companies in the sector pay top dollar, or at least that is the claim, but they provide great employment and offer great opportunities to people to get employment and better themselves.</p>  <p>  I refer to the skills that are available in the hotel and catering sectors.  In the main, there are two groups of people who make their living in these sectors.  First, there are the coach tour operators and those in the aviation sector but, as well as that, high levels of expertise are now required in the tourism sector, such as in the case of chefs and managers in the hotel industry.  The need for such skills will continue into the future.  Previously, people were sent abroad to learn the skills of the trade.  In the recent past, however, people came here to learn those skills.  We are at a crossroads, and we need to avail of every opportunity to fill the posts as quickly as possible so that the industry can survive.  That has to be done by encouraging people who have the skills required to come here and assist in the recovery of the industry.  If they need visas or anything else, that should be facilitated.</p>  <p>  We are facing into winter, not summer, so we must gear the industry towards how best to succeed at a time of year that is not always the most lucrative.  We have to gear it towards winter tourism and avail of every opportunity to encourage people to participate, visit other parts of the country and spend their money.</p>  <p>  The industry has been a great place for young people to get a start.  They can become involved in the hotel and restaurant sector and learn the trade from there.  Not everybody needs to have the same skill, but their skills are improved in that area.  Many schools have supplied the industry with waiters, waitresses and so on to meet the requirements at this time.  There is a marked difference in the custom enjoyed by the restaurant sector.  Not as many people are visiting restaurants as previously.  I strongly support the points made by colleagues on all sides of the House in respect of the fact that, more than ever, we must do whatever is needed now.  We must recognise what needs to be done and deal with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700037#KK00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the related sectors of tourism and aviation.  Both sectors are of critical importance to County Clare, the mid-west region and the entire western seaboard.  I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications at which we formally approved the appointment of Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as chairman of the board of the Shannon Group.  There is a groundswell of support for Mr. &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as he takes on this new role and there is cause for optimism that he will place Shannon on the pathway to recovery, with all stakeholders, including the Government, working together.  There is a strong case to be made for his post being upgraded to that of executive chairperson and I hope the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, as the Government representative in the Chamber at present, will give that strong and due consideration.</p>  <p>  Shannon Airport underpins 46,500 jobs in business and tourism right along the west coast.  It is a hub and gateway for tourism and business.  In the context of aviation, it is important that a recovery plan is produced and that a fund is made available by the Government to help re-establish key strategic routes such as to London Heathrow, New York and Boston.  These routes should continue to be underpinned by Government supports in the short to medium term.</p> <p>I am encouraged to see that Ryanair is now operating 18 different routes out of Shannon Airport.  While I warmly welcome the return of the Aer Lingus Heathrow route, it is only a temporary service.  Every effort must be made to reinstate this vital route on a permanent basis and to restore the three daily direct services to Heathrow that we had prior to Covid.  Early morning and late evening connectivity to the global Heathrow hub is critical for business and tourism.</p> <p> National aviation policy needs to be amended to reflect the importance of Shannon to the mid-west and western regions.  It is important, as we emerge from the pandemic, that we put in place a solid foundation to rebuild this critical sector.  I am asking that the Minister of State ensures that the findings and recommendations outlined in the Copenhagen Economics report, as commissioned by the Limerick Chamber of Commerce, are incorporated into a new national aviation policy.</p> <p> Like other Members, during the pandemic I have had discussions with people who work in the aviation, tourism and business sectors.  It is vital that the critical business supports continue to be made available to tourism and aviation-related businesses.  The EWSS has provided a lifeline to our network of quality hotels and guest houses and other tourism business.  I am requesting that these businesses, which have been so severely impacted by the pandemic, be given access to the EWSS up until at least June 2022.  Equally, the rates relief made available to businesses needs to be extended to the end of the first quarter of 2022, and the 9% VAT rate must be extended for the next number of years to give this vital sector certainty as it rebuilds and recovers.  </p> <p> My final point relates to the importance of the suite of Shannon heritage sites in County Clare.  The transfer of these sites to Clare County Council needs to be completed.  In doing that, the dedicated members of the workforce at these sites must be consulted and their rights must be respected.  I believe that both our aviation and tourism sectors will recover, but we must ensure that the recovery is fair and regionally balanced.</p></speech>

We are talking about the tourism and aviation sectors - two sectors that were hammered by the pandemic we have been through.  Some of that pain will continue to be felt into the future, so it will be necessary to keep everything under consistent and constant review.  Business and individual supports will be necessary.  I agree with points made previously  in respect of the fact that we should never miss an opportunity provided by the sort of chaos that we have been through.  We really need to look at the HR issues that we currently face and we must ensure that terms, conditions and workers' rights are protected, whether it is in Aer Lingus or in the context of the outsourcing issue relating to the DAA.  That is absolutely necessary.  We also need to look at what the sector is asking for as regards an aviation-specific EWSS.</p>  <p>  Connectivity is necessary.  Like Deputy Carey, I attended the meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications earlier.  In fairness to P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, he spoke about regional balance and the necessary steps he would take in relation to Shannon Airport.  He stated that he believes there is a possibility to work alongside the DAA and others with a view to producing something that works for everybody.  We cannot go on with the situation we have been in, whereby we go from panic stations to panic stations.  We need an overall strategy.  That goes without saying.</p>  <p>  Points were also raised earlier in respect of necessary supports that will be required by the likes of the private coach industry.  It has been hammered in the pandemic.  We must provide supports to the industry.  Even in the live music and events sector, certain skill sets and supports that need to be looked at.  Those in the sector would say that they are afraid of losing some of those skill sets.  We must ensure that these people are protected up to a point in time, which may be after 22 October, when that part the industry is able to move into a stronger position.</p>  <p>  Across the board, we must ensure that we provide the supports required to keep these industries going.  It is why we provided them in the first place.  We also need to ensure that we have a policy that works in terms of both tourism and aviation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700038#LL00300"><p>In the short time I have, I will focus on aviation, albeit in the context of tourism.  Cork is a great destination and I hope everyone will take the time to visit.</p>  <p>  The aviation sector has taken a ferocious hit during the pandemic, there is no doubt about it.  It is a resilient industry.  Indeed, I think we can all expect that many of the big airlines will return to very considerable profitability quite soon.  In the meantime, however, we need to ensure that our airports and workers are supported and protected.  They must be given the supports that they need to recover.  The Minister of State will have heard this before, and I am sure her Department and the Government are considering the need for additional capital expenditure, CAPEX, and operating expenditure, OPEX, funding streams, but - and I have been making this point for about a year now, or perhaps longer - it is vitally important that the funding to be provided for two,or, more likely, three years, because it will take that long for aviation to recover and to ensure that all the workers who would have had full-time hours in 2018 and 2019 can get back up to that and we have a commensurate level of employment.  We need that commitment for several years.</p>  <p>  It is not just about businesses.  For me, the key focus is the tens of thousands of employees in the industry.  Cork Airport employs 2,200 people directly and 10,000 indirectly, and many more benefit in different ways.  It is a crucial employer and link for Cork and the region.  I must admit that I was a bit frustrated by the fact that I and others spent months in the spring calling for the provision of supports to prevent Aer Lingus workers from being made redundant during the runway works at Cork Airport.  We did not see any urgent action taken by the Minister for Transport.  It was the campaigning of the union and workers that led to the issue being resolved.  I commend them on that.  It highlights is the need to continue the provision of the EWSS well into the summer, at a minimum, for sectors such as aviation, because it will take that amount of time for employees to get back to working full-time.  Cork Airport staff need that.  The airport needs certainty and funding for the next three years.  It also needs a sort of air traffic recovery stimulus package to encourage routes and connectivity.</p>  <p> Finally, I raise the fact that baggage handlers in our airports do not have a sectoral employment order to give them stability and security in pay.  Although such orders exist in other parts of the aviation industry, it does not exist for baggage handlers.  We need to consider it.</p></speech>

While staycations helped to bridge the gap to some extent, hospitality and retail in our well-known tourist locations have suffered two bleak summers.  With the majority of people choosing to holiday near our beautiful coastline, inland tourist attractions have been largely bereft of visitors.  Well-known attractions like the Rock of Cashel, the Swiss Cottage in Cahir, Nenagh Castle, Damer House in Roscrea and Holy Cross Abbey, which were popular stops on bus tours for overseas visitors, saw only a trickle of tourists throughout the pandemic.  As a result, businesses in towns and villages right across County Tipperary and the country lost much needed revenue.  As we know, unfortunately, many could not sustain such losses.</p>  <p>  While the losses incurred can never be recouped, despite the assistance that Government aid provided, the focus must now switch to the future.  Despite their best efforts, people in smaller inland tourist areas will not be able to promote their tourism gems in a way that will reach out and grab attention.  I am asking Government to increase investment in promoting Ireland as a tourist destination for 2022 and beyond.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland do a wonderful job in promoting the Emerald Isle across the globe.  With additional investment, this promotion could attract even more visitors, which will help in both our economic recovery and further cement our reputation as a top holiday destination.</p>  <p>  While aviation has been hit hard globally since the beginning of 2020, recovery is under way.  It is commonly acknowledged that it will take up to three years to return to its pre-pandemic levels.  Personally, I feel that it will take considerably less time than is being speculated.  Travel by air is a fundamental necessity of life for both personal and business reasons.  Our world revolves around our ability to get from place to place.</p>  <p>  The importance of Shannon Airport to the mid-west region cannot be overstated.  Air connectivity is crucial for regional economic development and sustainability.  I welcome the appointment of P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh as chairman of the Shannon Group.  He has the knowledge, experience and capability to provide excellent leadership at a time of unprecedented challenge for Shannon Airport and the economy of the mid-west region.  I support the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications, of which I am a member, that his position be given the status of executive chairman.</p>  <p>  Expert studies and analysis have proven that Shannon Airport has a hugely positive impact on the local economy.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>More crucially, they have shown that huge untapped potential exists which would not only assist with the development of the mid-west region but also the country as a whole.  Shannon Airport must be aided in its recovery.  While the closure of Cork Airport for necessary repair and upgrade will be beneficial to Shannon Airport for a short period of ten to 12 weeks, it requires a long-term plan to hold its place as a port of choice.  Negotiations must take place with Aer Lingus to ensure it maintains its base in Shannon when works at Cork Airport are completed.  This is a very important and vital measure.  It would be a major vote of confidence for the future of Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

As an island nation, we rely heavily on our aviation sector to drive tourism so the two go hand in hand in many ways.  Of all counties, Wexford has one of the highest, if not the highest, percentages of people employed in the tourism sector.  Tourism is vital to the county's economic sustainability.  Most of County Wexford is within two hours of Dublin Airport.  If I have not said it before, we also have Ireland's most strategic port situated in Rosslare.</p>  <p>  The nickname "the sunny south-east" refers to the fact that County Wexford typically has the highest levels of sunshine of any county in the country.  We also have fabulous beaches in Baginbun, Duncannon, Rosslare Strand, Morriscastle, Ballymoney, Curracloe, Courtown, Ballinasker, Carne, St. Helen's and at many more locations.</p></speech>

Kennedy family homestead and various other sites of interest such as Hook Head, Enniscorthy Castle, Johnstown Castle and Fethard Castle, which the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will visit tomorrow.  We also have the National Opera House and many more attractions that are unrecognised and in need of urgent attention, such as Duncannon Port and our marine tourism sector.  It is easy to see why County Wexford is a prime destination for tourists.</p>  <p>  With all of this in mind, I want to draw attention to passenger traffic at Rosslare Europort.  Many of Ireland's and Wexford's tourists enter the country through Rosslare.  I hope the Government is listening and will prepare accordingly.  Prior to Brexit, the Government was almost lulled into a false sense of security by relying on an Irish Maritime Development Office report that argued sufficient capacity was available on existing continental ferry routes to absorb demand after Brexit.  In the meantime, freight numbers have increased by almost 500% while the number of ferry sailings from Rosslare, with the introduction of some new routes to the European mainland, is 28 sailings six days a week in and out of the country, with incoming sailings on Sunday.  This is fantastic news.  I worked very hard to make some of this happen but it has to be said that any progress that was made at Rosslare Europort after Brexit is down to bodies such as the Irish Road Haulage Association, in consultation with private shipping operators, which got no encouragement from the Government or Departments.</p>  <p>  Because of short-term charters of ships and the lack of availability of ships to charter, capacity is now dropping.  We are not out of the woods by any means.  Since Brexit and Covid, we have not had a proper tourist season.  This means that more of a ship's commercial capacity will be set aside for tourists once the demand increases through the summer season and the tourists return.  As we return to normal and summer holidays become the norm again, and we hope we will see a return to pre-pandemic levels of passenger demand on our ferry routes, it is vital that we have this for the recovery.  We must ensure we have capacity to bring people onto this island.  The warning is simple.  As passenger traffic numbers return to normal, we will have capacity issues at our most strategic port if action is not taken.  At present, ferry operators are at full capacity with freight alone.  Therefore, a return to pre-pandemic passenger traffic will see an issue with either passengers or freight been turned away.  We do not want a situation where anyone has to be turned away.</p>  <p>  I have long called for real State investment in Rosslare Europort in order to develop the facilities to allow the port to reach its full potential as a freight and passenger hub.  We have heard the same &euro;30 million being announced for the port again and again.  I understand that some of this money will be used to build another customs post, purely to comply with EU directives, rather than the Government asking for a derogation in respect of it and using the existing infrastructure on which we spent &euro;11 million to facilitate customs.  The portion of the money for building the new structure could be used to deepen the port and add an extra pier so we would have greater capacity to attract ships that need deeper waters and which carry more passengers and freight.</p>  <p>  Money is easy to spend but spending it in the most sensible, beneficial and strategic way is what I want to see for Rosslare.  I could head into a shoe shop and buy a pair of shoes for &euro;100 but if they are the wrong size then my &euro;100 is a waste and not an investment.  I do not want to see waste at Rosslare.  I want to see sensible investment and I would like to see it quickly.  Ensuring our port is capable of catering for freight and passenger demand in a normal summer season is critical to the recovery of the tourism sector.  We can only take advantage of the growth in wind energy if the ports infrastructure is significantly upgraded, the waters deepened and an extra pier is added on quay side.  It is imperative that we keep the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector.  Neither tourists nor the sector itself have had an opportunity to take advantage of it.</p></speech>

I did not want to forget the Deputy's comments and I wanted to give a rundown through my constituency.  In the context of this debate, however, the most important part of my constituency is Dublin Airport.  The aviation sector supports more than 150,000 jobs and provides billions of euros to our economy.  I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for being present, particularly as this is a very important and timely debate.</p>  <p>  Many of my colleagues on these benches and those opposite have gone into detail on the supports that are there and the supports that should perhaps be extended and I agree with them.  The knock-on effect of a damaged aviation sector will have a profound effect on the tourism sector, which supports several hundred thousand other jobs in our country.  The ESRI and other bodies stated very recently that a strong economic bounce back is expected but we must ensure it is translated into the aviation and tourism sectors.</p>  <p>  I welcome the recent news of a tourism strategy, which, I believe, the Minister launched.  We should hyperfocus in particular on the transatlantic routes and the US market which is so crucial to Aer Lingus in particular.  A significant number of cabin crew in particular are on 60% of their wages at present.  This translates to 40% when we remove their duty roster payments.  As the Minister and Minister of State will understand, it is exceedingly difficult to operate on 40% of wages, particularly given the number of households that employ pilots, co-pilots, ground crew, cabin crew and everything else.  This is very common in Swords and other communities in the Dublin Fingal local authority area.</p>  <p>  We have wonderful tourist attractions in my constituency.  I will not go through the list of them.  I would say that the Office of Public Works did a very good service to the State when it made its sites free when travel was permitted.  This is something we should consider rolling out until such time as it can be determined that the sector has recovered.</p>  <p>  Hospitality provides us with thousands of jobs throughout the country, particularly for young people who get their first job in the sector.  I know there are a number of small businesses that are really struggling to get people to take up employment.  This is something we need to assess.  Many people have said it is because of the pandemic unemployment payment.  I am not sure I agree given that only approximately 100,000 people remain on it.  There are things we need to re-evaluate in terms of how we support small businesses, particularly in the tourism sector.</p>  <p>  I want to get a little parochial.  I was very pleased to see the national development plan include a proposal for funding towards the Broadmeadow project, which is part of the programme that will eventually see pedestrianised walkways and cycle tracks running from Balbriggan to Howth and that will link with the Sutton to Sandycove project in Dublin city.</p>  <p>This is a vital piece of tourism infrastructure in the constituency and will be a linchpin, along the lines of what the Wild Atlantic Way did to certain places on the west coast.  This particular route is very significant for north Dublin and I have been a wholehearted supporter of it for many years.</p> <p> I will make a final remark on the recovery of the sector, in particular aviation, and the fact that so many people are on reduced incomes.  We need to continue to support them into next year and for as long as we possibly can.  The sector will rebound; we just have to continue supporting it.</p></speech>

It is great to see tourists returning to our shores again and those employed in aviation being able to return to work at long last.</p><p>Tourists come to our shores to visit our stunning and scenic beauty spots, our mountains and coastlines, and to experience our bustling cities.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Department of Tourism, Culture<b>,</b>Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media have done a tremendous job in promoting Ireland as an attractive tourist destination.</p><p>Tourists also come here to sample our culture, taste our famous Irish dishes and sip on our iconic Irish drinks.  Our meat, dairy and seafood are some of the best in the world.  The iconic pint of stout and Ireland&rsquo;s status as home of whiskey are tourist attractions in and of themselves.  That is why before the pandemic, Ireland was increasingly seen not only as a great tourist destination but also a leading food tourism destination.</p><p>Building on Ireland&rsquo;s strong food and drink production we have Michelin star chefs, world-class restaurants and world-famous Irish pubs.  We have food markets, food trails, cookery schools, breweries and distilleries.  It is a thriving industry.  Food and drink focused tourists, particularly those looking for premium experiences, bring a very welcome contribution to the economy.  As we emerge from the pandemic and tourists and aviation return to our shores, we must do all we can, as a Government, to encourage and nurture food and drink tourism, hand in hand with our tourism strategies, like the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands, as well as the promotion of our thriving cities.</p><p>In 2018, F&aacute;ilte Ireland published a food and drink tourism strategy.  The following year, it ran the Taste the Island initiative.  This strategy should be at the heart of post-pandemic tourism recovery when it comes to food and drink focused tourism.  Instead, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has disbanded its food and drink team.  I ask that the Minister seek a reversal of this decision and ensure food and drink tourism is given the support it needs to attract tourists, sustain and create jobs and benefit communities across the State.</p><p>In focusing on food tourism, I also mention the important role our hospitality sector and local businesses play in welcoming tourists to every part of Ireland.  The &euro;7 million streetscape enhancement initiative, part of the Our Rural Future programme, was a great success in supporting rural towns and villages to be more attractive and welcoming places for locals and tourists alike.  Many of my constituents in more rural areas of Dublin Mid-West, places like Saggart, Brittas, Rathcoole and Newcastle, were disappointed not be considered for this funding.  Other Dublin areas such as Rush, Lusk, Donabate and Skerries were included.  This left community groups in my area, such as Rathcoole Tidy Towns, feeling excluded.  Making rural towns and villages welcoming and inviting to tourists is of great importance, as we all know.</p><p>I compliment the Minister on all she is doing to reboot our international tourism strategies.  I ask her to consider the two changes I have highlighted, in tandem with our flagship tourism programmes.</p></speech>

Having spent a week in Fethard-on-Sea a few years back, I concur that it is definitely an excellent holiday destination.  I also agree that we should not be wasting money on tourism but should be spending it carefully and in the right way.  There are many opportunities to pick the low-hanging fruit in order to significantly increase our tourism offering and the value of the current offering.</p>  <p>  I want to talk to the Minister about Kilmainham Mill, a piece of our much undervalued industrial heritage located in Dublin city.  The mill is located on the Camac River alongside the planned Camac River greenway.  It is next to Kilmainham Gaol, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, and the War Memorial Gardens.  Providing support for the Kilmainham Mill restoration project and creating an industrial craft heritage site on the site would multiply the effect of all of the tourist offerings in this area.  Praise has to go to the Save Kilmainham Mill campaign, which ensured the mill was bought by Dublin City Council instead of falling into dereliction and falling apart.</p>  <p>  Efforts have been made to save Kilmainham Mill and keep it going to ensure there is an opportunity for its development as a tourism site.  In recent months, the campaign has not been successful in securing funding and support.  As I said, this project has strong potential to establish links with other tourist offerings and to support our industrial and craft heritage, which does not get the level of support it deserves.  To be unapologetically parochial, I ask the Minister to visit the mill to see the potential it offers and the hard work of the Save Kilmainham Mill campaign.  If she does come, I ask her to please bring her cheque book with her.</p>  <p>  We need to embrace our industrial heritage, particularly in Dublin.  We are not providing for it.  We can talk about our built heritage, including industrial built heritage, being torn down and undervalued and about not placing it on the record of protected structures but that is a debate for another time.</p>  <p>  Another project also desperately in need of support is a proper Dublin docklands museum.  We have seen big changes to Dublin Port, with containerisation and automation.  All of these developments have changed the nature of the work at the port.  There is a group of Dublin dockers who celebrate the rich heritage the stevedores of Dublin Port have provided over the years.  Any support for them would not only be very welcome but would again tap into an industrial heritage that is undervalued and under-supported.</p></speech>

I hope her favourite song is "See the Lights" by Simple Minds or "Come Fly with Me" by Billy May.</p>  <p>  The impact of Covid-19 on Ireland&rsquo;s tourism industry and throughout the world has been catastrophic.  We are dependent on international visitors.  The aviation industry is key to this because hospitality is dependent on connectivity.  Hospitality is our biggest regional employer and the industry showed unbelievable resilience during the pandemic.  It embraced what it could do as opposed to what it could not do.  Businesses set up takeaway services in outdoor areas and they have my admiration for what they achieved.  I was delighted to see that Fitzgerald&rsquo;s Woodlands House Hotel &amp;amp; Spa in Limerick received an international award for its outdoor dining and vision for the region.  I was proud to see that.</p>  <p>  VAT needs to remain at 9% and there must be guaranteed certainty around the current rate for the hospitality sector.  I have asked several times for the appointment of a dedicated Minister for tourism who would track, liaise and support this very valuable industry, through motivation and proven targets.  The stimulus to kick-start the hospitality industry needs to come from the Minister.  The employment wage subsidy scheme for tourism needs to be continued at least into next summer because we can see what the hotel sector and other industries have suffered through the pandemic.  Yes, they have had a good year since the summer but given the losses they incurred and the need to reboot their businesses, it is very important that the scheme remains in place.</p> <p> I welcome the recent appointment of the chairperson of Shannon Group, Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh.  I wish him well in the challenges ahead, many of which existed prior to this pandemic.  I met P&aacute;draig last night and we had a half-hour discussion here in Leinster House.  It was my first time meeting him.  One of the first questions I asked him related to his background, which is absolutely exceptional.  We discussed different areas of his background but what stood out to me were his education, the way he conducts himself and the vision he portrayed to me last night, which was unbelievable.  Moreover, he was once self-employed, something that is lacking at the Cabinet table, where we need that in the mix.</p> <p> I also met Ms Mary Considine, the CEO of Shannon Group, at Limerick Chamber to talk about the common sense and the vision we have for Limerick, Shannon and the surrounding areas in order that the airport can contribute to the region.  A total of 143,000 people work in the aviation industry, while 270,000 people are employed in tourism, 50,000 of them in the mid-west.  Shannon Airport needs an airline stimulus package to encourage and rebuild air traffic.  It also needs to be included in the regional airport programme of state aid for airports handling under 3 million passengers a year.</p> <p> I made this point 12 months ago and I do so every time we talk about aviation.  The only way aviation can prosper in this country is through the dispersion of traffic.  Other Deputies talked about what has happened in regard to Dublin Airport, but a projected 15 million passengers will pass through that airport's gates this year.  Shannon Airport will have somewhere in the region of 350,000, or 19% of its traffic pre-2019.  Likewise, Cork Airport will have in the region of 35% of its pre-2019 traffic, or about 850,000 passengers.  I welcome the expansion of any airport, but any airport that is expanded, such as Dublin Airport, has to be subject to a dispersion of traffic.  If it wants to increase its number of passengers by 3 million, it should have to give 10% to the regional airports.  That would mean the likes of Shannon Airport could return to its pre-Covid figure of 1.8 million and we could build it up to 3 million and more, which it has the capacity to do.  The same is true of the likes of Cork Airport.</p> <p> I live in a parish called Rahanagh, five minutes off the main road.  It is located 10 miles from the Cork border but it would take me one hour and 45 minutes to travel to Cork Airport.  If I had to travel to Shannon Airport, it would take me between 38 and 40 minutes, depending on whether I was caught in traffic coming onto the N20 at Anhid Cross.  I can travel to Dublin Airport, however, in two hours and ten minutes.  That means the proper road infrastructure is there.  Farmers and industry have been held to ransom for 19 years and they cannot build for their future because there is a proposal to build a road, the N20-M20, on their land.  One farmer I talked to said the road is planned right next to his farmhouse and he does not know where he can build for his children's future.  We need funding and connectivity for future-proofing, not only for Shannon Airport and Cork Airport but also for Dublin Airport.  We need connectivity but also balance in order that we will all get a piece of the pie.  In that way, the likes of Shannon Airport will not need to be subsidised.  There will be more than 3 million passengers and the airport will be well able to subsidise itself.</p></speech>

Somewhere between 15% and 18% of all enterprises in the north west are in the tourism and hospitality sector.  In the context of a balance of development between the regions, support for this sector is vital.  Last week, I spoke to B&amp;B Ireland, which is based in Ballyshannon.  It emphasised the need to maintain the 9% VAT rate until 2023 at least, although I think it should be permanent.  That rate is important everywhere but it is crucial in Border areas.  I fully support the organisation's call for the employment wage subsidy scheme to continue to June 2022 in a targeted way.  B&amp;B Ireland is appreciative of Government supports but emphasised it could take until 2024 before the sector is back on its feet.</p>  <p>  The less said regarding the stay-and-spend scheme, the better.  There was nothing in the July stimulus package.  For the next six months, we will rely almost entirely on our national market, so we urgently need a substantial stimulus package for the hospitality sector in the forthcoming budget.  This will help keep the industry afloat in the counties I represent, namely, Leitrim, Sligo, Roscommon and Donegal.  It will help sustain initiatives such as the Sligo Food Trail and the Shed Distillery in Drumshanbo, which I will visit tomorrow.</p>  <p>  Alignment of VAT rates with those in Northern Ireland is crucial for the coach industry.  There are 1,800 small businesses here and they will not be back on their feet until 2023 at the earliest.  Again, therefore, targeted supports are essential for the sector.  If those supports are withdrawn before the sector gets off its knees, many businesses will fail.</p>  <p>  Aviation, just like the coach industry, is still on its knees.  Only sustained Government support can offer the lifeline it so badly needs.  Inward tourism will collapse without it; we cannot let that happen.</p></speech>

What is the point of it?  I appreciate that the Ceann Comhairle does not decide how the Government fills its time but what is the point?  Nothing new has been announced.  We have learned little or nothing and then, towards the end of the term, a load of legislation will be rammed through and it will be because we did not have D&aacute;il time to debate it.  There will be no amendments but guillotines and the whole shebang, with contempt for democracy and Parliament and so on.</p>  <p>  I have learned two things today, in fairness.  One relates to Kilmainham Mills, from Deputy Costello, which I had never heard of before.  There is a nice mill in Bow River, just down the road from where I live.  If the Minister is ever travelling from Scariff to Mountshannon, she should take the Middleline road and she will see a nice mill.</p>  <p>  The other thing I learned was that 90% of passengers coming to Ireland have been vaccinated.  Of course they have been, given that there is a considerable disincentive to anyone else coming to Ireland.  The proportion of the population of Europe that has been vaccinated is not 90% - nowhere near it.  We have the highest vaccination rate in Europe, which is great, but the obvious corollary is that every other country in Europe has a lower vaccination rate.  If we want their populations to come, therefore, we will have to accommodate them.  We are not accommodating them, however, and we are almost unique in requiring a PCR test.   It is difficult to get a PCR test in most countries because they are used only to confirm a clinical diagnosis, so people have to present among sick people who have Covid to get a PCR test if they want to come to Ireland or even to return to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Of course, it is not about keeping Ireland safe; it is about being a disincentive to Irish people to travel abroad, and the collateral damage is the tourists who want to come here.  Money does not matter any more in this brave new future we have created.  We can live off borrowed money indefinitely, if I have got that right.  Where are the antigen tests?  We heard an awful lot about a project involving the introduction of antigen tests.  Where is it?  As recently as about two hours ago, Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, the new chairman of Shannon Group, was appearing before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and he talked about how essential it will be to get in line with the rest of Europe if we want to rejuvenate and revitalise the tourism sector and those who depend on it.  I want clarity on that.  It is not about keeping Ireland safe but rather about being a disincentive, just as our indoor hospitality policy was not about making the environment safer but rather was intended to coerce people.  If it was about keeping people safe, there would have been antigen tests and PCR tests and we would have accepted the EU digital pass in its entirety rather than just the part we could use to coerce people.  The same is true of the introduction of mandatory quarantine.  What a farce.  There was a statement two weeks ago suggesting that on its "successful" conclusion, a total of 593 cases had been detected.</p> <p>While mandatory quarantine was in being and the 593 cases were being detected, and we will find out in the fullness of time how many euro it cost, there were 151,350 cases detected in Ireland, so it was a drop in the ocean or 0.39% of the total to be precise.</p> <p> Are we going to have an aviation policy in Ireland at any point soon?  Until such time as we have one, it does not really matter whether Shannon Airport is part of the Dublin Airport Authority group.  There are State interests competing with each other.  There are two runways in Shannon yet we have almost completed building another runway in Dublin.  I do not know how that makes sense from an environmental perspective.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, might explain that.  There is all this concrete, tarmacadam and so forth going into creating a runway when we already have two runways.  We are going to have them competing with each other further.  We are bussing people from the mid-west to Dublin to fly out of Ireland and everybody is flying into Dublin to be bussed down to the Cliffs of Moher.  How does that make any environmental sense?</p> <p> I return to my question: What is this about?  If it is about answering questions, I would welcome answers to those particular questions.  If it is just about the Government filling time because it has nothing else to do, I suggest it concentrate on the legislation that it is going to ram through at the end of this D&aacute;il term.</p></speech>

We are on track to remove most remaining restrictions from 22 October and this will provide a further boost to the tourism sector.  In the meantime, our primary focus is to continue with our careful and gradual approach to easing remaining restrictions and facilitating full reopening from 22 October, while supporting the maximum reach of the vaccine programme and allowing time to achieve the full benefits for all those currently being vaccinated.  The Government will meet in advance of 22 October to decide on the next phase of easing the restrictions and on what, if any, further guidance might be required beyond that date.  Overall, I am confident that our trajectory in managing Covid is very positive.  This along with the very successful vaccination programme mean that we should be viewed as a safe destination for holidaymakers.  I will ask our agencies to convey this message.</p>  <p>  With regard to supporting direct access to regional airports, I am providing funding to Tourism Ireland for the regional co-operative market access scheme.  The purpose of this scheme is to promote direct air and sea access routes into Ireland's tourism experience brand regions, with matching funding from airlines, sea carriers, airports, ports and regional tourism stakeholders, including local authorities.  In this regard, I am happy to report that, for 2021, I have increased the funding available for the scheme to &euro;3 million from &euro;2.5 million, the amount available last year before the pandemic struck.  To help to stimulate inbound tourism directly into the regions, Tourism Ireland is currently engaged with a number of air carriers to support the promotion of routes into our regional airports.  Aside from this, Tourism Ireland also engages in co-operative marketing with Dublin Airport to support inbound routes with strong tourism potential.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to business tourism and related events, F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently briefed the industry on its plans to support the sector and rebuild a strong pipeline of events.  Thanks to the collaborative efforts of the industry and the tourism agencies, I understand that over 280 important events lined up before the pandemic, but subsequently postponed, have now been rescheduled.  That is worth approximately &euro;200 million to the economy.  Another exciting event that has been rescheduled is the highly anticipated Aer Lingus College Football Classic, which was originally due to kick off in Dublin in 2020.  It will now take place in 2022 with the first game between Northwestern University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  In its first year, this event will attract in excess of 25,000 visitors, most from the US, and many are expected to stay for a week or longer.  It is expected to generate some &euro;63 million alone for the Irish economy next year.  As ever, these types of events, including the Ryder Cup in 2027 in Adare, County Limerick, are also a fantastic opportunity to showcase our beautiful country and the many attractions it offers as a holiday destination.</p>  <p>  As regards specific queries raised by Members, my officials have been taking note of them and we will follow up in writing with the Members.</p>  <p>  Before handing over to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, I will refer briefly to sustainable tourism.  While our focus is correctly on the survival of the tourism sector, we must also begin planning for a sustainable recovery.  The global health crisis has left the tourism sector in a state of shock, but it has also provided an opportunity to address sustainable tourism development in a more meaningful way during the recovery and rebuilding phase following the crisis.  A sustainable tourism working group established under the Tourism Action Plan 2019-2021 published a report setting out the ambition for sustainable tourism in Ireland as well as a number of guiding principles for sustainable tourism development.  This group has also drawn up an interim action plan, which will be published shortly, that aims to promote sustainable tourism practices up to 2023.</p>  <p>  In line with the programme for Government commitments, as I have outlined, officials in my Department have initiated the development of a new national tourism policy which mainstreams sustainability.  The development of this new policy will be informed by, and build upon, the work undertaken by the sustainable tourism working group and will be consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments.  It is clear that the traditional model of tourism is changing and the development of the new national tourism policy gives us an opportunity to set out what type of tourism sector we want up to 2030 and beyond.  Tourism has proven itself to be resilient previously and I am confident that, with the support of the Government, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again in a manner that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.</p>  <p>  Tuigim go maith na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in ollmh&oacute;ra at&aacute; roimh an turas&oacute;ireacht agus leanfaidh m&eacute; ag obair le mo chomhghleacaithe sa Rialtas chun a chinnti&uacute; go dtabharfar gach taca&iacute;ocht is f&eacute;idir don earn&aacute;il chun &eacute; a chur ar a cumas teacht sl&aacute;n &oacute;n bpaind&eacute;im agus t&oacute;g&aacute;il ar bhealach n&iacute;os seasmha&iacute;, n&iacute;os digit&iacute;, n&iacute;os glaise agus n&iacute;os inbhuanaithe.  I am fully aware of the massive challenges facing tourism and I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Government to ensure the sector is given every possible support to enable it to emerge intact from the pandemic and to build back in a more resilient, digitalised, green and sustainable way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700042#PP00300"><p>I join the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, in thanking all Deputies for their contributions to this debate.</p><p>The aviation and tourism sectors are among those most impacted by the Covid crisis.  Civil aviation is emerging from by far the most sustained and challenging crisis it has ever faced, with many analysts predicting that it will take several years to return to 2019 levels of activity.  However, the aviation and tourism sectors have benefited from extensive and unprecedented Government supports, as I outlined earlier.  This is because the Government recognises that they play a key role in our society and economy.  Aviation provides jobs, supports business travel and tourism, connects Ireland to new markets for exports and supports foreign direct investment by multinational companies locating in Ireland.</p><p>From early in the crisis, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and I engaged extensively with all aviation stakeholders, including through the aviation recovery task force, the National Civil Aviation Development Forum and the aviation subgroup of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, which I chair.  In the most difficult times, we worked together with stakeholders to ensure the resilience of the airlines and airports to survive the crisis.  Later, along with international partners, we formulated a plan to enable the safe return of international travel.  That said, it is recognised that restoration of connectivity cannot happen overnight.  However, while full recovery will take time, I am confident that we are on the right path.  I am also hopeful that the spirit of collaboration and co-operation with the aviation sector which has served us through the Covid crisis will again allow us to meet new challenges together in the coming years.  </p><p>We are already pursuing regulatory reform through the Air Navigation and Transport Bill that will better position the sector for the recovery to come.  At international level, aviation must respond to the challenge posed by climate change, in particular, the EU's commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 55% by 2030.  This will require investment in new technologies and fuels that have the potential to eliminate the CO<sub>2</sub>impact of aviation in the longer term.  Until then, the sector must play its part in reducing its carbon impact in other ways.  Before the Covid-19 crisis, the Department had commenced scoping work on a new national aviation policy.  As will be appreciated, during 2020 it was necessary to shift policy focus to ensuring our airports and the sector could weather the sustained crisis that Covid-19 presented and it was necessary to pause this work.  It is the Department's intention to recommence work on a revised national aviation policy in the coming months.  A key part of the policy development will be a comprehensive public consultation process as well as close engagement with the aviation industry through the structures of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum.</p><p>The Government recognises the value of a strong aviation industry, as is clearly set out in the programme for Government.  It also acknowledges our commitment to support EU and international action to reduce aviation emissions.  We will continue to support the industry to build on the recovery in the aviation sector which we have seen to date.</p> <p>As evidenced this week, with the launch of the National Development Plan 2021-2030, across that period we will see &euro;2.4 billion invested in our State and regional airports ensuring the necessary infrastructure is in place to safeguard and enhance our international connectivity and ensure capacity for logistics, both of which are crucial to the economy.  The Government will continue to support eligible regional airports under the regional airports programme to support connectivity and ensure safety, security and climate-related efficiency and resilience at these airports.  All airports plan to invest in sustainability projects and moving towards carbon neutrality which is very welcome as we look to the future.</p> <p> My Government colleagues and I will continue to monitor developments in our tourism and aviation sectors with a view to further progressing their recovery.  It is our shared goal to see these sectors regain their key positions supporting jobs, growth and innovation in a vibrant and dynamic economy.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.</p>  <p>  As thousands of people from all over the country descend on our capital to highlight a humanitarian matter of untold proportion, I wish the march well tomorrow and everybody a safe journey to Dublin and back home.  This evening I will speak about William and Trish, who started out in secondary school together, went to university together, got married and brought up four great children, who are now young adults.  William and Trish's family was forced to leave their home in 2014, seven years ago, because of mica.  They moved into rental accommodation, which, by the way, has mica.  As they had to pay rent, they defaulted on their mortgage.  Both husband and wife went through personal bankruptcy, recorded in the High Court, solely because of mica.  The family has endured incredible levels of stress over these seven years but these people continued to keep their family on the right track through education, sport and the daily challenges in raising a family these days.  Trish had to take early retirement from teaching because of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of mica.</p>  <p>  The rub for the family is that the bank that owned the mortgage sold it to another institution after the bankruptcy case.  It sold, in effect, what was a worthless property.  I want to send a public message to this institution tonight publicly, as I have tried to do it diplomatically and behind the scenes.  I failed in that.  I want somebody from within that institution to sit down with the family and try to figure out a way for the family to get peace and restart their lives.  I want the institution to find a way for the family to recover from the trauma, fear, loss and distress felt over these past seven years, all caused by mica and through no fault of their own.</p>  <p>  We should remember that the people who will march tomorrow will send a very loud message not just about what might happen in the days, weeks and years ahead if there is not a significant intervention by the Government but also it will concern what has happened with William, Trish and others like them.  It is about the stress they have endured, the pressure they have been under and the cliff edge they have approached.  Now is the time for us to hear the plight and voice of so many people who find themselves in an impossible position.  Tonight my message is for this particular financial institution but it is also for the Government, insurance companies and all the stakeholders that can play a role in sorting out this impossible position in which people find themselves.</p>  <p>  We must show them the way and indicate there is hope and light at the end of this terrible tunnel.  I hope to hear from the Minister of State this evening that there will be an enormous effort and emphasis over the next few days and weeks to try to bring all this to a conclusion.  I emphasise again my message to the banking institution involved with this case, along with other banking institutions.  I ask them to show some humanity and let us see that they can work shoulder to shoulder with people who find themselves in this very dark place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="15:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700044#UU00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter.  The story he has told is replicating itself with thousands of families across the country.  I hope I can provide, by way of background, where we are now and assure the Deputy that the Government is working tirelessly to try to resolve this matter on behalf of families.</p><p>The Department is not familiar with the specific details of the case but there are a number of broader points to be made.  It may be useful for the Deputy to forward the exact details of the case involved to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who would be eager to assist in any way he can.</p><p>The first trip taken by the Minister when he took office was to Donegal for the launch of the current scheme.  He saw first-hand the impact of mica and how important it was to give homeowners who have bought or built in good faith real hope and a path forward.  They have done nothing wrong but simply worked hard to buy their own home only to see it turn into a nightmare.  They deserve our full support.  The scheme was designed by the previous Government and signed off in January 2020.  It is all too clear now that the scheme is not working as intended and needs to be overhauled to help those homeowners.</p><p>In response to concerns expressed by homeowners and a unanimous D&aacute;il motion on the matter, culminating in the June protest march, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, established a time-bound working group to consider the concerns being raised.  The first meeting of the group was held onWednesday, 30 June 2021, with the terms of reference agreed.  In total, eight meetings took place over the life of the group and numerous breakout sessions were also facilitated.</p><p>At the request of the homeowner representatives, it was agreed to extend the timeframe of the working group from the end of July to the end of September.  Throughout August, the Department facilitated the homeowners' intensive engagement with the Housing Agency to flesh out the matter in greater detail.  The last meeting of the working group took place on Wednesday, 29 September, with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.  He commended the effort of volunteer homeowners and the leadership role they have taken for their communities to help reach agreement on these matters.</p><p>The family representatives were disappointed with the output of the group but it fleshed out the matters involved and it will help ensure a fully informed Cabinet decision on any changes.  Their views have been heard loud and clear.  A final output report arising from the engagement of the working group has been commissioned and published on the Department's website, which includes Engineers Ireland correspondence, the homeowners' final position paper and the Department's observations.</p> <p>Following the conclusion of the working group report, and building on a cross-party D&aacute;il motion of June 2021, the Minister wrote to each Opposition spokesperson on housing to seek their views and input into potential changes to the scheme.  The Minister has previously sought their views on major documents, such as Housing for All, and has accepted Opposition amendments on legislation, such as the Land Development Agency and Affordable Housing Acts.  It should be noted that the main Opposition party did not once mention defective concrete blocks as part of its submission to Housing for All, so the letter to them on Monday was an opportunity, once again, for them to submit their views.  Any responses will be considered as part of designing an improved scheme.<br/><br/>The Minister will now, along with the Taoiseach, T&aring;naiste and the Ministers for the environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan, Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, with input from the Attorney General, consider proposals that can then be presented to Cabinet.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, intends to bring a memorandum to Cabinet in the coming weeks.  <br/><br/>There are three key principles that will inform any changes to the scheme, that is, that they are timely, reasonable and consistent.  They should be timely in the sense that since there are ongoing risks associated with the most damaged homes, a short-term solution to address this important work will be required to implement any changes and the work must be done in the most efficient and effective way.  There must be reasonable, evidence-based solutions.  These solutions must be justified from an engineering perspective and the costs for undertaking remediation works should be quantified.  There should be a safety net for homeowners undertaking remediation should they require further work to be done on their home.  The key test for remediation is that the home can be sold in future and any changes must achieve this.  The changes must be consistent in that each homeowner should receive the same support for the same solution, there should be consistency within each county, and between counties, and engineers need to be clear on the criteria for assessing options and clear on the regulations that apply.  I again thank the Ceann Comhairle for the additional time.</p></speech>

I appreciate his statement.  I know he will talk directly to his party leader and we all look forward to the meeting between the three party leaders.  His colleague, Michael White, in Moville, has contacted the mica group in the past few days.</p>  <p>  Once again, to focus on the issue of timeliness, this has gone on too long.  There is nobody more disappointed than me that the original scheme did not work out.  I worked closely with the mica group on it but when a thing is not working, we all have to put up our hands and figure out a better way.  I totally accept that the Minister and his officials are working on a more enhanced scheme.  There was very little detail in the report presented to us last week, so it is very important that the detail will be there.  I am a little concerned by the word "weeks".  It does not really say when and we should really nail that down.  </p>  <p>  A strong message will come from the city centre protest tomorrow.  Many people will be there, including many who are not directly affected by mica.  There has been such solidarity on this issue because Irish people are good at putting their feet into other people's shoes.  For any homeowners not affected by mica, it is hard to even comprehend what it is like.  While many people spent their time during lockdown talking about doing up their gardens and houses, building extensions and all that, that nightmare continued for so many people.</p>  <p>  I again thank the Minister of State for his time.  It is another opportunity to keep this issue alive and on the agenda.  It will be very much on the agenda tomorrow, with people power and feet on the ground.  The reason I raised the issue of William and Trish and their family is that it is an example of so many families who have spent seven to ten years living that nightmare.  They are out of their homes.  William sent a message to me today saying he does not want to be a victim.  People with mica in their homes do not want to be victims in this scenario.  They want it sorted, they want 100% redress and they want the Government to do the right thing by making that scheme accessible and affordable for them.  We have to move on from this.  </p>  <p>  When William and Trish look their young adult children in the eyes, they have to do so in the full knowledge that their parents did everything they could.  William is a former chair of the Mica Action Group.  He has done everything but he does not feel that he has.  We have to bring this to a quick conclusion.</p></speech>

Progress has been made to date through the group and issues such as removing upfront costs for assessing the scheme have been agreed with homeowners, as have other issues, including rent costs for those who have had to move out of their homes.  Planning permission exemptions have been agreed for like-for-like developments, as have proposals for the replacement of damaged septic tanks.  In addition, a guarantee on second grant access for homes that undergo remedial work to ensure they can access supports if any future problems emerge has been agreed.  This will help ensure homes can be sold in future.  It is expected any new scheme will involve a commitment of more than &euro;1.4 billion, with significant changes.  In comparison with the international models, it will be one of the most comprehensive packages in the world for homeowners in similar situations.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed, along with the Attorney General, to seeking financial contributions from liable parties.  The Deputy raised this issue.  I have spoken to the Minister about this and he is determined we should pursue those parties and other stakeholders to help fund any future scheme.  The Government, Minister and Department are all committed to working with homeowners in order to find resolutions to the issues under review.  All options remain on the table, including that of a 100% grant, and no final decision has been taken.  It is the Minister's intention that the matter will be brought to the Cabinet in the coming weeks and clarity and certainty will be given to homeowners to allow them to move on with their lives.</p>  <p>  I again reassure the Deputy that while the Minister is unable to be in the House today, it is critically important that stories, like the one the Deputy told of William and his family, are told because they deeply affect communities.  He is correct about the social solidarity this issue has brought about throughout the country.  There will be a large public demonstration tomorrow but I again give assurance that the Government is working tirelessly to try to resolve this issue satisfactorily to the benefit of all the families concerned.</p></speech>

It is what happens after that decision is made, if it is positive, and what processes will follow that I want to address.</p>  <p>  This project has been in existence for the past 30 years, but the reality is the most recent analysis of Galway's transport requirements was done in 2016 by Galway City Council, Galway County Council and the National Transport Authority, NTA.  It was a very comprehensive strategy that looked at walking, cycling, public transport, etc.  One of the things it highlighted was that Galway needed a road around the city as a piece of critical infrastructure to connect east to west.  The Minister of State, no more than me, is familiar with the territory, but many people watching and listening to this debate will not be.  Approximately 40,000 people live in the west of the city while another 40,000 people, approximately, live in Connemara, which is west of the city.  That is a total population of 80,000.  It is an area that attracts a large number of tourists every year.</p>  <p>  There are two ways out of Connemara, effectively.  One can come across the city.  Alternatively, because Lough Corrib forms a barrier between east and west - between Connemara and the west of the city and the east of the city and the rest of the country - one has to go 50 km north, to where I live in Cornamona, to get out by the next available route.  Within the city, there are four bridges across the River Corrib, three of which are old.  One of them, the Salmon Weir Bridge, which is very famous in Galway and that many people know, is to be transformed for public transport, cycling and walking use only.  The other two bridges in the city centre are very narrow, which leaves one newer bridge across the River Corrib to take the traffic of 80,000 people coming and going, many of whom do so every day.  In Galway, many people live in the west of the city, while its industry is in the east of it.</p> <p>They need to break the logjam to free up city space for cycling, walking and all the other purposes we want in our living cities, including for public transport, with which Galway is poorly served because the road infrastructure is not there.  The need to progress with this bypass is evident.</p> <p> I want the Minister of State to outline the processes that will have to be followed if this project is approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la before it will go to construction, taking into account the announcement in the national development plan, NDP, this week and, more particularly, the announcement made by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, of a new step he has put into the evaluation of all these projects as regards their carbon footprint.</p></speech>

The Minister for Transport has responsibility for overall policy and securing Exchequer funding for the national roads programme.  Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Tll, under the Roads Acts, 1993 to 2015, and in line with the NDP, the planning, design, improvement and upgrading of individual national roads is a matter for Tll, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Tll ultimately delivers the national roads programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework, and the NDP.</p>  <p>  In the new NDP, launched on 4 October, approximately &euro;5.1 billion is earmarked for new national road projects to 2030.  This funding will enable improved connectivity across the country as well as compact growth, which are core components of the revised NDP.  The funding will enable the development of numerous national road projects, including the completion of projects at construction stage and those close to it, as well as the development of many others.</p>  <p>  The N6 Galway city ring road is one of the projects included in the new NDP, which is currently at the planning application stage.  The proposed project around Galway city comprises 12.5 km of motorway and 6 km of single carriageway.  The route would run between the existing N6 at Coolagh to the existing Ballymoneen Road and continues as a single carriageway road for a further 5 km of protected road, west of Barna.  The new orbital route would travel around the city and include a new bridge crossing of the River Corrib.</p>  <p>  Galway County Council published the road scheme and submitted the planning documentation for the scheme to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for approval in October 2018.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la wrote to the council in April 2019 requesting further information about the environmental impacts of the scheme, and this was submitted in August 2019.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la requested that the council publish the further information for inspection by the public.  The closing date for further information on display was 25 October 2019 and this was subsequently extended to 24 January 2020.</p>  <p>  An oral hearing commenced on 18 February 2020 and concluded on 4 November 2020, inclusive of a seven-month gap in proceedings due to Covid-19 restrictions.  Galway County Council is awaiting a decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which has recently been pushed back to a decision by a new target date of 19 November 2021.  If planning approval is received from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and there are no legal challenges, the proposed project will require Government approval under the public spending code to proceed to the next stage, including procurement of a contractor, given that the project cost is expected to be more than &euro;100 million.  It would also be subject to final Government approval in advance of construction.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, this project is a key component of the Galway transport strategy, which realises Galway city and county councils' vision of all elements of transport working together to achieve an integrated, sustainable transport system.  The project would, as the Deputy said, free up road space in the city by removing through traffic for use by improved public transport services and active travel modes, while improving air quality and reducing noise levels in the city.  As the principal economic centre of the west, Galway city is critical to employment in the region and this project would contribute towards ensuring the city is able to cater for future economic expansion and development.  As a gateway to Connemara and the western region, which includes large Gaeltacht areas, the optimisation of transport connectivity within Galway city will be essential to help the region chart a steady course for economic growth.  The additional bridge crossing of the Corrib will provide this accessibility to the west.  By reducing traffic volumes on the existing road network, this proposed project will drastically improve journey times and allow for safer and more reliable journeys for road users.  It will improve the existing collision rating, which currently stands at twice the average rate in the country.</p>  <p>  The project will provide direct access to major employment centres at Parkmore and Ballybrit business parks, and offers an opportunity to execute the vision of the Galway transport strategy.  Galway County Council has an advanced negotiating strategy in place for the proposed Galway city ring road.  All affected householders were invited to participate and discussions and negotiations have been ongoing with those willing to participate since mid-2019.  If the scheme is approved and confirmed, the council will prioritise the acquisition and agreements associated with the affected residential properties.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced during the week a new process that is to be followed.  It seems to have been designed as a clever way of stopping projects such as this.  Can the Minister of State outline what that process will entail?  In the case of a road, will the process be based on cars, heavy goods vehicles and buses that are fuelled by fossil fuels or, as will happen in the future, vehicles that are fuelled by hydrogen?  Hydrogen will be produced in abundance in the west of because we will have so much renewable electricity.  We are already looking at hydrogen fuelled and electric public transport in the region.  Can the Minister of State outline how this new process will work out, what it will entail and the basis on which it will be decided?  Is this just a new method by the Green Party to stop this project going ahead and to stymy, once again, the proper development not only of Galway city, but of the entire region west of the city that requires so much development?</p>  <p>  My basic question is: what is really going on?  What is the subtext to all of these new announcements?  I notice there was no reference in the Minister of State's reply to the new layer of bureaucracy that is being added to the scheme.  I know this was not added without a deadly purpose.  I am trying to elicit whether this is a scheme by the Minister to make sure this project does not go ahead and will be strangled if or when it gets through the An Bord Plean&aacute;la process.</p></speech>

I am confident that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will make its decision next month and I am hopeful for a positive outcome.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to a 2:1 ratio of spending on new public transports over new roads.  This commitment has been confirmed in the NDP, published this week, which makes clear that substantial funding will be made available over the coming decade for new national road programmes and projects.  As the principal economic centre in the west, Galway city is critical to employment in the region and this project would contribute towards ensuring the city is able to cater for future economic expansion and development.</p></speech>

There is another process under the national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, which involves four priorities, all of which are given equal weight and ranking.  The first priority is to ensure that roads have regional connectivity, the second is decarbonisation and another is to ensure the mobility of goods and people in our urban centres.

This Bill has now lapsed.  It was introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.  A couple of weeks ago, it was noted in the legislative programme for the 2021 autumn session that work is under way to "provide a package of health and personal social services and other supports to survivors of thalidomide on a statutory basis".  Will the Minister of State outline the timeframe for the roll-out of this particular legislation?</p>  <p>  Will he also outline why the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has not met with the Irish Thalidomide Association?  It seems extraordinary that the last two Ministers for Health and the current Minister have all failed to meet the thalidomide survivors.  How can Ministers for Health not meet a group for which it is introducing legislation?  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, introduced the Bill I mentioned earlier in 2018 to support thalidomide survivors and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, supported it.  Despite this, the Government has now turned its back on these survivors, of whom there are only 32.  The Minister is on record as saying that the thalidomide survivors deserve compensation, recognition and justice.  They are his words and yet he will not even meet them.  </p>  <p>  I am pretty certain that thalidomide survivors are going to hear the same speech from the Minister of State that they have heard for the last ten years.  There are, as I mentioned, only 32 acknowledged survivors in Ireland.  The vast majority of them turn 60 this year or next year.  The Minister will hide behind solicitors and barristers and claim there cannot be a meeting for legal reasons.  On that point, not all survivors are taking a legal case so why not meet them?  Survivors have been in the courts with Government for the last eight years.  The Government faces a bill of &euro;24 million for its court action against survivors yet it will not engage with them.  Does the Minister of State have even one sentence that will give thalidomide survivors hope?  Will he show that there is some genuine commitment from this Government, because there has been no evidence of it so far?  </p>  <p>  More than 60 years after the thalidomide scandal in which morning sickness medicine for pregnant women caused malformations in their babies, survivors are still fighting for fair compensation in several European countries.  I have met many survivors of thalidomide and I have been inspired by their stories, their resilience and their courage.  Like all of us, thalidomide survivors are getting older and now require extra medical assistance and social care.  They fear that their independence might be stripped from them.  Thalidomide survivors must be respected and compensated.  The British Government's &pound;100 million compensation scheme stands in stark contrast to the unsatisfactory approach taken by our Irish Government.  </p>  <p>  It is long past time for the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to engage realistically with thalidomide survivors.  The Government needs to bring forward a package that gives due acknowledgement to the victims of one of the greatest medical scandals.  This package must guarantee the healthcare and personal needs of just 32 people who have to face later life with great uncertainty.  Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to support the survivors of thalidomide to ensure that they get fair support and compensation.  The Government must take steps now to ensure appropriate compensation is allocated to survivors.</p></speech>

I am glad to have this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to set out the supports currently provided by the Irish Government to Irish thalidomide survivors.</p><p>As the Deputy will know, following an Irish Government decision in January 1975, each Irish survivor is provided with health supports, including a medical card issued on an administrative basis regardless of means, in addition to appliances, artificial limbs, equipment, housing adaptations and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services.  Work is under way in the Department of Health to bring forward legislative proposals for the provision of these health and personal social services for Irish survivors of thalidomide on a statutory basis.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide a specific time frame for these legislative proposals. </p><p>Since 1975, the Irish Government has also provided financial assistance to each Irish thalidomide survivor including an <i>ex gratia</i>lump sum equivalent to four times the German lump sum and an <i>ex gratia</i>monthly allowance for life which is equal to the German monthly allowance.  There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of these <i>ex gratia</i>monthly payments from the Department of Health.  The annual figure for the Irish monthly payments ranges from &euro;6,175 to &euro;13,313 for each individual.  The rate of payment is related to each survivor's level of thalidomide-related injury.  The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation.  All thalidomide survivors entitled to benefits are entitled to a lifelong monthly pension ranging from &euro;8,928 to &euro;100,765 annually.  Since 2009, they are also entitled to annual special payments of between &euro;460 and &euro;3,600 and, since 2017, annual specific needs payments of between &euro;5,676 and &euro;14,700.  Both the German payments and the Irish <i>ex gratia </i>monthly payments made to survivors are exempt from tax, including deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, and are not assessable as means tor the purpose of Department of Social Protection payments.</p><p>In April 2010, the Government decided to provide additional financial assistance and other supports for Irish thalidomide survivors to meet their needs into the future.  The measures included an offer of an additional once-off <i>ex gratia</i>individual payment of &euro;62,500.  This offer was subsequently accepted by a number of the survivors.  A senior manager in the Health Service Executive has also been designated to liaise with survivors with a view to meeting their ongoing health and personal social service needs.  This support continues.</p><p>It is important to note that the German Contergan Foundation has confirmed that, since 2013, it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide-related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the foundation for assessment of his or her disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that his or her injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.  I also assure the House of the Government's commitment to the ongoing support of Irish thalidomide survivors.  The Deputy asked that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, meet with the thalidomide survivors.  I will raise this within the Department.  If the Deputy would like to send in an email, I will follow up with the Department.</p></speech>

What has been said by the Minister of State is the same as what has been said for the past ten years.  Survivors are fed up, angry and annoyed.  There is no commitment to and no hope or empathy for a group of survivors who are ageing and concerned for their futures.  How can the Minister not meet this group?  This has been going on for years.  As I said, in 2018 he was gung-ho in his support for them and said they needed justice.  Now he is paying lip service to this group.  They are a courageous group of survivors who had mountains to climb from the moment they were born.  They were still able to make a valuable contribution to society.</p>  <p>  The Government does not see fit to even meet them.  It is willing to spend millions taking them to court and fighting with them instead of sitting down to meet with and acknowledge them.  I do not believe that there is any barrier to meeting them.  We have heard that the courts are an obstacle, but the reality is that can be overcome . The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, wanted to introduce legislation and address certain issues.  He has again turned his back on these people.  I cannot understand that.  It was mentioned that there are 32 people involved.  That is a very small number.  How can the Government not sit down and talk with a small group of people face to face, say that it got it wrong and is at fault and that it will work with the survivors to rectify matters in a just and fair manner?  Meeting survivors has to be the first step.</p></speech>

I would like to reiterate that the Government is committed to the continued support of the health and personal social services needs of Irish thalidomide survivors.  There is empathy.  It is very difficult.  There are a number of cases concerning thalidomide before the High Court.  It is not possible to comment on matters that are <i>sub judice</i>.  Maybe that is a contributing factor in the context of why a meeting has not taken place.  As the Deputy said, there are ways around that.</p><p>The current supports provided by the Government to survivors, including monthly payments for life and medical cards, are provided on an administrative basis, regardless of means.  Access to the full range of health and personal services is ongoing.  I assure the House that work is under way, as I said, in the Department to bring forward legislative proposals for health and personal social services for Irish survivors of thalidomide on a statutory basis.</p><p>I again thank the Deputy for raising this very difficult issue.  The survivors have shown massive resilience and, as he said, courage.  As a Government, we will try to do everything we can.  There are probably issues that are outside my control, but I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

I am raising this matter because it is something about which I have a particular concern.  SI 461/2021 states that mussel dredging opened with effect from 14 September 2021.  The statutory instrument provides that persons may fish for mussels between that date and 16 December next.  The concern is that this statutory instrument is facilitating about a dozen large boats working around protected Natura 2000 site sandbanks in the Irish Sea and off Irish coasts.  It is enabling them to remove so-called mussel seed from our commons and relay it into aquaculture sites.</p>  <p>  The seed then grows on the estuary with or without further dredging.  It is often dredged up again for sale.  The unique Irish definition of mussel seed, which, according to SI 461/2021, is mussels of any size as long as they are not intended for direct human consumption, allows big vessels to dredge up entire biogenic reefs wherever they find them.  I understand from reading the statutory instrument that while a small number of sites are excluded from dredging within the terms of it, they are far few in number.</p>  <p>  There is serious concern about the impact this dredging is having on mussel beds and the broader issue of sustainable development.  There is a wider issue about the need to halt unmanaged fisheries.  Coastwatch and other organisations have tried for years to ensure that this practice be regulated and halted unless we can establish that it can be done without undue environmental impact.  The real concern is that there is no mussel management plan and that exploitation of commercial shellfish without a species management plan or adequate impact assessment will contravene the marine strategy framework directive, MSFD, descriptor 3 requirements and have a serious impact on our biodiversity.</p>  <p>  Some years ago when I was newly elected to the Seanad, I raised a similar issue about cockle dredging at Passage East in Waterford.  The then Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who had responsibility for it reversed the statutory instrument in response to the concerns I and environmentalists raised with him about the impact of big boats coming in and sweeping the seabed and destroying biodiversity and marine life.  What is happening in this instance is quite similar.</p>  <p>  I am asking that the practice provided for in the statutory instrument be halted.  I am not convinced that it is being done sustainably.  There is no data to show it is being done sustainably.  There is a real concern that these large, high-carbon-footprint vessels are dredging in and out of protected marine sites and that this is impacting on the biogenic reefs formed by mussels, which are crucial for the marine food chain and which form biodiversity hotspots in the sea.  There is a real concern that substantial volumes of mussels have already been dredged up and that serious damage is being done.</p>  <p>  I do not have data on how many boats are active, but I have been told that there are 11 or 12.  It should be possible to set the statutory instrument aside because of the assumptions that are being made or that it seems are being made on foot of it.  These are unsubstantiated assumptions about mussel population dynamics.  Specifically, the statutory instrument should be set aside because we do not have an environmental impact assessment and there is a real concern that we are damaging biodiversity at our marine sites.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700048#YY00500"><p>I thank Deputy Bacik for raising this important issue.  It is important to state from the outset that mussel seed is an essential raw material for the bottom growing mussel aquaculture industry.  Mussel farmers fish for wild mussel seed for transplantation onto their licensed aquaculture sites for ongoing and later harvesting over a two-year growth cycle.  The fished seed is grown to maturity on the sea floor, as distinct from what happens with rope grown mussels.</p>  <p>  The dredge-and-relay aspect is a unique feature of the fishery, whereby the mussel seed biomass is not removed from the ecosystem but is, in fact, retained at more sheltered locations where it typically spawns three or four times during the cycle thereby creating an additional spawning biomass.  The fish-and-relay process can, therefore, enhance spawning output by increasing the survival of mussel seed transferred to sheltered sites.  The mussel seed fishery sector is managed on an all-island basis in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland and the cross-Border Loughs Agency.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the 2008 expert group report, the rising tide, on the bottom mussel industry on the island of Ireland forms the policy basis for managing the mussel seed fishery and bottom mussel culture.  A fishery Natura plan for the Irish Sea mussel fisheries was adopted in 2018 following an appropriate assessment.  The plan covers five years, from 2018 to 2022, inclusive, and follows on from the previous five-year plan.  Fishing for mussel seed in the Irish Sea is restricted under Fisheries Natura Declaration No. 3 of 2018 (Mussel Fishing).  This declaration prohibits fishing for mussels in the intertidal zone.  It also prohibits fishing for mussels in a number of specific Natura 2000 sites around the Irish coast.</p> <p>This declaration was amended by Fisheries Natura Declaration No. 2 of 2019 (Mussel Fishing), which modifies the boundary of an area off the Irish coast where fishing for mussels is prohibited.  It is important to note that any recommendations to the Minister requesting that fishing be allowed on suggested dates is subject to the availability of adequate amounts of mussel seed being identified by surveys of mussel seed beds.</p> <p> SI 461/2021 was made under section 15 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  It allows fishing of mussel seed in the exclusive fishery limits of the State from 14 September to 16 December 2021, inclusive, as Deputy Bacik outlined, on suitable tides except for Natura areas closed under fisheries Natura declarations.  The fisheries management measures in place for the fishery include restricted access to the fishery and seasonal controls on the periods during which fishing is permitted.</p> <p> The decision to open the fishery was based on information from various sources, including Bord lascaigh Mhara, BIM, surveys, Marine Institute scientific advice and Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority advice on enforcement.  Between May and August 2021, BIM carried out eight seed surveys, including some preliminary surveys, in a number of locations in the Irish Sea, including off Rosslare and Wexford, at Long Bank; off Cahore Point, Rusk Channel; off South Wicklow Head; in the Dublin Bay area; and at Glassgorman Banks.</p> <p> On the basis of these surveys, BIM identified an estimated 9,293 tonnes of mussel seed in the Irish Sea.  The Marine Institute provided the Department with scientific advice for the proposed 2021 mussel seed fishery.  The advice notes that survey estimates for the period 2016 to 2021 varied from 3,500 tonnes to 9,293 tonnes.  These estimates are substantially lower than previous highs of over 25,000 tonnes reported in catches.  At 9,293 tonnes, however, the 2021 estimates are the highest in recent years.</p></speech>

I am conscious that, as he said, mussel dredging is run on an all-island basis with Bord Iascaigh Mhara co-ordinating and providing a secretariat for the mussel boats, but I am told there is a difference in that in Northern Ireland mussel seed fishing grounds remain closed in 2021 as it was seen that there were not enough mussels.  The mussel dredgers from Northern Ireland tend to come south to get mussel seed for NI aquaculture areas such as Belfast Lough.  The Northern Ireland Government survey of summer 2021 states:</p> <blockquote> 	These surveys have indicated the continued reestablishment of this once large seed mussel bed ....  [This was a bed at Skullmartin.]  We would therefore not recommend opening this bed at this time. </blockquote>  <p>Therefore, I think there remains a serious concern, despite the surveys the Minister of State has cited, that good weather has already facilitated intensive dredging over the recent neap tides and that substantial volumes of mussels have already been dredged up and damage done, both where they were dredged and where the dredged seed was dumped.  Again, there is just a lack of information available on assurances about the environmental impact of dredging at this scale and this level will have.  There is a concern also that the statutory instrument enables dredging based on assumptions that are not borne out by the reality, one difficulty being that mussel seed is so widely defined in the statutory instrument as to include mussels of any age or size under Irish law.</p><p>During the recent by-election campaign, one of the issues I campaigned on was climate matters, in particular protection of the uniquely brilliant environment that is Dublin Bay.  I represent Dublin Bay South.  When we see this sort of wide-scale dredging being allowed under statutory instruments such as this one, it is important we question them and the environmental impact they have and look for environmental impact assessments.</p></speech>

We should always look at our processes and make sure they are robust and are protecting our environment and the sustainability of our future stocks, as is the case.  In some ways, I would argue that perhaps the survey the Deputy points to in the North that advised that there not be harvesting in those areas actually show that the system of surveying is working.  This is done on an all-island basis and, therefore, certain areas under that survey were found, as the Deputy outlined, not to have been selected, it would appear.</p>  <p>  Authorisations are provided only to those boats which are directly connected with a bottom-grown mussel aquaculture operator or which are contracted to fish on behalf of same.  An authorisation to fish for mussel seed specifies various conditions, such as the quantity of seed that may be fished by the boat, or the "allocation", the aquaculture site where the seed is to be relaid and the permitted tides for fishing, together with other regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  The Marine Stewardship Council, MSC, issued on 27 July 2018 certification for the fishery, which is valid for five years, subject to the results of ongoing surveillance audits.  The certification states that the fishery has been evaluated by SAI Global, has been found to comply with the MSC requirements and is a "Well Managed and Sustainable Fishery", in accordance with the MSC's principles and criteria for sustainable fishing.</p>  <p>  I bring the Deputy back to the earlier point, that this harvesting leads to increased spawning levels of biomass in the process, but I thank her for raising these points.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700049#ZZ00800"><p>I doubt I will take the 15 minutes.  I welcome the Minister.  This is a Bill I moved a number of years ago, I think in 2019 - the name of the Bill is the Broadcasting (Amendment) (Protection of Journalism) Bill 2019 - responding to particular circumstances of which I am sure the Minister is aware.  It was in the lottery of Bills and I am happy it has been selected.</p><p>I introduced the Bill, as I said, in 2019, following Communicorp Media's outrageous act of blacklisting in 2017 from its radio stations certain journalists, including highly respected and award-winning journalists, Tom Lyons and Ian Kehoe.  In October of that year, Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la from all parties signed a joint letter to Communicorp Media urging an immediate end to the ban with the support of the then Taoiseach and all party leaders.  The ban on <i>Currency</i>journalists ended in December 2019, thankfully, but the ban on journalists from <i>The Irish Times</i>was not lifted until the acquisition of Communicorp by Bauer Media Audio over the summer.  I commend the integrity of those journalists who stood in solidarity with their peers in <i>The Irish Times</i>and who limited their engagement with the offending party until the ban was lifted.  It is welcome that this practice was ended by the new administration but it is worrying that it could occur in the first place.  It has set a precedent that we must act to end.</p><p>The Bill would amend the Broadcasting Act 2009 to make it a breach of contract or licence under the Act to prohibit a member of the National Union of Journalists from communications media for reason or reasons of occupation, employer or employment status.  It would ensure that the targeted censorship we have witnessed could not happen again without a mechanism for accountability.  At this point in time, there is no accountability and no such mechanism.  No journalist should be banned from any communications platform on the basis of their occupation, place of work, who their employer is, the status of their employment or the type of work they perform.</p><p>A free, independent and pluralistic media based on freedom of information and expression is a core element of any functioning democracy.  We have seen free speech and the free media attacked in very recent times from some quarters in the United States.  We in this country who believe in a free press stood against that type of intimidation of the media, and we should not tolerate any intimidation of the media in this State either.  No entity, government or private corporation should have the ability to manipulate the media and censor or silence journalists who are recognised as journalists by their adherence to the relevant professional standards.  It is not for a private corporation to determine for itself what those standards should be.  It was extremely disconcerting when one of the largest media corporations in the State was able to ban respected journalists from respected institutions, whether this was to protect commercial interests or for some other reason.</p> <p>Large media conglomerates are becoming more dominant and more globally intertwined.  Our laws must be robust if they are to ensure protections for a free and open press in a more global and less accountable environment.  I am not insinuating there is foreign or corporate interference in the press but we must ensure the safeguards are in place, learning from our experience to prevent any further unjustifiable restrictions.</p> <p> I have limited the scope of the Bill to members of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, for a number of reasons.  First, professionalism in the media is essentially governed by the terms of membership of the NUJ, as well as the integrity of individuals and editors.  The union plays an integral role in protecting the free press, editorial independence, and the rights of journalists and their sources.  We have seen that happen time and again.  As part of the International Federation of Journalists, it plays a part in the collective, global effort to ensure the safety of media workers, freedom of information, open government and, crucially, plurality of the media.</p> <p> Second, as we do not have a legal definition of "journalist" in law, to apply the legislation to journalists more broadly might open broadcasters to the possibility of court cases being taken by any person who uses the label "journalist".  This could result in frivolous cases being taken that are designed to punish broadcasters for what might be a genuine reason for not including a person or persons on a programme.  Limiting the scope of the Bill to NUJ members creates a certain standard or threshold as to who can, or cannot, avail of the legislation, if passed. </p> <p> Finally, and importantly, I am proposing this threshold as I believe in trade unions and that all journalists should be in the NUJ or another union.  Workers are stronger for being members of unions and the legislation supports this.  Unions are self-governing democratic organisations and are an important pillar of democracy.  They have a wide, constructive and institutional role to play.  For these reasons, I am proposing membership of the NUJ as the test for whether a person would qualify for protection under the proposed section 78A to be inserted in the Broadcasting Act 2009.</p> <p> I will not be accepting the Minister's amendment, the rationale for which is seriously lacking.  It is not the first time the Government has proposed to impose a delay on the Second Reading of a Bill brought to the House by an Opposition Member.  The Minister is proposing that she needs 18 months to look into the matter and deal with any anomalies she might find in its provisions.  This makes a mockery of the process we have in the Oireachtas whereby we propose Bills on First and Second Stages.  Committee Stage is there for a reason and I have no problem, as the proposer of this Bill, coming before any committee of the Oireachtas to do what needs to be done in terms of amendments the Government or any Opposition Member might wish to put forward.  I do not like this practice of simply kicking the can down the road for 18 months, especially given that this Bill was introduced in December 2019.  It seems the departmental officials, in the almost two years since I brought it forward, either did not examine the scope of the Bill to determine what they might see as the complications or unintended consequences arising from it, or this is simply a tactic to kick the can down the road.  If the Minister's officials genuinely believe that a huge amount of work needs to be done, that can be dealt with in committee.  That is why we have Committee Stage.  As I recall, the Ceann Comhairle has raised this issue in the past.</p> <p> It is very important that there be a consensus across the political divide that the actions by Communicorp Media some years ago were absolutely unacceptable.  For a renowned and respected journalist to be blacklisted in a modern democracy is entirely unacceptable.  It is equally unacceptable that there was absolutely no recourse whatsoever to achieve accountability.  How can that be?  The company was simply allowed to get away with its actions until it was bought out.  We cannot tolerate that.  There must be standards and they must be enforced.  That requires legislation, which is why I am proposing this Bill.</p></speech>

In October 2019, a cross-party letter was sent to the company calling for an end to the ban.  Since then, a great deal has changed.  Denis O'Brien's position as a media tycoon in this State, controlling large swathes of print and broadcast media for several decades, has come to a close with the sale of both Communicorp Media and Independent News &amp;amp; Media.  The lack of media pluralism in the State during his time was, frankly, outrageous and the subsequent change in the media landscape is to be welcomed.  Media pluralism is an essential component of any modern, democratic state.  The State needs to step up to ensure that media freedoms and media plurality are maintained and protected.</p>  <p>  While there have been changes in media ownership in Ireland in recent years, the regulatory landscape has remained much the same.  There has been some progress, such as the establishment of the Future of Media Commission, the proposed online safety and media regulation Bill, the proposed electoral reform Bill and a number of EU directives.  I look forward to reading the commission's report.  It had a very wide and interesting remit and I hope that matters such as media concentration and freedoms of the media will be included in its findings.  The 2021 report on Ireland by the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom notes that the only survival plan for many Irish outlets is to become an element of larger international media groups.  The issue of the consolidation of media ownership remains.  Only this week, we were reminded of such concentration on a global scale when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp went offline due to a Facebook server error.  We might not be able to enact regulation in this House to manage media ownership but we can regulate how media companies do business here.  I look forward to the publication of the online safety and media regulation Bill, which will bring about a number of major changes in the regulation of online media in this State.  The Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, of which I am a member, is currently finalising a pre-legislative report on the Bill.  We have a large number of recommendations for the Department on how to improve it.  I hope our suggestions will be taken on board as we need robust legislation to reform how online media operate in this State.</p>  <p>  The Bill we are debating today will make it an offence for a broadcaster to ban a journalist who is a member of the NUJ from the airwaves for reason of occupation, employer company or employment status.  Its provisions are limited to members of the NUJ as there is no legal definition of a journalist in law and we want to be fair to broadcasters and ensure the Bill is not so broad that anyone who self-identifies as a journalist can potentially take a case.  There is a serious lack of legislation at this time regarding certain aspects of the media.  The Bill will address one small, unregulated area and I hope the Government will support it.  Every broadcaster has a responsibility to be fair and impartial regardless of who its owner is.  Without this legislation, the obligation of impartiality is open to abuse.  That is why it is needed.</p></speech>

Is fi&uacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht chuiditheach a dh&eacute;anamh sa Teach.  Tuigim an r&eacute;as&uacute;na&iacute;ocht a bhaineann le moladh an Bhille seo.  As Deputy Cullinane rightly pointed out on First Stage, the banning of journalists by media outlets is a step in the wrong direction.</p> <p>It is something that needs to be challenged in order for the media sector to function as it should.  Journalism at its best informs us as citizens, engages us as a society and challenges us as representatives.  It is a public good and I recognise it as such.  It plays a crucial role in shaping a healthy democracy and is one of the pillars of a democratic society.  A strong and independent media sector is central to our parliamentary democracy and freedom of speech, as well as to the provision of quality and impartial information.<br/><br/>As Minister, I firmly believe in the safeguarding of media plurality and in protecting the freedom of journalists to perform their jobs without fear of reprisals from other media organisations, such as in the form of bans.  To elaborate on this point, I bring to the attention of the House the adoption by Ireland of the Council of Europe resolution on the safety of journalists.  The resolution was tabled at the Conference of Ministers responsible for Media and Information Society, which I attended in June of this year.<br/><br/>Point two of the resolution is particularly relevant in the context of this debate.  In summary, it asserts that the key role of journalists and other media actors in exposing wrongdoing, corruption, crime and abuse of power exposes them to intimidation, threats, harassment, violence, arbitrary surveillance or interception of communications, misuse of national laws, abusive litigation and sometimes to arbitrary deprivation of liberty.  In adopting the resolution, the Government affirmed its commitment to the support and protection of journalists.  We acknowledged that in order for journalists and other media actors to effectively and safely fulfil their role as public watchdog, they require appropriate protection.  They also require an enabling environment for freedom of expression and media freedom in which vigorous public debate can thrive.<br/><br/>The Government recognises that journalists and other media actors play a central role in enabling the full enjoyment of freedom of expression.  They are critical to the healthy functioning of a democracy.  In support of this point, I bring the attention of Deputies to a line from the final declaration adopted by the Conference of Ministers.  It asserts that all forms of attacks on journalists and other media actors intended to undermine their ability to perform their public watchdog role must be regarded as attacks on democracy and strongly condemned.  It is the responsibility of states to act to effectively prevent, investigate and sanction threats and attacks of all kinds against journalists.<br/><br/>The relevant provisions of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, as well as Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights, remain the fundamental standards to be applied in the exercise of those rights.  Robust frameworks for the protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the media must be in place to ensure that journalists and the media can effectively perform their professional duties, including in times of crisis.<br/><br/>These points demonstrate the seriousness with which this Government views the importance of journalistic freedoms.  As Minister I thank the Deputy once again for bringing forward this Bill so that a thorough debate can be held, and all arguments considered.  Discrimination of any sort is something this Government vehemently opposes.<br/><br/>As the House is aware, the Bill seeks to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009 by making it a breach of contractor licence for a broadcaster to prohibit any member of the National Union of Journalists from appearing on its communications media for reason or reasons of occupation, employer, company relationship or employment status.  However, while I welcome the debate brought on by the proposal of the Bill, I believe that, as drafted, it raises complexities.  These could lead to significant unintended consequences which I will set out presently.  It is the view of the Government that these issues require further consideration to ensure the Bill is suitably robust to ensure its effectiveness.  It is on this basis that the Government is proposing to defer the Second Reading of the Bill for 18 months in order to allow further consideration of the matter.<br/><br/>The proposed change to the Broadcasting Act envisaged in the Bill would lead to a requirement to amend existing broadcasting contracts.  Potential inconsistencies of application of the measure may arise across the broadcasting sector, as contracts are agreed for a fixed period of up to ten years.  This would lead to a piecemeal landscape in which contract changes are implemented by the broadcasting regulator on an incremental basis over an extended duration of time, in line with the timeline for contract renewal for each individual broadcaster.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as the Bill provides for the amendment to be inserted in Part 6 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, it would only apply to commercial and community broadcasters, and not to services operated by RT&Eacute; or TG4.  As a Government, it is important that we take account of the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming and content they wish to broadcast, subject, of course, to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations.  It is a long-established principle that a decision about who should be invited or not invited to appear on Irish radio or television programmes is solely a matter for individual broadcasters.  As the Bill could constrain broadcasters' freedom of action on decisions regarding inclusion or exclusion from programming content, the implications of the Bill in the context of freedom of expression would require further research to establish the legality of such an approach.<br/><br/>Another issue with the Bill is the lack of detail as to how it would work in practice.  It is unclear how the regulator would determine whether a violation has occurred.  For example, it is unclear whether this would have to be explicit written policy or an unwritten practice within an organisation.  Furthermore, it is not clear how an investigation would initially be triggered.  The Bill does not give details as to whether, for instance, such an investigation would be on foot of a complaint from a member of the public or initiated as part of the regulator's routine compliance monitoring.<br/><br/>I have concerns regarding the fact the Bill only specifies members of the National Union of Journalists as being able to benefit from this protection.  Consequently, it may be deemed discriminatory to journalists not affiliated with this union but who are members of other recognised unions, such as journalists who are part of unions in other member states.  Moreover, the Bill does not account for journalists who do not belong to a recognised union.<br/><br/>It must also be noted that the context in which the Bill was initiated was the ban imposed by Communicorp Media on journalists from <i>The Currency</i>and <i>The Irish Times</i>from appearing on its radio stations.  As the latter of the aforementioned bans was rescinded following a change in ownership of Communicorp Media in June 2021, the Government does not consider that there is an urgent requirement in the short term for legislation of this nature.  What matters more is that we get it right.<br/><br/>As regards the next steps, the timed amendment I am proposing asks that we take the necessary time to consider the issues and complexities that I have put forward this evening.<br/><br/>To reiterate, we as a Government are keenly aware of the issues raised by the Bill, and I thank the Deputy for bringing it forward and encouraging this debate.  A free and pluralist media is one of the cornerstones of a modern democracy.  It should quite rightly be supported.  In times of crisis, freedom of expression and information and freedom of the media are vital components of the functioning of democratic societies.  As I stated, the Government deems this issue of the utmost importance.  We will continue to strive to foster free, open and democratic debate across all forms of media.  Ireland's adoption of the resolution on the safety of journalists at a European level reinforces this statement.  This timed amendment will allow for the necessary care to be taken when assessing the proposal in the Bill.  I know the Deputies speaking on the Bill will make a valuable contribution to the further consideration of the proposals at the heart of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700051#BBB00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  The Labour Party supports the Bill because at its heart is addressing an issue that should have made everybody in Ireland feel extremely uncomfortable, that is, that a multimillionaire tax exile who owns several radio stations and did not like what certain journalists were writing about him decided to ban entire publications and representatives who work for those publications from speaking on the radio stations he owns.  This ban even extended to the sports programmes on those stations.  What was at the heart of this was an attack on journalism, free speech and democracy.</p>  <p>  As was stated, there are many things we have taken for granted, such as the way democracy works, how people carry themselves in public forums, the way the Judiciary works and the way that journalism seeks the truth.  Members have seen that in the United States the media have been portrayed as being the enemy of the people.  In this country, two journalists have been murdered in the past 25 years.  Journalism is at the heart of democracy because journalists seek the truth.  All those in political circles have complaints about individual publications, and sometimes about individual journalists, and we sometimes feel that we have been unfairly criticised, but central to our belief system in a republic is that journalism is allowed to do what it is supposed to do.  As such, for a radio station that, effectively, gets its licence from the Oireachtas to ban several publications from appearing on any programme on that station is an outrage and the Oireachtas has to react.  That is why the Labour Party is in full support of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The Minister outlined several issues pertaining to the Bill and it is important that she and her Department examine proposed legislation.  I accept that if legislation is to be enacted, it must be workable.</p> <p>I also accept the point made by Deputy Cullinane in respect of having Second Stage in 18 months.  We have also been on the receiving end of this kind of treatment in respect of Bills that we have brought forward.  It almost feels like an attempt on the part of Government to delay.  It does not want to be seen to vote the Bill down, so it will elongate the process and hope it will almost go away.  It is almost 12 months since I introduced legislation and was told we would come back to in 12 months.  It does not feel as if there is the urgency that is needed on this issue.  It has been discussed within these Chambers over the past two years.  What is to stop another tax exile, or the same tax exile, from acquiring another radio station that currently has a licence from the State and to issue another ban on whatever publication he feels should not be allowed to give its point of view?  It could happen tomorrow, yet the Government has said that it could take 18 months for something to be done about it.<br/><br/>I wish to make another point on a responsibility that all of us in political life share.  I have noticed in the past number of years, and certainly, since the dawn of the social media age, that there have been personalised attacks on journalists from certain political quarters or supporters of certain political entities or movements.  They have been trolled and abused and the abuse is often quite misogynistic.  Attempts are made to assume that because a person writes for a certain publication, they are from a certain part of the country or they are related to somebody who may be involved in politics, they have a certain point of view.  All of us in politics, regardless of our political party, have a responsibility to call that out.  It is wrong that somebody engaging in journalism, producing copy, trying to seek the truth and giving what they believe to be a fair analysis of what is happening in these Chambers would be targeted by the supporters of any political entity here - Government, Opposition or otherwise - and be accused of being political, biased, having a political slant, or whatever.  We speak regularly in these Chambers about the type of poisonous culture that we sometimes have to deal with in politics.  Just as we want to encourage people into politics, we also want to encourage people into journalism and to seek that essential truth.  We want to encourage that life and career.  It is going to be difficult for someone to be attracted to a career in journalism if, by virtue of where they are from, the fact that a member of their family may have been politically aligned at one point or other or assumptions that can be made about them, that they will be on the receiving end of vicious abuse.  We have all seen it and we cannot pretend that it does not happen.  All of us have responsibility to ensure that whatever supporters we may have for our political entities online, they behave in a much more responsible fashion.  I have seen some quite poisonous attempts made to silence journalists, whose job it is to analyse and report, online in the social media space.  The agenda is often to ensure that they will second-guess a comment, a column or a question that they may ask of a political leader.  That is wrong and we need to be mindful of that.<br/><br/>To be clear about the Labour Party's stance on this issue, it is an attack on democracy for somebody who has deep pockets to own a radio station and to limit those who can come on purely because of the profession that they hold or the publication that they write for.  That is an attack on democracy, and Government and the Oireachtas must respond to that attack.  It is not good enough to say that we can respond effectively in 18 months because circumstances have changed and this ban is no longer in place.  That is not good enough.  I remind people that we live in a country where two journalists have been murdered over the past 25 years.  The vitriol and poison thrown in the direction of certain journalists has to be called out.  It is making some people wonder why they are in the profession.  It certainly is making some people second-guess whether they will go into the profession.  <br/><br/>Finally, I wish to speak in support of Deputy Cullinane's point about the delaying tactic.  Politics works best here often on evenings such as this when Government and Opposition can work constructively together.  They do not get much media coverage and people are not necessarily watching in great numbers.  However, some of the energy is taken out of constructive politics when a Member brings legislation forward in good faith, and rather than just voting it down or letting it move to Committee Stage and having a thorough investigation of it, the Government kicks it down the road for 12 or 18 months.  As a result, the energy, intent and ethic behind the bill is lost.  The Minister is just going to have to hope that multimillionaires stay out of the communications sphere and do not introduce more bans on <i>The Irish Times</i>or other publications.  That would be a situation that the Minister would regret.  <br/><br/>With those comments, we support the Bill and look forward to seeing it enacted, even if it does take 18 months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700052#CCC00200"><p>I recognise the work of my colleague, an Teachta Cullinane, in this regard.  It is important legislation and, indeed, as the Minister herself has stated, media plurality and freedom of the press are essential parts of a functioning democracy.  I am a bit confused by her contribution.  She said she wanted to draw our attention to the adoption of the Council of Europe resolution on the safety of journalists, and went further to state that journalists "also require an enabling environment for freedom of expression and media freedom in which vigorous public debate can thrive".  That is grand.  That is contained in resolution and it is stated that that should be done.  Then we bring legislation to the House, which attempts to go some way towards that.  It would certainly make a contribution to that sentence, which, in and of itself, is simply just a nice thing that one might like to do but not a thing that will actually happen.  This legislation seeks to put some structure on that, but for some reason, that is not deemed to be a priority and it has to be kicked down the road.  That is where there was a contradiction in what the Minister said.</p>  <p>  On the one hand, she stated that the legislation is necessary, and I believe her party was a signatory to the letter that was signed at the time the ban was put in place.  However, now the ban is no longer in place, she stated that given that the last of the aforementioned bans was rescinded following a change in Communicorp Media's ownership in 2021, the Government does not consider there is an urgent requirement in the short term for legislation of this nature.  I find that outrageous, actually.  It is either necessary or it is not.  If it is necessary, let us build on the work that has been done by an Teachta Cullinane.  If it is not necessary, the Minister should say so.  We find ourselves in this kind of in-between space, where the Government is not opposing the legislation.  Indeed, it is opposing very little at the moment.  This is not the only Bill it has failed to opposed outright, as referred to by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  The Government is not opposing the legislation, but it is saying it is not necessary now, although it might be necessary in a while.  The Government is just waiting for the next billionaire to come along and put in place another ban and attempt to destroy the career of another group of journalists.  They could work for another publication or any organisation.  The Government is content to wait for that to happen and then perhaps to act in haste.  However, we have time now.  The Ceann Comhairle, an Teachta Cullinane and Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referred to the practice of kicking things down the road for 18 months with the argument that more time is needed to consider the legislation.</p> <p>It is like the Government is saying it needs more time to consider it or that it will do it but just not now.  This is nothing short of disrespectful to the committee process and the people here who give of their time.  The Government does not expect that every piece of legislation brought to the floor of the D&aacute;il will be perfect and will work and will not require scrutiny.  This is what Committee Stage of legislation is for.  On Committee Stage we have an opportunity to interrogate the legislation.</p> <p> What the Minister is effectively saying is that we should do it, or perhaps that we should not do it as the Minister is certainly not committed to it, but that we definitely should not be doing it now.  The Minister is content to wait for the next billionaire to come along and for the next group of journalists to be blacklisted or banned or whatever word she wants to put on it.  This sends a very dangerous message to people working in journalism.  Importantly too, as has been alluded to, it sends a very dangerous message to anyone considering a career in journalism.</p> <p> The Bill seeks to make it a breach of contract or licence under the Broadcasting Act to prohibit a member of the NUJ from communications media for reason or reasons of occupation, employer or employment status.  As I understand it, most journalists are members of the NUJ.  The Minister referenced other trade unions from outside the State of which they might be a member.  They are all part of a European or global union movement.  These are small issues that could be addressed.  This is exactly the type of thing that Committee Stage would be an opportunity to do.</p> <p> There was a chilling effect, and it was discussed by my colleague, Senator Lynn Ruane, who commissioned a very important report into this area.  A concentration of media ownership is not good for journalism or democracy.  It is not healthy.  The notion that the Government is content to park this until the next billionaire comes along or there is another chilling effect sends a very poor message.  I urge the Minister rather than seeking to kick the can down the road to accept that this legislation is necessary and that it complements the resolution the Minister signed.  It does not undermine it in any way but enhances it.  It is a necessary element to put some structure on what the Minister has committed to, which is that journalists require an enabling environment for freedom of expression and media freedom in which vigorous public debate can thrive.  The Minister is content for this not to happen for 18 months.  This sends a very poor message not just to members of the press but to anyone considering a career in journalism.</p> <p> I urge the Minister to withdraw the amendment and engage with the democratic process we have in the House and the committee rooms.  If there are issues those issues can be teased out.  If amendments are required those amendments can be considered and made as appropriate so the message goes out from the Chamber to journalists that we respect what they do, that we want them to be protected in their work and that we as legislators are prepared to use our powers to legislate in their favour and in favour of protections for this group of workers.</p> <p> To do what the Minister is proposing sends out the message that perhaps the Government is not that committed to freedom of the press or protecting journalists, is not interested in doing anything about it now, and is content to wait until the next billionaire comes along.  This is a very poor message to send out from the Chamber.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the amendment, back the Bill and allow it to proceed, as all legislation must, through the procedures we have so it can be scrutinised, enhanced if necessary and amended as is required.</p></speech>

I am grateful to Deputy Cullinane and other colleagues for highlighting the issue and for contributing to the debate.  I do not doubt the Bill has been tabled in a sincere effort to ensure the Irish media landscape continues to be an open and pluralist space.  I have listened to the Deputies with interest and I thank Members of the House for all of their comments.  We agree that the banning of journalists by media organisations raises serious concerns and we must now ensure we consider all of the points raised in the debate.  It is also imperative that we take into account possible future consequences of the Bill.  As I stated earlier, there are fundamental weaknesses in the structure of the Bill, as drafted, and it is crucial to address these before considering whether a legislative response is the right one and, if so, what approach that legislation should take.</p>  <p>  A strong and independent media sector is central to our parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and the provision of quality and impartial information.  As a government we firmly believe in the safeguarding of media plurality and in protecting the freedom of journalists to perform their jobs without fear of media organisations.  Our work at European level, as highlighted earlier, shows the seriousness with which we treat the function of journalists and the media in this country.  In adopting the resolution on the safety of journalists we reinforce the idea that a functioning democracy requires media freedom.</p>  <p>  I want to bring the attention of the House to the 2021 World Press Freedom Index as compiled by the international non-profit organisation, Reporters Without Borders, in which Ireland ranks 12th in the world out of 180 countries listed, just two places outside the top ten.  This serves to emphasise the high regard with which we hold press freedom in this country.  However, I must reiterate the concerns raised earlier in the debate.  It is the Government's view that these concerns require further consideration to ensure the Bill is suitably robust and that it is the most appropriate course of action.  Of major concern is that the Bill may be rushed through at this point and have far-reaching consequences in future.  The Bill was tabled in the context of bans that have now been rescinded.  It is essential that we take into account there is not a requirement in the short term for legislation of this nature.  The proposed 18-month period will allow us to give adequate consideration to the Bill and ensure we can explore the full range of policy options around the matter.  Allowing sufficient time to consider all of the issues involved is the best way to make sure any legislation or policy measure we put in place on the matter takes a careful, measured and well-evidenced approach and will do the best for journalists and our media sector.  A free and pluralist media is one of the cornerstones of a modern democracy and we should do our utmost to protect and support this ideal.</p>  <p>  As I indicated, I am broadly supportive of the aims and objectives of the Bill but I have laid out the issues and reasons for proposing an amendment with regard to 18 months.  As the Deputy is aware, the online safety and media regulation Bill is being drafted.  It is a priority for the Government.  The Deputy is also aware it will provide for the establishment of a media commission.  Once established, it is my intention to consult it on this specific issue.  The establishment of the media commission seemed to be something the Deputy has not considered during the debate.  The period of assessment sought is very much needed, particularly for a new media commission to have a role.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le mo chomhghleacaithe sa Teach ar&iacute;s as p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar bhealach tuisceanach agus soil&eacute;ir agus t&aacute;im ag tn&uacute;th le tuilleadh pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an &aacute;bhar seo.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-10-07a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021100700053#DDD00300"><p>I thank the Minister for her response.  I also thank the Members who spoke in support of the Bill.  Drafting legislation is complex.  We have to call a spade a spade here because we have all been in this position.  We have not yet been in government and, hopefully, at some point we will be.  We certainly have been in opposition as has the Minister.  Others have been in government and in opposition.  When we are in opposition we have very limited staff, as the Minister knows.  It is very difficult to draft legislation.  I do not ever remember a Bill brought forward by a member of the Opposition where a Minister came in and said it was a perfect Bill, that the Government would support it, that there was no need for amendments and that the job was done.  As we know, this is not how a parliamentary democracy works.  Even Government Bills brought forward very often have a lot of Government amendments that must be introduced, sometimes at the 11th hour on Report Stage.  I am illustrating the point that this is how legislation is drafted.  If the heart of the Bill, as the Minister says, is sound then it should be supported and allowed to proceed to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  I will bring this back to what we are speaking about and the reason we tabled the Bill in the first place.  What was the rationale for the Bill?  Respected journalists were blacklisted and banned from appearing on a certain radio station and certain media outlets because they worked for other media outlets.  The owner of that organisation decided he did not like what they were saying or what they were writing and he took this course of action, as other people have said.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The only thing the Oireachtas could do, including the Taoiseach, was write a letter.  That was it.  We all wrote a letter and nothing happened.  It reminds me of what happened in a completely different situation when we were left powerless when it came to people who needed the support of the State, namely, the closure of Clerys.  The Minister may remember the case.  The company was broken up, its assets removed and sold and its workers left high and dry.  Again, the State could do nothing about it.  We saw this in the case of the Debenhams workers when we also raised concerns in the Chamber.  All we got from the Government then was tea and sympathy and statements that nothing could be done about it.  </p> <p> We are not powerless.  We are the Oireachtas and our job, as legislators, is to legislate and ensure that where wrong is done, sanctions, penalties and recourse to fairness are available.  If there is unfairness in how the law is being applied or if a licence issued by the State is being used or misused in any way, we must ensure citizens have recourse to justice and having bad decisions overturned.  In this case, there was no such recourse.</p> <p> I listened to the Minister's contribution and I accept her point on the need for changes to this Bill precisely for the reason I gave, namely, that we can only do what we can with a Bill.  I accept there will always be unintended consequences that can be fixed but I do not accept that we can kick the can down the road for 18 months, hope it will not happen again and forget about it because - in the eyes of the Government - Communicorp Media has been sold on.  That is not the way to do it.  It is exactly what we did in the case of the Clerys workers and in other circumstances.  However, what happened to the Clerys workers was repeated time and again and every time it happens the Government asks what it can do, it does not have legislation and is powerless to act.  It is as if we are impotent in this House when it comes to being able to solve problems, put legislation in place and address these problems.  That is fundamentally untrue.  I will be blunt and say the political will does not exist to deal with this issue.  It is not that we do not have the ability as legislators to do something about it.  We do but the political will does not exist.</p> <p> It is not clear from the Minister&rsquo;s speech what the Government is saying the remedy should be.  She did not give us even a glimpse of one.  She spoke about looking at this issue over the next 18 months.  How would we look at it?  What would the format of this &ldquo;looking at it&rdquo; be?  It will not be through the Oireachtas committee because the Bill will not even be sent to the sectoral committee.  What will the Department do?  My guess is it will probably do very little, if anything.  This goes back to the experience of previous speakers when a timeframe is given that a Bill will be revisited in 18 months in the hope that it will go away and even if it does not go away, the Government will not deal with it anyway.  It shows real disrespect for the Opposition when that happens.</p> <p> I concur with the remarks made about pushing back against any attacks on journalism.  I have seen these attacks on social media and I have called them out.  They are wrong.  Journalism is a profession, the same as politics.  I have seen many politicians abused on social media, sometimes on my own timeline on social media accounts, and I have called it out.  Every time I see what I believe is someone being abused on social media, certainly on my timeline if I have posted and have some control over it, I will call it out.  Even if I do not have control and it is not on my timeline, I will call it out.  I have done so in the past and I will do again.  In more recent times, it was to do with a disgraceful article written about the appearance of certain female politicians.  The Minister may remember that case.  We have a responsibility to call out abuse, including abuse of journalists.  </p> <p> I mentioned what happened in the United States for this reason.  Donald Trump created a toxic culture that the media were the enemy of the people. That was a very dangerous and deliberate tactic on his part to turn a section of the electorate that he saw as his base against the media so that no matter what he did or what wrong was done, the media were the enemy.  That is how he wanted his supporters to perceive the media.  We can never allow that to happen in this State.  We have to protect freedom of expression and a free media and defend journalists, who are not perfect as they will admit.  Sometimes we have robust exchanges with people in the media in the cut and thrust of politics but we should always call out abuse when we see it.  Equally, we have a responsibility to deal with discrimination and discrimination occurred in this case.</p> <p> The Minister, in her statement, notes that "As a Government, it is important that we take account of the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming and content they wish to broadcast".  I accept, of course, that that is their prerogative.  Broadcasters are perfectly entitled to decide what topic they will discuss and who they will have on their programmes.  No political entity should seek to interfere in that, whether with regard to the national broadcaster or any private broadcaster.  We can have our view and engage in discussions but we certainly do not have a right to dictate to any journalist what he or she can do.</p> <p> The Minister's statement continues: &ldquo;It is a long-established principle that a decision about who should be invited or not invited to appear on Irish radio or television programmes is solely a matter for individual broadcasters.&rdquo;  I also agree with that.  However, the Minister also states: &ldquo;As the Bill could constrain broadcasters' freedom of action on decisions regarding inclusion or exclusion from programming content, the implications of the Bill in the context of freedom of expression would require further research".  I do not agree with that statement because what happened in the case we are talking about was pure and blatant discrimination.  We, as an Oireachtas, agreed - and I believe the Minister&rsquo;s party leader signed the relevant letter - that it was blatant discrimination.  We have a responsibility to deal with it and to ensure it does not happen again.  </p> <p>To be helpful, a Cheann Comhairle, I will oppose the amendment but I will not call a vote.  I would like the Minister, on another occasion, perhaps in private, to communicate to me over the next 18 months how this Bill or its intent can be progressed in order that we can bring about the changes which are necessary.</p></speech>
