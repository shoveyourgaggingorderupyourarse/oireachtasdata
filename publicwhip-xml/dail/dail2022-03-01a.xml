C&aacute;inimid na gn&iacute;omhartha sin go hioml&aacute;n.</p>  <p>  I reiterate on my own behalf and that of my party our total and unwavering solidarity with the people of Ukraine at this deeply distressing and traumatic time for their country.  We once again condemn unreservedly the actions of the Russian Government in violating Ukraine's sovereignty and internationally recognised borders, its attacks against Ukrainian people, property and infrastructure, and its initiation of a humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.  The invasion of Ukraine and the military assault we have witnessed are a criminal affront to the civilised world and a threat to the peace and security of people everywhere.</p>  <p>  The Irish people have been appalled at the heartbreaking scenes of civilians being killed, being injured and fleeing their homes for their lives.  Communities across our country are now actively working to assist in the humanitarian response.  I believe I speak for all Deputies in the D&aacute;il when I say we are united in our condemnation of the actions of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.  Any attempt by Putin or his regime to justify his actions as a response to NATO are without foundation and are merely a means of distraction from his own culpability.  It is his military aggression that is bringing death and destruction to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  The international community has an obligation through diplomacy, support for Ukraine and strong sanctions against the Russian Federation to bring about a peaceful resolution to stop this horrific war and to see all Russian forces leave Ukraine.  Ireland must be a voice for peace, justice and freedom in the world.</p> <p>Will the Taoiseach agree with me that Ireland, more than most, understands the impact of occupation and imperialist aggression, that we deeply value the principles of national sovereignty and the right of all people to self-determination, that Ireland also understands the importance and difficulty in finding peace through dialogue and diplomacy and that our status as a neutral state, with no colonial baggage and an independent foreign policy, has allowed us to play a valuable and honourable role in peacekeeping and conflict resolution around the world and in the battle against nuclear proliferation?  Now, as a member of the United Nations Security Council, we must do everything we can to end this unjust war and force complete Russian military withdrawal.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach outline how he intends to intensify sanctions in order to ensure a Russian withdrawal and the right of Ukraine to a peaceful future as a sovereign independent state?  I ask him to update the D&aacute;il on the efforts of the Government, as a member of the UN Security Council, to ensure an urgent response to what is a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.</p></speech>

No one in this House or anywhere else should be under any illusions about the seriousness of the situation Europe and the world faces right now, this afternoon.  Vladimir Putin, who is a bully and a thug, has unleashed an unprovoked and unjustifiable war on the people of Ukraine, committing war crimes in the process, as we are witnessing.  As President Zelensky said most movingly to the European Parliament this morning, every day now in Ukraine is someone's last day.  I was very struck both by the contribution he made there and, indeed, to the European Heads of State last Thursday at the European Council, when he said to us it might be the last day he would speak to us because he is number one on the list, along with his family.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to comprehend.  A week ago, it would have been unimaginable to see what we are witnessing now: a 40-mile-long convoy of Russian troops and heavy military equipment grinding their way towards Kyiv, where children and their families take shelter in the underground.  Just hours ago, Liberty Square in Kharkiv was devastated by a missile strike.  As President Zelensky said, it is a city where there are up to 20 universities and the area is frequented by thousands of young students in the full expression of freedom of choice, expression and so forth.  Residential neighbourhoods in cities all over Ukraine, where ordinary, decent people were going about their normal lives, are today facing barrages of illegal cluster munitions, which we, well over a decade ago, worked as a country to ban in an international treaty.  Caithimid deireadh a chur leis an gcogadh seo.  Caithfidh Vladimir Putin deireadh a chur leis an bhfor&eacute;igean agus leis na hionsaithe uaf&aacute;sacha ar leana&iacute; na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine agus ar theaghlaigh &eacute;ags&uacute;la ar fud na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine because what we are witnessing is scarcely believable but it is very real for the people of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Our response, I agree, must, therefore, be unprecedented and it has been unprecedented.  Over the past ten years, and certainly since 2014, I have been arguing and debating in this House about the consistent violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity by Russia.  Now it has reached an appalling stage in terms of an all-out assault on Ukraine and the Ukrainian people and territory.  Before leaving for Brussels last week for the emergency European Council, I said I wanted to see the most comprehensive and widest set of sanctions deployed by the European Union.  That has happened in respect of the sanctions that have now been put in place by the EU, along with the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan and others.  I have been very heartened by the unprecedented commitment to humanitarian care and support for Ukrainians.  I believe the European Union genuinely has responded with absolute solidarity with Ukraine and with absolute speed in its response in terms of the unprecedented scale of sanctions that have been deployed, in particular, the sanctions against the Central Bank of Russia in terms of it not being in a position to access its European and foreign reserves, Russian banks being locked out of the SWIFT mechanism, the listing of key individuals who are part of the coterie of leadership around Vladimir Putin and much more in terms of the industrial base of Russia.</p> <p>It is an extraordinary package of sanctions that people did not believe would happen.  Ireland did not hesitate to facilitate the deployment of the European peace facility and &euro;500 million to assist people in Ukraine, Ireland's support being in terms of non-lethal weapons.</p> <p> The biggest challenge facing the country is that we must be very, very generous in the refugee crisis that will undoubtedly flow as a result of this war.  It will be beyond anything we have comprehended before.  I have said to my colleagues in government and the Departments that we must put to one side what we might have considered to be the norms in responding in a humanitarian way to the plight of the Ukrainian people.  The Secretary General of my Department is convening with other Secretaries General and Government Ministers to make sure we scale up the response in the context of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding before our eyes.</p></speech>

They have launched an all-out offensive against a sovereign people and they have, as the Taoiseach has correctly said, committed war crimes on the watch of the international community.  We need to see an intensification of this package of sanctions.  Vladimir Putin, and all others who might choose to violate international law and brutalise people, need to understand that the international community can and will put our foot down.  I support the Taoiseach&rsquo;s call for generosity towards those fleeing war and conflict.  We must extend the most generous of Irish receptions to those people and families.  I want to go back to the economic sanctions and to invite the Taoiseach to set out how we might deepen them, not least in respect of the Russian banking system and the SWIFT system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100005#C00300"><p>We have witnessed the severest form of sanction of the Russian banking system, particularly in the Central Bank of Russia being denied access and being frozen out of accessing its reserves, which is unprecedented.  Furthermore, financial transactions with many Russian banks and companies have been prohibited.  That means it is very difficult for Russia to sell exports and to buy imports on international markets, which will be significant.  European Union banks are prohibited from accepting deposits over a certain amount from Russian individuals and, as I said, the European assets of the Central Bank of Russia have been frozen, restricting its ability to prop up the value of the Russian rouble.  Many Russian banks are excluded from the SWIFT payment network and that will hamper Russia&rsquo;s ability to trade with the outside world, particularly the major global economies.  The sanctions are already having an effect, with the Russian rouble crashing to record lows on foreign exchange markets.  Russian purchasing power in international markets has also dropped and inflation in Russia is likely to rise significantly.  The Central Bank of Russia has been forced to hike interest rates from 9% to 20% to prop up the currency.  Interest rates at these levels, if sustained, will severely damage the Russian economy.  Russia&rsquo;s stockmarkets are shut and there are signs of increased stress in the Russian banking system, with media reports of long queues at ATMs.  Some analysts have predicted that the stress on the system could lead to a run on Russian banks.</p>  <p>  We have to be in for the long haul, which is a phrase that was used consistently last Thursday evening.  Vladimir Putin has fundamentally altered the multilateral rules-based order that characterised international behaviours since the end of the Cold War.</p> <p>It is that fundamental and will cause reflection all over the world and within Europe in terms of how we respond to that and how we endeavour to restore some stability to the multilateral rules-based order to which we subscribe as a country.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Russians used cluster bombs in a densely-populated civilian neighbourhood of Kharkhiv.  This kind of indiscriminate attack is clearly designed to maximise civilian casualties.  I know the Taoiseach will agree with me that this is the definition of a war crime.  Today, a military convoy extends for 60 km and inches its way closer to Kyiv.  It is clear Kyiv will soon be under siege with massive invading armies surrounding the city.  The people of Kyiv, who are watching this on satellite images as a convoy approaches must be experiencing unimaginable fear.</p><p>Ireland is a neutral country but, as has been said before and as I will say again, this does not mean we are neutral on the invasion of Ukraine, which is a sovereign country and nor does it mean we cannot act.  I welcome the Government's lifting of visa restrictions and donation of humanitarian relief which have been announced in recent days.  However, we have been slow to act against the Russians in the past.</p><p>It has long been reported, including by John Mooney, that the Russian Embassy in Dublin is being used as a base for espionage operations across Europe.  This was confirmed when the Government used legislation to block a proposed expansion of the embassy, on security grounds in 2020.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, suggested that Russian diplomats or some operatives who are in Ireland and may not be diplomats could be expelled in coming days.  Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House whether this means that the Government has identified spies among the Russian Embassy staff who are about to be expelled?</p><p>The economic sanctions announced by the EU over the weekend are wide ranging and significant and must be welcomed.  However, Colm Keena, in <i>The Irish Times</i>, has reported how one Russian company, subjected to previous sanctions in 2014, was able to bypass them and access Western capital markets using a company registered in Ireland.  We know that tens of billions in Russian money has been funnelled through Ireland using financial services operations in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and entities called limited partnerships.</p><p>One of the attractions of limited partnerships is that there is no requirement to disclose publicly by whom they are really owned.  If the ownership of these entities is shrouded in mystery, how can Ireland ensure sanctions will be properly applied?  Will the Taoiseach confirm what the Government intends to do to close any loopholes and ensure there is no place for dirty money to hide in this country?</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of civilians have already fled Ukraine and the number of refugees could soon reach the millions.  Will the Taoiseach outline the practical steps Ireland will take to ensure refugees can easily get from Poland and other eastern European countries to Ireland and to safety?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100006#D00300"><p>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy on the appalling attack and war being raged against the Ukrainian people by Vladimir Putin and the Russian leadership.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of Russian people do not support this war.</p>  <p>  In terms of the diplomatic issue, first, anything we do should be in consort with our European partners.  European strength and unity of purpose are very important in respect of responding to Russia.  That has been a hallmark, so far, of the European Union's response, working with the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and other countries that hold up democratic and universal principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and freedom of speech and movement.  Those are fundamental values.  We share those values with other countries.  Those countries are uniting in opposing what the Russian leadership is doing.</p>  <p>  In respect of the ambassadorial issue and diplomatic channels, no country is proposing the expulsion of any ambassador so far.</p> <p>Our view is that it is important from a practical point of view in looking after our citizens either in Russia or Ukraine that we keep all channels open right now.  We have a limited presence in the embassy in Moscow with six individuals all told.  They have a fundamental function to look after Irish citizens in Russia and also to articulate our views and keep abreast of what is happening within that jurisdiction and different jurisdictions.  I am very conscious of that.</p> <p> While I understand fully the revulsion and anger towards how the Russian ambassador has spoken on this war, nonetheless, we have to keep cool heads, hold our nerve and keep the fundamentals in front of us all the time in terms of looking after Irish citizens, in particular.</p> <p> On the IFSC, entities in the financial services sector in Ireland are within scope of the sanction measures agreed unanimously by the 27 EU member states.  All natural and legal persons in the State are obliged to comply with the European Union sanctions.  A breach of financial sanctions is a criminal offence.  Accounts, funds or other assets must be frozen without delay so that they cannot be made available directly or indirectly to the sanctioned person, entity or body.  The sanctions include a prohibition on the listing and provision of services on EU trading venues, including Euronext Dublin, which was formerly the Irish Stock Exchange, in relation to shares of Russian state-owned entities.</p> <p> The Central Bank of Ireland has undertaken an initial review of any links between the approximately 3,000 Irish domiciled special purpose entities and Russian entities.  Some 34 of these 3,000 entities have a Russian sponsor, meaning that they were established on behalf of a Russian company.  The total assets of these special purpose entities is approximately &euro;36 billion, largely comprised of loans to Russian companies.  Of these 34 entities, three have been identified as being directly linked to individuals or financial institutions covered in the 23 February round of EU sanctions.  Work is ongoing in respect of the subsequent sanction rounds.</p> <p> With regard to authorised investment funds, the Central Bank has advised that total Russian assets held at 31 December 2021 are estimated at &euro;11.4 billion or 0.3% of the total Irish fund assets of &euro;3.8 trillion.</p></speech>

The Irish collective asset management vehicle, ICAV, unit trusts, common contractual funds and investment limited partnerships are subject to beneficial ownership registration requirements to enhance transparency and help combat money laundering activities.

With regard to the limited partnerships, it has been demonstrated that a Russian company previously subjected to the sanctions in 2014 was able to overcome them by having a registered company in Ireland.</p>  <p>  It will be really important that if there are loopholes to be closed and legislation to be produced in that regard, it needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  We do not want to look back in retrospect and see that there was a way around this.  I am hopeful that the Taoiseach will give us an assurance that there will be comprehensive consideration of this.</p>  <p>  I also asked the Taoiseach about the practical steps regarding people arriving into Eastern European countries across the border from Ukraine.  What practical steps are there to make it easy to get from Poland and other Eastern European jurisdictions to Ireland for people who wish to make that journey?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100007#E00700"><p>We will do everything we can to ensure compliance with the sanctions.  We have no interest - none, zero - in enabling any Russian oligarch or to be more specific anyone who is part the sanctions' list, either to evade or avoid being fully accountable to that sanctions regime.  We have no interest as a country in protecting anybody in that regard.  I have to be crystal clear about that.  We will do and are doing whatever it takes, with the Central Bank, to facilitate full compliance with sanctions.</p> <p>As I said, it is a criminal offence to endeavour to evade these sanctions or to facilitate the avoidance or evasion of these economic and financial sanctions. </p> <p> This morning, we went further in the European Union.  Justice and home affairs ministers will meet on Thursday to ratify this.  Understandably, we are making very liberal plans for Ukrainian people who are fleeing Ukraine to come to this country and to any European country.  They will be able to stay here under the temporary protection mechanism for quite a considerable length of time.  They will have access to our social protection system, housing and the education system.  This will involve a levelling up in terms of the humanitarian response in this country.  We will work with countries closer to the border of Ukraine and on the border of Ukraine in respect of burden sharing across the European Union to contribute our fair share and to facilitate logistically transfers of people to Ireland where that would be required.</p></speech>

Julia Marciniak, who is originally from Poland, and Lenka Laiermanova, who is originally from the Czech Republic, were found to have been sacked by the Ivy restaurant on Dawson Street for trade union activity.  These two experienced waitresses joined the newly opened Ivy restaurant in 2018.  They found that customer tips were being taken by management and were being used to make up the difference between their contracted wages and the minimum wage.  After Lenka contacted me through my constituency office, I arranged for her and for a group of her fellow workers to meet the trade union Unite, which they joined.  It sought negotiation rights with the Ivy, which were rejected.</p><p>It is quite rare for an unfair dismissal case over trade union activity to be won in the Labour Court and the case has a wider significance.  That significance is that while the Unfair Dismissals Act only kicks in after one year of work with a specific employer, there are exceptions to this, one of which is trade union activity.  However, that one-year rule gives some employers and managers a licence to dismiss workers on a whim.  As Julia said to <i>The Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;if you ask about your breaks, you can be dismissed.  See ya!&rdquo;  Both Julia and Lenka, as well as Unite&rsquo;s regional secretary, Brendan Ogle, have called for the Act to be amended to give all workers protection against unfair dismissal from day one of their employment.</p><p>The other aspect of this is that there is no penalty under the Act for employers that are found to have unfairly dismissed staff.  All the Labour Court can do is make an employer pay for loss of earnings for up to two years after an unfair dismissal.  As both Julia and Lenka found work and new jobs very quickly, the compensation to be paid by the Ivy is quite limited.  There should be penalties against employers that are found to have unfairly dismissed workers.</p><p>Finally, will the Taoiseach join me in congratulating Julia and Lenka and their trade union, Unite, on this victory over a very exploitive, bullying employer, as well as encouraging all workers who are suffering low pay, who are being bullied by employers and managers and are being denied their rights under labour law to join a union and to stand up for themselves and their workmates?  When you act together with the backing of your union, you can win.  </p></speech>

I pay tribute to two workers concerned.  To go to an unfair dismissal tribunal is not an easy journey.  It can be a very challenging one for young workers.  I pay tribute to them for seeing that through.  On the specifics of the case, the Deputy is saying that the tips were essentially being retained or kept or were being used part of wages, which is an absolutely unacceptable practice.  There is separate work being done by the Government in relation to that.  In my view, that is reprehensible and wrong; if that was what transpired here.</p>  <p>  I also should say to the Deputy that under the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, discussions are under way between trade union leadership, employer leadership and the Government in respect of collective bargaining more generally.  We have freedom of association in the country under the Constitution.  That governs the relationship between the employer and the employees. </p> <p>It is not as simple to resolve as one might think, but serious negotiations are under way in respect of it through LEEF.  Equally, in my view, employees should always feel entitled to raise issues without being punished for doing so by employers as a basic code of conduct that has to apply in employer-employee relations.  If the Deputy has specific proposals in the context of labour relations reforms that are being contemplated and how they can be improved to enhance the rights of workers and facilitate the smooth operation of collective bargaining in worker-employer relations, I will certainly discuss them with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100009#G00200"><p>I thank the Taoiseach for joining me in congratulating those workers.  As he said, it was a very high bar, and there is no other case we know of in Ireland in which an unfair dismissal dispute over trade union activity has been won.  The unfair dismissals legislation should be amended to give all workers protection from unfair dismissal from day one of their employment, not just after 12 months, which is much too long.  We must also deal with the issue whereby there is no penalty under the Act for employers that are found to have unfairly dismissed a worker.  There is also the issue of trade union recognition, which the Taoiseach mentioned, and the right of a union to access the premises of its members, another crucial issue that has to be addressed.</p>  <p>  The Payment of Wages (Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Bill 2022 is going through Committee Stage at the moment.  It partly addresses the issue of employers robbing employees of tips but it must deal with the issue of service charges, which have to go.  The Ivy restaurant still applies a 12.5% service charge to all tables.  It is used to pay wages and to supplement business income.  An owner-manager of a bar-restaurant in Connemara says service charges should be abolished and I concur.  Does the Taoiseach agree?</p></speech>

In any event, there should be full and absolute transparency governing them.  Many people are under the impression that when they pay a service charge, it goes to workers and that is not the case in many instances.  We need absolute transparency.  Ideally, the consumer should hand tips directly to the employee, or to a group of employees, however those mechanisms can be facilitated, as an additional contribution if he or she is so minded.  That needs to be absolutely clarified and in the context of the legislation going through the House, the T&aacute;naiste is anxious to clarify that and make it as transparent and simplified as possible in respect of the reality on the ground.</p>  <p>  In respect of amendments to the Unfair Dismissals Act, a balance has to be struck between competing rights, practical issues with employment and so forth.  Again, that is a matter we keep under constant review.  Trade union activity in itself should not be the subject matter of a dismissal.</p></speech>

There are currently 3,521 people on approved housing lists waiting for housing in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  Rents in the county were on average 7.7% higher in the final three months of 2020 than they had been one year previously.  The national average listed rent is now &euro;908, up 61% from its lowest point.  The property rental crisis is now at its worst point in more than a decade, with so limited a supply of housing.  Tipperary County Council - agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag obair air seo - is meeting its Rebuilding Ireland targets for 2021 and is expected to exceed its targets this year, but that is simply not sufficient to meet the demand.</p> <p>Tipperary County Council delivered 840 units between 2018 and 2021 and aims to meet its new-build target of 230 units between now and the year end.  Unfortunately, these targets will go nowhere near to address the acute problem that is there.</p> <p> My office and, indeed, many other offices are inundated with people desperately seeking housing.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na daoine ag obair i m&rsquo;oifig f&eacute;in freisin.  People are desperate.  These are families who are currently living in homes where the landlord is selling up and they cannot find alternative accommodation, applicants approved for housing but who cannot find accommodation under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, returning Irish emigrants who cannot find accommodation in their local areas to rent or buy and young couples - this is a big bone of contention - who have sites but who are being refused planning permission and cannot find accommodation to rent or buy either.</p> <p> There is also a serious disconnect in respect of the current income limits to qualify for social housing in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann.  The Tipperary County Council cap is &euro;25,000 for a single person and &euro;27,500 for an average family of two adults and two children - a figure that has not been reviewed since 2011.  I am calling on the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet to review this immediately.  It is causing a considerable problem, especially when we see that an average four-bedroom house in the county costs approximately &euro;2,100 per month to rent, meaning that a family with an income of &euro;28,000 is expected to pay 51% of their income on rent without any assistance.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin uaf&aacute;sach ar fad.  In the face of the significant increase in rent in the county and across the country, as well as the considerable increases in the cost of living, these limits are wholly inappropriate and need to be reviewed urgently.  I reiterate I am calling on the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and on the Government as a whole, to act here.  We keep talking and having aspirations and good intentions but they are not being delivered.  People cannot afford or they cannot get HAP.  There are people sleeping in tents beside the River Suir in the beautiful Cluain Meala and I meet them on the street.  I am sure other Deputies also do so in all the counties.  The policies that the Government has, with not cutting timber and the insulation costs as a result of oil prices and carbon taxes, are driving up the cost of building.  We are in a perfect storm.  We need action and we need it now.</p></speech>

The issues concerning housing in Tipperary are ones that are reflected across the entire country.  The only response to it is a sustainable comprehensive one, which is what the Government has provided in the form of Housing for All.</p>  <p>  Housing for All provides a comprehensive set of measures and targets with financial backing to increase housing supply.  That is the most fundamental thing we can do in relation to the housing situation, which is difficult and challenging for many people, particularly the scarcity of supply.</p>  <p>  Basically, Housing for All is committing to the creation on average of 33,000 homes per annum over the lifetime of the plan.  We have had setbacks with Covid-19 in 2020 and 2021, in terms of the lockdowns which slowed down construction in housing, but there has been a very significant rebound since then, with 31,000 commencements in the year to January 2022, which is a 48.4% increase year on year.  That is the highest rolling 12-month total since comparable data were first published.  Construction of 1,861 homes commenced in January 2022.  That figure is up 35% on January 2021.</p>  <p>  Approximately 20,400 houses were completed in 2021, while the number of apartments completed increased by over 30% for the year.  Progress is being made and we have got to make much, much more.  It really is about supply on the house construction side, and then a variety of offers to people including affordable housing, in terms of the local authorities supporting affordable housing with State backing, social housing, of which we want to construct up to 10,000 annual with the approved social housing bodies and the local authorities, cost rental, which will be increasingly more significant as an option for people and we want to develop a critical mass of supply on the cost rental front, as well as giving supports to help to buy through the shared equity scheme to young first-time buyers.  Last year, approximately 46,000 homes were purchased, with over 30% of these being bought by first-time buyers.</p> <p>Approximately 40,000 planning permissions were granted up to quarter 3 in 2021.</p> <p> HAP is a huge provision from the State.  At the end of quarter 3 in 2021, over 97,500 HAP tenancies had been set up since the scheme commenced.  This comprises more than 62,000 households actively in receipt of HAP support and over 33,400 separate landlords and agents providing accommodation to households supported by the scheme.  Budget 2022 allocated &euro;585 million in Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme.  That will enable a further projected 14,000 households to be supported, in addition to the supports to existing recipients.</p> <p> There are facilities whereby each local authority has statutory discretion to agree to a HAP payment of up to 20% above the prescribed maximum rent limit to secure appropriate accommodation for a household that requires it.</p></speech>

Billions have been spent on it which should have been used to build houses.  We need to get off that particular road, an b&oacute;thar uaf&aacute;sach, as I said.  The situation is desperate.  While the Government talks of great intentions, when it comes to building houses we need further immediate action for young people, na daoine &oacute;ga.  Many of the Government's policies, especially since the Taoiseach hitched up in a marriage or threesome with the Greens, are leading directly to a limited supply.  Young couples who want to build on their own land cannot get planning permission.  The Government will not let them cut a cip&iacute;n not to mind a tree.  Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmad?  It is so sad.  Then there is the price of building.  We do not have enough apprentices.  The Taoiseach referred to starts.  Are there ESB connections?  Is it when everything is finished and the ESB has approved the turning on of the electricity?  The Government is playing with people's lives here and playing with figures.  Builders cannot get tradesmen or supplies.  A young couple, or any couple, cannot get a quotation for less than a week now because building suppliers will not give it to them, because they cannot due to the escalating costs.  It is backwards we are going.  The sense of meitheal, t&aacute; s&eacute; imithe.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin.</p></speech>

We need to have a frank and honest debate here about the provision of energy.  At present, we are importing coal from Russia and Europe is importing gas from Russia and we are then talking about sanctioning Russia.  We need to have a frank and honest debate here about the provision of energy into the future.  We need to be able to buy gas from other entities like the United States and places like that which might be inclined to sell it to us, and not leave the people stranded without electricity.  They closed Bord na M&oacute;na and put nothing in its place.  Shannon can provide an LNG terminal that would not cost the State one cent and it would be another option for us.  Gas is much cleaner than coal, and the Taoiseach will have to admit that, yet he seems to be against it.  He is making no attempt.  He allowed his Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, the man tasked with providing energy for the country, to make a submission against this worthwhile project.</p></speech>

There has been a reasonable request for additional speaking time and, today, a number of us emailed that time should be set aside on Thursday.  The Government could facilitate this, not the debate tomorrow night which is 100 minutes.  We are asking for another 35 minutes.

It would expand our proceeds of crime legislation, which established the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, to capture the ill-gotten goods of oligarchs, officials and anybody else involved in human rights abuses.  It is a signal that this House should give.  I ask that the Taoiseach reflect on that and provide time so that all parties which supported the Bill on Second Stage could enact it this week.</p></speech>

Only 55% of the staff of three new teams promised for 2021 have been recruited and less than one third of available funding has been invested since 2016.  According to a freedom of information request, there is no implementation plan for the recruitment and training of staff despite the HSE previously stating in a response to a parliamentary question from me that there was a plan in place.  Many people have to go to the UK for treatment and are forced to spend thousands for private care.  Those who cannot afford to travel or get private care do not get that care.</p> <p>Eating disorders are incredibly serious as they are the psychiatric condition most associated with mortality.  I have been raising this issue for more than a year now and despite continued assurance from the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Ministers of State at the Department of Health, there has been worryingly little progress.  What will the Government do to address this?</p></speech>

This is eating disorder week.  Last year, 504 people were referred to eating disorder teams.  When the clinical programme was put in place in 2018, there was an assumption, judging by the correspondence and data the teams had, that approximately 60 people would be referred to eating disorder teams.  That number was, in fact, 504, which was an increase of 120%.</p>  <p>  I met yesterday with Dr. Michelle Clifford, who is the clinical director for eating disorders-----</p></speech>

However, the T&aacute;naiste's comments have nothing to do with solidarity with the Ukrainian people.  It is a cynical and opportunistic move to push an agenda by the T&aacute;naiste, an agenda Fine Gael has held for quite some time, of aligning Irish foreign policy more closely with the EU and NATO, taking steps towards making the EU a military power and massively increasing the Irish State's expenditure on arms.

Europe's security architecture is an issue from which we cannot escape.  The Deputy said last week that European and NATO leaders are warmongers.  We now know that to be completely not the case.

I have no doubt that Ireland will produce more than enough food to feed itself but I am less confident about Europe, particularly given the lack of supply from Ukraine, which is the bread basket of Europe.</p>  <p>  To ward off a horrible scenario whereby Irish consumers cannot afford the cost of food in Ireland, like other European consumers, will the Government intervene by bulk buying fertiliser, subventing it or putting price caps in place?

It is policy that retirement age is currently 66 at Bus &Eacute;ireann but part-time school bus drivers and drivers nominated by the private operators as school bus drivers may continue in this role subject to completing an annual medical examination up to the age of 70.

During the course of the consideration of that issue, careful consideration must also be given to the suitability of the site at St. John's Hospital, Limerick, which has the space, expertise and track record to make this an outstanding success.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the provision of a State hospital, provided by the State on State lands, is infinitely preferable to what is being mooted by the HSE at present, which is some type of public private partnership with a controversial American outfit?</p></speech>

We should not complicate these issues.  God knows that to get a health facility built takes an ordinate length of time, as we know from the various hospitals under construction, at planning or where there is a row before they even get off the ground.  My view on elective hospitals is that where we have State land, we should get on with it.</p></speech>

Dealgan House is the only nursing home in the country that was taken over by the HSE.  The families of the residents there, or a representative of them, would like to be invited to any such event.  On 25 January, I called in the D&aacute;il for a commission of inquiry into the 23 deaths that occurred there.  The Taoiseach acknowledged that this is a genuine issue and said the Department of Health is finding a way in which it can best respect and meet the needs and concerns of the families.

We need increased Garda resources and youth and community resources.  The Talk about Youth project on Pearse Street, for example, has no dedicated youth space from which to work.

The Minister of State who is responsible for this area is in the Chamber.  Young people who live with autism have limited access to dental services and are subject to many sensory issues.  This means the dentists who look after them need to be specifically and highly trained.  In Dublin South-Central, there is one such dentist for the entire constituency, which results in parents having to access very painful treatments for their children privately, which costs a fortune.  Is the Minister of State aware of the lack of specifically trained dentists for young people living with autism and will she address the issue?</p></speech>

There have been difficulties in terms of the discussion so far.  The HSE and the Department are anxious to provide that allocation and have an interim resolution of this ongoing dispute, which is not to the advantage of people who want to access the service.</p></speech>

In my view, there has been a lot of meddling and manipulation going on in the geopolitical world.  We saw that, for instance, with vaccines.  It is interesting that Russia was offering Sputnik to various countries in the western Balkans, notwithstanding that it had not vaccinated its own population to any significant degree.  It was doing so for geopolitical reasons, namely, to court favour with certain countries.  In my view, the application processes for some countries have gone too slowly.  I instance North Macedonia and Albania, which have made huge progress.

More than 600 families are in that situation, with 227 awaiting further services.  An internal review of these highly unsatisfactory waiting lists for the home care service in Wexford was conducted in November 2021.  People in Wexford are very concerned about not knowing the overall context of that report.  The south east community healthcare organisation, CHO, held a governance meeting in February to decide what resources were to be allocated to deal with this issue.  In the interests of the families desperately awaiting these services, will the Taoiseach ensure the Minister for Health provides details of this resources allocation and that the HSE produces a copy of the report immediately?</p></speech>

In order to ensure my Department remains agile in responding to emerging priorities, its staffing resources are kept under ongoing review.  At present, there are 223.8 whole-time equivalent staff employed across the Department.  The majority are assigned to the following main divisions of the Department: international, European Union and Northern Ireland division, including the shared island unit; economic division; social policy and public services reform division; protocol and civic policy division; Government secretariat; and corporate affairs division.  The remainder are assigned to private offices, constituency offices, the Government information service and internal audit.</p> <p>The highest-paid civil servant in my Department serves as both Secretary to the Government and as Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach.  He is paid at the Secretary General 1 level and his current salary is &euro;215,998.  Civil Service salary scales apply to staff employed in my Department as set out in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's most recent pay circular published on <i>www.gov.ie</i>.

The CEO of the HSE is paid more than the Taoiseach, five times more than the President of India, twice the amount the President of France; more than the Prime Ministers of Britain and Canada, more than the President of the USA and more than the Chancellor of Germany.  Would the Taoiseach agree that the wages of top civil servants should be proportional to their performance and productivity?</p>  <p>  If he agrees with this, surely there needs to be some reduction in the wages of these civil servants when one looks at what is happening within much of the public service at present.  There is the Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, scandal, the national children&rsquo;s hospital overspend, the failure of the CervicalCheck tribunal etc.  Why are we paying such high wages to certain civil servants when they are in charge of so many scandals?  The Taoiseach mentioned a wage of &euro;215,998 per annum and that is a lottery win for most people on the average wage in this country.  There is a chasm between the experience of most ordinary citizens in this country and the largesse that is experienced by many within the upper echelons of the Civil Service.  I call on the Taoiseach to make sure that chasm is closed, that the multiple of earnings at the top compared to the bottom is reduced and that there is some level of productivity and performance in the salaries.  That is the experience of practically everybody else earning an income in this country.  Why is it not the case in the Government and the Civil Service?</p></speech>

Last month, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform told an Oireachtas committee of his intention to establish an independent review panel to advise on senior public sector appointments and corresponding salaries.  The need for this panel is a direct consequences of the opaque method by which the Government appointed the Secretary General to the Department of Health last year and the Government party leaders&rsquo; decision to attach an arbitrary 40% pay increase to that position.  Can the Taoiseach confirm if this independent review panel has been established and can he tell us what its remit is?  Who has been appointed to carry out this work and when is the panel due to conclude its work?  Following the Minister&rsquo;s attendance at last month&rsquo;s committee meeting, Government leaks to the media indicated that the work of the review panel might result in the final tranche of pay restoration for senior public servants being deferred or cancelled.  Will the planned pay restoration in July proceed as agreed or has the Government put this agreement on hold until after the review panel completes its work?</p></speech>

He stated &ldquo;While I would rather there was a much more scientific process for all of these things, there is not.&rdquo;  Some &euro;81,000 extra was given to Mr. Watt, more than the vast majority of workers earn in a whole year as a regular wage, not a pay increase, and with no scientific process for it.  We hear that further pay increases of 10% to 15% may possibly be given to those earning over &euro;150,000 in July but that they may be postponed.  How can the Taoiseach justify such pay increases for highly-paid officials while most ordinary workers are getting below-inflation pay increases?  Instead of pay rises for those at the top, should we not have a maximum pay in the public sector and instead have above-inflation pay rises for ordinary workers in both the private and public sectors?</p></speech>

How can the Government justify that when at the same time it is willing to stand over the fact that ordinary workers in the health service, in education and in local authorities are held down to 1% or 2% pay increases when inflation is running at 5%?  Following a briefing at the Department of Finance today, the breaking news is that the Department is estimating that as a result of the situation in Ukraine and the decision to impose sanctions, we are looking at 7% inflation for the coming year.  Working people are being hammered with the rising cost of living, which will go up further, yet the Government will keep their pay increases at 1% or 2%.  Would workers not be right to put in pay claims to insist they get pay increases at least to the level of the cost of living and inflation increases that are being inflicted on them?</p></speech>

It is objectively regarded as a progressive taxation system.  The Deputy referred to performance and productivity and I am a strong admirer of the Irish public service and have been for a long time.  That is notwithstanding weaknesses, flaws and uneven performance at times but if one looks at the evolution of the Irish State over the last 50 or 60 years or even from its foundation, one has to objectively say that the country has made a lot of progress.  Some 100 years on from 1922 survival rates in health have dramatically improved and we have gained 25 years in lifespan over that 100 years.  In the past 20 years, survival from cardiovascular disease have dramatically improved.  Survival from cancer, on foot of oncology, has dramatically improved.  National accident strategies have dramatically lowered rates of mortality on our roads and in workplaces-----</p></speech>

While there is no doubt but that lessons can be learned from that, if one looks at the vaccination programme alone, it was one of the best vaccination programmes administered in the world, which dramatically protected Irish people from losing their lives, becoming severely ill or being hospitalised.  That was not achieved on fresh air or without a competent public service behind it.</p> <p>The Deputy first listed a number of areas in which things could without doubt have been done better but he should equally have shown the full balance sheet, in that some very significant work was undertaken by Irish public servants.  We do not affirm that enough in this House.  It is important to affirm, as well as to criticise and be negative.</p> <p> The other key area and this is all happening in real time, is Brexit, which we had just before Covid.  If one looks at the situation in the United Kingdom in respect of Brexit, compared to the preparation in the Republic, one would have to say that Revenue, social protection, various Departments and our ports authorities have responded well and efficiently.  Maybe they could do better in some respects but, overall, Brexit was a considerable potential issue for us as an economy and a society and we have managed to deal with it-----</p></speech>

The most effective way to tackle high salaries is the income tax system, which is progressive in this country.  It basically means that when one gets to a certain level, approximately 50% is taxed.  That rarely gets said in the debate but it is the reality.  That relates both to USC, which is especially harsh or strong on those on very high incomes, and to higher income tax rates.  That is the most effective in terms of redistribution of income from higher salary earners and is a more effective way of doing things.</p>  <p>  With regard to Civil Service renewal, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has indicated he will undertake a comprehensive review of all of the issues around Civil Service recruitment and pay.  He proposes the establishment of an external review panel to make recommendations to strengthen the recruitment processes of senior public service posts and the process for determining the terms and conditions of employment.  To ensure transparency and objectivity in the process, it is proposed that the panel will consist of three members from different relevant backgrounds with secretarial support to be provided by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently examining the issues and will recommend terms of reference, scope of the review and potential membership of the review panel.</p>  <p>  This Oireachtas, in previous iterations, already passed financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The process of unwinding the financial emergency legislation commenced under the Lansdowne Road agreement between unions and employers and the State, which covered the period 2016 to 2018, with the remainder of the process largely completed under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  The final elements of pay restoration have continued under Building Momentum, a new public service agreement for 2021 to 2022.  Salary rebates up to &euro;150,000, which account for 99% of the public service, have been fully restored.  Section 20 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 states that the Minister, by order, shall provide for completion of pay restoration to public servants paid an annual basic salary of more than &euro;150,000 by 1 July 2022.</p>  <p>  In light of the consideration now being given to an external review to examine the processes and procedures around the recruitment of senior public servants, as well as the process for pay determination at senior levels, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently examining potential options around how and when this final element of restoration will be implemented.  As restoration is provided for in legislation, this will require careful consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

The NESC work programme in 2022 includes five main areas.  It will carry out a major piece of research and consultation on climate, biodiversity and how to achieve a just transition in agriculture.  It will continue to help us deepen our understanding of how to deliver more affordable and sustainable housing systems, drawing on international and national experience, including ongoing work in Ireland on cost rental.</p>  <p>  NESC is supporting work on Ireland's well-being framework by examining how well-being frameworks are implemented in practice.  It has undertaken an extensive programme of research and consultation to support the shared island initiative.  It will produce a report on the shared island in quarter 1 of 2022, which will make recommendations in five key areas, namely, economy and infrastructural investment; social policy; climate and biodiversity; well-being frameworks; and data co-ordination.  It will examine aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic to help identify strategic lessons about public governance and how Government can be supported to arrange and manage its activity to deliver the best results for society.</p>  <p>  The council published five reports in 2021; Grounding the Recovery in Sustainable Development: A Statement from the Council, report No. 152; Shared Island: Projects, Progress &amp;amp; Policy Scoping Paper, report No. 153; Digital Inclusion in Ireland: Connectivity, Devices &amp;amp; Skills, report No. 154; Ireland's Well-Being Framework: Consultation Report, report No. 155 and Collaboration on Climate and Biodiversity: Shared Island as a Catalyst for Renewed Ambition &amp;amp; Action, report No. 156.  As reports are finalised in the relevant areas, they are brought to Government for approval in advance of publication.</p></reply>

The research finds that "many aspects of mental health services and promotion are well-suited to cross-border working, such as [for example,] ... on-line supports, mental health promotion, and training and education".  Increased cross-Border work is viewed by stakeholders as "positive and desirable" and it was found that specific areas of co-operation, such as suicide prevention or the treatment of eating disorders, would add a very significant value to care.  As other research commissioned by the shared island unit has found, community and voluntary organisations are already informally working on a cross-Border basis and, as a result, there is a real appetite to formalise these arrangements, to have processes and bodies that can continuously support such co-operation.</p>  <p>  Existing co-operation on mental health has played a crucial role in establishing connections and maintaining co-operation and interaction between the health services, North and South.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the council's recommendation that Government should build on this progress and that a more specific and formalised mental health cross-Border structure should be established?  Will the Taoiseach confirm the next steps from the shared island unit to advance the council's paper on mental health?</p></speech>

That is the conclusion of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report, which notes "Human-induced climate change is causing dangerous and widespread disruption in nature" and is affecting the lives of more than 3 billion people.  It is fair to say that this report reckons that the situation is more severe than previously reckoned.  Moreover, it flows from that reckoning that COP26 and the Government's commitments fall short of what is needed.  I am in favour of democratic public ownership of the big corporations and the wealth in society in order that we can plan for the needs of people rather than profit and for a sustainable future.  I do not expect the Taoiseach to support that position.</p>  <p>  However, will he comment on the following point? The Government's position on data centres is clearly now insufficient.  A ban on more data centres is needed.  A carbon tax is needed on the big polluters, as opposed to on the shoulders of ordinary people.  In addition, the Government's retrofit policy is insufficient.  How can the council tenants avail?  How can renters avail?  How can those who cannot afford to match the State funds avail?  A new scheme is needed, which provides for the needs of everybody and not just a section of society.</p></speech>

Like all Deputies across this House, I have been appalled by the war of aggression being waged by Russia and now, it would appear, Belarus, against the people of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  News last week that the Irish visa requirements will be lifted is very welcome, as is the &euro;10 million relief fund.  Families in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire are making arrangements to host friends and family from Ukraine.

I wish to ask about the issue of housing, which was an important part of the body's work.  In the context of the upcoming mortgage rules review by the Central Bank, I encourage the NESC to undertake a body of work to do analysis for long-term renters in our society, of whom tens of thousands of young working professionals are in that category, about how it may be able to lend money under a more sustainable economic policy from the Central Bank which, of course, is independent of much oversight from the Government through legislation that was brought in in the past.  It would be appropriate for this unit, under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach, to carry out analysis of this particular area ahead of the review, which will be finalised later in the year 2022.</p></speech>

One of the things to which that report referred was the issue of incorporating social and economic rights into policymaking.  Today, the Minister referred the issue of housing to the Housing Commission in respect of a possible referendum.</p>  <p>  I want to pin the Taoiseach down as to what his view is on this issue.  People Before Profit put forward a constitutional amendment Bill, which was passed by the D&aacute;il, seeking to incorporate the right to secure, affordable housing into the Constitution, and for the State to prioritise resources towards the vindication of the right to housing in the midst of an absolutely dire housing crisis.</p>  <p>  That would then give protection to tenants facing evictions by vulture funds or would give us the power to take over vacant properties that could be used to house people affected by the housing crisis which, arguably, the Constitution currently prevents although, frankly, that is an issue of dispute.  It would allow us to bring in rent controls without any threat of legal action.</p>  <p>  Is that what the Government is actually going to do now?  In fact, the aforementioned Bill that was passed by the D&aacute;il would achieve this.  Is the Taoiseach in favour of putting the right to secure, affordable housing into the Constitution to vindicate that right?</p></speech>

No progress has been made on that but we heard reports today that the Cabinet is discussing it.  We need to know what wording is going to be proposed by the Government.  There has been much vagueness about that.  It is in the programme for Government in a very vague way.  What is the timing?</p>  <p>  At the root of the housing crisis is that housing in Ireland and most countries around the world is seen as an investment, a commodity and a way to make money rather than a fundamental human right.  Basically, the rights of cuckoo funds, real estate investment trusts, REITs, and developers to profit takes precedence over the rights of tenants and people seeking to have access to their own homes.</p>  <p>  When will the Taoiseach set the date?  What will the wording be?  Will he guarantee that this will happen while he is still Taoiseach rather than being yet another Taoiseach who fails to deliver on the right to housing for people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100019#T00500"><p>I thank all the Deputies for raising these issues.  In the first instance, I support NESC's work with regard to the shared island unit and the work it has done in terms of greater potential for cross-Border co-operation projects, particularly in respect of health, which has been one of the more effective cross-Border areas over a long time and, in particular, in respect of paediatric health and cardiovascular health in paediatrics.  The one cardiac surgical centre on the island enjoyed political support across the island irrespective of political background.</p>  <p>  That scope and potential also exists for mental health.  The shared island unit stands ready to financially support any cross-Border project that is developed by respective mental health agencies, North or South.  I would be very keen to progress that whether it is in a variety of areas under the mental health umbrella or otherwise.  That is something we will continue to work practically towards realising.</p>  <p>  In respect of Deputy Barry's points on climate change, I accept the conclusions of the IPCC report but we need to start matching the rhetoric with reality.  Any time the Government proposes anything, it gets opposed.  In his contribution, the Deputy said he wants data centres banned, retrofit spread more widely and carbon tax abolished.  I simply do not know how he is going to do all that.</p>  <p>  We will be including council tenants and council houses will be retrofitted.  There is a separate programme for that and a programme under the retrofit scheme for low-income families in respect of energy efficiency.  An unprecedented allocation of funding has been provided under the retrofit programme.  In fact, we aim to do in ten years what we did in the last 20 years.  We want to double the numbers we did since the year 2000 over the next ten years.  We also will be providing substantial grants to people to insulate attics and walls and so forth and then to do a deeper retrofit.</p>  <p>  The resources we are providing are extraordinary but they have to be raised for the scheme to be sustainable over the ten-year period.  That is why we put the carbon tax into law, which gets attacked all the time.  Whatever measure we bring in to deal with climate gets attacked or undermined, which leads me to believe that people want to keep delaying dealing with climate change.  That is the biggest danger we face in this country and all over the world.  People want to keep delaying the action that is necessary and that will involve a bit of pain and readjustment.  People want to keep on delaying it; we can no longer do so.  People may attack our targets and say they are not ambitious enough, but God knows they are quite ambitious, and they will be very challenging over the next five years.</p>  <p>  Whatever chance we have, however, we need co-operation and everybody on board because they are extraordinarily challenging.  All sectors will have to play their part in respect of climate change.  The NESC has pointed all this out in its reports.  Likewise, the most recent report is quite depressing in terms of where the world is heading in respect of climate change and biodiversity.  We must make very strong efforts around biodiversity.</p>  <p>  I was in Fota Wildlife Park at the weekend to meet the executives there in terms of their plans.  The work they are doing in biodiversity is quite extraordinary-----</p></speech>

A programme is being led from the wildlife park in terms of various species of toads.  We need to be funding organisations like Fota Wildlife Park, Dublin Zoo and those which are involved in global interbreeding, breeding programmes around wildlife and protecting endangered species.  That is what we need to be doing more of but we need resources to do that.  We need a re-engineering of our economy towards the green economy and also the decarbonised economy.</p>  <p>  We have to change how data centres are developed in terms of back-up generation but also in terms of renewables being used by those who wish to construct them, and offsetting technologies being deployed by such companies.  We have, therefore, a twin-track approach on the economy, which incorporates digitalisation.  Digital transformation will happen but all that has to be borne along with the green economy.  NESC has reported on all those issues.</p> <p> Deputy Devlin raised a key point.  He summed it up when he said that we have to do things differently this time in respect of the human trauma and crisis that will emerge as a result of the appalling assault on the Ukrainian people.  The Deputy referred to families in his constituency who would gladly house people.  We will need that in addition to what the State can do order to deal with the sheer numbers that could come into the EU and, by extension, Ireland.  We have to play our part as an EU member state in sharing the burden and by being generous and open.  We have to talk to our educational partners and stakeholders to facilitate children to attend our schools.  There is also the social protection aspect.</p> <p> Deputy O'Connor raised a matter that I will ask NESC about.  He made a very good point about long-term renters in Ireland, as well as what are the correct policy frameworks to deal with them.  NESC has done some work on this already.  I will ask NESC about a more comprehensive approach to that issue.  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in it.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the Housing Commission, which earlier announced details of the referendum sub-committee that will examine the complex constitutional issues around housing rights.  The Housing Commission will propose appropriate wording to the Government for a referendum on this matter.  The sub-committee is being chaired by Dr. Ailbhe O'Neill, who is a barrister with extensive practical experience in constitutional law, a former adviser to two referendum commissions and a member of the school of law at Trinity College Dublin.  She is joined on the sub-committee by Sorcha Edwards, secretary general of Housing Europe, Pat Doyle, CEO of the Peter McVerry Trust, and Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  In addition to these four members of the Housing Commission, the sub-committee has been supplemented by external members, including Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, the former Chief Justice and a former referendum commissioner, Gerard Whyte, professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, Rosalind Dixon, professor of law at the University of New South Wales, and Madeline MacKenzie, parliamentary counsel in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Parliamentary Counsel Office.  I am sure that the Deputies will agree that that is a very strong sub-committee.  It will focus on this very important issue, in respect of which there is a commitment in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

My Department will provide progress reports under the six strategic priorities set out in the strategy through the normal annual reporting cycle.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work at the centre to ensure that policies that are developed support the Government&rsquo;s commitment to develop Ireland in a sustainable way which supports economic development and social progress.  It achieves this mainly through the Cabinet committee structure.  Through the work of the ten Cabinet committees supported by my Department, a range of cross-Government work has been advanced under the new strategy statement.  These include: management of the whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including the national vaccination programme roll-out; the economic recovery plan, which was published in June and the implementation of which is helping to drive a jobs-rich recovery and which will support the economy in transitioning towards a decarbonised and digital economy; publication of the Housing for All plan, an ambitious and far-reaching plan to address the provision of housing, increase the supply of housing and provide a sustainable housing system into the future; supporting the cross-Government work to manage the ongoing economic and political impacts of Brexit; driving delivery of our commitments for a shared island on a whole-of-government basis through the shared island unit in my Department and the shared island fund; supporting Ireland in its role in Europe and the world, including through my participation in the European Council, Ireland&rsquo;s seat on the UN Security Council and with respect to continuing European Union-United Kingdom discussions on the Northern Ireland protocol; delivery of an initial well-being framework for Ireland and a supporting information hub, which have been developed to better understand and measure our progress as a country; the establishment of a social dialogue unit for my Department, which is working to co-ordinate and support the Government's overall approach to social dialogue; the work of the future media commission, which has now concluded; the completion of the work of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on gender equality; the launch of the revised national development plan, which sets out the road map for investment of &euro;165 billion in new and upgraded infrastructure over the decade ahead; supporting the development of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2021 and the Climate Action Plan 2021, which are key elements in a suite of measures introduced to fundamentally alter Ireland&rsquo;s approach to climate change; and four legislative programmes, details of which have been published, to set out priority legislation across the Government.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s priorities for 2022 include: a continued focus on the whole-of-government response to Covid-19; economic recovery and investment; driving delivery of the housing plan and measures on climate action; progressing health and wider social reforms; European Union engagement; Northern Ireland; and establishing two citizens&rsquo; assemblies to run concurrently, one of which will be on biodiversity and another that will consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures that are best suited to Dublin.</p>  <p>  Under the Public Service Management Act, 1997, Departments must prepare a new statement every three years or on the appointment of a new Minister.</p></speech>

Priority E is, &ldquo;Strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s place in Europe and the world&rdquo;.  In the context of the current crisis, invasion and war in Ukraine, I want to know what that means.  What is our role in this?  Obviously, all of us believe that Putin should be stopped, that he should leave Ukraine and that his invasion is inexcusable.  Yet, I worry deeply about the comments by the T&aacute;naiste earlier, which were about closer co-operation with the project of European militarisation and about the comments made by the Taoiseach, in which he essentially absolved NATO as some sort of defensive alliance-----</p></speech>

I wonder is the Taoiseach's opposition to warmongers like Putin selective insofar as we seem to oppose some warmongers but not others.  We had briefing today with people from Yemen.  They asked why no action is being taken over the role of the United States, Britain and France in arming the Saudi dictatorship to allow it to conduct a disastrous war that has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Yemen.</p></speech>

We unreservedly condemn this brutal invasion and we demand that Putin withdraw from Ukraine, immediately and unconditionally.  I want to pay tribute to the anti-war protesters in Russia who are under conditions of horrendous repression.  More than 1 million people have signed a petition, tens of thousands have come out onto the streets and in excess of 6,000 have been arrested.  Will the Taoiseach join with me in calling for those prisoners to be released?</p>  <p>  I want to ask if the Taoiseach agrees with the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s comments, which clearly point towards an undermining of Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing position of military neutrality?  The T&aacute;naiste said, &ldquo;I do see us getting more involved in European defence&rdquo;.  On Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, he says that it offers one route to deeper involvement in European defence.  He talked about removing the requirement for the UN Security resolution for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in military operations.  Does the Taoiseach oppose the very cynical attempt to use people's horror at what is happening in Ukraine to drive through a Fine Gael agenda to abandon neutrality and align with NATO?  </p></speech>

The strategy makes a specific reference to the implementation of policing reforms and to the Dublin north-east inner city initiative.  The Taoiseach met with members of the North Inner City Community Coalition last month to discuss the increase of violent crime in the area.  The coalition emphasised to the Taoiseach the urgent need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to grip the escalating crime and the drug-related violence and intimidation that is rapidly becoming normalised in some parts of the city.</p> <p> I believe the Taoiseach recognises the need for strong community engagement, increased community safety and enhanced youth services.  What progress has the Government made on these over the past month?  In his public comments after the meeting, the Taoiseach specifically mentioned that additional outreach and information programmes would be rolled out, as well as youth justice and other interventions.  What progress has been made on these initiatives?  What agency has responsibility for their delivery?  Will the Taoiseach provide a briefing on these measures and on the additional policing resources agreed between the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner?  Dubliners need reassurance that the Government is committed to getting tough on serious and violent crime.</p></speech>

Those interests should have nothing to do with turning a blind eye to racism.  The following are the words of Isaac, a Nigerian man trying to get into Poland from Ukraine.  He stated that he and his companions had been chased back and hit by police armed with sticks.  The Polish Government denies this is happening, but that is disproved by hundreds of videos on social media.  The Nigerian Government has recommended that its citizens not try to flee Ukraine via Poland.</p>  <p>  Putin's bombs and bullets do not discriminate according to a person's passport or skin colour.  All people fleeing the conflict, regardless of nationality, ethnicity or legal status, should be allowed to cross the Polish border and have the right to stay in the European Union.  Will the Taoiseach join with me in voicing strong opposition to the racist policy being applied by the Polish state to people fleeing a humanitarian crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100021#V00300"><p>What is happening in Ukraine is an absolute disaster.  It is a tragedy and an inhumane injustice.  Ireland needs to do all it can to help Ukrainians.  Bizarrely, dozens of Government Deputies signed a petition to expel the Russian ambassador, yet the Government has said "No" to them.  The Deputies, therefore, are in opposition and in government at the same time.  It is a strange scenario whereby the Government will not make a decision because it has not got permission from the EU to do so.  There is irony in the fact that a sovereign country will not make a decision regarding the Russian ambassador in order to protect the sovereignty of another country.</p>  <p>  There have been allegations that the Russian mission in Ireland has a large number of spies here.  Is this the case?  It has been further alleged that the threat from Russia is particularly high - higher even than that from jihadists or dissident republicans.  Is this the case?  The Taoiseach stated that he is a realist when it comes to the fact that Russian spies are in Ireland, which amounts to an admission that they are here.  Is that not reason enough to expel the Russian mission?</p></speech>

It is disappointing to see reports of a number of Irish MEPs, including Mick Wallace, Clare Daly, Luke 'Ming' Flanagan and Sinn F&eacute;in's Chris MacManus, supporting an amendment before the European Parliament that would delay Ukraine's accession to the EU.  Will the Taoiseach advise whether Ireland will support Ukraine's accession to the EU and indicate what practical supports Ireland can give as the Ukrainian people fight for their lives and their independence?</p></speech>

To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett in respect of what Ireland's place in Europe means, it means that from the outset of this crisis we have decided to take a proactive role in supporting a unified response from the 27 member states of the European Union to Vladimir Putin's assault on the Ukrainian people.  As I said at the European Council meeting, it meant we wanted the most comprehensive, wide-ranging, robust set of sanctions that were possible.  That was the statement I outlined, and I made it clear at the meeting as well.  We supported the conclusions that had been put together by the European Union, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and other like-minded democracies that uphold universal values of free media, free speech, freedom of association, democracy, the territorial integrity of a country, sovereignty and self-determination.  Those values are what European democracies support and we are going to be proactive in supporting them.</p>  <p>  I take issue with the moral equivalence the Deputy draws, and has been drawing over successive weeks with other Deputies, between what Vladimir Putin is doing and the actions of the member states of NATO.  It is fundamentally wrong.</p></speech>

I listened to what the T&aacute;naiste said; he referenced Irish military neutrality.  Equally, however, the global system of a rules-based, multilateral order has been turned upside down by Vladimir Putin, and that has implications.   One issue I observe is the vulnerability of Europe.  The European Union cherishes democracy, social systems, education, open and free trade and so on.  All of that is now vulnerable.  Given the scale of Putin's forces on the European Continent, be it naval, the air force or the more than 150,000 troops with missiles and every type of advanced weapon, can we honestly say it will not go beyond Ukraine?  Talk to people in Estonia, the other Baltic countries or Poland.  They do not see NATO as a warmonger.  I said this in response to the Deputy last week.  The grandmother of the Prime Minster of Estonia was deported to Siberia when Stalin took over after the Nazis.  Her mother was six months old at the time.  Estonia said after 1941 that it would never be alone again.  That is why it joined the European Union and NATO.  It gives them some semblance of security-----</p></speech>

There is a process there but, I believe, it should be a candidate country.  I am consistently of the view that the European perspective represents perhaps the most strategic approach that the European Union can take, not only in the eastern neighbourhood but in the Western Balkans as well.  It has been too slow, in terms of application processes, for many countries and then Europe complains when Russia and others start meddling in the affairs of the western Balkans, as we saw recently during Covid-19 in terms of the deployment of vaccines for geopolitical objectives which, in itself, is reprehensible.</p></speech>

In the early hours of the morning, Russian forces began a large-scale assault on the sovereign nation of Ukraine, involving invasion by land, sea and air.  Russia mounted this invasion from multiple fronts, including Ukraine's northern border with Belarus.  Russia, a country of 17 million sq km &ndash; and with the added utilisation of Belarus's territory - tried to suddenly overwhelm its neighbour of 604,000 sq km in the middle of the night.  The previous evening, the D&aacute;il had heard statements on the security situation in Europe.  The solidarity with Ukraine, expressed in the presence of the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland, was widespread and sincere across this House.  The message from this House was unwavering: Ireland supports Ukraine.  That evening &ndash; not even a week ago - we were clear in our condemnation of President Putin's decision to recognise the non-Government controlled areas in the Ukrainian oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent entities, and we were, of course, deeply concerned by Russia's military build-up and aggressive stance towards Ukraine.  That was only six days ago. </p><p>Less than a week later, we gather again, united in horror at the outrageous and naked aggression which we have seen from Russia against its neighbour. Through its decision to launch an invasion, violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the Russian Federation has brought war to European soil.  It has flagrantly violating the UN Charter and the core principles of international law.  Its actions have horrified and disgusted the world.</p><p>I have been asked questions in recent days about Ireland's military neutrality - we heard some of them again today - and the impact on our neutrality by some of our responses to the Ukraine crisis.  Ireland is militarily neutral, that is, we are not a member of a military alliance.  Let me say clearly, however, that we are not, and will never be, politically neutral in the face of the bombardment of cities, the targeting of civilian infrastructure, and attempts to lay siege to a city of 3 million men, women and children - people who have never asked for war and who wish only to live in a democratic, peaceful, stable and free country and make their own sovereign decisions about their foreign and security policy.</p><p>Like all of us in this House, I have been deeply impressed by the resolve shown by the Ukrainian people and government.  As we speak, the capital, Kyiv, and the second largest city, Kharkiv, remain in Ukrainian hands despite intensive attacks against both.  The dignity and heroism of so many ordinary Ukrainians has been simply extraordinary.  The leadership shown by President Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Kuleba has been exemplary.</p><p>In response to Ukraine's application for EU membership, I say that Ireland is a strong supporter of Ukraine's European aspiration and making that happen as soon as possible.  Ukraine has shown extraordinary determination to uphold the values of the EU.  We have seen a heroic effort over the past number of days to defend not only Ukraine, but a value system and a way of life that they want to pursue.  Ukrainians in their thousands are willing to lay down their lives to protect that dream.</p><p>I devoted some time in my statement on Wednesday last to the EU response.  In my 24 years in politics, I have never seen EU member states as unified and with as much resolve as I have seen on this issue.  In the space of five days, we have imposed three packages of unprecedented sanctions against Russia; hitting the web of companies, financial institutions, state institutions and agencies, oligarchs, government members and media interests that surround President Putin and enable the corruption and violence that we have seen on such naked display in the past week.</p><p>These actions include: the closure of EU airspace to all Russian aircraft; freezing the assets of the Russian Central Bank in the EU; expelling key Russian banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, SWIFT, system; sanctioning more than 500 individual oligarchs, Government Ministers, senior army and security officials and heads of state institutions; extending sanctions on Belarus for its role in allowing its territory to be used for Russian aggression; and sanctioning key figures and Russian media outlets that are disseminating disinformation across the EU.  EU leaders said in December that further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine would result in massive cost for Russia, and this is exactly what has happened.</p><p>Ireland will continue to play its part in these collective efforts.  We have been at the forefront of EU efforts and, indeed, sometimes ahead; taking a decision in principle to ban Russian aircraft from our airspace in advance of the collective EU agreement to do so, and calling early for an exclusion of key Russian financial institutions and banks from SWIFT.</p> <p>Each package of sanctions has been designed to add an additional layer of pressure on the Russian - and Belarusian - Governments and to cripple their ability to finance their illegal and unconscionable actions.  Ireland will support any further proposals that we believe will be effective in stymying Russia's war efforts.  The news coming out of Russia since Thursday shows that these wide-ranging sanctions are having an undeniable effect.  The value of the ruble has crashed, which will impact Russia's continued ability to conduct this war.  The effect of asset freezes and travel bans will be felt immediately by individuals who have been sanctioned, including those close to President Putin, who influence his decisions and provide him with support.</p> <p> Sanctions are not cost-free for Ireland or for the other countries joining this unprecedented global effort.  We are in ongoing contact with Irish companies to support them in mitigating some of the impacts on them and we will continue work at Government level to ensure we are ready for any countermeasures that Russia might impose on the EU, which we can expect to be potentially severe.  No one is being hurt as much as the innocent Ukrainians citizens, fleeing for refuge, whose cities are under siege and whose civilian infrastructure is being targeted.</p> <p> I welcome the statement of the International Criminal Court prosecutor, Karim Khan, that he will open an investigation into the situation in Ukraine.  He stated unambiguously last night that there is a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine.  Ireland, as always, will stand firmly and unambiguously behind the International Criminal Court and defend its independence and impartiality.  Alarmingly, we have also seen reported use of cluster munitions or bombs in an urban residential area in Ukraine's second largest city, which Ireland strongly condemns.  The use of indiscriminate and disproportionate weapons cannot be tolerated and is a clear violation of international humanitarian law.</p> <p> We must do everything we can to reach and to support Ukrainian people.  My Department announced late last week a fresh &euro;10 million in humanitarian funding for Ukraine.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has confirmed that we have suspended all visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens seeking to enter Ireland, for their first 90 days.  Two days ago, along with my EU colleagues, we agreed a package of &euro;500 million in military assistance for the Ukrainian military through the European Peace Facility, EPF, so that people can defend themselves.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, Ireland will pay our share of those efforts in full.  Our proportion, which is likely to be approximately &euro;10 million, will be used exclusively for the provision of non-lethal support.  The latter component will include supplies such as personal protective equipment, medical kits and fuel, all urgently needed and being sought by Ukrainians.  Two fellow EU member states, Austria and Malta, have taken a similar approach.</p> <p> Ireland has also led the response at UN level.  After Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution last Friday condemning the offensive against Ukraine and calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and urgent dialogue, Ireland moved quickly to ensure that an urgent session of the General Assembly was convened.  The Russian Federation's use of the veto at the Security Council was a reprehensible attempt to excuse its own military aggression against another sovereign state.  It must not and will not prevent the international community from responding to Russia's blatant breaches of international law, nor will it deter us from holding Russia accountable for its actions.  We hope and expect that a majority of the members of the UN General Assembly will support a clear and robust resolution to condemn this outright violation of the UN charter.  We will bring this issue back into the Security Council chamber and are pushing today for the adoption of a resolution calling for safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all in need in Ukraine.</p> <p> I will not go into the details here on the consular issues on which my Department continues to lead.  I will just say that my officials are in ongoing contact with the Irish citizens remaining in Ukraine - the number fluctuates daily, but today stands at just under 80.  We are also in contact with families in surrogacy arrangements in Ukraine and Members will understand that I do not want to make any comment on that publicly, given the extreme sensitivity of the situation that applies to a number of families, some here and some in Poland, waiting for news of their newborn children.  I want to make clear that our strong advice is against all travel to Ukraine for any reason.  I understand the strength of feeling among Ukrainian and Irish citizens alike and some have been in contact with my Department, looking for information on how to join the military efforts to defend Ukraine.  I must make clear again - the situation in Ukraine is extremely volatile and dangerous and Irish citizens and residents should not travel under any circumstances.</p> <p> This motion, which I am laying before the House, articulates the support from every political party and every Deputy here for Ukraine.  Last week, Leinster House, along with many other civic buildings in Ireland, lit up in the colours of the Ukrainian flag, blue and yellow, to show solidarity.  It is now time for us in the D&aacute;il to formally record solidarity with Ukraine, by agreeing this motion.  In the course of our debates on the security situation in Europe, there have been some differences of emphasis and some differences of view expressed on international matters, as is normal in a healthy democracy.  As a fundamental principle, there has been widespread support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  I know we can reiterate that collectively today.  The text of this motion is straightforward in its support for Ukraine and I urge all Deputies to support it.</p> <p> The date, 24 February 2022, was a dark day for Ukraine, for Russia, for Belarus, and for the whole world.  President Putin's announcement represents a dangerous and irresponsible escalation in tensions, and considerably heightens the risk of catastrophic miscalculation.  There can be no justification for threatening the use of nuclear weapons.  I have called for Russia to immediately revoke the order to place nuclear weapons on high-alert status, and I urge maximum restraint and de-escalation.</p> <p> As I close, I want to speak directly to any Russian people in Ireland or elsewhere, who are watching or listening to this debate.  We know that many Russian people do not want this war.  Many have been deeply courageous in protesting against military aggression.  We know that the people of Belarus are not represented by the aggressive actions of the Belarusian Government either.  There is still time.  Enormous damage and destruction has been done.  The loss of human life, which is mounting as we speak, is beyond shocking.  The UNHCR estimates that 500,000 Ukrainians have already fled to neighbouring countries, four in particular.  However, there is still time to pull back, and to choose a path of reason, restraint and diplomacy.  In this motion, the D&aacute;il calls on Russia to withdraw its military immediately.  This can be done at any moment.  What has happened will not be forgotten, but we can still work towards peace and resolution, and that is an aspiration everybody in this House should support.</p></speech>

The events of the past week have rightly caused anger and disgust across our Continent and across the world.  Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign state, is unprovoked, illegal, a blatant disregard of international law and, most importantly, it shows a blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life.  It is the act of an autocratic and dangerous bully with no regard for any interests but his own.  It is important to say that this is Putin's war.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, outlined, we know there are many Russian people who are as horrified by what he is doing as we are.</p> <p> The images from Ukraine are truly horrifying &ndash; images of families fleeing their homes for safety, images of bombs ripping through cities and towns, images of doctors fighting in vain to save the life of a six-year-old girl still wearing her pyjamas.  Those doctors were right to demand that the images of that dying girl be shown to Vladimir Putin.  Nothing so encapsulated the horror of war.</p> <p> We must be clear: nobody is responsible for this war but Vladimir Putin and those who surround him in a discredited and morally bankrupt regime.  They are responsible for the death and destruction being visited upon a proud country whose only desire is freedom, the freedom to choose their own path, something we in this House recognise.</p> <p> In Ukraine right now, we see the best of the human spirit in President Zelenskiy and his people, fighting for that freedom and the right to manage their own destiny.  We see it in the members of the Ukrainian community here returning to help their country at its time of need.  We should be proud that they desire to be part of the European Union, our Union of free nations working together for mutual benefit, a Union, as we know, in which smaller nations and larger nations share peace and prosperity equally.</p> <p> That imposes on us here in Ireland and in the European Union a responsibility to do all we can to help Ukraine and its people.  This morning, I briefed the Cabinet on discussions I have been having with EU Justice and Home Affairs colleagues on what we can do, as well as the potential implications of the invasion of Ukraine.  These include the need to be vigilant against potential security issues as well as cyber threats.</p> <p> For many of us, the discussion focused on how we can assist the Ukrainian people.  Here in Ireland, we have already lifted visa requirements to allow Ukrainian people who want to seek safety here to do so as quickly and easily as possible.  Prior to the lifting of the visa requirement for Ukraine nationals, the Department of Justice, in co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs, was working to ensure that it assisted Irish citizens and their family members in Ukraine speedily and with flexibility.  This included applications for non-EEA family members of Irish citizens which were processed swiftly and humanely, with no backlog of applications.  Family reunification visas for the family members of Irish nationals were granted in eight out of eight completed applications made over the days before the invasion.  As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, outlined, we have also worked to help many families expecting babies through surrogacy in Ukraine who found themselves, and still find themselves, in unimaginable situations, and we will continue to support them.</p> <p> Since I introduced the visa waiver on Friday, 25 February, a total of 143 Ukrainians had arrived in the State up to 6 p.m. yesterday.  However, it should be noted that many of those who travelled were already resident in the State and had travelled back to the State for reasons other than escaping the conflict in Ukraine.  We will, of course, keep the situation under review as events transpire.</p> <p> However, that is an emergency measure and we must do more.  We will act in co-operation with our colleagues across the EU.  I will meet colleagues again on Thursday and it is likely that we will activate the EU's temporary protection directive.  This is designed to provide a co-ordinated response to a mass influx of displaced persons to standardise the giving of temporary protection across EU member states and to ensure that all member states play their part.  This measure has not previously been used by the EU but the view is that it would be the right mechanism to help those leaving Ukraine.</p> <p> As I said, the Government is clear that Ireland will play is part in assisting Ukraine and its people, and has a clear record of helping those in need.  In recent months, Ireland has opened the Afghan admission programme to help family members of the Afghan community here from Afghanistan.  This programme was the only one of its kind in Europe.  Through the Irish refugee protection programme, Ireland has also offered refugee protection to more than 500 Afghan nationals, as well as meeting ongoing commitments in relation to Syrian refugees.  Previous Governments also introduced the Syrian humanitarian admissions programme, which offered temporary Irish residence to vulnerable persons who are present in Syria.</p> <p> It is not possible at this point to be precise about numbers of Ukrainian people who will come here under this directive but it is likely to be significant.  The numbers fleeing Ukraine are growing daily, with more than 650,000 estimated to have fled the country and significant numbers of displaced persons locating themselves in neighbouring territories.  More than 280,000 had fled to Poland alone by last Saturday.  I have no doubt that the Irish people will welcome and shelter all of those who come here and seek our help.  As a people, we have never been found wanting, and we will certainly not be found wanting now.</p> <p> The activation of the temporary protection directive would involve creating a simplified protection route to process the numbers of people who could come to Ireland.  The Department of Justice has already started work on this.  Rather than being required to apply for international protection, those arriving would instead access a simplified process to receive temporary residency permission for one year initially, which may be extended for further periods, potentially up to three years.  The permission would provide an immediate right of access to the labour market, housing, social welfare, healthcare, education, training and other supports.  This will not remove the right of those persons to apply for international protection, which they will, of course, be allowed to do as well.</p> <p> Whatever the method used to provide refuge, there are implications for a number of Government Departments and agencies including: the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as the State would be required to ensure that persons eligible for temporary protection have access to suitable accommodation where needed on arrival; the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities as the State would be required to ensure those arriving have access to suitable longer-term accommodation or be supported to obtain such accommodation; the Department of Social Protection as those received in Ireland would have entitlement to social welfare supports; the Department of Education as children must have access to education; the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for access to further and higher education, and to vocational training; and, of course, the Department of Health and the HSE as many, if not all, arriving would be entitled to access healthcare.</p> <p> Given the potential implications for a wide range of Departments, the Department of the Taoiseach is convening interdepartmental meetings in the coming days to further assess the implications of the activation of a temporary protection measure.  This includes the potentially significant resource and staffing implications, and to seek to develop an approach to support Thursday's discussions at the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</p> <p> The EU and the West generally have been fully united in their strength and resolve in responding to Putin's aggression and to supporting the Ukrainian people.  It is important that that message of unity and solidarity goes out from this House today too, and I have no doubt it will.  From our perspective in government, we are also taking action possible to help Ukraine and its people.  I know we will have the support of the House and the Irish people in doing so.</p></speech>

N&iacute; thugann gn&iacute;omhartha na R&uacute;ise ach b&aacute;s agus scrios do th&iacute;r br&oacute;d&uacute;il.</p>  <p>  I want to start by again extending my solidarity, and the solidarity of all of us in Sinn F&eacute;in, with the people of Ukraine.  All of us who value freedom, sovereignty and the right to self-determination of free peoples can only look on in horror at the actions of the Russian Federation and its leader, Vladimir Putin, in embarking on the type of invasion that we have not seen in Europe for decades.  Ireland, more than most, knows and understands the impact of occupation and imperialist aggression, and we stand with Ukraine as they face down the tyranny of empire.</p>  <p>  The actions of Russia bring nothing but death and destruction to a proud country.  They are acts that we have regrettably witnessed around the world in modern times - in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Palestine.  They are acts that have no place in the 21st century, period, irrespective of who the aggressor is.</p>  <p>  The Charter of the United Nations, the cornerstone of modern international law, prohibits the &ldquo;use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State&rdquo;.  That must be our starting point and our end point.  It must be the goal of the international community, through diplomacy, to bring about a peaceful resolution and to stop this war, and all wars.</p>  <p>  James Connolly wrote: &ldquo;There are no humane methods of warfare, there is no such thing as civilized warfare; all warfare is inhuman; all warfare is barbaric; the first blast of the bugles of war ever sounds for the time being the funeral knell of human progress.&rdquo;</p> <p>He was not wrong.  However, there is a way out of this.  I believe that, as with any conflict, the way out of this is through politics and through dialogue.  By dint of our military neutrality, our history of conflict resolution, and our seat on the UN Security Council, particularly as the only European member of the Security Council that is not also a member of NATO, Ireland is uniquely placed in Europe to put the case for an intensification of efforts to find a peaceful pathway forward.</p> <p> As a militarily neutral country and a country committed to the rule of law, to the success of multilateralism, to democracy and to dialogue, I believe we can play a proactive role in the response of the international community at large.  We must step up our supports for those in need of humanitarian aid and our support for those displaced by this conflict.  I have no doubt that we will play our full part in accommodating those fleeing Ukraine, as part of a comprehensive Europe-wide, and indeed global response.</p> <p> I also hope that Ukrainian membership of the EU can be expedited in line with the motion passed overwhelmingly today by the European Parliament.</p> <p> I want to acknowledge the very many people in Russia who do not want this war.  We send them our solidarity as they bravely protest the unjust actions of their leaders.  We should acknowledge that this is not an easy thing - in fact, it is a most courageous thing to do in a country that has a dismal human rights record.</p> <p> It is ordinary people also who will feel the heavy impact of economic sanctions, even when they are correctly targeted predominantly at Russian oligarchs and big business.  Those sanctions are, I believe, an absolutely necessary part of the diplomatic effort to make the Russian leadership realise the futility of their actions in invading Ukraine.  Vladimir Putin can, even at this late juncture, accept that his actions are entirely unjust, that they are contrary to international law and that he can end this barbarism.</p> <p> As we move forward from here, there is an onus and a responsibility on us to renew and step up our proud efforts as a State to advance the cause of international nuclear disarmament.  Indeed, it should be remembered that Ireland was the first country to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1968.  Statements and events of recent days serve to remind us that we are never more than minutes away from a chain reaction of missile strikes that threaten the very existence of humankind.  For that reason, all nuclear weapons held by all actors must be put beyond use and new measures put in place to ensure that they can never be produced again.</p> <p> In conclusion, let me state again that we here in Ireland stand with the global community and oppose and condemn Russia&rsquo;s actions and that we support Ukraine&rsquo;s right to territorial integrity and its internationally recognised borders.  We recognise above all else the rights of Ukrainian women, men and children to their safety and to their homeland.  There can be no tolerance for the type of aggression we have seen by a very large, very powerful state against its smaller neighbour.</p> <p> T&aacute; s&eacute; sin go hioml&aacute;n do-ghlactha d&uacute;inn i Sinn F&eacute;in, do bhaill an T&iacute; seo, agus don phobal idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.

I, therefore, commend and support the motion before us this afternoon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100025#Z00200"><p>Today, as they have been for the last week, our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine as an aggressive, brutal invasion of their territory takes place and the missiles continue to fall.  From the outset, I completely and utterly condemn the actions by the Russian Federation.  I want to send a message of solidarity to the many Ukrainian people who have come to Ireland to find a new home.  We share their pain at what is happening in their homeland.</p>  <p>  Hour by hour, we have witnessed incredible courage and sacrifice by the Ukrainian people in the face of increasingly overwhelming odds as the Russian war machine gears up to escalate the conflict.  We have also witnessed many Ukrainian nationals whose sense of duty led them to leave the safety of Ireland and put themselves in harms way to defend their native land.  I salute their courage.</p>  <p>  The arrogance, disdain and dismissiveness of Vladimir Putin towards the sovereign rights of the people of Ukraine is an affront to the UN charter, democracy, decency and international law.  Russian aggression has brought such widespread resolve among democratic nations that there is an appetite to eat the cost of sanctions against Russia whatever that cost may turn out to be.</p>  <p>  Russia has attacked a sovereign state.  It has brought war to Europe for the first time since the Second World War.  It has performed an unthinkable act.  More than half a million Ukrainian refugees have attempted to flee the Russian invasion.  Some will unfortunately have to make their way to our shores for their protection as they flee from this aggression but I have no doubt that the Irish nation will welcome them with open arms.  I also want to commend the efforts of the Irish diplomatic staff and NGO personnel working on the ground in very trying circumstances.  Will the Minister update the House on their safety and well-being at this difficult time?  A dire humanitarian crisis is developing.  It is imperative that we do everything in our power to contribute to the wider humanitarian effort.  This should also include the opening of a humanitarian corridor to allow full access for NGOs into Ukraine itself.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that Putin&rsquo;s actions represent a threat to the rules-based international order.  The Russian assault on Ukraine represents a pivot point in history.  The ripple effects of the attack and the international response will impact on geopolitical and economic affairs for some time to come.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent from the outset of this crisis in our adherence to the principles inherent in the United Nations Resolution 68/262 adopted by the General Assembly on 27 March 2014 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.  This UN resolution specifically calls on all states to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state and to settle their international disputes by peaceful means.  I add my voice to the calls urging Russia to withdraw its military forces and to return to discussions within the Normandy format.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for the full implementation of the Minsk agreements endorsed by the Security Council in UN Security Council Resolution 2202 in 2015 and do so again here today.  We believe that efforts must remain focused to establish this resolution as reality.</p>  <p>  The democratic nations of the world are united in their outrage against Russian aggression.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the continuing imposition of sanctions against Russia as part of an international response designed to bring an end to Russian aggression.  Every possible effort must be expended to bring an end to the conflict.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this conflict is set to get worse, if the current trend continues.  The likelihood is the Russians will get more ruthless.  There are going to be many more people killed in the coming days and we cannot just sit down and accept that politics has failed.  To do so will be to be forced to observe even more unspeakable suffering.</p> <p> We in Ireland, along with the wider international community, have a moral obligation to the people of Ukraine to bring every diplomatic pressure to bear on Russia and pursue every avenue to bring this crisis to an end.  If we do not, we will be talking of Ukraine in the same breath as Syria, Lebanon or Yemen, to name but a few.  Here in Ireland, Sinn F&eacute;in for close to two years has been pushing to close off access to section 110 funds for use by the Russian war machine and oligarchs.  My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, has raised this issue in the D&aacute;il on several occasions.  She did so first with the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, and then, more importantly, with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell followed this up a letter to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about the issue.  Unfortunately, no response was forthcoming.  The Government has refused to address the connection of the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, to Russia and that is totally unacceptable.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Coveney will be able to inform the House as to whether the sanctions imposed by the EU will finally address this and cut off the &euro;118 billion in funds that has been washed through the IFSC.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Yury Filatov.  The Government has offered a rationale for its decision to demur on this for the time being.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has himself talked of the importance of Ireland acting in unison with our European partners.  Ireland is a member of the United Nations Security Council.  It secured election to that position predominantly through the votes of many of the non-aligned nations of the world.  We sit on the UN Security Council through the gift of non-aligned nations.  They look to us to provide leadership, act in the interests of, and to be the dissenting voice to power of the less powerful.  Hence, for Ireland to act unilaterally in expelling the Russian Ambassador would not be the act of a lone nation.  It would be the action of a nation that has been tasked with providing leadership and example to those nations who have tasked our State with giving voice to the countries who remain outside the power blocs of the various military alliances.  When Ireland acts alone, takes a moral stand, and pursues mechanisms designed to exercise diplomatic action in the pursuit of ending violence, our country sends a powerful message.  Ireland needs to provide leadership and to provide an example to those non-aligned countries who have placed our country on the UN Security Council.  It is our non-aligned status that provides us with the global footprint and soft power beyond anything we could hope to achieve by waiting to follow the examples of alliances.</p> <p> We can never give up on our attempts to achieve a peaceful solution to any conflict and in this instance, I believe the UN still has a massive role to play in this.  We will continue to call for de-escalation, for dialogue and for the UN to have a greater say in attempts to bring about an end to the conflict.  I am aware talks are again due to take place this Wednesday between Ukraine and Russia.  There must be an immediate ceasefire, the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops and the territorial integrity of Ukraine must be fully respected.</p></speech>

The Labour Party strongly and warmly welcomes this resolution.  I thank the Government for responding to last week's request from our leader, Deputy Kelly, for this motion in order that the House could act together and the voice of elected representatives of the people could be very clearly heard.</p>  <p>  The last six days have been among the most momentous and frightening in Europe since the end of the Second World War.  The settlement we Europeans thought existed, one that underpinned peace on our Continent, has been fundamentally undermined and attacked.  This D&aacute;il must be clear and united in our response.  We previously heard in statements some few comments beginning with: "Putin is evil but what about ..."  There is no space now for whataboutery.  The single and clear issue before the House is the invasion of a member state of the UN, which is a sovereign and independent state, by a neighbour with the objective or removing its democratic administration and making it a vassal state.  When we spoke about these issues last week I said President Putin's aims are stated clearly.  He has not hidden what he intends to do.  He wants the restoration of a super-Russian state that reabsorbs into its territory the now-independent former Soviet republics.  The views, wishes, hopes and expectations of the citizens of those states are of no interest to Vladimir Putin.</p>  <p>  We are watching the news as it unfolds on an hourly basis and today may be a critical one in the conduct of this war of aggression.  As we have all seen, hundreds of tanks are within kilometres of the centre of Kyiv.  Rockets have landed in the centre of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv.  It is alleged, and I believe it, that cluster bombs, which are banned in many countries, have been deployed against civilian targets.  The humanitarian consequences of these actions are horrific and wholly unacceptable.</p>  <p>  We have stated repeatedly we stand with the people of Ukraine.  In his presentation via video link to the European Parliament earlier, however, the Ukrainian President, Mr. Zelenskiy, gave a real challenge to all of us when he said: "Prove that you are with us".  What then can we do?  What more can we do?  I have a number of suggestions.  I am sorry the Minister for Justice has left as I wanted her to hear my direct appeal to her, like the one I made earlier to the Taoiseach.  I call for the immediate enactment - and I mean this week - of the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill 2020, the so-called Magnitsky Act, which is on the Order Paper of this D&aacute;il and has passed Second Stage.  It aims to expand our existing proceeds of crime legislation, namely, the one that created the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, to take and seize ill-gotten gains and to put the onus of responsibility on those who are holding those gains to explain where they got them and to prove they are legitimate.  In the Bill I have proposed we wanted to define certain conduct occurring outside the State, in places like Ukraine and places like Israel, as criminal conduct if that conduct constitutes or is connected with a gross abuse of human rights.  Under the Bill, conduct is stated to constitute "a gross human rights abuse if ... it is carried out by, or at the instigation or with the consent or acquiescence of ... public official[s]".</p> <p>We need to ensure that the pals of Putin who have stashed money all over the world, probably including in this jurisdiction, can have that removed from them.  That is the most damaging thing we can do to them.  I believe that the Bill has all-party support and a strong move we could make would be to provide time in the House this week to pass its remaining Stages and make it law.</p> <p> We could also accept refugees from Ukraine.  I welcome the Minister for Justice's comment that the temporary protection measure that she outlined is in place, but the numbers she mentioned are tiny so far.  Today, the United Nations stated that 660,000 people had left Ukraine for fear of their lives and well-being.  The visa requirement to get to Ireland has been removed but we must be more proactive than that.  We are on the periphery and our European neighbours are taking in massive numbers of people and are desperately struggling to provide them with accommodation, food and the basics of living.  We need to plan - almost on a war footing - for the reception of refugees and for welcoming not only families of Ukrainian nationals resident in Ireland, but many more who need shelter from the ongoing conflict.  We need to have clear and unambiguous plans funded and set out.</p> <p> Yesterday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed an application for EU membership.  It is his and his people's declaration that they look towards Europe for their future.  It was a massive political statement.  We must respond in kind.  We must agree to declare Ukraine an EU candidate country, which I understand was the majority decision of the European Parliament in the past 24 hours.</p> <p> An investigation into potential war crimes has been opened by the International Criminal Court.  Let all aggressors take note &ndash; there must be a complete and exhaustive examination of their actions in Ukraine.  We must tell them clearly now that anyone involved in the war crimes being perpetrated against the innocent people of Ukraine will be held to account.  Even if it takes years to do it, we will follow it up.  The world community is clear and united in that regard.  Hopefully, this will have some impact on reducing the enthusiasm of some of the Putinistas for their ongoing vicious campaign of oppression.</p> <p> Yesterday, I had the task and great honour of moving a resolution of solidarity with Ukraine at the plenary session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in London.  Needless to say, it was carried unanimously by representatives of democratic parliaments on all these islands, representing England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  We sent our support to the people of Ukraine and our fellow parliamentarians in the Ukrainian Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada.  Democracy is often spoken about in all of our assemblies but it is under specific and brutal assault today on our Continent.</p> <p> It is unclear how this invasion will end, although we already know that nothing will be the same after the attack.  All of us in this House and all the people we represent fear for the Ukrainian people in these dark hours.  We admire their courage and strength, their resolution and their bravery.  We watch in amazement and admiration their courage, as well as the courage of those Russian men and women who have taken to the streets in cities across Russia demanding peace and the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine.</p> <p> Russia will take its own course but we &ndash; people who are committed to the rule of law and democracy &ndash; cannot tolerate a return to a Europe that we thought we had put behind us in previous decades and centuries where aggression, conflict and subjugation existed.  Our determined and clear resolve as a Parliament must be to stand with Europe, stand with Ukraine and give a clear message to the valiant people of that benighted country in their hour of great need.</p></speech>

His analysis of Russian-Ukrainian relations, published last July, is in effect his war manifesto.  In that document, he rejects the concept of Ukrainian independence and Ukrainian sovereignty.  In that paper, he asserts his belief that the people of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are one people and should share one geographical and political space.  He talks about Ukrainians, Russians and Belarusians as being one family, yet now we see that he has turned his guns on his Ukrainian brothers and sisters.</p><p>Four weeks ago, the Russian ambassador, Mr. Yury Filatov, speaking before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, which I chair, said that any invasion of Ukraine would be insane.  He repeated the same statement on national television.  Last week, his President, Mr. Putin, gave the order to invade Ukraine.  Does the ambassador in Dublin now believe that President Putin is insane?</p><p>The invasion of Ukraine is the latest in a very long line of Russian and Putin aggression.  Look at Chechnya, Georgia, Moldova, Crimea, Syria, Kazakhstan and Belarus.  Under his leadership, assassinations, poisonings and oppression of dissent also became his <i>modus operandi</i>.  Cyberattacks originating in Russia and interference in elections and the internal politics of many countries have been other common features of Russian aggression.  The failure of the Russian political and military elites to restrain him and the failure of the international community to realise the danger he posed emboldened him further.  Indeed, President Putin perceived the West as weak and decadent.</p><p>In Ukraine, however, President Putin has miscalculated.  He has overreached.  The international response has been impressive on many fronts and is becoming more effective day by day.  Ukrainian resistance is stronger than President Putin had anticipated.  Opposition to the war is growing within Russia and will grow even further in the days and weeks ahead.</p><p>There is now a clear choice facing the Russian military, political, business and diplomatic establishment - stay with him or remove him from office.  If they stay with him, some like President Putin will find themselves, as Deputy Howlin has rightly said, before the International Criminal Court answering for war crimes in Ukraine.  I support the gathering of evidence now towards a case against Mr. Putin and his henchmen in the International Criminal Court.</p><p>The invasion of Ukraine has been a rude wake-up for many countries in Europe, none more so than Germany.  Many believed that trade with Russia would change Russian politics.  What has happened instead is that much of Europe has become dependent on Russian gas and Russian dirty money, which has corrupted business and, in some cases, politics in some European countries.  There is a danger that change through trade works both ways.  Indeed, there have been suggestions of Russian dirty money in Ireland, which need to be assessed and analysed by the Government, which I support on a daily basis.</p><p>Ireland's geographical location has protected this country in many ways.  It is interesting to compare Ireland's relationship with the UK during 100 years of independence and Russia's relationship with Ukraine's 30 years of independence.</p> <p>We in Ireland also have been sheltered from external threats by the NATO umbrella.  To a large extent, we have enjoyed the luxury of being bystanders as regards security and defence.  This approach is no longer a credible option.  Ireland's well-being and prosperity is dependent upon the European Union and our positive and strong relations with other western countries, in particular the United States of America.  What is worth having is worth defending.  As a country we must now be prepared to shoulder a fair share of the burden of European defence and security.  The European Union and the United States of America have been strong supporters of Ireland and of the Irish peace process.  The European Union in particular, but also the United States of America, have had our back and continue to do so in the crisis relating to the withdrawal of our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, from the European Union.  </p> <p> Now is the time for Ireland to look at where it stands on the issue of European security and defence.  We recently and coincidentally had the publication of a very wide-ranging and long-awaited independent report on the future of our Defence Forces.  It also presents us with an opportunity to answer many of the serious questions that are now being posed on the streets of Ireland as to where we stand and how stand our Defence Forces.  These are questions that this D&aacute;il must return to on a regular basis.  They are questions that we need to address.  In the meantime, I strongly support this motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100028#CC00200"><p>I do not agree with much of the sentiment just expressed and nor would I like to see the situation exploited to that end.  I know many of my colleagues would agree with that.  It is important to make the point that not so long ago, in the aftermath of the annexation of Crimea, a number of Members of the European Parliament representing parties opposite, whom I will not name because I do not want to politicise the particular debate, criticised the European Union for being overly confrontational towards Russia.  They now have to own that and to respond to it in the current context.</p>  <p>  I am fairly clear in my own mind as to what Ireland needs to do.  We are militarily neutral.  As has been stated here, we are a small neutral country on the periphery of Europe.  There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in regard to the Russian ambassador.  He lied to an Oireachtas committee.  He more than likely has lied to the Minister and the Government.  He lied to the nation last week.  All of that is in regard to this issue.  I presume he lied, as did his officials, to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council when the Russian embassy sought to significantly expand its premises and facility on Orwell Road.  That is a very valuable lesson for us, particularly in regard to espionage, our data centres and our cybersecurity. </p>  <p>  While I accept the T&aacute;naiste's comments earlier today with regard to the importance of maintaining diplomatic connections, relations and channels, particularly in the interests of protecting Irish citizens both in Ukraine and in Russia, he will understand that the impulse in regard to the call for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador and the initiative arose out of a sense of powerlessness and anger in the face of Russian actions.  We can certainly expel the bulk of the Russian team at the embassy, particularly its spying team, listeners and that section of its diplomatic corps.  I also think the Taoiseach needs to call in the ambassador soon and give him a dressing down, not least in regard to the lies he told the Government and the people of this country.  </p>  <p>  Enough on that.  I will move now to what we can do as a militarily neutral country with a very proud record in regard to humanitarian support and relief of other countries.  I hear a lot of words here today.  I know they are incredibly well-meaning but on occasions like this I cannot help but be reminded of the scene in the "Life of Brian" when the committee gets together and there are proposers, seconders, alternative motions and further motions and the crisis has passed before they get out of the meeting room and no solid action has been taken.  What does a militarily neutral country do?  We got our lead today from Adi Roche that we need to send money and support.  Clearly, we cannot send ships but we can send shiploads of relief supplies.  The Government must not just support NGOs in doing this, it must lead on it.  We cannot send soldiers but we can send volunteers to assist with refugees.  Again, the Government must lead on this and not just depend solely on NGOs to lead on it.  The Government needs to facilitate it.  We cannot send tanks and trucks but we can send truckloads of supplies, comfort, food and humanitarian aid.  The Government needs to lead and facilitate this.  We cannot send warplanes but we can send aeroplanes to transport those refugees to safety and to our shores.  The Government must lead and facilitate in this regard.  </p>  <p>  Let us accept our conscious decision in regard to military neutrality, but take control of what we can take control of.  Let us use the power that we have, which is tremendous human power and good will, and put it to good effect.</p></speech>

Like all Deputies across this House, the Irish people and almost everyone around the world, have been shocked and truly appalled by the illegal war of aggression being waged by Russia and now Belarus on the people of Ukraine.  The war is a clear breach of the United Nations Charter.  It is causing untold suffering for the people of Ukraine and it is creating a human catastrophe in Europe.  Over 650,000 Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, families have been split, people have lost everything.  We are hearing stories of men in particular being asked to remain, choosing fighting over their families.  It churns the stomach of the Irish people that this could happen again on the Continent of Europe when we thought we were living in a time of peace.</p>  <p>  Russia&rsquo;s prosecution of the war has been appalling.  The use of cluster munitions and other weapons on an indiscriminate basis against residential areas constitute war crimes.  These crimes must be investigated.  I support the calls of other Deputies in that regard.  The international community and particularly the European Union cannot stand idly by while a democratic state with a rich cultural and social history is snuffed out. </p>  <p>  I welcome multilateral sanctions against the Russian regime by the EU and other nations.  I welcome commitments today by several party leaders across the House with regard to the need to facilitate Ukraine&rsquo;s membership of the EU.  Efforts earlier today by some Irish MEPs to frustrate the process for reasons known only to them were bizarre and shameful.  On a practical basis, Ireland should do everything it can to assist the people of Ukraine in their hour of need.  I welcome the lifting of visa requirements for Ukrainians coming to Ireland, the establishment of a relief fund and plans to support Ukrainians fleeing to Ireland in a special refugee programme.  Efforts by individuals and groups across Ireland should also be acknowledged. </p>  <p>  It would be remiss not to recognise those brave Russian citizens who have come out to protest the illegal war against their neighbours in Ukraine.  Like all of us, they are disgusted.  I support this motion.  It demonstrates the resolve of this House and the Irish people.  Even at this late stage, like all Members of the House, I would like to see Russia and Belarus do the right thing.  They can and should do that.</p></speech>

Our thoughts are with all those who are so terribly affected and impacted.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, rightly criticised the actions of the Putin regime as unacceptable and illegal.</p> <p>He stated that we need to be part of the response to that.  I agree.  Of course, how we respond is what matters.  We are citizens of a neutral country which often punches way above its weight in international affairs.  It is great to see the EU solidarity on this matter but, of course, accountability starts at home.  It is about what we can do in the here and now and what changes we can effect.  It is no secret that the IFSC is a major offshore financial centre for people linked to Putin.  Gazprom, Rosneft and VTP in the state sector and major oligarch-controlled entities such as Alfa-Bank, EuroChem and Rusal are but a few of the companies involved.  They all have special purpose vehicles located in the IFSC.  They have no employees, offices or fixed assets and they pay no tax.  Nevertheless, between 2005 and 2017, those shell companies funnelled &euro;118 billion from the IFSC to Russia.  Many of the companies that received those funds had been accused of serious wrongdoing.  For example, Credit Bank of Moscow required a major bailout.  Approximately 50% of its loans were to its management.  Promsvyazbank had to be nationalised and its former owners were accused of being the ones buying their own debt.  A quick look through some of the prospectuses for their bonds listed on the Irish Stock Exchange are striking.  The section which lists risks includes reference to the fact that the measures implemented to prevent it from being used as a conduit for money laundering or terrorist financing may not be completely effective.</p> <p> We know that following the imposition of sanctions in 2016 and 2017, some IFSC-based companies managed to raise finance on behalf of companies under those sanctions, as was well covered in the media over the past four years.  Yet nothing happened.  I have been raising this matter with the Government since 2020.  In September 2020, I raised the matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who said it would be a matter for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to address.  I heard nothing thereafter.  Shortly after I raised the matter with the Minister of State, one shell company connected to the now sanctioned bank Sovcombank issued a bond for &euro;300 million.  Its prospectus, listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, mentions risks from the sanctions imposed by foreign governments, including sanctions against Russian individuals and legal entities.</p> <p> In March 2021, the now sanctioned bank Alfa-Bank issued a bond of &euro;1.2 billion.  It also noted risks from economic sanctions.  I raised this matter with the Minister for Finance when he was before the Joint Committee on Finance two months later and he told me he was not in a position to give an answer, which is understandable, but that he would write to me.  He did not do so.  I then wrote to him at the end of that month but I never received a reply.  I am sorry, but that is not good enough.</p> <p> We need to be a part of the response.  I welcome what is being done and what has been done.  We absolutely do need to be a part of the response.  However, we need to ensure the IFSC is not used for the purposes of sanction-busting.  Are we going to continue to allow anonymous company ownership which uses legal trustees because these non-transparent structures create significant risks of abuse?  Because of the trustee ownership, it can be difficult to see-----</p></speech>

It is always good to have accuracy.</p>  <p>  Will the statutory company information in the Companies Registration Office, CRO, be made free, as it is in Companies House in Britain?  Are we going to continue to allow these Russian-connected companies operate tax free because they can avail of the section 110 tax concession?  Are we going to introduce any kind of accountability to that small network of professional services, including legal and accountancy firms that service them?  These are the primary beneficiaries of these Russian-connected shell companies.  These things have been brought to light in the context of the invasion of Ukraine.  We need to consider whether a cost-benefit analysis can be done around the use of section 110 tax concessions, which allow these companies, and many others, to operate largely tax free.  With the current reforms in the international tax regime, a tax concession for non-residents such as this seems completely out of step.</p>  <p>  We are more than happy to work with the Minister.  Indeed, we think that is crucial and it is good to see everyone working together on this issue.  However, if we want to provide a deterrent to the Putin regime and its connected oligarchs, we need to aim for their pockets and look at what has happened in the IFSC.</p></speech>

The attacks on civilians, the use of rockets and bombs on civilian targets, the brutal murder of children, the use of cluster bombs and the war crimes that are happening need to be condemned by all of us in the strongest possible terms.  It is important that we stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and, indeed, the people in Russia who have been bravely protesting against this war.  We must also support the Ukrainian community in Ireland and everybody in eastern Europe and Asia who lives with the constant threat of Russian aggression.</p><p>This is not just an attack the Ukrainian people; it is also an attack on democracy, international law and a rules-based international system - things which we all hold dear.  It is also an attack on the system which has a simple tenet that countries cannot take by force the territory of other countries.  It is important that we all stand in unity against that.</p><p>It is also important that we do what we can, as other Deputies have stated.  We must focus on what can be done to support the people of Ukraine.  While it is welcome that the Russian war crimes that are being committed will be investigated by the International Criminal Court, there is a need for urgent action now.  This is no time for half measures.  I support the calls that have been made by Deputies from different parties across this House for the immediate expulsion of the Russian ambassador.  I have heard and appreciate the reasons that have been given for not doing that.  If we expel the ambassador, we can expect a reciprocal move and the expulsion of our ambassador from Russia.  However, that would not necessarily mean that all diplomatic ties and presences would have to be removed as part of that.</p><p>All Irish-domiciled Russian assets need to be frozen and seized immediately and all forms of trade with Russia should be ceased immediately.  The harshest possible economic sanctions are needed.  According to Eoin Burke-Kennedy, a credible commentator writing in <i>The Irish Times</i>, the sanctions were carefully crafted to avoid major economic fallout.  That is a very serious charge he has made.  He has stated that economic self-interest is inhibiting the level of the sanctions going through.  Other commentators have said that the expulsion of only some of the Russian banks from the SWIFT system does not go far enough.</p><p>At this point, we need to end all business and trade with Russia.  Everyone doing business with Russia, including those buying oil or gas, holding investments, engaged in commercial arrangements or sitting on boards, is contributing to Putin's war chest.  Anyone involved in that is fuelling the invasion of Ukraine.  Pension funds and companies should divest now.  Members of boards should resign.  It all needs to stop now.  That signal needs to come clearly from everybody who stands against the invasion.</p><p>Some &euro;34 billion is held by Russian-linked shell companies registered with the IFSC.  Between 2005 and 2017, according to research by Cillian Doyle and Jim Stewart, &euro;118 billion was funnelled through the IFSC by Russian entities through so-called section 110 trusts.  There must be no more sheltering of Russian money through the IFSC.</p><p>We can also be strong in our support the people of Ukraine through our humanitarian response.  We should have the strongest possible humanitarian response to support everybody who is fleeing from war and the civilian population remaining in Ukraine.</p> <p>Food supplies will be of critical importance because it will be a matter of only days before food runs out in some areas.  While we have heard from the Government about some of the measures that will be taken, we have not been given details of how that level of humanitarian assistance will be provided in terms of what needs to be done in the coming days.  It is important that we hear more in this regard.</p></speech>

We would like to hear more about it as and when the Minister is able to provide the information.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that the European Union will trigger the temporary protection directive and that Ireland will, from what the Government has said, participate fully in it.  That is important.  The visa waiver is another important move.  It was deeply frustrating to members of the Ukrainian community in Ireland, however, that it came only with the outbreak of war and the invasion of their country.  A number of them were pleading with the Government to make it easier for people, including their family members, to come to Ireland before war broke out, while there were still flights coming here from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  People need certainty in terms of what will happen next.  I welcome the indication from the Minister for Justice that Ukrainian citizens will be able to work and contribute fully to Irish society when they come here.  Very significant resources will have to put in place to provide shelter and other supports.  I welcome the comments by the Taoiseach earlier indicating that the scale of the response will be unprecedented and on a level not contemplated before.  That certainly is needed.  Last Thursday, the T&aacute;naiste gave a commitment to provide practical assistance to people fleeing from Ukraine.  We need more information on what that practical assistance will be.  Ireland can and should be organising flights out of eastern Poland for people who want to come here, especially those looking to be reunited with their families who are living here, whether they are Ukrainian citizens, Irish citizens or otherwise.  Getting to the eastern part of Poland is a huge journey, trauma and ordeal for people.  If they manage to get that far, we should be providing assistance to them.  We must do everything we can to support the Ukrainian community in Ireland in its moment of need.</p>  <p>  There have been disturbing reports of the mistreatment of African students in their attempts to leave Ukraine.  It is critically important that everyone fleeing war is treated equally.  There must be no repeat of the treatment of Syrian refugees, some of whom have been waiting in Beirut for up to two years, having been promised support in terms of coming to Ireland.  They say they have received very little communication or support.</p>  <p>  This really is a time for us, as a country, to do everything we can in terms of our humanitarian response.  The people of Ireland and the Members of this House support that very strongly.  We must do everything we can to support the people of Ukraine.  We must do all we can to support those who are under attack at this moment, including very strong humanitarian support for people in that country.  I appreciate the Minister's comments regarding this being done at an international level.  We will want to hear more information about what specifically Ireland is doing in that regard.  We can play a leadership role in this, which is what people want to see.</p></speech>

The Russian war is illegal and a serious violation of international law.  Russia's attack is totally unjustified and Ireland and the EU are right to demonstrate steadfast support for Ukrainians' rights to sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Peace has been shattered and the horror of war and war crimes have been visited on Europe once again.  This has resulted in unprecedented solidarity on the part of the EU in support of the Ukrainian people.  I welcome that.  Despite a little hesitation by a few member states late last week, the EU has since adopted the most comprehensive package of sanctions ever in the case of Russia.  I am proud that Ireland supported this extensive package from the outset, including the exclusion of key Russian banks from SWIFT.</p>  <p>  It is important that the D&aacute;il should carefully consider the implications of the agreement last weekend by EU foreign ministers in respect of the European peace facility.  This is a significant shift for the Union, or a watershed moment, as the President of the European Commission described it.  The European peace facility is a new EU programme, agreed last year, on security and defence.  Given our traditional peacekeeping role and long-standing policy that no Irish funds shall be spent on weapons, it is right that Ireland abstained constructively on the lethal weapons package and supported the non-lethal weapons proposals.  Ukraine certainly is an exceptional case but there must be ongoing scrutiny of the European peace facility by the Oireachtas and clear guidelines on its future use in another context.</p>  <p>  What are we to do about the calls for a breaking off of diplomatic relations with Russia and the expulsion of its ambassador to Ireland?  Irish people are horrified by the lies Yuri Filatov has told in recent weeks, culminating in his outrageous interview with David McCullagh on RT&Eacute;'s "Six One News" last Friday.  In these circumstances, I had no hesitation in saying at the weekend that this man is not welcome in Ireland.  I hear what the Government is saying about the value of keeping diplomatic channels open between Dublin and Moscow but I am not sure about that.  We certainly should expel a number of Russian diplomats and so-called operatives in the coming days.  I am glad the expulsion of the ambassador is still under consideration, having regard to the ongoing work on co-ordinated action at EU level.  I look forward to receiving the Minister's advice on this ongoing situation in due course.</p>  <p>  We have a humanitarian crisis on our EU borders.  It is heart-breaking to view the emotional scenes at the borders of Poland, Moldova, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, where families are being broken up and women and children try desperately to reach the security barriers.  Millions of Ukrainians are being displaced.  We need to put in place special refugee programmes here in Ireland, in conjunction with the EU, to assist Ukrainians fleeing this war.  I welcome the measures in this regard announced by the Minister for Justice earlier in the House.  We must show full solidarity with the people of Ukraine at this very difficult time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1511" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100030#EE00500"><p>I thank the Minister for his statement.  More than half a million people, most of them women and children, have already fled Ukraine.  It is the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.  In this age of social media, we are watching the horror unfold on our devices.  I was especially concerned to hear 19-year-old Rachel from Carlow, a medical student in Ukraine, tell her experience today.  We need the Minister's assistance to get her home.  I have emailed him and the Taoiseach on this matter and I have more information to give them.   We need to get Rachel home.</p>  <p>  It is welcome that Ireland is waiving visa requirements for Ukrainians fleeing the war.  This has been a vital comfort to the Ukrainian community here in Ireland, including for families in Carlow and Kilkenny.  We must ask the good people in our communities to express their solidarity by offering, if they are in a position to do so, to take in Ukrainian refugees as part of the EU's humanitarian response to the conflict.  These same communities, including those in Carlow and Kilkenny, have already set up donation stations to help.  There is a huge amount of goodwill within communities, with a large number of stations established to raise funding and collect food and clothing.</p> <p>One has to congratulate communities for the efforts they are making and it is important that we recognise the work they do and we are helping.  Our State facilities will not be enough and we need to accept this.  This is a war effort and while we are neutral, we are human and we should do everything we can to help those displaced by this.</p> <p> The invasion by Russia on innocent people in Ukraine is horrific.  I appreciate that we must keep diplomatic channels open and that we are a small country but can we not lead the EU in expelling the Russian ambassador from our country and support other countries in taking the same action?  This aggression by Russia will cause untold hardship and tragedy for the Government and people of Ukraine, who have shown remarkable resilience and resolve.  I admire Mr. Zelenskiy, who has shown such leadership to his people.  A father himself, he does what he does for his family and country.  I was moved by his appeal to the European Union today and I know I am not alone.  We must not leave them alone out there and we all recognise that.  The people of Ukraine are our family and we must answer his call for help by offering them the humanitarian support they will need.  I want to applaud the Department of Foreign Affairs for its support of those members of Irish Families Through Surrogacy with children just born in Ukraine.  They are our families too.  The help we give will be vital now.  I know the Minister is working hard on this but we need to give every support we can.  What is happening in Ukraine is horrific.</p></speech>

I am speaking in support of it, as are my party and the Government.  I have long raised questions in this Chamber and elsewhere as to the actions of certain states, particularly Russia.  It is not so long ago that I was engaging with the Minister on the Russian elections, the treatment of Alexei Navalny and other opponents, and what I saw as an attack on democracy that played out in Russia.  We saw similar activity in Belarus, where we have sympathy for the exiled opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has Irish connections.  In Poland, Hungary and other places we have seen attacks on democracy,the rule of law, academic freedom, media freedom and freedom of expression.  All the norms that western liberal democracy might have come to take for granted in the past 20 or 30 years have been eroded and attacked.  Perhaps the final frontier of conventional military warfare was then engaged in recent days, much to the horror of all in this Chamber I hope and certainly of myself and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member.</p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Flanagan speak earlier and I have been corresponding with him in recent days as well about the position of the Russian ambassador.  I note the Government&rsquo;s position on that and I realise there are complications but I want to say, and I have said this in the committee, when the ambassador came before us he misled the committee to put it mildly.  He laughed off our concerns and described them as a James Bond conspiracy.  He spoke about the idea of Russia invading Ukraine as being insane.  I asked him how insane it was when Crimea was invaded six years previously and they have gone back and done the same thing again.  It is abhorrent that such contempt was shown to the committee, the D&aacute;il and Irish sovereignty.</p>  <p>  I will speak to the issue of Irish sovereignty on a related point and again I recently raised this in the committee and in other media.  Our concept of neutrality is outdated.  We have a sacred cow and it is a traditional idea that we would shy away from any conflict or confrontation.  I appreciate that provides us with something of a position as an honest broker but it is also outdated in a world where warfare does not always come with tanks crossing our borders.  Warfare comes with marine presence in our exclusive economic zone; a cyberattack on our national health system; interference with data lines, communications and transmissions, be those under the sea or in data centres scattered across the country; interference with our economic interests and by threatening and jeopardising investment in the country; and by disrupting elections and the free expression of people at the ballot box, be that through referendums or elections.  All of those factors play into the new and modern hybrid warfare and I am convinced we have been subject to that by Russia and others who have sought to interfere in many ways.  Why do they do that?  They do that because it is in their economic and political interests.  Anything that can disrupt a western state is positive for certain countries that are outside of that alliance.  It is as easily and simply done as interfering with social media and running reverse algorithms, as has been done repeatedly and this has been well-documented in votes such as Brexit and the 2016 US elections.  I firmly believe this has happened on many occasions here also and I do not see it as being particularly contested that this has happened.  It is time to think long and hard about our position, about how we defend ourselves and about how we recognise the forms of attack that can come into being.  I suggest that the State has been already subjected to this.</p>  <p>  I listened to some of the contributions from around the House earlier and there were some good contributions from all sides.  I noticed a preponderance from the Sinn F&eacute;in benches to throw the ball back at the Government about various accounts and mechanisms in the IFSC and how various different investments could be frozen or moved on.  The EU is doing all of that and more and we are doing that as part of the EU.  I would say to Sinn F&eacute;in that it is easy to suggest that something that can be done and the Government has already spoken about the complexity of some of these matters.  It is complex to take on board the difficult financial tapestry of the IFSC; various funds and cross funds and legislation may be proposed that can tackle that.  Perhaps that is a good thing and perhaps something should be done but it cannot happen overnight.  What can happen overnight is a vote and Sinn F&eacute;in representatives in Europe have already spoken about their actions and votes.  In fact, its MEP rejected a call from across Europe to safeguard Ukraine&rsquo;s position, respect its borders and vindicate its independence before Christmas.  It is disappointing for representatives of the same party to come into this House, having refused the opportunity and being among a small minority that did so in the European Parliament in December, and throw the ball back at the Government about various complex financial manoeuvres that they know full well cannot be taken overnight.  There is hypocrisy in that, albeit I welcome their late conversion to the pattern.  There may have been ideological alignment with previous regimes in Russia and that may be at the heart of that.</p>  <p>  In any event, I commend the motion and I am delighted to support it.  We need to take seriously the notion of modern hybrid warfare.  The war that has been conducted is being conducted in cyberspace, social media and traditional media as much as it has been conducted on the ground in Ukraine.  Who is winning is a function of who one is following, not necessarily of the facts on the ground.  The facts on the ground are debated and I would not take for granted that Ukraine&rsquo;s position is so strong.  Russia made significant progress and that is of concern to us all.</p></speech>

Last week we debated the issue of Ukraine in the House and none of us could have imagined that within 24 hours we would see tanks crossing the border and rolling into Ukraine.  It is a despicable and sinister act by a determined dictator in Russia, Vladimir Putin.  The last time we were here we discussed the notion that &ldquo;Might is right&rdquo; and he is pushing that to its limits.  While conflict across Europe was something we had hoped we would never see again, we have to recognise that for the past hundreds of years conflict around the globe has been always happening as long as people have thought that greed made it appropriate to conquer and subdue others, take over countries and take wealth and pull that away.  The essence of that is the notion of imperialism and that is what Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation are about; it is an imperialist state which is flexing its muscles.  Our hearts go out to the people who are losing their lives, the families who are fleeing and the hundreds of thousands who are trying to cross the border into Poland and other countries to try to get to safety.  Our heart and spirit are also with the people of Ukraine, so many of whom are resisting and putting up a strong fight against Russia.  Yet, we see a 17 km long convoy of people travelling towards Kyiv, which poses difficulty and which will cause problems for all of the people there if the bombardment of Kyiv is as strong as that would suggest.</p>  <p>  I take the points that many Members have made about the Russian ambassador and his performance in the committee last week.  In effect, he lied to the committee and the people of Ireland as to the intentions of Russia and of course people are angry about that.  I also take the Minister&rsquo;s point that we have to be careful not to break off diplomatic relations.  However, we are all aware that in every conflict in the world there are always back channels and ways of getting things done and sorting out things.  Publicly, we have to make a stand and that stand could be clearly made in Ireland.  The Russian ambassador's performance and what he did here fly in the face of the common decency one would expect from a diplomat coming to represent a country.</p> <p>For such a diplomat to come to a neutral country, such as Ireland, and behave in that way, laugh off the prospect of an invasion and describe it as insane and for it to happen the very next day, calls into question his credibility.  If the Russian ambassador's credibility is in question, it would be appropriate to call him in and expel him and other Russian diplomats from Ireland at this time.</p> <p> I appreciate the Minister will say that could have the effect of us losing our embassy in Moscow.  However, we have to recognise that we have a crisis situation here.  It is an absolute crisis for millions of people in Ukraine and people throughout Europe who are terrified of what will happen when this goes all the way.  There is always the possibility that this can change.  However, if the Russians continue on the track on which they are going and conquer and hold Ukraine, as many imperialists have found in the past, it is sometimes easier to conquer a country than it is to hold it and I am sure the Russians will have that same experience.</p> <p> However, we hope we can have a solution here to turn this around.  Certainly, what we have seen happen in Moscow and in other cities throughout Russia where ordinary Russians have gone out to protest and to say this is wrong and to call for a different way forward gives heart that, perhaps, there can be a change.  Yet, we know that people can be so easily led in the wrong way.  Many Russians are certainly being led in the wrong way by Vladimir Putin and by what he is doing and the wrong and negative direction in which he is taking the Russian people.  It flies in the face of good international relations we have built up for so long.</p> <p> The United Nations has a key role to play.  We need to use our position on the UN Security Council to maximum benefit.  It is true to say we have quite a unique space there as a neutral country and we should use it to the maximum.  In that context, I offer our full support to any diplomatic efforts that have been made by the Minister, other diplomats, his Department and the Government, because we are all in this together.  We all recognise that what has happened here has been absolutely tyranny for the people of Ukraine and Europe.  We need to put every effort into trying to resolve this.</p> <p> We must also offer as much humanitarian support as possible.  People in Ireland, as ever, are more generous than anyone could ever imagine.  In every village and town throughout the country, we see people put their hands in their pockets and talk about having collections and assisting and welcoming people from Ukraine to Ireland, as we have always done.  Ireland as the country of welcomes is certainly something we need to bring to the fore at this time.</p></speech>

The assault by Putin and his forces on Ukraine is barbaric, foul and obscene and must be condemned.  It comes from a regime that has a long and brutal history of warmongering and despotism, whether it is suppressing dissent towards the regime by the Russian population or the bloody wars in Chechnya, Georgia and Moldova.</p><p>I was at the United States Embassy protesting last night.  I recalled the fact that in 1999, I stood outside that same embassy with very few people, it should be said, protesting against the Russian slaughter in Chechnya which claimed the lives of 50,000 to 80,000 people, but was little remarked on in the western world at the time.  It is vitally important we extend our solidarity to the Ukrainian people whose suffering is unspeakable.  We must do absolutely everything to extend humanitarian assistance, solidarity and support to Ukrainian people and defend, absolutely, their right to resist this brutal invasion of their country.</p><p>We believe the Government's motion is one sided because it does not, as our amendment does, allude to hope in this rather dark and grim situation - the Russian anti-war movement of ordinary Russians that has exploded on to the streets.  It proves that huge numbers of Russians do not stand behind Putin and oppose everything he is doing.  We must do absolutely nothing to undermine that movement of opposition to Mr. Putin but, rather, do everything we can to support and nurture that heroic resistance.</p><p>Most important, we must not pour petrol on this dangerous fire which could be inflamed to the terrifying, unthinkable point of the use of nuclear weapons, or deliberate or accidental catastrophes at nuclear power plants in that area.  It is critical we warn against any escalation.  As a neutral country, we have to be proactive in arguing against forces that wish to escalate this situation or seek to use it encourage militarisation, war and arms expenditure as a solution to the terrifying and dangerous situation we are witnessing in Ukraine.  That is why we think it is critically important to mention NATO.</p><p>That is not to excuse Putin's behaviour.  However, it was absolutely inevitable after the eastward expansion of NATO and the act of recruiting countries into a nuclear military alliance with a bloody history in Afghanistan and a history of bombing in Libya and whose major powers have been and are, as we speak, guilty of engaging in warmongering around the world.  They are not the allies of the Ukrainian people and, most certainly, should not be the allies of this country, as a neutral country.</p><p>Our job should be to argue against warmongering; involvement in military alliances, the arms industry and military expenditure and to urge peace and dialogue as the way to settle conflicts.

They are now the victims of war crimes carried out by Putin's army.  There is no justification for this imperialist invasion.  Russian troops should be withdrawn immediately and all refugees fleeing from Ukraine should be welcome into the EU and Ireland.</p>  <p>  I will address the campaign from large sections of the establishment to paint anyone who opposes escalation and the risk of nuclear war as, in some way, pro-Putin.  It is a disgusting slur designed to silence opponents of war in order to further the plans on display in this debate today to undermine Ireland's neutrality.  The idea that we are in some way soft on Putin is patently ridiculous.  One should look at the record.</p>  <p>  Who condemned Putin's horrendous invasion of Chechnya?  While Mr. Tony Blair rolled out the red carpet for Putin during that war, the socialist left opposed it.  Who spoke out against Putin's jailing of Pussy Riot and the repression of LGBTQ activists?  It was the left.  Who is on the streets in Russia in protest against the war right now?  A Putin ally in the Duma has called them Trotskyists and left scum.  Of course, it is much broader than the organised left.</p> <p>I want to be very clear.  It is not pro-Putin to say we do not want an escalation and to point out the dangers of a spiral towards an all-out war between nuclear powers, or to say we are against sanctions that are already having a devastating effect on the lives of Russian people.  It is not pro-Putin to oppose the one-sided nature of this motion, with no mention of NATO expansion into eastern Europe, no mention of the rights of minorities in Ukraine and no commitment to Ireland's continued non-membership of NATO.</p></speech>

We have watched our television screens in horror as their country has been invaded, their cities attacked, homes destroyed and their lives taken or shattered.  I state my support for the right of the ordinary Ukrainian people to defend themselves and resist, arms in hand, the invaders who threaten their homes and lives.  It is for the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian people alone to decide their own future, with a right to self-determination for minorities.</p>  <p>  I condemn this invasion.  The Putin regime is murderous.  It employs force at home to enforce its dictatorial rule over its own people and force abroad to advance it imperialist objectives, namely, its lust for power and profit.  Russian troops must be withdrawn back to their barracks in Russia and out of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I oppose those in the ruling classes in the West who would exploit this crisis to advance their imperialist and militarist objectives.  This includes the German Government, which plans to immediately treble its spending on arms.  It also includes the US political and military establishment, which plays the lead role in NATO and which killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people in a war for oil.</p>  <p>  I also oppose the agenda of this Irish Government, which seeks to align its foreign policy more closely with NATO.  Despite the comments made by Deputy Lahart in this debate, the comments of Deputy Flanagan in the House and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, on the radio show the real agenda, which will be opposed from this section of the House.</p>  <p>  I salute those brave Russian people who have taken to the streets to oppose this war.  I note that 1 million Russian people have signed petitions again the war.  Petitions will not stop Putin, of course, but 1 million people in the streets of Russia will represent not only a massive challenge to the war itself, but quite possibly, the beginning of the end of the Putin regime.  Protests and strikes on the streets of Russia marked the beginning of the end of the First World War, tsarist rule and capitalism in that country.  I hope that historical example can be repeated.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, I call on workers and young people in this country to take inspiration from the heroism of ordinary Ukrainians and follow the example of the Russian anti-war movement, and take to the streets here in massive numbers to say "No" to this war and build an anti-war movement.  That is something we need now in every country of the world.</p></speech>

In the few brief minutes I have before I share time with colleagues, I will hit on three points because we can have a discussion on so many different aspects that require attention.</p>  <p>  The first call I will make is for the Irish Government, in particular, to work with European partners directly on addressing the very real disinformation campaign that is being used by the Russian Government to undermine the efforts of the government in Ukraine to protect its people and, indeed, the efforts of many people in Russia to access the truth.</p>  <p>  That measures have been taken on Sputnik today to ban Russia from the airwaves in the EU is welcome.  Much more can be done by social media companies in particular, however.  It was easy enough for them to ban Donald Trump's Twitter account and yet they are not being half as proactive when it comes to tackling the propaganda from Putin sympathisers across social media.  The fact that so many of these social media companies are headquartered in Ireland behoves us to lead in the European Union to take a much stronger line.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the response from the Government to calls from many Deputies on this side of the House and, indeed, the other side, to expel the Russian ambassador and all 31 of his diplomats currently working in the Russian Embassy in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown.  I fundamentally repeat that call, however.  The Russian ambassador simply cannot be welcome in this State while Russia continues its illegal and bloody invasion of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I have a particular concern about the continuing presence of not one but two defence attach&eacute;s in the Russian Embassy in this State, an embassy which has previously had diplomats expelled from on suspicion of espionage.  The British Government only has one defence attach&eacute;.  We have much more work dealing with the British on defence matters due to the memorandum of understanding as well as historic reasons and yet the Russians have two attach&eacute;s.  It is a very suspicious approach to take.</p>  <p>  Unlike others, I fundamentally support and agree with every word spoken by and comment made by my party colleague, Deputy Flanagan, earlier in this debate.  He is right; rather than taking advantage, he is talking about a realistic concern that many of us in this country - a majority, in fact, if one looks at opinion polling - have with regard to our security and defence capabilities.  The fact that this country was the victim of a vicious cyberattack in August, by all accounts due to non-government operators with the protection of the Russian Government should be telling for all of us that we cannot simply continue to defend ourselves alone.</p>  <p>  The final point I will make is that the decision taken by the Irish Government to only partially support the European package for the Ukrainian Government earlier this week was a complete and utter cop out.  There is nothing stopping the Irish Government supporting the funding of the supply of lethal weapons to the Ukrainian army and people, every man and woman.  If we were in Ukraine today, all the men sitting in this House would be called up to defend the country.  That is what they are facing.  They cannot defend it with lights, flags, solidarity and all the nice things that are worthy.  What they really need is Javelin missiles and our support to ensure they can defend their homes and children.  We have all seen the horrific images.  Putin is now attacking civilian facilities and using cluster bombs.  He is engaging in the sorts of war crimes I hope will one day see him in the Hague.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100033#HH00400"><p>I strongly support today's motion.  I want to express solidarity with the Ukrainian people following an outrageous breach of international law by the Russian Federation.</p>  <p>  The images of refugees pouring into neighbouring EU countries, families separating at borders and civilians being targeted by cluster bombs are all stark, and reminiscent of images we hoped Europe would not see again.  This is an aggressive and hostile infringement of the sovereign integrity of Ukraine.  Ireland is militarily neutral but we are not neutral when it comes to egregious breaches of human rights and democratic norms in the Ukraine or anywhere else.  We have a proud tradition of military neutrality but we also have a proud tradition of independent foreign policy.</p>  <p>  I welcome the package of sanctions against Russia and assistance provided to Ukraine, in particular, and the speed with which these were approved following last week's invasion.  Three packages have been announced in just the last few days, which include removing air access, removing banks from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, SWIFT, system, sanctions against key individuals, sanctions against Belarus and limiting the propaganda power of Russia's puppet media.  Every one of these sanctions is a two-edged sword.  They will impact Russian interests but will also have an impact on Irish and EU interests.  However, we take them because we deem them to be necessary and justified.  I believe there is more we can do as a country to express our solidarity with Ukraine.</p>  <p>  In 2018, we expelled Russian diplomats following the poisoning incident in the UK.  The events of this week, when the Russian ambassador used our airwaves to spread lies and disinformation, and Russia invaded a sovereign nation and is targeting civilians in what could amount to war crimes, are incidents that I believe are at least comparable with the 2018 incident in the UK and, in reality, are far more grave.</p>  <p>  It is, therefore, time that we moved to expel their diplomats from Ireland again.  Like other sanctions, it will have consequences, but we should not be shy about taking the right decision.  Diplomacy is the formalised communication between nations, including the ultimate communication to sever that relationship.  It is ultimately a call for our Government.  In my view, however, all EU countries should expel Russian diplomats.  That is without prejudice to the EU as a block maintaining a diplomatic relationship that may be required to build a peaceful solution.</p>  <p>  In the very short time remaining, I must mention the triple lock mechanism, which I supported, that guarantees our military neutrality and multilateral approach to foreign policy.  However, it also hands Russia, China, Great Britain or the United States a veto on this State taking any military action, even on this island, because they are permanent members of the UN Security Council.  This D&aacute;il must ask itself whether we believe our sovereignty is best served by the interests of those nations.</p> <p>This is a question that is increasingly relevant, but which today's debate does not allow us to fully discuss.</p></speech>

A dictator has moved beyond threatening his neighbour.  Putin has rained total devastation and indiscriminate slaughter down on Ukraine.  He has gambled with the peace and stability of Europe, of his own country and of the world.</p><p>In 1936, &Eacute;amon de Valera addressed the United Nations in Geneva.  He lamented the unwillingness and the incapacity of the League of Nations to defend Ethiopia.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	Let us face the fact that every nation may when the test comes have many good reasons for shirking the terrible responsibility of entering upon a war.  Let us face the fact that not one of the fifty nations represented here is prepared to face war to preserve the principles of the League in the present dispute.  </blockquote>  <p>We speak of solidarity with Ukraine.  Hundreds of thousands across Europe are expressing solidarity in the only way they can.  They are taking to the streets.  They are active across social media.  They are making themselves heard.  As parliamentarians and as governments, the threshold for solidarity is much higher.  It is not enough for us to say that we support Ukraine.  We have influence.  We have power.  We can help Ukraine by our actions, or we can condemn it by our inaction.  We must give the people of Ukraine every chance of survival.  We have seen how they are standing up for democracy, for their right to self-govern and for their right to self-defence in the face of a man who is intent on destroying democracies and intent on maximising destruction on his neighbour.  </p><p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, spoke earlier of how impressed he was with the speed at which governments acted when it became clear that all-out war was imminent.  We have seen urgency and unity across the governments of Europe.  Positions that were long-held by states and by political parties shifted dramatically in a matter of days.  We have shown that governments need not be stagnant and slow moving.  They can be agile and responsive when people need it most.  We have seen immeasurable courage from the men and women of Ukraine.  The world is watching with awe as they face down the tanks of a military superpower.  We have seen political courage across the European Union as leaders and Ministers faced up to what was happening.  They saw it for what it was, namely, a war of aggression against a sovereign nation, a 1930s moment.  The sacred cows of non-intervention and neutrality have been shaken.</p><p>This responsiveness from the political establishment in Europe has given Ukraine a chance against the odds.  In my party, which is a pan-European party, we have always taken a firm stance against militarisation.  Our fundamental philosophy is to oppose it, but it has been recognised that we do not have the luxury of not being involved.  As Europeans, we are involved and across Europe we are facing up to that.  </p><p>Ireland must grapple with the same dilemma.  We are on the edge of Europe, but are we going to stand on the side-lines?  We must have the courage and resolve that we are seeing in the Ukraine and that we are seeing across Europe.Whether we like it or not, we are part of this 1930s moment.  This is a fight for democracy, for sovereign integrity and, possibly, for civilisation.  I commend this motion.</p></speech>

It is important that in this House we assess ourselves when it comes to deciding how we respond to the threat posed by Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s unlawful and brutal invasion of Ukraine.  We need to know what our capacities are and what our limitations are.</p>  <p>  The first thing we all need to acknowledge is that we are not a military power.  We do not have the type of military power that would have any impact on this invasion.  Even if we did, we could not use it, because of our long-standing policy of neutrality.  However, we need to look at where we are powerful and where we are significant.  This comes under two headings.  First, as a member of the European Union, we are very effective.  That is why I support the Government in what it has done by being part of the imposition of swingeing sanctions on the Putin regime, which I think will be effective.</p>  <p>  Second, and more important, we are an independent, sovereign State.  We are a State that has a proud record of standing up to aggression and of standing up for justice.  We need to emphasise that more.  We also need to recognise that when it comes to foreign policy, it is not a delegated function.  It is a competence that remains within the member state under the European treaties.  That is why I find it so hard to understand that a country that is as proud of Ireland is prepared to associate itself diplomatically with a regime that is at present committing war crimes.  We know that it is committing war crimes.  The Government says that it is committing war crimes and yet we are prepared to go along with this practice of permitting diplomatic relations between Ireland and Vladimir Putin's Russia.  We should call an end to it.  We should close our embassy in Moscow.  We should bring our diplomats home.  We should tell the Russian ambassador and his colleagues in the embassy, which is on the appropriately named Orwell Road, to depart, to get their bags and baggage and to leave this country.</p>  <p>  As to the reasons we do not do that, two reasons have been given.  First, we want to keep diplomacy open so that we can talk.  This is where self-awareness is important.  We are delusional if we think Vladimir Putin or his regime is going to listen to Ireland.  They have no interest in listing to Ireland.  The second reason we do not do it is that we are told it is important to ensure that a decision is made collectively by the European Union.  Foreign policy, as I said, is a competency of this country.  We should stand up proudly and we should lead the way diplomatically by saying that we want to get rid of the Russian ambassador from this country.</p>  <p>  If we look back at what has happened in Europe, we can see that different reasons and different decisions are being made by member states within the European Union.  That has happened already.  Some of them are participating militarily.  Others, such as us, are not.  It is not correct to say that we have to act collectively as a European Union.  By doing so, we are undermining our strength as an independent country.  </p></speech>

Like many Members here, it is vital that we give our solidarity to the Ukrainian people.  T&aacute;im an-s&aacute;sta a labhairt faoi saoirse na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine, and against the disgraceful Russian onslaught and the war crimes of Vladimir Putin and his army.  We have all seen the scenes.  Some Ukrainian people have made their lives in Ireland, in places like Dundalk.  They have seen what we have seen.  It is a lot more real for them.  We can only commend the courage of those who have returned to fight a foreign invader and to defend their homeland.  It is one of the things those I have spoken to locally bring up and commend. </p>  <p>  It is necessary that we play our part.  Everyone has spoken about financial sanctions.  There is a need to cut off the supply chain and to cut off the moneys to ensure that the war economy cannot operate.  I heard the Russian term &ldquo;bunt" earlier today, which refers to an uprising from the ground up.  It is the idea that one can overthrow a Russian leader.</p>  <p>  The big thing required is the courage and the bravery of the Ukrainian people.  What is also necessary is that things are made difficult for the Russian economy and for Vladimir Putin and that a determination might be made by others.  We have seen the bravery of people who have been protesting on the street.  Even some of the people who call him "boss" might think that the boss has gone too far and that it might be time for him to go because nobody knows where exactly he is intent on going at this point in time.  However, we all accept that it is somewhere very dangerous.</p>  <p>  We probably all expected that the Russian invasion would have had greater military success.  However, down to the defence put up by the Ukrainians, that has not been the case.  Our big fear is an escalation.  We are hearing of further attacks and of a probable escalation in various cities and towns around Ukraine at this point in time.  The future is incredibly scary.</p>  <p>  Brendan Murphy was in contact with both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me.  I spoke to him a couple of days ago.  He was very worried.  He had to stop his journey with his family.  They were under attack and they were obviously under really terrible conditions.  I think he is under slightly better conditions now and is closer to the border.  He sent me a message to say that between the Irish and the Ukrainians, they are being minded.</p> <p>I believe he is in contact with departmental officials and the work that is being done in that regard is, of course, utterly commendable.</p> <p> I might highlight a couple of things he mentioned in a message he sent to me within the past half an hour.  He stated that where he lived, the war is hard, with missile tanks and many Russians and Belarusians - these are his words, not mine - being wiped out.  He went on to state Putin's 60 km military column is being broken up, and described the conflict as a bitter war, with ordinary people stopping and disarming the invaders.  Missiles are a big problem, he wrote, because they are impersonal and kill anyone who is not strong.  All of this is ominous and none of it is good.</p> <p> Nevertheless, there also has been a response locally in towns such as Dundalk, where St. Patrick's GFC, for example, has been carrying out collections for Ukraine.  Many people will say that what is needed is money for the likes of UNICEF and the Red Cross and there is a difficulty in respect of medicines.  I and many others have been contacted by people who have pointed out there is a fear in respect of insulin supplies, given there may be only two or three days' worth of them in Ukraine.  Moreover, there is a lack of supply even in countries such as Poland.  People are looking into organising a collection here but that would need to be facilitated by the Department of Foreign Affairs and whoever else because it would not be possible to deliver these sorts of material by truck.  It would need to be co-ordinated and I would like to think work could be done in that regard.</p> <p> We all stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and I fully support the motion.  We have to do whatever we can to ensure the response will hurt in Russia and that it hurts Vladimir Putin's regime in order that we can see an end to the conflict.</p></speech>

Many Ukrainians already live among us and, indeed, play a big part in our day-to-day lives through work, sport and many of our social circles.  Since March last, there has been a call on the Departments of Transport and Enterprise, Trade and Employment to allow Ukrainian heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers to come to Ireland on work permits.  I have been told this has not been progressed because the Road Safety Authority, RSA, maintains that the Ukrainian driving licence is not recognised by Ireland as compatible.  As I have pointed out previously, a number of EU countries accept the Ukrainian HGV licence as compatible with the EU licence, including Italy and Portugal to name but two.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State that no further stress or hardship be placed on those who choose Ireland as the land of the free, as they flee the atrocities being visited on them and their loved ones.  Given all requirements have been lifted for visa qualification, can he ensure there is agreement on this issue from the RSA, not lame excuses arguing that the personnel in the area are no longer in the position?  It is quite an outrageous response.  Will the Minister of State please ensure measures can be put in place to satisfy the safety requirements and insist in the easement of accessing jobs for the people who may come here?  This would be a stitch in time that would save nine, and it is a measure that can be considered now in preparation.  It would allow those who wish to avail of Ireland as a means to getting their lives back on track to do so, and it might in some way distract them from the awfulness of what is happening by allowing them to avail of work and rebuild their lives here or when they return to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Finally, I condemn the actions of President Putin.  There have been many calls during this debate, but no words befit the cruel actions being taken against the Ukrainian people that we see minute by minute on our social media feeds.  Words are cheap; actions speak louder than words.  Pictures of the beautiful children such as Polina will be etched on our minds forever.  Every possible action must be taken to end this horror at the earliest possible opportunity.  I commend and will support the motion.</p></speech>

Watching the ominous pictures of columns of military vehicles heading towards Kyiv is deeply chilling and Ireland should, obviously, do everything it can to help the people of Ukraine.  I refer to everything in economic, financial and diplomatic terms to deploy pressure on Russia.  I welcome much of what the Government has done and I do not want this debate to be unnecessarily fractious but some critique in the Government's approach is warranted.</p>  <p>  The Ukrainian ambassador has asked Ireland to isolate Russia and that means sending home Russia's diplomatic mission to this State.  The Government is refusing to do that, which is a big mistake.  I have never seen a Government refuse to do what so many of its own Deputies have asked it to do.  It is unprecedented.  It is strange also that the Government is lauding itself, on the one hand, for being ahead of the rest of the European Union with regard to preventing flights from flying over Ireland's airspace, yet it is saying it cannot move until the rest of Europe does when it comes to sending the Russian ambassador home.  Ireland is refusing to exert its own sovereignty to support Ukrainian sovereignty.  It does not make sense.  Moreover, what is the Government going to do if a Russian aeroplane flies over Irish airspace?  Two Russian aeroplanes flew over Irish airspace in 2012 and we were powerless to do anything about it.  Will the Government scramble the Government jet to see whether it could stop it?</p>  <p>  I asked an important question earlier of the Taoiseach and he refused to answer it.  It relates to the Russian mission in Ireland and, allegedly, a number of spies who exist within it.  Is it the case that they exist?  The Minister of State might answer that in his concluding remarks.  It has been further alleged that Russia poses a significant threat to this State.  Is that the case, in his estimation?  When the Taoiseach was asked this question, he stated he was a realist when it comes to spies, which was an admission that they exist in this country and are doing damage to our interests.  That alone should be good reason for this country to send home the Russian embassy staff.</p>  <p>  Russian companies have sanctions against them and some of the companies are linked to firms that operate in the IFSC.  Firms in Ireland have been raising billions of euro and lending that money to Russian banks, which have been lending it to firms that have sanctions against them.  We cannot turn a blind eye to that if we want the impact of those sanctions to stick.  What will the Government do to ensure this country does not allow for the bypassing of sanctions?</p>  <p>  Ireland has not nearly exhausted the potential for humanitarian aid to Ukraine.  I find it strange that we have only touched the tip of the iceberg of what is necessary in humanitarian aid, yet Fine Gael Deputies are demanding that Ireland pursue lethal force.  This would do damage to Ireland&rsquo;s potential in the future to be seen as a strong, honest broker that can reach out to different factions and look for peaceful resolution.  We have a name internationally as a peaceful, honest broker.  We should not do damage to that by getting involved in the delivery of lethal force.</p></speech>

I wholeheartedly approve of and endorse the motion.  As the House will be aware, I have been raising concerns about the Ukraine situation in recent months.  Unfortunately, those concerns were well founded and now we are in a very dodgy place whereby Europe is once again at war, for the first time in the 21st century from the point of view of a land war.</p>  <p>  I utterly condemn the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, that is, not only the fact it is happening but also the manner in which it is being done.  We should not forget the bogus peace talks that were engaged in at the very start, where not only was time wasted from a European point of view but Mr. Putin used that time to pre-position his troops before he launched his attack.  We should never forget that.  Moreover, the conduct of the Russian ambassador is beneath contempt and should certainly be remembered.  He came to this Parliament twice in the past 12 months and lied through his teeth.  Nevertheless, that was good because we saw his true colours and every time that he said an attack was not going to happen, we knew instantly that it would, which certainly helped from a preparation point of view.</p>  <p>  The targeting of civilians in Ukraine is outrageous, as are the use of cluster munitions and the completely unacceptable escalation of the nuclear alert status from the baseline.  While I absolutely condemn the activities of the Russian Federation, I commend the conduct of the Ukrainian Administration and would like to see it continue.</p> <p>First, we have to remember the reason Ukraine is in this situation is that in 1994, it voluntarily agreed to hand over all its nuclear weapons.  Under the Budapest Memorandum, they gave Russia all their nuclear warheads in return for what they thought were security guarantees.  Ukraine utterly honoured its part of the agreement whereas we can see the Russian Federation utterly ignored its part.</p> <p> We should also remember that if you compare the two presidents, President Zelenskiy of Ukraine and President Putin of Russia, you can see a completely different approach.  One President is at home with his people and easy and comfortable in their presence and the other President sits at the end of a long table utterly afraid of his own shadow, basically, afraid of a few Covid bugs, not the hard man that we have been told he was in the past.</p> <p> I also welcome the response of the international community.  The sanctions regime is comprehensive and it was swift.  Ireland played a significant part from that point of view - the fact that there are financial sanctions, a travel ban and all the odds and sods that go with it - but the public displays of solidarity are important as well.  The lighting up of the buildings is absolutely essential.  It really motivates the Ukrainian people and demotivates those Russian soldiers who have access to the Internet.</p> <p> Most importantly, I very much approve of the upgrade of Ukraine's accession to the European Union.  It is now being classed as an accession candidate.  That political embrace is hugely important because President Putin - I should say "Mr. Putin" - basically thought by his actions he would be able to remobilise the old Soviet Union.  The reality is that he remobilised an entirely different union, the European Union, and it reminds us to go back to first principles in relation to why this Union exists in the first place.</p> <p> As for the Irish response, I welcome the extra &euro;10 million.  From a humanitarian point of view, Ireland was fast out of the blocks in that regard.  Humanitarian organisations are getting an extra &euro;10 million.  I also welcome the &euro;9.5 million through the European peace facility.  It is definitely unprecedented, from Ireland's point of view.</p> <p> I totally accept the coalition situation where there is a programme for Government.  It is a non-judicable programme.  It is only a political agreement but it should be honoured because it was voted on by the grassroots of the three constituent parties.  However, there are alternative pathways available in relation to the provision of lethal weapons.  That situation will develop over the next few days or weeks.  I suspect that the Government may have to amend its position in that regard.</p> <p> We can do more.  First, in respect of the Russian Embassy, I have listened to the counterarguments over the past few days as to whether the Russian ambassador should go home or should stay.  I propose a compromise.  At the very least, the Russian ambassador should be banned from attending the parliamentary precincts here.  He is no longer welcome in the Leinster House campus.  He lied to the Parliament and he lied to the people.  If Leinster House is the people's house, then he should be banned from here.  If the Minister wishes to have negotiations with the Russian ambassador, he can bring him to Iveagh House and carpet him there, and I hope the language of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will be neither parliamentary nor diplomatic in that regard.  That is what I would suggest.</p></speech>

As for whether we can enforce it or not, we all know the answer to that.  We should explore extending that to shipping as well to ban Russian ships from our ports and from our territorial waters.</p>  <p>  The Minister, through the European Union, should also have an additional range of sanctions available for primarily one reason.  The Russian forces have thermobaric munitions in Ukraine at present.  They are not officially classed as weapons of mass destruction but I have seen what they can do in Homs and in Aleppo and we all know what they did in Grozny, Chechnya.  If thermobaric munitions are deployed, unprecedented massive additional sanctions should be unleashed.</p>  <p>  We are hoping for a diplomatic outcome here.  I urge the Russian Federation to implement a ceasefire, to withdraw its troops and to return its alert status for its nuclear weapons back to the baseline from whence it came.</p></speech>

I was appointed by the Ceann Comhairle as the convenor of the Irish-Russian parliamentary group.  We had a discussion following the invasion of Ukraine at the weekend and the Ceann Comhairle decided, in conjunction with the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, that the Irish-Russian parliament group would be dissolved yesterday.  The Ceann Comhairle issued a statement, which quoted me, that it was being done in full support of and solidarity with the Ukrainian Parliament and the Ukrainian people.  That job has been done, effectively and well.  Following the Russian invasion, the Ceann Comhairle's act of solidarity has been the right and appropriate one to make.  It reflects the views right around the country that that should be the case.</p>  <p>  This day, millions of despairing Ukrainians are fleeing for their very lives from their family homes - men to bear arms to do battle for freedom against the Russian invader and women and children to undertake arduous and desperate journeys seeking sanctuary and a safe haven in western Europe, and looking to places such as Ireland where they will find a place of safety.</p>  <p>  Cities all over Ukraine are daily under appalling cruise missile and artillery assault while combat-hardened Russian troops and battle tanks creep closer each day to the centre of cities such as Kyiv and threaten the innocent men, women and children who may still reside there.  Brave and determined patriotic Ukrainian soldiers are fighting resolutely and with superhuman effort to resist the invader but there is no doubt but that the dark fog of war that is swirling around in Ukraine emanates solely from the decision of one man, the Kremlin dictator, safe in his gilded palace in Moscow, as Deputy Berry said, at his long table away from and afraid of everybody.</p>  <p>  We in this country and, indeed, the EU and the free world call for Russia to end its military aggression in the Ukraine and we demand an immediate ceasefire.  I have no doubt but that Ireland, as a member of the United Nations Security Council, is working unceasingly for a peaceful resolution of this crisis and we are ready, willing and able to assist in that manner.</p>  <p>  I salute the unquenchable spirit of the Ukrainian people, as all of us do, led as they are in their resistance by the resolute and brave democratically-elected President Zelenskiy.  He is a man for all seasons.  He is somebody who shines out and gives all of us who believe in democracy a shining light to follow and to support.</p>  <p>  The Irish people have responded to this crisis with great generosity.  Every town and village is organising practical support, help and assistance and we are ready, willing and able to assist refugees who may come here.</p>  <p>  We hear today of a 60-km long Russian military convoy approaching Kyiv which has the capacity to pulverise and raze that proud city to the ground and massacre many of its remaining inhabitants.  Please God, they will not succeed in this objective.  The truth, the fundamental truth, the universal truth is that good must prevail over evil and might is not right.  I believe that the blue and yellow national flag of Ukraine will never be replaced on the flagpoles of Ukraine by the flags of temporary imposters from aggressive military occupiers.  The only other flag that should be welcome alongside their national emblem of Ukraine will, I believe, be the blue flag with the gold stars of our united European Union.  We in the European Union and Ireland must now earn our place on that flagpole by our continued determined unequivocal support for Ukrainian membership of the European Union, and, indeed, expand further our Union to further interested nations.</p>  <p>  We must also, as an island on the edge of Europe, play our full part in ensuring the safe defence of the European Union into the future and have a full national debate, and an informed debate, on how this can best be done.  We stand absolutely united behind the Ukrainian people.  I fully support all the actions which the Government and, indeed, the European Union are taking in this situation.</p></speech>

Their sovereignty and territorial integrity has been so illegally and callously attacked.  As a country which has historically suffered many threats to our own sovereignty, our hearts in Ireland are breaking for the people in Ukraine and, indeed, for all those living through war while praying for peace.</p> <p>We have sent a very clear message to Russia - both as a country and as a member of the European Union - that Putin's war will not be tolerated.  With the rouble crumbling, we can see that is having the desired effect.</p> <p> I understand where the national outcry for expulsions and independent actions against the Russian regime is coming from and I agree.  It is very clear that we have been blatantly lied to and fed misinformation and disinformation in recent weeks, if not months and possibly longer by Russian representatives in Ireland.  However, it is growing ever clearer that our strength lies in our union with Europe.  Ultimately, any unilateral decisions on Ireland's part would not serve the Ukrainian people or the Irish people.  For that reason, we must act collectively, boldly and bravely.</p> <p> I very much welcome the swift action by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, to waive visa requirements for those fleeing Ukraine.  I have been heartened by the support and welcoming nature of the Irish people towards Ukrainians here in Ireland.  However, even the most optimistic outlook on the war could not see it being over in 90 days.  I seriously doubt it would be safe for Ukrainians to return home then.  I welcome the ongoing talks with the EU to allow Ukrainians to stay and work here for up to three years.  It is our moral duty to support these people and their families whose worlds have been so violently turned upside down.  I would welcome an update from the Minister on plans to treat Ukrainian citizens the same as EU citizens and to extend to them the right to work and social protection.  That must be done soon, given the indefinite nature of this crisis.</p> <p> I welcome the confirmation from the Minister for Justice today that work has started on activating the temporary protection directive.  A number of people have raised the matter of documentation with me.  I urge the Minister to take a compassionate approach to the current travel requirements and documentation such as passports.  Like many, I have been horrified by reports of white people being prioritised to leave Ukraine, while people of colour are held back at Ukrainian borders.  I want to put that on the record of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> We all feel very helpless watching what is going on.  The first question many people ask is what they can do to help.  Lots of people have contacted my office to ask about that.  People have offered to welcome Ukrainian people into their own homes.  I would be interested to know if we will have a system set up to allow people to register their interest to host Ukrainians coming to Ireland.  Over the weekend there were countless people and organisations arranging collections of supplies and support for Ukraine, including transition year students in Griffeen Community College.  I understand the advice is that continuing to send these supplies may clog up transport channels.  For those looking to help, the easiest way to do this is through financial donations.  Some 60,000 Irish people have already donated more than &euro;1.3 million to the Irish Red Cross Ukraine crisis appeal.  I urge people to please do so if they can.</p></speech>

The bravery and heroism of Ukrainian soldiers, its President and its people is profound.  We in Ireland must do everything we can to protect and support Ukraine and its people.  The Ukrainian people and their Government did not seek this war with Russia, instead this conflict has been thrust upon them by a man detached from the reality of the modern world.  The Ukrainian people did not invade Russia.  The Ukrainian people did not ship separatists to Donbas or Crimea.  The Ukrainian people did not use cluster bombs on apartment blocks.  The Ukrainian people did not target hospitals, killing countless innocent children.  Vladimir Putin did.  He has taken the course that has been chosen by history's worst monsters.  He is a tyrant, whose fear and ideological crusade of greed and conquest will reduce the Russian Federation to a pariah state, without access to international investment, support, or sympathy.</p><p>A simultaneous war of disinformation is raging in Russia itself, which is why the international community must reach past the Kremlin and speak directly to the Russian people through any means possible.  I applaud the steps that are being taken to do this online but we must do more.  Ukrainian citizens can come to Ireland without the burden of normal processes.  We will support them with housing, healthcare, education and, most importantly, family reunification.</p><p>We do not yet know where this war will lead us.  Putin is intent on redrawing the map of Europe and the restoration of some imagined idea of Russian empire.  It was around this time eight years ago in 2014 that Ukrainian civilians, that is, normal people - mothers, fathers, teachers, bus drivers, nurses and shop workers - took to the streets and to Maidan Square in Kyiv in what became known as the Revolution of Dignity.  They protested a Government seeking to prevent their country moving towards the European Union.  I have visited Ukraine twice in recent years and on behalf of the Oireachtas, I observed its free and fair elections.  Ukraine has the right to self-determination and to determine its own foreign policy.</p><p>Ignoring evil will not stop evil.  I commend Russian citizens who have had the courage to protest this war in Russian cities, knowing a despotic dictator such as Putin would have them arrested, which he did.  Today, we see again the dignity of the people of Ukraine and their rightful President, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.  We must support their efforts to become an EU member state as quickly as possible.  The international community must continue to roll out crippling sanctions, including in hard-to-reach places, like legally complex investment vehicles right here in Ireland.  We must seize the aggressors' wealth immediately.  I commend this motion.  <i>Slava Ukraini</i>.</p></speech>

What can we do for the Ukrainian people at the moment?  First and foremost, they are looking for humanitarian aid.  We need to get food out there.  There is a co-ordinated European approach, and it needs to happen immediately.  We need to fast-track Ukraine's membership of the EU.  That will send a strong statement to the Russians that we are four-square behind the Ukrainians.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer to the security of the State.  We had the Irish Aviation Authority before the transport committee on 2 February.  The only country that flew aeroplanes near Ireland without transponders on was Russia.  There have been five incidents in total since 2017: one in 2017, three in 2020 and one in 2021.  As a country, we need to invest heavily in proper radar equipment.  It will cost between &euro;100 million and &euro;200 million.  That needs to happen as a matter of urgency.  There is great frustration among the public as well as the body politic at the behaviour of the Russian ambassador to Ireland.  However, we have Irish citizens in Russia and Irish citizens in Ukraine and we must look after their interests as well.  That is why it is most important that we maintain the embassies in those specific countries.</p></speech>

As a citizen of a country that understands the impact of occupation and imperialist aggression, I offer whatever support I can to these people.</p>  <p>  I also add my full condemnation of the actions of the Russian President.  We debated in this House previously that Ireland must use its seat on the United Nations Security Council more robustly.  We must now do whatever we can to stop this war and ensure the rights of the Ukrainian people to a peaceful future as a sovereign independent state.</p>  <p>  As a militarily neutral state, Ireland has played a widely recognised role in peacekeeping and in the battle against nuclear proliferation.  The Russian President's actions must be roundly condemned.  No country should be subjected to the kind of military aggression and destruction that has been brought to the people of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I also extend my solidarity to those ordinary citizens of Russia who are brave enough to protest against this war imposed by President Putin and have been arrested in their thousands.  We must make every effort as a country to sanction Russia here in this State.  We need to make our position very clear by expelling the Russian ambassador and ending the practices within the International Financial Services Centre that facilitated the &euro;118 billion being funnelled from this State to Russia's oligarchs.  We must use every democratic process available to us to impose sanctions and to bring a speedy and peaceful resolution to stop this war.</p>  <p>We must redouble our diplomatic efforts while simultaneously supporting Ukrainian people and sanctions against the regimes that are now in place.  Democracy, international law, human rights and peace are what we must focus on.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Government's decision to contribute to Ukraine via the purchase of protective equipment.  Our neutral status puts us in a unique position to work with others to end the war which is causing so much suffering to the people across Ukraine.  The EU must act with sanctions on such a scale that there can be no doubt that we will not stand by and allow Putin to continue his imperialist ambitions in Ukraine.</p> <p> I would like to make a comment in response to Deputy Richmond.  The most recent poll, which was discussed last night on the Claire Byrne show, shows very clearly that the vast majority of people - in fact, 76% of the 1,000 people who were polled - want Ireland to maintain its neutral status, and that must be heard.</p> <p> To conclude, let me reiterate my condemnation of the actions of Russia and my solidarity to the Ukrainian people and to all those countries which are suffering at the hands of oppressors, like the Palestinian people at the hands of Israel.  It is time for the UN and this Government to stand up and stand firm for all small nations under occupation.</p></speech>

We have heard and seen so much in the past few days about Ukraine and the terrible way its people are being treated in their own country by Russia, a move sanctioned by the Russian Government but which may not be supported by the majority of its Russian people.  In the past few days, we have heard some politicians in this country make wild statements about expelling the Russian ambassador.  This might sound like a popular move but common sense must prevail here and doors must remain open so the mad actions of Russia will be condemned at the highest levels in this country.</p>  <p>  Ireland must focus most of our efforts on something we can do, and this is to make the Ukrainians who come here welcome and comfortable in Ireland.  From what I can gather, no accommodation provision has been made for anyone coming from Ukraine to Ireland.  This is typical - all talk but little or no action.  I spoke to the Ukrainian community in west Cork over the weekend in Bandon, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bantry.  Many of them told me they are living in one-bed apartments and are expecting family to arrive here.  In some cases, five to ten adults and children will arrive on a 90-day visa and all are expected to cram into a one-bed apartment.  This is not good enough and the Government must act quickly.</p>  <p>  We may ask what is the solution.  What about our lovely community centres and parish halls across the country?  While this is not the perfect solution, surely it is better than putting ten people in a one-bed apartment.  At least they will be treated with some respect and dignity if the State were to work with local communities to provide these excellent facilities with a little financial aid.</p>  <p>  In the past few days, I have seen what I always knew was in this country - an outpouring of love and kindness as a Ukraine family were reunited yesterday in Dublin Airport and last night in Ballydehob, after a nightmare journey.  It started in Kyiv last Friday morning when they went to their local hospital with their five and a half year-old son, who has leukaemia, to be met at the hospital by the medical team, who gave the boy&rsquo;s mother and father the boy&rsquo;s medical records and told them to flee the country immediately.  This started an incredible 77-hour journey, ending in Ballydehob last night.  I would like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs for its co-operation, the staff in my office, who followed every minute of the highly dangerous journey for the family, night and day, and the family themselves for being brave enough to get out and seek immediate medical attention for Leonid in this country.  This journey for Yana, Sergei, Svetlana and, last but certainly not least, the real hero, Leonid, a five-year-old child who is now in the wonderful care of medical professionals in this country, must have looked like an impossible journey.  To leave behind their country, their home and their loved ones must be a heartache beyond words.  No matter how Victoria, David and Sasha show kindness in Ballydehob, the hearts and minds of that family who came from Ukraine must be in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I would like to thank the doctor, nurses and staff in the Mizen Medical Practice in Schull for the wonderful care shown to Leonid, who was to undergo a bone marrow transplant in Ukraine on 10 March.  I would also like to pay tribute to other medical professionals in Cork, Dublin and Belfast who have put out the hand of love to these people through me since their arrival in Ireland yesterday.</p>  <p>  There are many other people out there who are in our thoughts.  Eugene O'Sullivan from Bantry is out in Ukraine at the moment and I was in contact with him over the weekend, and there are many more.  We are doing our level best but we need to look at the accommodation side.</p></speech>

We welcome those who are seeking refuge here in Ireland and those who have already arrived here safely, especially one girl I know of who arrived in Killarney late last night after travelling from the very first moment of the attack all the way to the Hungarian border, where she was met by her Killarney boyfriend.  Her mother is following now.  She had been in the car as well but the girl's grandmother got sick and was not able to make the journey, so her mother was not able to come any further.</p>  <p>  We are asking what we can do.  I thank the staff and management of Michael J. Hoare&rsquo;s machinery sales in Killorglin, in particular Nuala, Timmy, Claire and all of those who are making a massive effort to collect at their premises the utensils, first-aid, bandages, non-perishable food and any other goods that would be of benefit.  These are wonderful people who thought of this initiative off their own bat and they are doing their very best to help the Ukrainian people by collecting all of these things.</p>  <p>  What guns, ammunition or artillery do we have in the Curragh that is not being used at the minute?  I do not think it has been used for many years.  Maybe we should think of sending this stuff off to people who are trying to defend their families, to the men out there trying to defend their children and their elderly parents.  If there is no use for it, and I do not see that there is at the present time, I ask that we send it out there to them.  It is frightening to think that we see 40 miles of Russian troops along the motorways into Kyiv and think of what they are going to do when they arrive there.</p>  <p>  We need to hurt this fellow in his pocket, where it hurts him most, and we all support that initiative.  Surely we must stop importing coal from Russia, cop on and have our own natural gas terminal in the Shannon estuary, and get energy from places that might make it readily available to us, so we will not be hurting people in other countries.</p></speech>

I see his arm is in a sling.  I did not notice it last week, in case he thinks I was inadvertently avoiding it.  I do not know cad a tharla but I hope he will be better soon.  I do not know if he is in a fit condition to be sent out to use those weapons Deputy Healy-Rae is talking about.</p>  <p>  Last Sunday - D&eacute; Domhnaigh seo caite - in Cahir - Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh - Josephine Casey, Patsy McGurk, Fidelma Nugent, Sergeant Ray Moloney and many others organised a wonderful event in music, song and chant for Ukrainian people and the many other nationalities and newcomers we have in our State.  They are not new anymore and one family I met there now has four generations in Ireland.  They are playing their part here in Ireland and we must play our part to support them.  It was a wonderful, spirited occasion and I salute the companies involved.</p>  <p>  In Seachtain na Gaeilge, we have the adage of meitheal and n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  It is very important and we have seen it in every parish, with people organising and coming together to see what we can do.  We are a neutral country but we can provide the medicines.</p> <p>I am a diabetic and I have insulin.  We just take it for granted.  To think that they might only have two or three days' supply is unthinkable.  What is happening is unspeakable.  I compliment Deputy Michael Collins and Valerie in his office and other staff on the heroic efforts that they made over the weekend to get that buachaill &oacute;g back here to Ireland.  Hopefully he will be able to get a donor now.  He had a donor where he was but they made the decision that they had to send him away.  And that hospital where he was going to have his operation was actually bombed either today or last night.</p> <p> How horrific can it be?  Man's inhumanity to man.  We have to do what we can with financial support but also with these goods.  In every parish, people are offering trucks and to drive them, keeping them safe while they are being filled and when they are full, sending them out to eastern Europe into the jaws of war.  It is so important.</p> <p> We must send a signal to the rest of the world that war is not the answer to anything.  We must support those people.  Many of them have being living here for four generations.  Many of them are welcome.  There are issues about housing our own people; I raised them earlier.  There are people saying this, that and the other, but it is 90 days for the moment.  It might be much longer.  In the spirit of compassion, integrity and decency, Irish people will put them up in community halls, in their homes or wherever.  We did it for Kosovo and other places.  I have fond memories of that.  We were recognised for doing that.  That is the role we must play.  I do not support calls to dismiss the Russian ambassador.  We have Irish citizens in Russia and there are many Russian people here who have nothing to do with this horrible war.  We should keep the lines of communication open.  I thank the Ukrainian ambassador.  He was here last week and he helped Deputy Michael Collins earlier today with translating and other issues because all the medical records are in a different language.  We must do what we can.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.</p></speech>

Over the past week, what we have seen unfolding before our eyes are acts of violence and cruelty, and an attack on the most fundamental principles of sovereignty, self-determination and democracy.  Few of us every expected to see scenes like this unfold in our lifetime and on our continent.  We have also seen the resolve of Ukrainian citizens, in Ukraine and abroad, standing up against Russian aggression and this existential threat against their country.  As others have stated, our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine.  We stand with them in this hour of need.</p>  <p>  This is a moment for European solidarity, not just in words but in actions too.  The Irish public has been rightly horrified by events in Ukraine.  As the Taoiseach said earlier, the Government must be generous in its response to the crisis.  That is what the Irish public want to see.  People have already begun to arrive from Ukraine, including a small number who have claimed international protection.  In the coming days, we expect to see, for the first time in 15 years, unaccompanied minors from Ukraine arriving into Ireland and seeking international protection.  We are potentially facing into a level of displacement not seen within Europe since the Second World War.  Collective solidarity across the EU is the best response to this crisis.  In this collective response, Ireland will not be found wanting.</p>  <p>  This is a moment of international crisis.  Our country may be asked to make a collective national effort to provide sanctuary for civilians.  If that happens, all of Government and every community in this country must rise to that challenge and do our part to help all those from Ukraine who seek refuge here, whether in the short term or for longer.  That is the character of Irish people and what our people expect us as their political leaders.  We have a strong track record in this area in recent years.  In responding to the ongoing crisis in Afghanistan, we offered humanitarian visas to more than 500 vulnerable individuals through the Irish refugee protection programme.  We are also continue to meet our ongoing commitments to support Syrian refugees who are integrating into communities across the country.  We are ready to provide accommodation to Ukrainian refugees who are offered temporary protection in Ireland.  I want to support as many people as possible.  The Government wishes to support as many people as possible.  I know this is the also desire of the Irish people.</p>  <p>  It is too early as yet to know what the likely demands on our assistance will be.  Many Ukrainians may wish to remain close to the border with Ukraine in order to enable them to return home as soon as possible, if that becomes feasible.  Officials from my Department are working closely with all Departments and State agencies under the co-ordination of the Department of the Taoiseach.  This work will allow us identify the type and the scale of the resources needed to ensure that Ireland is a position to respond in a comprehensive and compassionate manner to those fleeing the crisis in Ukraine.  We will work intensively in the days and weeks ahead to demonstrate to the people of Ukraine that we stand with them in this hour of need and that in the face of this indefensible aggression, our shared humanity will win out in the end.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-01a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1454" speakername="Michael Creed" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030100039#OO00300"><p>My son who is in primary school asked me at the weekend whether we are facing a world war.  When I realised that I could not give a monosyllabic answer to a very straightforward question, it encapsulated the magnitude of the event we are discussing today.  I rise in support of the Government motion in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and in condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  It is a breach of international law.  It is a monumental failure of politics, which is the stock-in-trade of what we do.  We have to accept that internationally, as politicians, we have failed.  It is inconceivable that having seen the devastation of a world war on European soil and European citizens in living memory that we could be on the cusp of that again.  That is why we must recognise that this is a watershed moment.  History has a habit of repeating itself.  We know the consequences of appeasement in the 1930s.  Appeasement of Putin to date has led us to this situation.</p>  <p>  Words matter.  I welcome the apparent consensus.  It is broadly nuanced in certain circumstances and belated from other quarters within this House.  Nevertheless, I welcome the broad consensus of the contributions to this debate.  However the genesis of this problem goes back at least to 2014 and the invasion of Crimea by Russia.  On that occasion, unfortunately, many within this House and others who have flown this nest and gone elsewhere failed the test in that appeasement of Putin's Russia on those occasions.  The voting record of members of the European Parliament then and subsequently, even as recently as December, is a travesty of appeasement of a brutal regime that breaches international law and has led us to where we are today.</p>  <p>  As I say, words matter in politics.  They are the stock-in-trade of our profession.  Unfortunately, many have failed the test.  I welcome the international coalition that has been amassed.  I acknowledge in particular the role played by the Government and the support it has received in the House and from the people at large for the actions taken.  The stock-in-trade of the Putin regime has included breaches of international law, suppression of dissent and poisoning.  The list is endless.  We should have no truck with that.  There should be no equivocation in respect of lawlessness.</p>  <p>  Last week I attended the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, parliamentary assembly meeting in Vienna.  I took the opportunity on Thursday to express the solidarity of this Parliament and the Irish people with the Ukrainian people.</p> <p>One of the most telling contributions at that meeting was made by the Ukrainian representative, who said if we think this is going to end in Ukraine, we are making a monumental mistake.  His prediction was if Putin succeeds in Ukraine the next stop is Moldova.  Thereafter, he will continue unfinished business in Georgia and in doing all that he will be destabilising Russian minorities within the European Union's borders and heading for the Baltic states.  In that context, I acknowledge the role we have played in building that consensus and the actions we have taken, while suggesting one or two others.  We could follow the Turks' example in closing the Bosporus.  We could close the Skagerrak.  That would close off a marine avenue for Russian trade that would be significant.  It is something that could be considered by the Heads of Government, the Council of Ministers, etc.  We should also consider another maritime step.  We should not purchase any of the proceeds of the Russian fishing fleet, which I think would be significant.</p> <p> I acknowledge I am impinging on Deputy Calleary's time.  What is needed is regime change.  I salute the opposition in Russia.  It is a monumentally brave act to put your head above the parapet in Russia and stand up against Putin's regime.  We need regime change in Russia.  We need to ensure the cyberattacks, poisonings, interference with foreign elections and suppression of civilian and political dissent comes to an end so we can have normal relations.  I acknowledge the calls made by others for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador.  Action should be taken against the Russian diplomatic service in Dublin.  I acquiesce to the judgment of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Government as to who should bear the brunt of that, but it is undoubtedly true the incumbent is a yes-man and an apologist for the Putin regime.  Whether his presence here can continue or not is something that is up for question, but we need to have avenues of communication open.  I am reminded of Kissinger's remarks on America in Europe when we asked who do you call when you want to talk to Europe.  We need somebody to talk to.  There are Irish citizens in Russia.  Russia may well call the shots in Ukraine temporarily in the weeks to come, and we have citizens there also.  I conclude by acknowledging the role played by our diplomatic mission in Kyiv in particular.  It has done a fantastic job of work in the most difficult of circumstances.</p></speech>

As we were doing so, President Putin was making arrangements to cross the border and invade Ukraine.  As we speak, Kyiv is being bombarded with missiles.  Last night, Fergal Keane, who has observed so many of these situations, finished his report with a father touching his son, who was inside a train, through the glass and on the glass.  He said: "What cannot be held must be let go, until another day".  That is the reality for families.  They are being split.  They are being torn apart and torn asunder.  Fergal Keane also said he had seen scenes he had never imagined he would see, and he is a war correspondent who, unfortunately, has many years of experience and exposure.</p>  <p>  I understand the Government's position on the Russian ambassador, but what about when somebody cannot give a credible answer?  He was challenged last Friday evening on RT&Eacute; that he is an apologist for slaughter.  He had no credible answer to that challenge from David McCullagh.  He said it was a matter for the Irish Government.  We must ask ourselves if is this somebody who has respect for the views of the Irish people and who we can do business with.  I accept the need to keep diplomatic channels open, but is it worth keeping them open when we are not being listened to?</p>  <p>  We need to be able to stand up, as a Government and as a country, and say that within the IFSC and within the section 110 trusts, no Russian operations are being financed or facilitated through the existence of said trusts or through the support of work relating to them.  If we cannot do that or clearly say that, then we need to act as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said about the ordinary Russian people.  Many of them are taking brave steps to outline their opposition to all this.  They should be supported and acknowledged.</p>  <p>  As a final point, we need to act cohesively.  Last Wednesday night, I traced how, as Deputy Creed said, this has been going on since 2014.  Since then, we have had a relaxation on the part of many institutions, including the EU.  I acknowledge the huge steps taken in the past few days, but they have come too late.  We need the resolution of the past few days to be continued and strengthened.  All of us, as member states and citizens, need to look in the mirror and ask ourselves if we are doing enough.  Are we doing enough, as member states, to cut this off at the head?  Unless we do that and cut every asset, source of finance and source of support off we cannot look at ourselves in the mirror properly.</p></speech>

I have a slight few more minutes than I had on the last occasion but my message is exactly the same, notwithstanding the blatant breach of international law by Russia, which went in on the day after I made my speech.  I stood up as a voice for peace and asked for this country to be that voice as well.  That is the role we will have to play and we have no choice about it.  I say to mhuintir na h&Uacute;cr&aacute;ine we stand with you for every possible human help we can give you.  I welcome the package of help offered and the sanctions that have been highlighted.  I would like to see the details of those to discern whether some of the sanctions are self-serving or are they actually serving what they are setting out to do.  I would also like to see the details for helping the people who come here.  I welcome it and also the two &euro;10 million amounts highlighted, although one of them is a matter for discussion on another day.  It is dancing on the top of a needle in the context of lethal and non-lethal weapons, but it is for another day.</p>  <p>  I wish to pick up on Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's remarks.  He said that we are a sovereign, independent country.  I totally agree with him on that.  He went on to say we should use that independence in making decisions about expelling diplomats and other things.  I agree with him on that.  We are an independent, sovereign state.  We should reflect on what that means and how we can use it because it does not mean sitting idly by.  I repeat we will not sit idly by in the face of what is going on.  However, we must do that in full knowledge we are a neutral country with a powerful voice.  How do we then use that voice?  We build on the trust and respect we have gained that allowed us to get a seat on the UN Security Council on a temporary basis because people trusted us.  Countries trust us.  We are in serious danger of losing that trust if we go with the vast majority of the call here on the right to move forward to a military alliance.</p>  <p>  Ours is a tiny country of approximately 5 million people.  We have experienced much in our lifetimes and we should build on that and use it.  I go forward to what has been mentioned as the hypocrisy of some of our attitudes.  We all got a briefing on Yemen today and I have it here.  When I hear we stand up to the egregious breaking of human rights I fully agree but we do it on a very selective basis.  There have been seven years of war in Yemen and 10,000 is the minimum number of children.  When we look at children, it does not matter which country and which war - I abhor it.  The minimum number of children is 10,000.  The number who have died is 377,000.  Time is running on.  The figures are here and we have done nothing, as a neutral country.  We have stood idly by and watched Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who did not vote for the action against Russia, interestingly enough.  We have stood idly by.</p></speech>

We play around.  Amnesty International has produced a report on Palestine.  I will have two and a half minutes tomorrow night to speak on that.</p> <p>Amnesty International has clearly asked this Government to do something and all governments to show solidarity and not stand idly by, but that is what we are doing.  The Taoiseach has told us that he feels uncomfortable with the word "apartheid", but that was the finding.  Amnesty International did not say that Israel was an apartheid state.  Rather, it said that Israel operated an apartheid regime.  The report was specific and based on years of research.</p> <p> When we talk about the egregious breaking of laws, we keep our respect if we keep a voice that is consistent, powerful and truthful so that people can rely on us and see that we have integrity and our words mean something.  War is abhorrent.  This is much bigger than Russia.  This is much bigger than Ukraine.  There is a huge threat of nuclear war.  If that does not encourage us to stand back and reflect as a neutral country, God help us.</p></speech>

Implicit in that is the absolute right of Ukraine to determine its own future and alliances, including membership of the EU.  I am pleased to see that the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly, with just nine against, to approve EU membership for Ukraine.  The right to self-determination includes Ukraine's right to join NATO if that is the choice of the democratically elected Ukrainian Government.  The first paragraph of this motion references our right as the Irish nation to determine our relationships with other nations.  It is the same for Ukraine and, indeed, the Baltics - the tiny Estonia and the slightly larger Latvia and Lithuania - if they wish to remain members of NATO and not bow to Putin's threats.  Those countries have declared their independence and have democratically elected governments.  That is the beginning, middle and end of it.  If we proclaim our right not to join NATO, then they have an equal right to join or not to join it.</p>  <p>  The attack on Ukraine was premeditated and well planned, as Putin amassed his troops on the borders of Ukraine for many months, the details of which are clearly outlined in the European Parliament motion on Ukraine of 15 December.  The invasion of Ukraine is another step in years of Russian action dating back to 1991 and, latterly, to 2014 and Euromaidan &ndash; support for promoting Brexit, interference in US elections, the proliferation of disinformation and cyberattacks linked to Russia, including that on our own HSE.  All of this was done in an effort to destabilise, sow doubt and dissent between countries, weaken our democratic states and undermine our institutions, especially those that promote civil and human rights.  While we strongly pledge our support to Ukraine, it is important to remember that this is not an isolated incident.  It is part of a pattern meant to establish a new world order.  It is a frightening prospect for all of us but a terrifying one for those in Kyiv and other cities.</p>  <p>  As I drove from Sligo to Boyle this morning, a distance of just over 40 km, I could not help but think of the 40 km convoy of troops, tanks and missiles bearing down on Kyiv and the shocking despair of those waiting in bunkers and underground and those defending their city.  I am afraid that we may spend many more days, weeks and even months watching our large and small screens as this unfolds in front of us and asking ourselves what we can do as individuals and collectively as a government.  Many of the actions taken by Ireland as part of the EU contribute to a strong response &ndash; closing off money trails to Russian banks, freezing many of the assets of the Russian Central Bank, enforcing no-fly zones, etc. &ndash; but I have a question.  I am not sure that all the loopholes have been closed.  We know that money finds a way to move.  Oil and gas find a way to move and they have to be paid for.  I am genuinely asking whether we have done all that we can.  Where the IFSC and the upwards of &euro;118 billion in dark money moving through Dublin and on to Moscow and elsewhere are concerned, have we done everything that we can?  I am not sure that our hands are clean, and if we are unsure, then now is the time to wash them.</p>  <p>  We are not sending military hardware to Ukraine because we are neutral.  I support that position.  We might revisit it but that is for another day.  We have contributed &euro;10 million and will contribute a further &euro;9.5 million.  Many Irish citizens are contributing.  Perhaps the Government might consider the State matching those contributions, whatever they are.</p>  <p>  My final point is on our role in the UN.  It is an area where, as a neutral state, we can make our best impact.  I understand that Russia has a veto and has used it.  We must not forget that, when Ireland applied to join the UN in the late 1940s, Russia vetoed our application, so it has form.  As a small peacekeeping country, though, Ireland can play a niche role on the world stage.  Right now, the UN is our theatre.  I wish the Government well in its work in the UN.</p></speech>

Russia should immediately withdraw its forces and uphold international humanitarian and human rights law.</p>  <p>  I wish to outline for colleagues the actions that Ireland is taking to provide healthcare support to Ukraine at this time.  I have asked my Department and the HSE to identify ways for Ireland to provide medical assistance.  They are responding to a number of urgent requests for medical humanitarian assistance that we have received from the governments of Ukraine and bordering EU member states.  The Government of Ukraine is seeking support, including emergency medical supplies, from Ireland and other EU member states directly through the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism.  The Government of Ireland has offered an initial donation of medical supplies to the Government of Ukraine through this mechanism.  The donation includes 10,000 bio-protection suits, 50,000 medical protective masks and 2,500 litres of disinfectant, all items requested by the Government of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have attended EU meetings of the Health Security Committee and the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority in recent days and have heard directly from Ukrainian officials, and the deputy minister for health speaking from Kyiv, about the harrowing situation they are facing as they attempt to prepare their health services to receive civilian and military casualties.  We have also heard directly from Ukraine&rsquo;s neighbouring countries, including Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.</p>  <p>  Officials from Ukraine and its neighbouring countries have indicated that their needs are rapidly changing and that we can expect further requests for assistance, including medical assistance.  I have asked my Department and the HSE to identify a wider range of supports in terms of direct support to Ukraine and neighbouring countries and ensuring that Ukrainians arriving in Ireland will have access to any healthcare they may need.  This work is being done in co-ordination with ongoing EU efforts.  I am also speaking with some Ukrainian doctors in Ireland who are looking to have medical supplies and other healthcare assistance provided to Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I would like to express my solidarity with the people of Ukraine and to assure them that the Irish Government stands ready to assist in any way we can as part of the national response to this terrible crisis and outrageous and illegal invasion.</p></speech>

As a nation that values these highly, it is incumbent on us all to make clear our solidarity with Ukraine.  The Government's motion, which I support, states that Ireland is fully committed to the UN principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of states, that Ukraine has the right to ensure the security and defence of its territory, and that Ireland condemns Russian aggression in Ukraine and calls on Russia to withdraw its military.</p>  <p>  I am aware that some negotiations were attempted between Ukraine and the aggressor states at the border between Belarus and Ukraine.</p></speech>
