We all extend our sympathies to her husband, Praveen, and their families at this sad time for them.</p><p>  For decades Ireland has had and has always aimed towards the lowest maternal death rates in pregnancy and during childbirth.  This has always been a fundamental aim of our country and our society.  By any international standards we have one of the lowest maternal death rates in pregnancy and during childbirth, and certainly one of the lowest in Europe.  That is cold comfort to Praveen Halappanavar this morning, however.  It is because maternal deaths are so rare and this particular death is so shocking that I believe we need an independent inquiry outside of those already established, comprising personnel from outside the country, to establish the full circumstances of the death of Savita Halappanavar at University Hospital Galway.  An internal inquiry in itself will not suffice.  While the hospital group and the Health Service Executive, HSE, will conduct their inquiries, there is a precedent for a ministerial inquiry such as I have proposed.</p><p>  Confidence in our maternity hospitals and services is paramount and absolutely essential.  It is also important for the Legislature to be made fully aware of the circumstances surrounding this particular death as independently as possible so that informed analysis can take place.  It is necessary, given the rarity of such deaths in our maternity hospitals.  Does the Taoiseach agree that an independent inquiry, conducted outside the group of hospitals in question and the HSE, is required?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400003#A00500"><p>First, I would like to extend our sympathy to Praveen Halappanavar on the death of his wife, Savita.  This is a case of maternal death in which a child has been lost, a mother has died and a husband is bereaved.  That is a tragedy.</p><p>  It is true that we have exemplary standards in our maternity hospitals.  The fact that this young woman lost her life is a personal and family tragedy.  No words of ours here can deal with that loss.  It is appropriate that we do not rule anything out, but there are two investigations going on: the internal investigation by the Galway-Roscommon university hospital group, and a second by the HSE national incident management team.  It would be appropriate for the Minister for Health to receive both of these reports, and that we then consider them and decide on the best option.  It is important and imperative that the standards that apply in our maternity units are kept at the highest level of professionalism and competence.  For that reason, I do not rule anything out.  However, it is only appropriate that the two investigations being conducted be allowed to conclude, that the Minister for Health receive those reports and that we consider them at that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400003#A00600"><p>I want to make it clear that my objective here is not political.  I am a layperson but, from a preliminary reading of this matter, it seems to me this woman should not have died in these circumstances.  I accept that this is a subjective early assessment, but there are a range of issues involved.  First, a woman has died in circumstances which are rare in Ireland and, accordingly, an exceptional response, such as an independent inquiry, is required.  That does not exclude the internal inquiries that are under way.  It might be useful if those involved were aware there was to be an external independent inquiry.  Whether we like it or not, people will not have confidence in an internal inquiry.  Questions will inevitably be raised about it as, unfortunately, they have been in the past.  This is why it is important that an external independent inquiry is established and that it reaches across to the other issues about which one can read in the newspapers and commentary this morning.  When the independent report on the A, B and C case is published, people will draw conclusions.  That is why we need, above and beyond everything else, a clear, independent clinical inquiry into what happened in this case and why this woman lost her life in such circumstances.</p><p>I submit to the Taoiseach that we need that and I call on him to give that commitment to have such an independent inquiry.</p></speech>

I do not believe we should say anything about this until we are in possession of all the facts.  I do not want to decry in any way the capacity of the internal investigation being conducted by the Galway Roscommon university hospitals group nor to decry in any way the investigation being conducted by the HSE national management team.  In the interests of this case and for all others, the Minister for Health should be able to receive both those investigative reports and to analyse them based on the facts as they are determined by the professionals in both investigative teams.  We should then decide what is the best option based on the facts.  I do not wish to say anymore about the case because neither Deputy Martin nor I are in possession of all the facts.</p></speech>

Ireland case has been completed.  The report was delivered yesterday evening to the Department of Health.  The report has not yet been seen by the Minister, who is in Cork this morning.  Obviously, he will read the report, reflect on it and bring it to Government when he is ready to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400004#B00500"><p>It was my intention this morning to raise the continuing scandal of bankers' bonuses, pensions and salaries and the Government's refusal to deal with this insult to citizens, who are carrying the burden of its austerity policies.  Then, I heard of the death of the pregnant woman, Savita Halappanavar, who died on 28 October in University Hospital Galway.  I understand that Savita's death is being investigated and we are rightly restrained in what we can say on this tragic issue.  However, it is reported that she died of blood poisoning after being refused a termination while miscarrying, according to her husband.  There is an imperative on the Dáil to express condolences and solidarity to Savita's family, but also to deal with the issues which led to her death.  Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón a dhéanamh le fear chéile agus clann Savita thar ceann Sinn Féin.</p><p>  There is also an onus on the Government to bring forward the report of its expert group on promised legislation without delay to deal with issues involving such cases.  I realise there are strongly held opposing views, including within Sinn Féin and throughout society, on the issue of medical termination.  However, the people spoke in a referendum and firmly placed the responsibility upon the Oireachtas to deal with the issue by means of legislation.  The Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that a termination is lawful if it can be shown that there is &quot;a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother&quot;.  When will the Government publish the report of its expert group?  When will the Government bring forward legislation, as promised?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400004#B00600"><p>I repeat that the matter of bankers' pay is under review by the Government with a view to action being taken.  This process was begun by the Department of Finance.  It has been added to by the Mercer group.  I have no reason to believe that it cannot be produced before the budget and I do not see why not.  It is a matter of intense interest for the public at large.</p><p>  I informed Deputy Martin that the report on the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland case has been finished and delivered to the Department of Health.  The Minister for Health has a duty to read and reflect on it and he has a duty and responsibility to bring it to Government.  The Government will make its decision on the basis of what the report sets out.  Deputy Adams is aware that the terms of reference for that report were to examine the A, B and C <i>v</i>. Ireland judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, to elucidate its implications for the provision of health care services to pregnant women in Ireland and to recommend a series of options on how to implement the judgment, taking into account the constitutional, legal, medical and ethical considerations involved in the formulation of public policy in this area and the over-riding need for speedy action.  Deputy Adams will be aware that the group was made up of experts in the fields of obstetrics, psychiatry, general practice, law, professional regulation and public policy and was chaired by the honourable Mr. Justice Seán Ryan of the High Court.  The group met on nine occasions and clearly the Government has a requirement to send a response on progress to the Council of Europe by 30 November.  From that point of view the Minister must read the report, reflect on it and bring it to Government, and then the Government will make its decision when it considers it.</p></speech>

In April, the Minister of Health stated that no action had been taken on these issues by six successive Governments and that he had no wish to be part of the seventh.  We know the terms of reference of the expert group and it is good that it has brought forward its report.  The Minister stated he was confident that the group would produce proposals that were sensible, practical and implementable.  There is a belief in Sinn Féin that all possible means of education and support services should be in place in order that the difficult choice of terminating a pregnancy can be avoided by as many women as possible.  However, in this case we are advised that the woman and her husband asked for a termination because the hospital had acknowledged that the woman was miscarrying.  There is a need to put in place legislation and arguably this has been the case for almost 20 years.  On this sad day for this family, will the Taoiseach simply indicate to the House when that legislation will come before the Dáil?</p></speech>

That was a good start to reforms, which, I suggest, are now necessary in a much more radical vein.  Yesterday in the High Court, a judge recused himself from a case because he held shares in CRH, the company over which he was making an adjudication.  After he had admitted in open court in 2010 that he held the shares, the discovery was made by the plaintiffs that his advisers - in his words - had bought more shares at a time when the case was proceeding under him.  I am not making any accusations against him.  He states that this was done by his advisers without his knowledge.  It raises serious questions about the regulation of the Judiciary and its self-regulation.  How can it happen that a judge is allocated a case involving a company in which he holds shares and from which he stands to benefit or lose depending on the verdict?  That is the reality.  This is a multi-million euro case.  It could run into tens of millions of euro.  There could also be, unknown to us, other cases involving such matters as the banks and NAMA whose judges are involved in commercial activities which are not declared and about which the plaintiffs and the defendants know nothing.  In light of this, would the Taoiseach consider providing that the members of the Judiciary be required by law to make a declaration of their interests for public view so that plaintiffs and defendants can see what they hold and the president of the court can allocate cases accordingly?</p></speech>

Members should be conscious of it.</p></speech>

He has been clear on that.</p><p>  The referendum in respect of pay for members of the Judiciary came about because of the constitutional Article that stipulated that the remuneration of judges could not be reduced and because of the circumstances that applied nationally when there was a request for voluntary reductions of salaries.  The fact that agreement to this request was not forthcoming to a great extent was the reason the referendum took place.</p><p>  I will consult with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, about this matter.  There is certainly a need for the public to view the Judiciary as being entirely independent, as it always has, but this is a small country and members of the Judiciary have obviously been involved in business in different areas over the years.  This is a matter on which we need to reflect without infringing in any way upon the separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary.  We must ensure that the high level of confidence in the Judiciary over the years is maintained.  It is an issue that I will certainly discuss with the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

Of course, as the Taoiseach will understand, I am looking for more than discussions, because this is a serious matter.  It is quite obvious that the opaque way in which judges conduct their business is not open to any public scrutiny.</p><p>  Judicial reform is important.  The Taoiseach will be aware that I am alleging no misconduct in this case.  The fact that the judge must remove himself from the case constitutes a waste of public money because, presumably, the case must be held again.</p><p>  Is there any way we could remove the appointment and removal of judges from the political arena?  The Taoiseach will be aware that this is an area crying out for reform.  We have been waiting at least ten years for a judicial council Bill, which has not appeared because the judges have resisted it so much.  The Taoiseach will be aware that there has never been a case in the history of the State in which a judge has been removed by a vote of the Oireachtas.  There have been one or two that have come close, but it has not happened.</p></speech>

In line with a commitment already given to provide for more effective scrutiny of legislation by the Oireachtas, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has referred the heads of the Bill to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform which will conduct pre-legislative scrutiny.  The process will involve a full, open and transparent examination of the heads of the Bill.  The Government, separately, will refer the heads of the Bill to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in each House to allow them to examine the elements of the Bill within their remit.  The general scheme of the Bill has already been referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform for a full, open and transparent examination in public session.</p></speech>

The Government is introducing banking regulations which are not appropriate to deal with a voluntary organisation such as the credit union movement and under which many smaller credit unions will not be able to function.  Therefore, every Teachta Dála must have the opportunity to speak on this issue, if he or so wishes.  The use of the guillotine will not allow them to do this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400008#F00200"><p>The Irish League of Credit Unions which represents 3 million members asked specifically in its submission on this legislation that there be no attempt to foreclose debate on the Credit Union Bill in the House.  It has expressed extreme concern about the potential damage that may be done to the fundamental, voluntary and democratic ethos of credit unions.  It is also deeply concerned that the imposition of legislation dealing with banks that wrecked the economy will have a detrimental effect on credit unions which bear no responsibility for the current economic crisis.  Is it the case that the guillotine is being imposed in order to suit the timetable being demanded by the troika?  If that is the case, it is unacceptable.  I ask the Taoiseach to lift the guillotine and allow for a full debate on this important legislation which will affects millions of citizens.</p></speech>

As a member of a credit union since my earliest years, I am very conscious of the different tradition that has evolved over time in the credit union movement.  That said, it is important we strike a balance between protecting the members of credit unions and having proper prudential provisions and preserving the ethos of the credit union movement.  In that context, will the Taoiseach confirm there will be ample time provided and additional time, if necessary, for the debate on Second Stage in order that the views of Members can be fully articulated?  There should be no great difficulty in agreeing to this, as I suspect there are no unnecessary demands in terms of time made by external bodies.</p></speech>

At the Whips' meeting last week all of the Opposition Whips requested that the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill dealing with the issue of risk equalisation be debated all day in the House today and tomorrow.  However, because of the level of interest in the Credit Union Bill, it was decided to include the Bill in the agenda for today.  Members may sit an hour longer tonight if they want to, or perhaps they might prefer to have a discussion with the Whips after the Order of Business.  The Credit Union Bill must pass through by Christmas.  There is a lot of backed-up material that has to pass through the House.  The Bills must also pass through the Seanad.  I do not wish to guillotine the debate, as Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett consistently suggests.</p></speech>

Many of the people who depend on home help hours must be wondering why the number of home help hours was cut when €8 million could have been transferred from the National Treatment Purchase Fund to the home help servcie some months ago.  In the context of the Health Information Bill, this all points to a complete absence of transparency in the budgeting and financing of the health service and how they are conducted within the Department.  Obviously, large sums of money remained unspent for most of the year.  We cut the number of home help hours and disability payments and now people will ask why did that happen if €8 million was available.  When will the Health Information Bill be published?</p></speech>

Tomorrow the Minister for Health and his Ministers of State will publish the health strategy for the next period of years.  It will deal with the requirement for transparency and accountability.  As the Deputy will be aware from his previous experience in the Department, it is often very difficult to follow the allocated moneys to see where they are being spent.  I do not suggest money was misappropriated, but it may have been diverted from where it was intended to be spent initially.</p></speech>

Last night's revelations that the golden circle presided over by Fianna Fáil was still alive and well under the Taoiseach's tutelage bring urgency to this issue of the salary and pension arrangements of the CEO of Irish Life and 57 employees who receive in excess of €150,000, which is outrageous.</p></speech>

I hope the review will be produced for the Minister for Finance before the end of the year.

While I welcomed the broad thrust of the proposed legislation that is before the House, I set out five concerns that Sinn Féin has with regard to it.  I would like to mention a sixth concern, which is very important.  In areas of low population, the setting of strict term limits on directors and the prohibition on being a member of the board while being a member of the board's oversight committee will present difficult if not insurmountable challenges for credit unions.  As I said last night, if such a high level of voluntary commitment did not exist, there would be no need for regulation because there would be no credit unions.</p><p>  I would like to make three suggestions that would improve the functioning and performance of the credit union sector immediately.  The Bill should support the sharing of services among credit unions to permit access to a wider range of services by members throughout the country.  The Bill should allow credit unions to offer electronic payment accounts, as this would support the Government's efforts to maximise social inclusion.  The Bill should enable credit unions to provide funding to Government-backed or Government-guaranteed schemes and projects, where those schemes and projects would have a social benefit.</p><p>  If we were to make nine amendments to this legislation to cater for the six concerns and three proposals I have outlined, we would ensure it does not damage the worthy institutions - the credit unions - it sets out to protect.  I hope the Minister can accept my suggestions and incorporate them in the Bill.</p></speech>

On the contrary, we are trying to provide for lending and deposit institutions that are stronger, more regulated and more prudent.  Like 3.1 million people throughout the country, I am a member of a credit union.</p><p>  We have been contacted by the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Managers Association.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has suggested amendments to the Credit Union Bill 2012.  I understand that its submission has been sent to the Department and that the Minister has had time to peruse it.  The Minister set out his thoughts on the Bill in a comprehensive reply to Question No. 57 of 24 October last.</p><p>  I am highly aware of the capacity of credit unions in rural areas to attract appropriate people of the calibre set out in the Central Bank Acts, as mentioned by the previous speaker.  Under the new legislation, they will have to undertake the onerous task of having to replace directors on a recurring basis and the onerous task of the new treasurer.  This requirement could ultimately lead to the demise of credit unions in small peripheral areas.</p><p>  We cannot underestimate the credit union movement.  It has fulfilled a role in society that has not been fulfilled by banks, loan sharks and other people we will not mention in the House, who have sought to benefit from the circumstances of people who are not well off.  It looks after people when it comes to First Holy Communion, people going to college for the first time and people seeking their first car loans.  It is the place where we realise how vital it is to save money in order to be able to purchase a house and do necessary things in society.</p><p>  I wish to comment on some of the suggestions that have been made by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  I think we are going to head towards electronically enabled payments accounts.  I welcome the proposal regarding social finance.  It is something that should be examined with regard to pensions as well.  It would be preferable for the money that is put on deposit to be ultimately spent in the local area rather than throughout the country as part of public private partnership agreements.  A real benefit could accrue from local people putting money into an institution locally, having an investment stake in it and ultimately reaping a dividend from it.</p><p>  It is obvious that the term limits will present a problem.  A &quot;hub and spoke&quot; resolution to this problem will have to be considered.  One cannot tell people in rural areas that they cannot have a credit union because it is not possible to find the appropriate directors.  We have discussed the prohibitions at length.  Many of the Deputies who spoke last night recognised that onerous tasks are being bestowed on credit unions.</p><p>  The memorandum of understanding for a credit union is significantly different from that of a normal registered company.  The Minister referred to the need to be regulated under the Central Bank Acts in response to Question No. 57 of 24 October last:<blockquote>It is not the case that the Central Bank Acts are banking legislation.  The principal domestic Act dealing with the establishment of banks is the Central Bank Act 1971.  The references in that Act to credit unions are specifically required to ensure that credit unions are not subject to a banking regime.</blockquote>It is imperative that this remains the case at all times.  The two types of institution are not the same.  I encourage people not to adopt a multifaceted banking approach.  Credit unions need to continue to be vanilla banking institutions that take in deposits and provide smaller loans.  They need to proceed on a socioeconomic path, rather than on a balance sheet path.</p><p>Overall, I do not believe this will diminish the role of the credit union but there are issues that are obviously necessary to consider.  The Minister has looked at the issues and the Irish League of Credit Unions has some concerns, although CUMA does not have any real concerns at present.  Nonetheless, I believe consultation rather than confrontation is the best way to proceed.  I would like to see consideration of the proposed amendments being trashed through and I look forward to seeing this in the finance committee in the not-too-distant future.</p><p> It is also worth noting, as a Parliament, that the credit unions did not provide money for apartment blocks in Ballsbridge, for contracts for difference or for foreign investment properties in Bulgaria.  On the complete contrary, what they did was get involved in lending towards the knitting together of community, bringing people together and helping each other out to the betterment of society overall.  This is very different to an ordinary banking institution and it is for the betterment of the people.  We should respect that and we should acknowledge the volunteerism.  We need to keep them separate from the normal banking institutions and give them the regard they deserve.</p></speech>

From listening to some of the debate, it is clear the credit union movement has been very good at arm-twisting Deputies of all parties.  I am no exception to that, so many of the issues I raise I have been asked to raise, and I would appreciate it if the Minister responded to them as positively as he can.</p><p>  The credit union movement broadly welcomes this Bill and realises its necessity in terms of strengthening the movement.  However, there are a number of issues it has asked us to raise.  When he concludes the debate, perhaps the Minister can explain whether and why Central Bank legislation should be applied to credit unions given that this issue was not considered by the Commission on Credit Unions, as I understand it.</p><p>  In terms of sharing services, I ask that the Minister allow for a more flexible approach.  For example, could it be arranged that a member of one credit union could borrow money from or access his or her account in another credit union?  In a situation where so many of the pillar bank branches are closing, this flexibility would be useful for a person who might, for example, be shopping in a neighbouring town.  On the question of basic payment accounts, it would be logical to allow such accounts be attached to credit unions as well as to the two pillar banks.</p><p>  Will credit unions be permitted to invest in Government schemes?  This is especially important where credit unions are lending a relatively small proportion of their finances, and it might be a better use of their money than simply having it on deposit.</p><p>  To turn to the issue of term limits and those who serve in credit unions, no such term limits are set for bankers, for credit unions in other jurisdictions or, indeed, for Members of this House.  In particular, I have been requested to ask the Minister to remove the subsections at section 15(10)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>n</i>).  Some of the volunteers in credit unions may have excellent local knowledge which would be a real asset to a board.  Why should they, of necessity, be excluded from membership, although it is reasonable to insist that those people should have appropriate financial training before they take such service?</p><p>  I am trying to get across the point that the exclusion of volunteers who serve on credit union boards should be removed.  Such terms and restrictions on volunteers will be very hard on smaller credit unions.  The role of such credit unions, whether they be in fringe areas of urban settings or in rural areas, is made even more important given so many pillar bank branches are closing.  Everything should be done to try to ensure that each area is able to hang onto core institutions, and finance institutions are such institutions because if anyone is going out to shop, the first stop will be to get some money.  It is a very important aspect of this whole issue.</p><p>  Some other aspects might be considered in terms of amendments.  The first is the removal of the post of treasurer from a credit union and its replacement by a manager.  There is a definite worry among the credit union movement that the manager in that situation may become too powerful.  It is important there is a balance between the manager, the board and the members.  Retaining the position of treasurer would help in that regard.</p><p>  The commission recommended that audit firms should rotate after six years and that a cooling-off period of four years should apply before they could be re-engaged.  This was included in the draft heads of the Bill as section 32 but it has been removed from what we have before the House.  There is a need to explain why this is the case.  It seems strange that a recommendation regarding the rotation of auditors was removed yet the recommendation that directors must rotate remains in place.  I ask for some explanation in this regard.</p><p>  The issue of the tiering of credit unions needs to be reconsidered.  Given the size of credit unions varies greatly in terms of assets, is there not more need to have a closer examination of credit unions that have larger assets?</p><p>  With over 3 million members, credit unions play a vital role in the economy and in the community.  In terms of how we move forward, it is very important to think both of the economic role and of the community role credit unions play.  It is important that people have institutions close to them with which they can interact and relate, which makes for a good, productive and positive society.</p></speech>

The first point is that the credit union movement is in need of regulation.  While it is an extremely positive movement with much positive to be said about it, we have to remember that people's savings are kept there, money is at risk and we have to make sure these financial institutions are on a sound footing.  There is a need for regulation, therefore, although the first principle should be that regulation should do no harm to the positive attributes of the credit union movement.</p><p>  The first of these positive attributes is that it is a voluntary organisation.  I meet members of credit unions in Galway all of the time and the immense amount of work they do for absolutely no pay or remuneration of any kind is to be commended.  We need to maintain that ethos.</p><p>  A credit union is not a bank.  It has been there, historically, to help people who cannot get credit from a bank.  When we are talking about credit, risk ratings, credit portfolios and so on, we have to realise the credit union served its primary purpose when people could not go to the banks and were sent away.  We have to maintain that flexibility within the credit union movement to facilitate those people who do not have access to credit on a normal basis.</p><p>  St. Columba's Credit Union in Galway city operates as a large, well run credit union but it also has a subsidiary arm called St. Columba's Credit Union Limited Enterprises, or SCCUL Enterprises.</p><p>The company uses it resources and the money of the credit union in an innovative way.  It has been involved in various projects.  It has invested in community neighbourhood projects in the Ballybane area of the city where a library was put in place.  A habitat centre in the area that was funded by the credit union won an award.  The credit union also invested in an enterprise centre in Ballybane which provides incubation units for businesses.  Great plans were formulated for a community centre and HSE facility in the Ballinfoyle area of Galway city but, unfortunately, it did not go ahead for reasons that were outside the control of the credit union.  That is an example of social finance where the credit union uses its resources to help better the community.  The legislation must promote the function and idea of credit unions linking in with Government as an alternative source of investment which is so badly needed in the economy.  The example of St. Columba’s credit union in Galway city is a model of how the credit union movement can be involved with community organisations, fund projects and serve members at the same time.</p></speech>

Many working families could not have stepped inside any of the conventional banks as they did not have sufficient money to save and because they were on low incomes they could not borrow from conventional banks.  Credit unions are not banks in the understood sense.  Part of my reservation, which I share with others, is that the legislation wrongly attempts to force 70 years of legislation pertaining to banks onto a voluntary movement.  Any rational person would consider that to be wrong.  I disagree with it.</p><p>  Credit unions have a different history and a very different ethos, the principal issue being the fact that they are voluntary.  That is a good thing.  Given what we have experienced during the booming Celtic tiger years of greed, we should encourage people to volunteer, not the opposite.  As legislators we should be careful in what we do.  It is wrong to try to convert credit unions into another banking system.  We should not allow it to happen.  I support the points that have been made.  I will not repeat them.  I refer, for example, to the arguments made by the credit union movement on the sharing of services.  The banks are opposed to that.  One does not have to be a genius to work out the reason.  I support the credit unions.  If one is a member of a credit union in Tallaght, one should be allowed to withdraw money in Cork, for example.  That is not possible at present.</p><p>  As legislators, we should not obstruct the right of credit union members to volunteer.  We should not encroach on people’s rights to be volunteers in the credit union movement.  If the Bill is enacted we would restrict people’s right to volunteer whether as directors or others.  We should not do that because it is wrong.  It goes against the original thrust of the credit union movement.  Deputy Nolan spoke about the voluntary nature of the movement and people giving without getting anything in return.  That is a good thing which we should promote.</p><p>  I hope those points are taken on board on Committee Stage.  I am a person who both saved with and borrowed from a credit union.  I am proud of that and of the work they have done.  It is ironic to consider that last week we discussed the fact that we could not do anything about the super pensions of bankers and former Ministers and yet if the Bill we are discussing is enacted we will restrict the right of people who want to volunteer in the credit union movement.  We should not find ourselves in that situation.  We should be on the side of people who want to volunteer with an important organisation such as the credit union movement.  We should bear that in mind.  Credit unions are banks for working families.  We should be on their side and not place restrictions on them.</p></speech>

The Bill before the House has great importance for the effective operation and functioning of credit unions.  It is important that we get the legislation right because it will have a long-lasting effect on the future viability of credit unions the length and breadth of this country.</p><p>  Credit unions are the cornerstone of the communities in which they operate.  The statistics show that this country has more credit union members per head of population than anywhere in the world.  That is an indication of the confidence people have in their local credit union.  I welcome the fact that the Government has rescinded its decision to guillotine the Bill and that it has extended the timeframe for debate to ensure each Member will have an opportunity to contribute because of the critical importance of the Bill.</p><p>  The Irish League of Credit Union has contacted all Members to voice its numerous concerns on the Bill as proposed.  In the short time available to me I wish to focus on those concerns.  I acknowledge the positive elements in the Bill but it is important to focus on where it can be improved.  We will submit amendments in that regard.  It is important that credit unions are allowed to maintain their ethos.  They are not banks.  They are a voluntary movement.  They continue to support people who would not otherwise have access to loans.  As we approach Christmas the number of families who depend on their local credit union is evident.  The manager of the local credit union knows its customers.  They might not have a strong credit history according to the Irish Credit Bureau, ICB, but the local credit union manager knows them and is in a position to take a risk and help out a family.</p><p>  Last night we debated the ongoing debacle of tens of thousands of students who cannot get access to their third level grants.  I and other Members on all sides of the House have seen umpteen examples of where the local credit union has come up trumps and has worked with families who will get the grant, albeit sometime in the future, to ensure that students can register and actively participate in their third level education.  The credit unions are helping out those affected by the problem with accessing third level grants on which the Government has failed.  I acknowledge that last night the Minister for Education and Skills put up his hands and apologised for his role in that regard.  That is a practical example of the importance of credit unions.</p><p>  Not alone do credit unions help families but they are also the only financial institutions that re-invest in the community.  My local credit union gives approximately €100,000 per year in grants to vibrant and worthwhile community groups in the Mullingar area.  I am sure the same is true for credit unions in other areas of the country.</p><p>The grants range from €500 to several thousand euro.  That is of enormous benefit to the local community.  </p><p> I wish to put on record my admiration for the credit union movement and the men and women who work to ensure we have that strong movement.  They do so in a voluntary capacity and it is very important that we acknowledge that.  </p><p> The credit unions believe that if the proposal they have made is not implemented there will be a detrimental and inappropriate effect on credit unions.  As it stands, the legislation will serve only to reduce their ability to provide services to their members.  It will undermine the principle of local democracy that gives voluntary control to the credit unions and will impose ever-increasing costs that in many cases will threaten the viability of these bodies.  That belief has been expressed by the credit unions; those are their words, not mine.  It is very important that we take this on board.</p><p> Many elements of the proposed governance structure, such as terms imposed on directors, prohibitions on members joining the boards and the removal of the office of treasurer are unnecessary and undemocratic.  There is no imposition on Members' terms in this House.  I look at the Acting Chairman, a man who has had a long and distinguished career in the House.  He goes for re-election at each general election without any prohibition telling him he has had two terms, which is enough, and that he should go out to grass.  </p></speech>

Why should a term be imposed on people who wish to serve voluntarily on boards of directors in their local communities?  Perhaps that could be examined.</p><p>  Electronic payments were mentioned.  The Bill fails to enable credit unions to offer electronic payment accounts, something that must be addressed.  There is the issue of social finance.  The Bill should be amended to allow credit unions provide finance to Government-backed or guaranteed schemes, and projects with social benefits.  </p><p>  I welcome that there is an extension of time.  We have until tomorrow morning to submit amendments, and my party will do so.  Given the wide range of support for the credit union movement among all political parties, I hope the Government will not act in the usual political partisan manner in regard to this Bill and will take on board the amendments that will be proposed, both from its own backbenchers and from Opposition Deputies, to ensure that we protect and sustain the future viability of the great credit union movement of Ireland.</p></speech>

I agree with much of what has been said thus far and will reiterate, briefly, some of those points during my Second Stage contribution.  First, I wish to deal with a specific issue, a fundamental part of the Bill, namely, the issue of the credit institutions resolution fund levy regulation 2012.  Already a Central Bank and Credit Institutions Resolution Act 2011 has been enacted by the Oireachtas, whereupon statutory instruments issued in regard to the resolution fund.  These apply to cases of credit unions in financial difficulty.  Another fund is also referred to in the legislation, a fund of the order of €250 million, similar to the resolution fund levy.  These funds are to be provided separately and are to be repaid to the Department of Finance if an advance is acquired by the institutions concerned.</p><p>  I refer to a principal issue, of which many people may not be aware.  I was genuinely shocked to see the statutory instrument the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has produced.  The Minister does not know the difference between €1 million and €1 billion.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, is rightly surprised.  I will tell him what happened.</p></speech>

I understand that.  Obviously something happened to him after he went to the Department of Finance.  I will explain.  This will be news to the Minister of State as I uncovered it only this morning.</p><p>  On 28 September 2012 the Minister signed his name, &quot;Michael Noonan&quot;, as a personal signature to statutory instrument No. 381, which was laid before the Dáil at that time.  The opening paragraph states: &quot;I, Michael Noonan, having consulted with the Central Bank of Ireland and the credit union advisory committee, hereby make the following regulation&quot;.  There follows two and a half pages that deal with the levies to be paid to the compensation fund in question.  In the schedule attached there are nine references to the banks and building societies, with the credit unions dealt with separately in the last paragraph.  According to the schedule, the banks and building societies are to make a contribution of €1,515 per €1 billion of their loans.  There is a breakdown of three elements, including pillar 1 capital requirements and pillar 1 capital requirements relating to the authorised credit institution concerned.  The officials will know to what I refer.  On nine occasions the document states that the three elements of the levy will apply to those institutions for every €1 billion of their loanbook.  The last paragraph refers to credit unions which are to be levied at €51,000 per €1 million.  </p><p>  The Minister of State might find that interesting.  However, yesterday I picked up a new statutory instrument, No. 443 of 2012, laid by the Minister yesterday, and to be published in Iris Oifigiúil by the end of this week.  This states: &quot;I, the Minister for Finance, having consulted with Central Bank of Ireland and the credit union advisory committee, hereby make the following regulation&quot;.  The Minister has changed the references made in the three columns he signed more than a month ago, beginning thus: &quot;I substitute €1 million for €1 billion in paragraph (a)&quot;.  In paragraph (b) in column 3 he substitutes €1 million for €1 billion, and similarly  in paragraph (c) in column 3.  His first statutory instrument was 1,000% off the mark.  He confused €1 billion for €1 million. </p></speech>

If the Department of Finance, the Central Bank of Ireland and the credit union advisory committee can get the levies that will be introduced in this legislation so wrong, I question their handling of it in the first place.  The Minister made nine references to this in the first document and has made nine corrections to it today.  I supplied the statutory instrument references in question, Nos. 443, laid in the library yesterday, and No. 381, signed by the Minister on 28 September.</p><p>  What is interesting about the latter is that the levies referred to in respect of those organisations were payable from 1 October 2012, a date which has passed, although the organisations have until the end of February to make the payment.  The new statutory instrument of yesterday, which is not yet in Iris Oifigiúil, will probably not have legal effect until 21 Dáil sitting days have elapsed, if I am correct, although perhaps the period is 21 calendar days.  The former would bring the date of completion to well into January.  The Minister has produced a statutory instrument that is incorrect by a factor of 1,000.</p><p>That is a shoddy way to conduct business.</p><p> I formally ask the Minister to supply the relevant documentation which indicates who was responsible for preparing the statutory instrument to which I refer.  Was it the Central Bank, the Credit Union Advisory Committee or the Department of Finance?  Were all three involved?  How was this mistake allowed to happen?  Who within the three entities to which I refer signed off on a statutory instrument which contained incorrect information?  I accept that the Minister is good at maths, but the person who placed the statutory instrument in question in front of him is not so good at them.  It is not fair that he is being obliged to return to the House only one month after the original statutory instrument was signed in order to have the relevant references changed from &quot;billions&quot; to &quot;millions&quot;.</p><p> On the legislation before the House, like most Members, I agree that the credit union movement is non-profit and community-based in nature.  Like many sports and other organisations, it is based on democratic traditions.  Credit unions in many communities have proud records.  To a large extent, the movement has traditionally been staffed by volunteers, which is the reason for its success because these individuals know the people living in their communities.  One of the key elements of the legislation is the limitation of the term of office of directors to nine years out of any 15.  This will give rise to many new regulatory costs.</p><p> Credit unions have €15 billion in deposits and 2.9 million members.  Most households are members of credit unions.  Of the 403 credit unions, only approximately 25 are seriously undercapitalised.  In total, 51 are undercapitalised to some extent.  This means that some seven out of eight credit unions are in good and strong financial condition.  Why fix something if it is not broken?  The legislation is right, in principle, but it oversteps the mark in far too many instances.  One out of every eight credit unions is in financial difficulty, but the other seven are not.  The lazy approach being taken is that if one little problem arises, we change the rules as they apply to everyone else rather than deal with the problem to which I refer.  We are placing many of the credit unions that have done good work in the past at a disadvantage.</p><p> The Bill introduces a levy of 0.2% on savings in respect of the deposit guarantee scheme being put in place.  Some of the banks are actually moving away from the deposit guarantee scheme which relates to them, but we are intent on introducing such a scheme for credit unions.  By and large, they did not present the same level of risk to the nation's finances as the banks over a period of years.</p><p> I wish to refer to a typical individual in my constituency who is involved with his local credit union.  The individual in question is Mr. Tony Flanagan who has given me permission to use his name and who is involved with Portlaoise Credit Union.  One can find people like him in every credit union throughout the country.  He was involved in establishing the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps, ANSAC, Credit Union and has been involved in Portlaoise Credit Union, at every level, for 19 years.  Under the Bill, his experience will be cast aside.  What is being done is similar to informing a county board that its team has won an all-Ireland championship, that it has a good manager and chairman but that its time is up and all its members must depart.  In the future one's term of office will be based on the calendar rather than on whether one is any good at what one does.  We must reconsider the position on these time limits and, if appropriate, people should be made to step down.  However, artificial time limits should not apply.</p><p> The Abbeyleix, Durrow, Mountmellick. Clonaslee, Mountrath, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Rathdowney, Mayo-Doonane and Carlow District credit unions contacted me about this matter.  They are unhappy with various aspects of the legislation, which goes too far too fast.  Credit unions are being informed that even though the bankers made the mistake, the solution is to be imposed on them.  Evidence of this comes in the form of the introduction of a deposit guarantee scheme for credit unions when the scheme for the banks has almost passed its sell-by date.</p><p> On the time limits for directors, it must be recognised that most directors know the people who live in their communities.  One must save with and have shares in one's credit union in order to have financial dealings with it.  As Deputy Robert Troy stated, directors know the genuine cases.  They will be aware, for example, of the families that do not have the money to pay student fees and are waiting for their grants to come through.  These families will be able to obtain loans to tide them over until the spring or whenever the grants are paid because credit unions know their members.  The credit unions' level of bad debts might be 7% or 8% of their total asset base, but that figure is small in comparison with those which apply to the banks.</p><p> We are intent on imposing a banking solution on the credit unions.  This is because the banks want to squeeze the credit unions out of existence.  The banks are reducing the numbers of their branches because they want to maintain an online banking system for most people.  They do not want to be obliged to operate branches.  When a person visits those branches still in existence, he or she is confronted with a machine which allows him or her to do his or her business without approaching the counter.  One can make lodgements and pay one's bills without troubling any of the bank's staff.  Now that they are pulling out of many locations in towns and cities, the banks do not want credit unions to be able to offer a good, strong local financial service.  They have used their muscle - through the Central Bank and the head of financial services regulation - to ensure their concerns will be met.  I accept that a few bad apples were identified - I refer to Newbridge and other credit unions - but that is no reason to put structures in place to penalise the seven out of eight credit unions that are operating well.</p><p> I accept the principle behind the legislation, but the reality is that it goes far too far.  On Committee Stage my party will be tabling amendments designed to allow us to row back on some of its provisions.</p></speech>

I welcome the debate and congratulate Deputy Sean Fleming on his conversion to <i>perestroika</i>.  It is a pity that when he sat on this side of the House for 14 years, he did not display the same level of vigilance and failed to communicate the message on the importance of protecting people's money.</p><p>  The Bill is extremely important.  There are over 400 credit unions and the legislation will give effect to the recommendations contained in the final report of the Commission on Credit Unions.  These recommendations were supported by the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Credit Union Managers Association.  There are four clear headings under which the Bill can be considered, namely, prudential regulation, governance, restructuring and stabilisation.  It is in the context of these headings that I wish to address a number of points.</p><p>  I spent a number of years on the supervisory committee of Bishopstown Credit Union.  I attended meetings of the board and dealt and engaged with its members, other staff and members.  As someone who saved with and borrowed from a credit union, I am aware that the importance of the movement throughout the country is not to be underestimated.  In preparing for this debate I spoke to a number of people involved with credit unions in Cork city.</p><p>  More than half of the credit unions, 211, have assets of &#8364;20 million or less, while three quarters, 285, have assets of less than &#8364;40 million.  Let us place this matter in context.  Credit unions are often small community organisations which meet the needs of their members.  They often offer a more personal and direct service than that offered by the banks.  They allow people to borrow money to buy cars, finance holidays, carry out home improvements, etc.  It is the not-for-profit and community involvement which distinguishes the credit union from the bank.  I stress that it is a movement.  Therefore, we must ensure, in the context of changes we might make, that this distinction will remain in place and that the authenticity of the movement will continue.  It is extremely important that we ensure that, even though they will be operating within a new regulatory regime, credit unions will be in a position to continue to cater for the economic and social needs of their members.  We must not allow a situation to develop - either through the enactment of this Bill or otherwise - where loan sharks and those who illegally lend money can continue to flourish and prosper from their activities and prey on people and communities.</p><p>  Having worked as a volunteer supervisor with Bishopstown Credit Union, I am aware that credit unions work with people in restructuring loans etc.  There are ten community-based credit unions in my constituency.</p><p>Community-based credit unions offer great service to members, be they in Ballinlough, Ballyphehane, Bishopstown, Chríost Rí, Crosshaven, Douglas, Passage West, Monkstown, St. Finbarr's, St. Michael's or The Lough.  Each one of those ten credit unions is in place to serve its members and work with them.  That voluntary ethos must never be lost.  We must promote the credit union movement, as credit unions are not banks.  I agree with Deputy Eamonn Moloney that if a credit union member in Bishopstown, The Lough, Malin Head, Glenties or anywhere else north, south, east or west wants money, he or she should be able to get it from any credit union office in any part of the country.  </p><p> Concerns about the Bill have been expressed to me by members of credit unions.  One concerns the imposition of a time limit on the term a director can serve and the prohibition of membership of boards and oversight committees.  The term limit will pose a difficulty for some smaller credit unions.  It is not a big issue, however, for credit unions such as those in The Lough or Bishopstown which have wide catchment areas.  The Bill provides that the offices of risk management officer and compliance officer should be held by separate officeholders.  I refer to the need for an explicit regulation on the use of shared services.  This would enable the credit unions which do not have sufficient volume of work for two full-time positions to share the services of a competent professional.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has asked that this provision be included in the Bill.  We must ensure credit unions are accessible, that technology is provided for the benefit of members and staff.  I encourage people to continue to use their credit union and ask the Minister to listen to some of the concerns expressed in the debate.  The credit union movement is different from the banks; we cannot expect credit unions to be the same as banks.</p></speech>

The programme for Government contains a social economy element.  The credit union movement encapsulates all that is good in a community.  The 1997 legislation provided for a figure of 0.5% for reinvestment in community projects which is decided by the board of directors of a credit union.  We should not, therefore, take our eye off the ball.  We must ensure there is a civic and community gain through the participation of credit unions in local communities.  In my county there are 14 credit unions which certainly did not cause the financial crisis or the break-up of the banking model.  Prior to the arrival of the Celtic tiger and during that period, the credit union movement continued to do the business in looking after people in communities by lending money or providing for share options through investments.  Today communities and the good citizens of the country are completely livid and vitriolic in their attitude to some of the payments and pensions enjoyed by bankers.  This reaction of the public must be taken into account very carefully in this House.  I share the opinion of citizens of the unregulated banking sector which led to the demise of our financial sovereignty.</p><p>  Previous speakers have referred to the provision in respect of a nine year term limitation for members of boards of directors of credit unions.  This is a ridiculous and crazy provision.  Directors of credit unions invest their time over a nine year period and will be told they are no longer required.  The option of providing for a step-down period will result in people ceasing their involvement with the credit union movement.  The provision that they can return at a later date is not good enough.</p><p>  The banking model forms the main point of my contribution.  One way to tackle the banking issue and the high salaries of bankers is to take the money from the banks' accounts to hurt them in their own pockets.  How is it that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine can make farm payments into credit union accounts, while the Department of Social Protection cannot pay pensions, make social welfare or child benefit payments into such accounts?  Let us hurt the banks in their pockets.  We should facilitate the movement of finance into credit unions which would be delighted with the extra financial injection.  Let us facilitate them and avoid the ridiculous nonsense about the need for a sort code, for example.  This is a job for the regulator, for Matthew Elderfield.  That is the challenge I make.  Let us begin to transfer some of the money in the commercial banks to credit unions in order that they can compete with the big banks.  There are plenty of people who are hurting in their pockets because of the behaviour of some of the larger banks.  Therefore, all options should be considered.  We need to respond to the general discontent in society because people do not believe the banks operate fairly.</p><p>  I acknowledge the important contribution of voluntary workers in the credit union movement and also Coast Guard volunteers.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is investing good money in a voluntary Coast Guard movement, with high professional standards which are being improved year on year.  The credit union movement should not be treated differently from the Coast Guard.  The Government should consider the social economy element of the programme for Government.  It should endorse the civic participation of directors of credit unions who are not remunerated.  They should be rewarded and the big banks hurt in their pockets.</p></speech>

I broadly welcome the measures set out in it.</p><p>  We are all very familiar with credit unions and the services they provide in communities.  They also provide funding for projects.  I am a member of a credit union.  A framed photograph of the first loan cheque written by the credit union hangs on the wall of the credit union office.  The cheque for £5 was written in the 1960s and was a significant sum at the time.  In those times the credit union was regarded as the poor man's bank.  Now there are more than 400 in the State, with 3 million members, and each credit union is owned and run by its members.  Credit unions are not-for-profit organisations and the role of volunteers in the daily operation of credit unions has always been significant.  For years credit unions were the only source of borrowing for many because banks were not an option for them.  They would not have been granted a loan by a bank, even if they applied.  </p><p>  The local credit union is not judgmental of its members.  It offers them a lifeline when they are faced with unexpected bills and once-off expenses for family occasions such as weddings and holidays or for car purchase.  Nowadays, many turn to the credit union to help with college fees for their children.  Credit unions know their members and of their ability to repay.  They have a unique understanding of the personal financial circumstances of their members.  They go the extra mile to help because they have a relationship with the person seeking a loan.  Many members save a little at a time without ever applying for a loan.  Some may save as little as €2 a week.</p><p>Many put aside such a sum to ensure that, on their passing, there will be money to pay for their funeral arrangements.  Since credit unions are local, convenient and run by locals who understand customers' concerns, they are trusted.  My experience of the local credit union has always been positive.  The failure of the banks should not result in the penalisation of credit unions.<i></i>When banks closed branches and withdrew services in many communities, credit unions took up the challenge and are now in a strong position to fill the gap and draw in new members.</p><p> The Bill introduces wide-ranging reforms for credit unions.  I am fully supportive of better regulation in all institutions in the financial sector and do not understand why credit unions should be exempt therefrom.  No organisation should be exempt from scrutiny to ensure it is run properly.  Events in recent years have shown the sad effects of poor governance in financial institutions and how lax regulation led to reckless lending and very misguided decisions by lenders.  We, therefore, need greater transparency in all sectors to protect customers and their money.  It is important that this be achieved in the legislation.</p><p> The measures contained in the Bill will give effect to over 60 recommendations made by the Commission on Credit Unions, which recommendations were made over a nine month consultation period and agreed to by the members.  The Bill aims to put extra financial safeguards in place for the sector and facilitate the merger of weak and stronger credit unions.  This is important because there are weaker credit unions which do need the support of larger ones.  I do not envisage any problem with the merging of some credit unions.</p><p> The Bill makes provision for the credit union restructuring board, known as the ReBo, which will engage with credit unions on restructuring.  However, it will not apply to all credit unions, as some will continue to operate on a stand-alone basis provided they have a viable business-friendly model that meets all of the recommendations made.</p><p> The Bill gives rise to many considerations and some concerns, which I ask the Minister to consider, especially regarding the work of volunteers.  Every Member has listened to comments on the importance of volunteering in all sectors, not least credit unions which are the backbone of communities.  As such, we should continue to support them and the Government has done so in many ways.  It set aside &#8364;500 million to recapitalise credit unions last year as many were in serious difficulty.  The Bill is one step forward in protecting credit unions from future difficulties.  I commend it to the House and ask the Minister to take on board what has been said by all Deputies.  Credit unions are a home-grown product and have been in existence for a very long time.  Without them, many people would never have been able to buy a car, have a family wedding, go on holiday or send their children to school.  I hope the Minister will consider this.</p></speech>

The Irish, more than citizens of any other European country, have bought into the credit union movement.  Our participation rate in the movement far exceeds that in any other European country.  The Government, through its legislative programme to deal with credit unions, has to take cognisance of this fact and I am happy that, to date, this has been explicitly expressed and acknowledged by the Minister for Finance.  As the Bill progresses, I hope our almost unique relationship with the credit union movement will continue to be reflected and acknowledged.  I am happy that the Commission on Credit Unions was established and had a constructive input in drafting the legislation before us.</p><p>  Under the terms of our current funding arrangements with the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, reform in this area is a requirement.  In acknowledging everything is not rosy in the garden, one must acknowledge that the vast majority of credit unions are well run, financially robust and properly structured.  The Bill largely reflects the recommendations set out in the final report of the Commission on Credit Unions, published in March this year.  I understand the commission met on up to 30 occasions and was thorough and comprehensive in its work and deliberations.  We cannot afford to lose the ethos of the credit union movement and also must ensure a regulatory and supervisory structure that will protect the financial interests of society as a whole.  That is what the Bill is about.  These points are all the more acute in the light of what we have seen take place in the banking sector, the institutions in which have broken the country.  There is a somewhat justified feeling that credit unions are suffering for the sins of others in the financial services sector.  There is a grain of truth in this, but it must be acknowledged that while credit unions are relatively small in the greater scheme of things, there are problems in a minority of them.  I do not want to see the credit union movement damaged in the longer term for want of reform on foot of our new banking and financial circumstances.</p><p>  The founders of the credit union movement in the 1950s recognised a double problem, the scare availability of money and the poor management of money.  Credit unions were established to empower ordinary people to gain more control over their finances.  The credit union movement has been very successful and it behoves us to ensure the principle and ethos of financial services rooted in the community can continue to flourish in what will be very different times.  I understand, respect and admire the voluntary aspect of credit unions.  We have many fine credit unions in my constituency of Clare.  My late grandfather and namesake, Mr. Joe Carey, was a founding member of my local credit union, Ss. Peter &amp; Paul Credit Union in Clarecastle where, incidentally, I participated as a supervisor for a period.</p><p>  Like all Members, I have received correspondence from the credit union movement which has concerns about the Bill, including in respect of the application of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 to credit unions.  The movement considers the Bill should support the sharing of services in order that members can avail of a wide range of services.  It has concerns about the term limits on directors of credit unions and the prohibitions on members of boards of directors.  It is asking that a memorandum of understanding be agreed between credit unions and the Central Bank and wants the position of treasurer to be retained.  There is concern that the tiering of credit unions is too wide.  In this regard, the movement believes a model based on the risk posed to and the complexity of business would be far more appropriate.  When the Minister for Finance is concluding the debate on Second Stage, he should take on board these concerns and introduce amendments on Committee and Report Stages to address them, if necessary.  The process used to get to this point and the Minister's comments in introducing the Bill indicate the Government's willingness to recognise the specific circumstances that can be accorded to the credit union movement.  I look forward to changes being made to the legislation as it passes through the Houses.</p></speech>

Donnelly and John Halligan.</p><p>  I welcome this important Bill which is being introduced at a pivotal time for the country.  Ireland needs a strong and resilient credit union movement that is fit for purpose.  The movement has been helping people for over 50 years.  Credit unions have weathered the financial crisis much better than other financial institutions, which has not been by accident.  By and large, they have acted in a prudent manner and in keeping with their ethos of existing not for profit but for service.</p><p>  Credit unions set up their own savings protection scheme in the late 1980s to ensure that, when the wet day came, the movement would be protected and secure from the storm.  Credit unions, unlike other financial institutions, are well catered for in bad debt provisions.</p><p>Credit unions use a standard simple calculation for bad debt provision which in general has worked out very well.</p><p> The people need options for their financial services.  The credit unions have provided a safe place to save and borrow at reasonable rates.  They have supported communities throughout the country via lending, sponsorship and organising events for the communities in which they work.  They want to progress.  They must progress for the good of the country.  They want to help out more.</p><p> The country needs an alternative to the two pillar banks in the area of personal finance and financial services.  The stumbling block for credit unions to filling that space is their lack of access to the Irish payment services clearing system.  Credit unions must offer electronically enabled payment accounts to their members.  We have talked about that for the past number of years.  The commission report rightly acknowledges that requirement.  That is the future.  The time to deliver on this aspect is now.  Increasingly, we are moving towards a cashless society with the phasing out of cheque payments by 2016, the increased usage of debit and credit cards, and electronic fund transfers.  A way must be found to provide the credit union movement with access to the clearing system at an affordable price which could be set to take account of the cost of the service provision.  Legislation alone will not achieve the required outcome.  The goodwill of all stakeholders must come to the fore.</p><p> As I listened to the apology from the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, for the delay in processing student grants I wondered where all those students will go, what we will do for them and if they would have to drop out.  Many of them probably sought finance from the credit unions.  The Minister can help in that regard.  He can arrange the grant payments to be mandated to the credit unions.</p><p> Regarding social finance, this is a great opportunity to allow credit unions lend out some of their excess funds through a carefully structured, safe and secure process, that is, funds made available to the National Treasury Management Agency, local authorities and housing projects.  I fully support allowing credit unions lend to State guaranteed projects which have a social benefit.  That has the potential to allow up to €6 billion of capital projects to progress.  That would provide a huge number of jobs and a boost to the economy.  That is something the Minister must seriously consider.</p><p> I do not agree that the term limits will undermine volunteerism in the credit union movement.  This might not be popular with some people but I have got information from a variety of different organisations.  I was elected here to make up my own mind and that is what I have done.  An example is that a member can be a director for nine years, spend three years mentoring new directors thereby ensuring the future of volunteering, spend three years on any of the crucial committees, that is, credit control or nominations and then revert to the board if they so wish.  That rotation of positions will be very positive for the movement.  Term limits are good governance.  Governance is vital for the future.  It relates to the separation of responsibilities and internal controls.  The separation of policy and operations is a basic fundamental of governance.  The introduction of the internal audit function, risk management and compliance will further improve the governance of the movement.</p><p> I reiterate that Ireland needs a strong, resilient and fit for purpose credit union movement.  We must ensure that this legislation enables the movement to progress into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400016#O00200"><p>I met representatives of the credit unions recently and they were broadly in favour of the Bill but concerned about some aspects of it the first of which was the proposal to apply historic Central Bank legislation from 1942 to 2011 to credit unions, which was not considered by the Commission on Credit Unions.  They consider that to be unfair and believe it should not form part of the Bill.</p><p>  We all know that credit unions are very different from banks.  They have served a wonderful purpose and many people who access money through the credit unions would not have a prayer in terms of getting it through the banks.  Credit unions did wonderfully well to come out of the crisis in the way they did.  They have allowed for €900 million of bad debts but they have reserves of €1.3 billion.  The Government is putting some money into them but they are not getting that for nothing.  They will give it back through a levy.  They are not being bailed out, unlike their bigger friends in the banks.</p><p>  I am in favour of legislation for all forms of activities in the State but this legislation is somewhat heavy-handed for what are volunteer run, not for profit organisations.  That must be taken into consideration in the Bill.</p><p>  Another area the credit unions were keen to get was the sharing of services.  The ability to take money from a credit union in Donegal even though one might be from Wexford is very important.  That would be a wonderful facility for the credit unions to have and I do not understand how the Government could see that in negative terms.  I understand the reason the banks would not like it very much, and I believe they have done some lobbying on that matter, which is somewhat worrying, but the notion that the credit unions could become even stronger and provide an even greater alternative to the banking system should be seen by the State as a positive rather than a negative development, especially given that this Government promised us a strategic investment bank that would be open for lending to small and medium size business.  That did not materialise on the basis that our pillar banks would do all that for us but as we are aware, that has not happened.  Unfortunately, the pillar banks have remained closed to most small and medium sized business.</p><p>  The other issue the credit unions mentioned was the term limits.  As Deputy Flanagan stated, the notion of limits on lengths of service in principle is a good idea but I would have started with the banks rather than the credit unions.  It must be remembered that the banks, not the credit unions, caused most of the problems and it might be somewhat challenging for small credit unions in rural areas to replace personnel who were there previously.  Perhaps the Minister should insert a provision to the effect that allowance should be made for small credit unions in rural areas and different limits imposed on them.  I suggest that he consider limits to the large financial institutions that have cost the taxpayer a fortune.  I will not talk about the crazy amount of money they are getting despite the fact that those who need it most are being denied it.</p><p>  I understand the credit unions have approximately €5 billion available for lending and that the legislation must be adapted to allow the Government take money from the credit unions.  The credit unions would be keen to lend money to them at a standard rate, especially for social projects.  Obviously, they will not give it for projects they do not agree with but there are many projects of a social nature that are in need of infrastructural investment with a view to creating jobs.  This is a &quot;no brainer&quot;.  Members on the opposite side of the House frequently ask us where will we get the money but the credit unions have €5 billion to invest in projects of a social nature that could create huge employment.  Unemployment must be one of the major curses on this State and on the world in general.  There are 28 million people unemployed in the European Union and until the unemployment problem is addressed we will not get out of this crisis.</p></speech>

The first is a real appreciation of the role played by the credit union movement in Ireland, the second is an acceptance that some form of regulation is required and the third is agreement that the Bill as it stands must be changed to ensure that the credit union movement is not damaged by inappropriate regulation.</p><p>  The rampant rabid capitalism of the banks went unmuzzled in this country during the boom and therefore we are naturally inclined towards further regulation.  However, the credit unions are not banks.  I had the privilege of working with the World Council of Credit Unions in Washington looking at how to provide savings and loans products to some of the most vulnerable communities on earth.  As we are aware, credit unions do not maximise profit.</p><p>They reinvest profit according to their members' wishes.  They are non-profit organisations providing an invaluable service in communities in Ireland and across the world.  Much play has been made of the fact that a small number of branches got themselves into financial difficulty.  We know some of them invested in property in ways that did not work out well and got themselves into financial difficulty.  To suggest, however, that this means the credit union movement in Ireland traded recklessly is incorrect.  We are aware the credit union movement has received no State aid whatsoever and its financial position is very different from that of the banks.  Recently, I met with one of the management team of a credit union in Wicklow to go through its numbers.  Its financial position is so healthy that it could pay out all of its members’ savings using just its cash reserves while not even touching its investments.  It would be impossible to have a run on this credit union, which indicates an extraordinary level of financial health.  If we are not careful, this Bill will impede the ability of healthy and sensible credit unions to do the most good they can, particularly when the joke that is the banking system is sucking all of the money out of our economy and refusing to lend it back.</p><p> Do we need regulation in this sector?  Yes, we do.  Does the Bill get that regulation right?  No, it does not.  I, along with many other Deputies, have spoken to representatives of the credit union movement.  It is interesting to note the serious and substantive problems they have with the Bill as it stands, which have been raised by many Members during this debate.  I wish to raise three of these concerns.  First, the governance rule whereby a member of a credit union board can have no family member working as a volunteer does not make sense.  This is a volunteer-led movement and, particularly in the smaller unions, branch workers are saying that if this is imposed it will radically alter their ability to serve the public.  Second, section 35 automatically prevents a credit union member who has rescheduled a loan for whatever reason from getting another loan.  These are not people defaulting on large loans and looking to borrow even more but parents looking to borrow money for Christmas presents or school uniforms.  To prevent someone who has restructured a loan - not defaulted on it - from taking out another loan is not sensible.  Third, I would urge that the Government consider allowing a softening of the bar on credit unions under certain conditions.  This is the geographical rule that Deputy Wallace spoke about earlier.</p><p> I look forward to further discussions on the Bill on Committee Stage.  Its passage will be quick; this morning the Taoiseach said it would be passed before Christmas.  I will be submitting amendments reflecting the issues I have raised.  I urge the Minister for Finance to be open to this debate.  There is clear support for the legislation on all sides of the House.  My experience of legislation in this House is that once it is agreed on Second Stage, no substantive changes are made, contrary to what our Constitution encourages.  Ireland has the deepest penetration of credit unions in the world.  They are a credit to their workers, their volunteers and their members.  The credit union approach is superior to that of small-scale community savings and loan banks and, in many aspects, to the banking system.  We need regulation, but it needs to be appropriate.  According to the well-thought-out criticism of the credit union movement, this Bill is not yet right.  I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will be open to accepting amendments to ensure we get this legislation right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400017#P00200"><p>No one denies that the credit union sector now finds itself in need of strong regulation, high standards of probity and better governance.  A quarter of credit unions in the State are under close supervision by the Central Bank due to fears about rising loan arrears.  Thousands of loans, totalling about €1 billion in value, are more than ten weeks in arrears, which is putting significant financial pressure on credit union balance sheets.  According to statistics from the credit union movement, members are behind on their payments in one fifth of all loans given out by credit unions.  Last year, more than 140 credit unions did not pay a dividend as they had recorded a loss or wanted to put more money aside to cover loans in arrears.  It is also clear that struggling members have been forced to stop borrowing from their credit unions because they fear they will not be able to meet repayments.  New figures show that the value of loans issued by community lenders collapsed by €500 million in the first nine months of the year.  In light of these figures, it is commendable and right that the Government assist in the restructuring of the credit union sector.  However, having studied the Bill and listened to the credit union representatives, I have concluded that the nuts and bolts of this legislation lose sight of the voluntary nature and ethos of the credit union movement.  The sector has been doing its damnedest to get its financial house in order for some time.  The Irish League of Credit Unions, which represents 3.1 million members, claims that just five member credit unions are set to record a deficit this year, compared to 81 last year.  The league also says that more credit unions should be able to pay a dividend this year.  Why, then, are we introducing legislation for the sector which will implement severe restrictions that are far more stringent than those imposed on the banks that bankrupted this country?</p><p>  It is claimed some changes proposed in this Bill are potentially detrimental to certain smaller credit unions, in which board members often help out free of charge.  As it is, many credit unions are finding it increasingly difficult to persuade people to become directors of their boards, especially with the introduction of the new fitness and probity rules for directors.  Smaller credit unions, particularly in rural areas, often have limited pools of people from which to draw their boards.  The proposed term limits will present a particular difficulty for such credit unions.  The number of credit unions in Britain fell by approximately 70% when new regulations were introduced there, as the majority were successfully absorbed into larger bodies.  With so many small rural banks and post offices closing around the country, including four in Waterford in the past two months, these small credit unions are the last financial lifeline left in many rural communities.</p><p>  It is not right that mid-sized credit unions are being asked to face the tougher regulatory rules applied to larger institutions which are sometimes more at risk of failure.  Will the Minister consider a scheme that incorporates the level of risk and complexity involved in credit unions?  Surely we have learned our lesson and realised that the risk involved is just as critical as the size of the institution.  Furthermore, I would like to voice my support for a scheme whereby credit unions could invest in socially valuable schemes and projects backed by Government guarantees.  Such an initiative has the potential to create employment and assist in the development of local infrastructure and services, as well as contributing to local social and economic development at a time when we need it.  Credit unions should be asked, although not compelled, to give loans to sporting and community organisations, as they sometimes already do whether above or below the radar.  We should talk to them about that.</p><p>I do not have as much time as I would like.</p></speech>

I was unaware that if I was a member of a credit union in Waterford and I happened to be on holiday in Donegal or Dublin, I could not use a credit union facility in those counties because I was not a member of it.  That is not fair and it does not represent the idea of shared services.  It should be the same with all financial institutions.  This is a big issue with the credit unions and I call on the Minister of State to consider it.</p></speech>

By default I am making an argument about how important credit unions are because of what is happening or not happening in the area of lending in the country.  Last week, we were informed that the number of new mortgages issued by Irish lenders is at 1970s levels.  At the same time Allied Irish Banks maintains that it is approving seven out of ten mortgages and that it will comfortably exceed its target of €1 billion in mortgage sanctions for 2012.  This is something of a contradiction.  On the one hand we are back to 1970s levels but, on the other, everyone is meeting their targets.  In other words, the banks' targets are so low that they cannot but be reached.  Last month, we were told by the Credit Review Office that while AIB and Bank of Ireland continue to report that more than 80% of formal loan applications are sanctioned, lending policy has tightened in 2012 for the more challenged small and medium enterprises and farms.  This is what I am encountering in Waterford and this is what people working in banks in Waterford are telling me.</p><p>  The Credit Review Office has said that far more could be done to assist access to credit.  Since the office opened, a total of 96 of the 207 applications for credit that were refused have been overturned, a high percentage.  Farmers in particular are feeling the effects of the lending drought while costs continue to rise.  On the flip side, the Irish Banking Federation has stated that the granting of credit is not a frivolous activity, that banks want to know that they will get their money back and that the business in question must have a sustainable future.  However, I believe in some cases banks are not lending to businesses which they know have a sustainable future.  There is a problem with what is being said publicly and what is actually happening.</p><p>  Ireland is second only to Greece in terms of refusing loans to small businesses.  Small and medium enterprises in Ireland are twice as likely to have a loan application turned down compared to the eurozone average.  The information I have received from bank employees is that systems are in place now which are unreasonable when it comes to assessing a loan application.  Increasingly, the banks are using what is termed soft underwriting tactics and have removed all power from the local bank managers to sanction loans.  Given the damage some of these local bank managers did by lending to developers, many would suggest that is not such a bad thing.  Unfortunately, however, we have gone to the other extreme.  The practices of bankers and lenders are hurting the economy in a completely different way now.  An AIB employee explained the problem to me recently, suggesting the lending procedures during the past two years have made it difficult to deliver to small and medium enterprises, and that a new set of guidelines were so complex that they have had to be amended and rewritten within the first year.  The levels of individual discretion at branch level has been reduced or removed which in some, but not all, cases is not sensible.  Overall, the process has become remarkably cumbersome.  The State must measure this process because if credit does not flow quickly from sanction to drawdown there is a basic problem with the process and, by extension, with a critical component of our economy's recovery.  The State must begin to question the process of lending in the main banks rather than simply wait every year for the Credit Review Office to publish figures that spell out what we already know.</p><p>  I do not believe everything bankers tell me but the people I know who work in banks, who cringe and acknowledge frankly the damage they did during the boom years, inform me that the system of lending in place in banks is not doing country or the economy any favours.  The new lending practices within these banks need immediate Government oversight.</p></speech>

The credit union movement and its branches throughout the length and breadth of the country, especially in small towns and villages, have provided a vital financial service during the past half century.  Its structure, based on volunteerism and being close to its members and the community, was and is unique and the main reason for its success.  The idea was that money was in circulation in the communities each union served.  In other words, people saved and invested while drawing down loans at the same time.</p><p>  This was a wonderful model, evidenced by the vast number of people involved; some 3 million people throughout the country are members of credit unions.  They were run in a personal way based on local knowledge and all decisions were made locally.  This meant there was less leakage and fewer bad loans were given out as a result of this local knowledge.  All of these developments in the credit union movement took place alongside a banking system that initially provided similar services but which then grew out of all proportion and became impersonal.  Decisions in the banks were not made locally and money was thrown at people in the good times.  There was little or no regulation and now those same banks are downsizing and closing as a result of that mess.  Now there is a greater need than ever for the services credit unions provide in their local communities.  Admittedly, some of the larger credit unions got involved in similar activities but the majority did not.  Everyone involved in the credit union movement and all the contacts I have had recognise that there is a need for reform and change.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Government have committed €500 million to address problems in the sector as well.</p><p>  There is recognition everywhere that change is needed.  The Irish League of Credit Unions acknowledges the need for change and reform and has stated that the process should be to facilitate healthy, strong and vibrant credit unions to provide existing and new services to their members in a safe, modern and consumer-friendly manner.  This is what everyone needs but the question of how to get across that line is important.</p><p>  Concern has been expressed by many Deputies about the need to keep in mind the uniqueness and the personal nature of the service and that these could be lost if they are put into a straitjacket of regulations that are disproportionate in comparison with the services they offer, and which do not take into consideration the nature of the input and volunteerism.  There is a marked contrast between the banks and credit unions.  We do not need to impose some of these restrictions on credit unions which might result in their becoming just as impersonal as the banks.</p><p>  I am a member of a credit union and I have a bank account, but I have not stood in a bank more than three times in the past ten years because they are simply impersonal.  We need to preserve the uniqueness of the credit union.  I do not have time to go through all the various topics or concerns but these are well known and have been articulated.  They include governance issues, Central Bank legislation dating back more than 70 years and the need to preserve some sense of volunteerism in the sector.  Some of these provisions should be re-examined but the uniqueness and services offered by the credit union movement should continue to be offered while ensuring they are regulated and run in a very transparent manner.  We should not throw out the baby with the bath water or inadvertently bring to the credit unions some of the lesser qualities of the banks apparent at the minute.</p></speech>

The main work will take place on Committee Stage.</p><p>  I support the credit union movement for a number of reasons.  I have been a lifelong member.  I was in business, self-employed as a chartered accountant for many years.  Only for the credit union movement, certainly in the 1990s, many of the small businesses to which the banks were not providing credit would not have survived without the credit union system.  That needs to be acknowledged.  Credit unions are not the same as the banks.</p><p>  I am pleased the Government is putting in place enhanced and strengthened regulation in the financial and credit union sectors.  It is important, however, that we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater, that we recognise the unique characteristics of the credit union movement and seek to preserve those while at the same time strengthening regulations that need to be strengthened. I welcome the work of the commission which has been comprehensive and has covered a range of areas.</p><p>  The credit union movement, like the GAA, is in every parish in Ireland and is based on volunteerism  The one aspect that comes across is that there is a genuineness about those involved in the credit union movement.  For no personal gain, they represent their members and we should not lose sight of that.  Credit unions are not banks.  There is a need for a memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the credit union movement on how credit unions will be regulated.  From my interaction with the credit unions in Limerick which do fantastic work, that is something that needs to be considered. Another matter relates to volunteerism.  I specifically refer to section 15 of the Bill which deals with membership of boards of directors.  A restriction is being included whereby no member can serve on a board of directors for more than nine years in any 15-year period.  I suggest that should be extended by three years, making it 12 years in any one period.  </p><p>  On the issue of holding posts on a board of directors, it is proposed that there will be a restriction of three consecutive years. We should consider extending that to four consecutive years.  Up and down the length and breadth of the country there are credit unions in which persons have been involved throughout their lives doing fantastic work.  We cannot afford to lose their skill sets, but there is a need for probity.  Under the Bill, if a sufficient case is put forward, the terms of those on boards and in office positions can be extended, and I welcome that.</p><p>  We also need to examine the need for a shared service.  This is a simple procedure.  People have an attachment to their local credit union.  We need to find a way to provide a shared service of a back-office function provided by a body to allow credit unions to meet their regulatory requirements and to continue as viable small credit unions. Above all else, the lifeblood of a credit union is its members.  For that to continue, it must be able to pay dividends.  We must get to a point with this regulation whereby all credit unions are able to pay dividends to their members.</p><p>  The issue of the position of treasurer has been referred to.  This is a matter of debate.  He or she is a member reporting to the members' body.  We need to have a mechanism whereby the role of treasurer can be retained for the members, involving the manager more in the finance area but retaining the role of treasurer as a position.  We must always bear in mind that the credit union movement is about the members and the voluntary ethos.  We need strengthened regulation, but we need to achieve it in a way that retains the voluntary aspect and the skill sets to which I referred, although there is a need for enhanced skill sets.</p><p>  I commend everyone involved.  I look forward to debating this Bill on Committee Stage, dealing with amendments and examining areas to strengthen both large and small credit unions to ensure their survival.</p></speech>

I am very much in favour of the legislation and I compliment the Minister and the credit union commission on its introduction.</p><p>  The credit union movement has done significant work in Ireland over a long number of years and it has good ethical banking values.  We all will be aware of the banking problems in recent years and the way in which banks have ruined the country with their reckless lending.  I compliment the credit union movement on its prudent lending. Credit unions were mature in the way they carried out their business.</p><p>  It is amazing that all credit unions were run by voluntary members who were not getting big salaries and bonuses.  They were persons who, as Deputy O'Donnell stated, had a genuine interest in the credit union movement in their respective communities, and they were not driven by profit or personal gain.  The good point about the credit union movement is that credit unions kept local money local and supported the community.  I compliment the credit union movement in all towns and villages across the country on the facilities they have provided and on the way they have improved them.</p><p>  I compliment voluntary directors in particular for getting extra training and support in order to carry out their roles.  Nearly every member of society is a member of a credit union.</p><p>  I ask the Minister to give careful consideration to one aspect of the Bill, namely, the length of time voluntary members may serve.  It is difficult to get genuine volunteers for any organisation.  In many cases voluntary members in credit unions have given 20 years or more of service.  I ask the Minister to examine that aspect of the Bill and the way such voluntary members could hold their officer roles.</p><p>  If we did not have credit unions, people would be driven to moneylenders.  We are all aware of the manner in which moneylenders behave.</p><p>  I compliment the credit union movement.  Its members have spoken to me regarding this legislation and the Minister, on Committee Stage, will take on board the views of the Members of the House.</p></speech>

The credit union movement in my county has been in touch with me in regard to this legislation.  I am sure it also has been in touch with other Deputies and Senators. There is nothing the credit union movement seeks that cannot be facilitated in this Bill.  As the previous speaker and Deputy O'Donnell stated, for many families, the credit union movement is the difference between accessing funds and not being able to do so.</p><p>  The credit union is not a banking movement.</p><p>It should not be compared to a banking movement; nor is it fair to use banking terminology when referring to it.  The credit union movement is about volunteerism, community, local knowledge and local communities coming together to provide a service that would not be provided otherwise.  Credit unions have local knowledge and directors who commit themselves locally.</p><p> The credit union movement is trying to promote many innovative ideas, particularly in the area of social financing.  One such idea is to work with local authorities, which are currently starved of cash, to carry out simple works in local authority areas.  It has been suggested that credit unions could enter into strategic relationships with local authorities and perhaps also with local educational institutions.  Credit unions have a social dividend to give to their communities and it is important that they are listened to in that regard.  </p><p> Having listened to the Minister for Finance opening this debate, it is clear that he is willing to engage with the credit union movement in a constructive way to advance matters.  It is important to bear in mind the three pillars of community, volunteerism and local knowledge as this Bill progresses through the House.  When the Bill moves into Committee Stage I am sure amendments will be tabled.  Many of the amendments proposed by the credit union movement itself are common-sense amendments and I hope they will receive the support of the Government.</p><p> I commend my own local voluntary credit union movement in the County Limerick area, which does sterling work.  For many families, local credit unions make the difference between access to funds for essential services and the denial of same.</p></speech>

That crisis was caused by unbridled capitalism, the gross mismanagement of the economy by successive governments and a complete lack of any serious regulation in the banking sector.  It is completely understandable that Irish citizens are extremely angry that their taxes have been used to bail out gamblers, speculators and private banks, whose managements are rewarded by obscenely generous salaries and pensions.  However, one institution has stood head and shoulders above the rest during these difficult times, namely, the Irish credit union movement.  To most people, the credit union is not just a financial institution but a grassroots movement that was built on volunteerism and is at the heart of many communities across Ireland.  The 493 credit unions affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions across the 32 counties have a total membership of approximately three million.  Credit unions affiliated to the league hold almost €11.7 billion in member shares and deposits and have approximately €5.5 billion on loan to members at the moment.  Most of us would agree that with its success over the years in serving members' needs and its impressive penetration levels within Irish society, the Irish movement is an international success story in credit union terms.</p><p>  On a daily basis we are bombarded with stories of former bankers, civil servants and Ministers living a lavish champagne lifestyle, with some collecting pensions of up to €500,000 per year despite their role in creating the social and economic crisis which has shaken Ireland to its core.  Credit unions are not perfect and individuals could and did make mistakes.  It would be naive to suggest that the movement was unaffected by the boom; we have all heard stories of unsustainable loans being advanced for properties.  However, the main point is that the credit unions themselves would be the first to admit that the regulatory context in which they operate is in need of real reform.  In fact, the credit union movement has campaigned for years for radical reform of the regulatory structure.  The Irish League of Credit Unions was an advocate for the establishment of the Commission on Credit Unions.  </p><p>  Some of the issues addressed by the aforementioned commission are not reflected in the Credit Union Bill, and one such issue is that of shared services.  The sharing of services, which was referred to by Members from all sides of the House, offers credit unions the opportunity to benefit from economies of scale and allows them to access expertise that they might not have the resources to engage individually.  This may become increasingly important in the future given the increased complexities and running costs which could be expected from a modernised regulatory framework and enhanced service offering.  While sharing services is to be encouraged as a mechanism for increasing economies of scale and promoting co-operation between credit unions, it should not expose credit unions to undue risk.  The commission recommended that shared service arrangements be established by legislation, and that recommendation must be taken into consideration.</p><p>  Credit unions should lead the way in assisting the Government in a financial inclusion agenda.  The new Bill should clearly enable credit unions to offer electronic payment accounts.  I do not know why the Government would be opposed to this development; perhaps the Minister will address that issue in his reply.  Credit unions should also aim to provide for the economic and social goals of members and their wider local communities.  Credit unions are in an ideal position to play a key role in the provision of social lending and the promotion of financial inclusion.  Social lending involves the provision of loans to local enterprises and voluntary organisations to develop social infrastructure in order to provide affordable debt funding for community enterprises that can operate on a self-sustaining, commercial basis to create jobs, promote economic development and otherwise improve social conditions.</p><p>  Ordinary hard-working people in Ireland are at economic breaking point.  Families have lost another generation to emigration, which is at a level we have not seen in decades, and nearly every household is scared stiff of what is coming down the track in the next budget.  The social and societal problems that drove the creation of the credit union movement, including high unemployment, poor housing, poor health, emigration and spiralling debt are again firmly embedded in many of our communities.  However, credit unions are ready and willing to come to the aid of ordinary people.  They can and should be supporting job creation, community-based enterprises and socially useful schemes.  In my own constituency of Dublin South West there are areas of high unemployment and social exclusion, but social lending by credit unions could have a strong impact in reducing many of our serious social and economic problems.  The Bill should enable credit unions to provide funding to Government-guaranteed schemes and job-generating projects with a social benefit.  Why does this legislation not allow credit unions to take part in social lending schemes?</p><p>  Another issue of concern is the second loan bar, which was referred to by other Members.  Reference was made to loans for birthday and Christmas presents, school uniforms, confirmations, communions, graduations and so forth, but people also seek loans to deal with unforeseen difficulties such as ill health.  Given the current delays in the processing of student grants, loans from local credit unions can fill a gap.  Another common reason for loan applications is for funeral expenses when there is a death in the family.  In that context, some flexibility is required regarding second loans.</p><p>  Why is there is an unacceptable imposition of limited terms for directors of credit unions and a prohibition on their membership of the board?  These measures are unnecessary, anti-democratic and an attack on the basis of volunteerism, and they will have a negative impact, particularly on smaller credit unions.  Why are we discriminating against credit unions?</p></speech>

I have asked why the Government is opposed to shared services and electronic accounts.  Credit unions should be allowed to invest in socially responsible job creation schemes with State-backed guarantees.  Is it necessary to provide for term limits for board members and prohibitions on service by family members?  I see these measures as undemocratic and an attack on the core of volunteerism.  They will have a negative effect, particularly on credit unions in rural areas.  Why does the Bill discriminate against credit unions in this way?  Is it proposed to introduce similar restrictions for board members in the banking or education sector?  Why pick on the credit union sector in particular?  Credit unions already face difficulties in recruiting directors.</p><p>  Sinn Féin wants the legislation to provide strong, effective and appropriate regulation of credit unions.  It must reflect the fact that credit unions are not banks.  They are ready and willing to tackle the huge socioeconomic problems which have come to the forefront since 2008, but the legislation must allow them to do so.</p><p>  Members on all sides of the House have made reasonable proposals for improving the Bill.  Many of the measures it introduces are positive, but it has failed to strike the right balance overall.  I hope the amendments tabled by all sides will be considered by the Minister on Committee Stage.  We want to support the Bill but it needs to be improved if is to get the balance right.</p></speech>

Ba léir gur thuig Teachtaí cé chomh tábhachtach is atá an córas chómhar creidmheasa timpeall na tíre agus an dáinséar atá ann, má reachtaítear an Bille go loitfear bun ethos na gcomhar creidmheasa.  Dúirt an Teachta Arthur Spring go ndéanfadh an Bille an córas níos láidre.  Tá roinnt de ghnéithe an Bhille a dhéanfadh sin agus tá gá le roinnt reachtaíochta.  Ach is í an fhadhb is mó, mar atá an Teachta Seán Crowe díreach tar éis a rá, nach bancanna atá i gceist anseo.  Ghníomhairí pobail atá taobh thiar den chóras chomhar creidmheasa.  Ar bhonn phobail a bhí na comhair creidmheasa ó thús báire agus ar son an phobail atá siad.  Níl siad ann chun brabús a dhéanamh dóibh féin.  Ní cóir go mbéadh siad ariamh ceangailte leis an gcaipitleachas a raibh na bancanna gafa leis. </p><p>  Tá cleachtas difriúil ag teastáil chun na comhair creidmheasa a reachtáil.  Ní cóir, dá réir, rialacha banc a chur anuas orthu mar bhéadh sé sin ag teacht salach ar an mbun ethos atá a baint leis na heagrais pobail seo.  Ba chóir déanamh cinnte de go leanfaidh na heagrais seo, go gcuirfear leo agus go dtabharfar cosaint don pobal a bhfuil siad ag soláthar seirbhíse dó, fiú in am an ghátair mar atá ann faoi láthair. </p><p>  Forcing on credit unions the commercial and banking regulations that apply to banks and other financial institutions reveals a lack of understanding of the credit union movement as it evolved in Ireland.  If the Minister understood how it originated, the services it now provides and the ethos underlying it, he would not even think of imposing many of the restrictions he proposes.  Nobody is arguing against stricter regulations for credit unions to ensure nothing untoward happens, but they should not be legislated for in the same way as banks.  These are voluntary groups with limited membership numbers and liabilities.  They are not multi-billion euro basket cases like Anglo Irish Bank, AIB or, to a lesser extent, the ESB, which speculated to beat the band.  They are community-based, not-for-profit organisations and their shareholders are their members.  Their purpose is to serve their communities and keep people out of the grip of moneylenders, both legal and illegal.  Professionalising them to the extent that the voluntary aspect is removed would limit the ability of directors to serve their communities and is an affront to members.  I do not deny that some credit unions face difficulties or need to amalgamate but they should not be tarred with the same brush as the Fingletons of this world.  Credit unions need to be protected and encouraged rather than hampered because they play an important social role.  We are trying to encourage people who are in difficulty to go to MABS rather than moneylenders.</p><p>  The Irish League of Credit Unions states that thousands of valued and experienced credit union members will be debarred from serving as directors or board oversight committee members as a direct consequence of the term limits proposed in the Bill.  It argues that the introduction of the fitness and probity regime for credit union directors and officers should obviate the need for the crude device of term limits and points out that such hard and fast rules do not apply to any other credit union movement across the world.  This is unprecedented in the context of the financial services industry in Ireland.</p></speech>

While there are many positive aspects to the Bill, there are a number of others which concern us.  As Sinn Féin's spokesman on finance, an Teachta Pearse Doherty, has indicated, we will table a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee and Report Stages.</p><p>  Credit unions have a distinctive, not-for-profit ethos that needs to be protected and encouraged.  This should be the position of the Government.  Credit unions are an integral part of every community.  Across the entire island they are a truly national social movement.  Their ethos is based on values of community, voluntarism, solidarity and social enhancement.  They keep people away from moneylenders and make money available to those not in a position to deal with the banks.  In many cases, this involves just small sums of money that can be paid back in small repayments.</p><p>  In September I met the representatives of the Kilsaran-Castlebellingham branch and the Dunleer branch and the manager of the mid-Louth group of credit unions.  I have also been in contact with Collon Credit Union and the parish of Darver credit union.  Many of those I met have serious concerns about the Bill.  They are not against change, but they have concerns which I share.  There are concerns that some of the measures agreed to by the Commission on Credit Unions have not been included in the Bill.  Why not?  The sharing of services among credit unions should be supported in order that members could avail of a wider range of services.  The Bill should also enable credit unions to offer electronic payment services and accounts.</p><p>  A particular fear of some of those I met is that some proposals will make the closure of smaller credit unions inevitable, leading to the removal of another vital service in rural Ireland.  There are concerns that some of the Government's proposals will undermine the ethics and principles of the credit union movement as a democratically based and community owned service.  Credit unions are not banks and should not be treated as such.  They did not help to cause the economic crisis and the directors do not draw huge pensions or receive huge bonuses or salaries.  </p><p>  The proposal to apply the Central Bank legislation from 1942 -2011 to credit unions was not considered, even by the Commission on Credit Unions.  This will have far reaching implications for credit unions.  There are similar concerns about applying the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 to them.  The concern is that this will undermine the right of appeal to the Irish financial services appeals tribunal, as recommended in the commission's report and included in the Credit Union Bill.  As some of my cairde have said, changes to the appointment and selection of directors will militate against real member and community ownership of credit unions.  Term limits for directors will remove a wealth of knowledge and experience from the movement.</p><p>  There are positive aspects of the Bill, but it needs to be amended.  We want to see strong, effective and appropriate regulation.  The credit union leaders I met want to see the same thing happen.  This is necessary for their survival and the future well-being of the communities they serve.  I hope the Government will take on board some of the suggestions others in Sinn Féin and I have made.</p></speech>

In the past couple of weeks I have taken the opportunity to speak to members of Donnycarney Credit Union and members of the credit unions in my constituency in Fairview and Clontarf who have told me that the basic role of credit unions is now keeping the wolf from the door of many households which in previous generations might easily have turned to moneylenders.  We should take the opportunity to give credit to the credit union movement for what it has done.  It is a not-for-profit organisation that is community-based and oriented.  Some of the sums of money credit unions deal with are very small, but they are a means of keeping a family on the straight and narrow and can make a huge difference in meeting the day-to-day expenditure of a family.  Everybody who enters a credit union knows its ethos.</p><p>  That said, everybody must accept that credit unions need regulation.  When I asked people working within the credit union sector about the Bill and their concerns, they said the one thing they would like to change was section 15(10) which deals with the directors of a credit union.  They have genuine concerns that the way in which credit unions operate will be severely undermined if this section is allowed to continue unamended.  It states an employee or voluntary assistant of the credit union or an employee or voluntary assistant of any other credit union are not eligible to become a director of a credit union.  This is overly prohibitive.  Most credit unions operate on the basis of good will, yet the people who work in credit unions and volunteer to help in them selected this section of the Bill as a concern.  When I asked them to select one area of the Bill in which they would like to see a change, this was the section they chose.</p><p>  Section 15(14) is also a concern.  It states a member of a credit union may not be appointed or elected to the board of directors if he or she has served for more than nine years, in aggregate, of the previous 15 on either the board of directors or the board oversight committee of the credit union.  I understand this provision may be being made owing to significant bad practice in the past.  Perhaps some individual credit unions operated in the manner of fiefdoms.  However, as previous speakers said, we should not over-regulate the credit union system because of the sins of a few.  Most credit unions have a long history of dedicated service in order to allow the credit union movement to survive.  The nature of voluntarism and community activism has changed in Ireland and many of those working in the sector are looking at the next generation and concerned because most of their members are not young.  Most credit union volunteer members are of a particular generation which had a different understanding of community interdependence.</p><p> While understanding the need for regulation of the credit union sector, I suggest that if one element of the Bill can be reexamined, it should be section 15(10) dealing with the board of directors.  The Minister should also reconsider the length of time for which they may serve.  The overall thrust behind what the Department is doing is laudable and important, but we should also remember that it is the credit unions that are keeping moneylenders out of business.  It is not in our interests, therefore, to put credit unions out of business.</p></speech>

This is something of which we should be very proud.  There are 399 credit unions in Ireland, with 3 million members.  More than any other country, Ireland has bought into the credit union movement and communities across the country have reaped the benefits of this development in the past 50 years.</p><p>  Credit unions are run by volunteers and owned by their members.  They sit at the heart of the community.  This community ethos is the most striking characteristic of the credit union movement.  For over 50 years, credit unions have encouraged saving and engaged in lending among their members.</p><p>They have supported communities and individuals in these communities on big and small projects.  Credit unions have a particularly strong reputation for supporting the needs of disadvantaged communities and individuals.  Small loans are regularly provided to people to assist them through difficult times, for example, to help a family pay for Christmas and to support young people to succeed in education.  People who save their money in credit unions know that this money will be used in their communities to support those communities.</p><p> The Government recognises the vital role credit unions play in Irish society.  In the programme for Government, it states clearly that it recognises &quot;the important role of Credit Unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between them and other types of financial institutions&quot;.  The Government's desire to reform and support the credit union movement properly, while taking the views of the movement fully on board, was recognised in the creation of the Commission on Credit Unions, which completed its work earlier this year.  It has also been recognised in the legislation we are discussing and the wide consultation that has taken place around the legislation.</p><p> Despite the unique nature of credit unions, the financial collapse has highlighted clearly the need for them to be governed by robust regulation.  The Irish League of Credit Unions went from a surplus of €15 million in 2009 to a deficit of €45 million in 2010.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has estimated that the cost of recapitalising credit unions will be between €500 million and €1 billion.  Credit unions affiliated to the Irish League of Credit Unions hold assets of €13.5 billion.  Measures must be taken to ensure this is secure.  Like any other financial institution, an individual credit union cannot be allowed to play fast and loose with the money of its members, or to take the kind of unacceptable risks that brought our economy to its knees.</p><p> The credit union is the people's bank.  As it takes responsibility for the deposits of individual members and lends to members when needed, it needs to be regulated.  In recognising the need to reform the regulation of credit unions, the programme for Government clearly states that a balance must be struck between &quot;their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus&quot; and &quot;the need to fully protect depositors savings&quot;.  The structure, ethos and business model of a credit union is vastly different to that of a commercial bank.  As a result, a credit union cannot be treated like a commercial bank.  Nobody is arguing with the need for robust regulation that will allow the credit union movement to develop into the future.  However, this legislation must ensure the credit unions' flexibility and ability to respond to the needs of the community is not lost.</p><p> I conclude by thanking my local credit unions in Ballyfermot and Inchicore, which contacted me to outline their particular concerns about the impact that certain aspects of this Bill will have on individual credit unions.  They are concerned about the effect of some governance provisions, such as the term limits to be imposed on directors, the prohibitions on membership of boards of directors and the status of the treasurer, on smaller credit unions in particular.  I ask the Minister to outline how he proposes to address these concerns to ensure credit unions retain the flexibility they need.</p><p> I would like the Minister to explain the absence from the legislation of two simple items raised by the Irish League of Credit Unions which strike me as sensible and desirable.  First, the sharing of services would allow for the provision of a broader service and would ultimately reduce costs.  Second, credit unions should be allowed to provide funding to Government-backed or Government-guaranteed schemes and projects with a social or local benefit.  I suggest that such investment should be encouraged at a time when every available resource should be targeted to deliver a social dividend in struggling communities.</p><p> We need to maintain a strong and vibrant credit union movement that continues to support communities and individuals.  It should be responsible and well regulated and should remain responsive to the needs of the community.</p></speech>

The Minister has done a substantial amount of work to strengthen the credit union movement, rather than damage it.  I should declare at the outset that I am a member of a credit union.  I would probably not be here if I had not been able to borrow money in 1998 to run my first campaign.  I suppose I should declare my self-interest at this stage.  That is an example of the strength of credit unions at the heart of the community.</p><p>  My children were introduced to the credit union movement when their grandmother opened their first account for them.  I am sure many people, including some of the young people in the Gallery, have had a similar experience of the intergenerational nature of credit unions.  In that context, it is worth mentioning the support that credit unions give to local communities and the assistance the credit union movement gives to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.</p><p>  As Deputy Crowe said earlier in this debate, we need to examine the possibility of expanding the role of credit unions to allow them to fund schemes with a social benefit.  I could not help thinking of John Hume when Deputy Adams was speaking.  As part of his great work, John Hume travelled the length and breadth of the country to build and expand the credit union movement.  Indeed, Deputy Adams would probably not be here today without the work done by John Hume as part of the Good Friday peace programme.</p><p>  A number of major issues have been raised during this debate.  Deputy Ó Ríordáin mentioned some specific areas.  Rather than repeating those points, I will express my support for them.  We need to examine the different types of credit union in this country.  Some of the smaller credit unions are associated with certain professions or workplaces.  The community credit unions tend to be slightly larger.  Some credit unions are verging on the size of banks.  Therefore, the new legislation has to cover a range of regulations.</p><p>  I hope the Minister will consider some amendments to this Bill.  A great deal of work has already been done.  Government and Opposition Deputies continue to have an opportunity to work together to try to get the best solution for credit unions across the wide range of the spectrum, from the very small branches to the very large branches.  That will be difficult.  When the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform held hearings on this issue, it was clear that there was a difference of opinion across the movement in several areas.</p><p>  I believe the issue of governance needs to be addressed.  Current legislation imposes a number of administration measures on credit unions.  For example, each credit union must have a membership committee, credit committee and a credit officer.  All of the functions of small specialised credit unions that have an excellent credit record over a number of years could probably be carried out by a single board.  I ask the Minister to consider giving the registrar of credit unions the leeway to permit small credit unions to have less formal committee structures, as long as the registrar is satisfied that the credit union in question is run in accordance with the regulations and requirements and is likely to be run in that way in the future.</p><p>  The specific requirement for all directors have to expertise, qualifications or backgrounds in financial services is worrying and needs to be considered in greater detail.  The extent of that requirement is not spelled out clearly.  We must ensure we are talking about a qualified financial adviser.  I ask the Minister to consider amending section 15(3) of the Bill to provide that the registrar must be satisfied that the board has availed of relevant financial services expertise and has not acted against the advice given.  Such a small amendment could assist smaller and more specialised credit unions.</p><p>  We have to bear in mind that the credit union movement in this country has been a force for good.  Recent surveys have shown that people try to make repayments to credit unions first because they appreciate that credit unions are continuing to lend money.  As Deputy Ó Ríordáin said, they keep the moneylenders from the door.  They play a very important role in society.  As we continue our consideration of this Bill, we have to ensure we do no damage and we strengthen the credit unions.</p></speech>

Everybody accepts that credit unions play a very important role in this country and appreciates the voluntary status and nature of those involved with credit unions.  Their importance can be seen in two large suburban areas in Cork.  There are four financial institutions - two banks and two credit unions - in the north east of the city, but both of the banks are closing, unfortunately.  In the north west of the city, there are two credit unions and no banks at all.</p><p>  It is important to note that the ambition of this Bill is to protect the savings of credit union members, to safeguard the stability and viability of credit unions and the sector at large and to preserve the ethos of credit unions, which we are all talking about today.</p><p>It was interesting to listen to Deputy Humphreys who, like myself, spent a couple of days a month ago with various representatives of credit unions, including individual credit unions.  It must be acknowledged that there is quite a varied stance on the Bill as it now appears.  It must also be acknowledged, however, that this is a new position, because this Bill gives effect to 60 recommendations that came from the final report of the Commission on Credit Unions, which sat for some nine months.  In the largest part, this comprised the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Authority and the Credit Union Managers' Association.  While one of the groups clearly has some difficulty with some of the elements, what I took from the meetings with individuals, particularly the managers, was how much they embrace the need for regulation.  In fact, the need to move on and enact the Bill was the greatest message I took from that series of meetings and from the witnesses.</p><p> There was a fairly strong message that perhaps some differentiation might be considered between smaller and larger credit unions when it comes to some of the regulation.  While this regulation certainly does not preclude movements on social finance, Government-backed schemes and electronic payments, that voice was clear and unanimous from the credit union movement.  Given that all of those who have spoken so far seem to have given a voice to the Irish League of Credit Unions, it must be acknowledged that at our committee meeting, the managers' association, including one individual manager whom I know quite well, was very supportive of the concept of term limits.  In particular, its representatives felt that to have employees as directors would be unsatisfactory within any financial institution.</p><p> When we are considering the amendments, it is important that there is some review of the fact that over nine months, all of the stakeholders were involved in a lengthy and thorough process.  It is acknowledged that while this Bill is not a carbon copy of the report of the Commission on Credit Unions, it holds very true to it.  There is not much point in engaging in such a widespread process with stakeholders for nine months and then allowing some individuals to come back afterwards and make arguments that would go against a unanimous report, although I am sure some of those opinions will once again be voiced when we reach Committee Stage.</p><p> I commend the Minister on supporting such a valuable resource to our country, which is, of course, our credit unions.</p></speech>

One of the great civil society institutions this State has produced, credit unions offer people access to credit they may not be able to get elsewhere.  Set up in the 1950s by the great Cork woman Ms Nora Herlihy, their aim was to provide ordinary people with bank-like facilities with which they could save and receive loans.  The founders of the movement, Ms Nora Herlihy, Mr. Sean Forde and Mr. Seamus MacEoin, were very much products of their time.  Shaped by the ideals of 1916 and driven by a desire to create a better society, they worked tirelessly to establish a national movement that would give ordinary people a degree, no matter how small, of financial security and access to credit.</p><p>  What makes the credit union movement unique and special is that at its core it was essentially about empowering, for the very first time, ordinary Irish men and women.  The founders had a vision of the type of institution they wanted to create and of its purpose.  It would be based on the notion of volunteerism, and it would be people-centred and built around communities.  It is worth remembering just how radical these ideas were in the Ireland of the 1950s and 1960s.  This was a time of high unemployment and massive emigration, with limited opportunities for ordinary working people.  Poverty was rampant and most people simply made do with what they had.  Household goods were bought only when absolutely necessary, and things such as travel and new clothing were deemed luxuries to be purchased for special occasions such as weddings or communions or in the event of a death.  As ordinary working people did not use banks, hire purchase was the order of the day; alternatively, people put deposits on clothes and other items.</p><p>  Set within the societal context of the 1950s and 1960s, the birth of the credit union movement was truly revolutionary.  The credit union - or the poor people's bank, as it was often referred to at the time - changed the lives of working-class men and women forever.  For the first time, people in towns and cities across Ireland had access to a cheap and secure form of credit that would allow them to move beyond an existence that was based on subsistence.</p><p>  The three aspects of the core ethos on which the credit union movement was founded - namely volunteerism, service and community - are also the key factors that helped it to flourish and grow.  Today, credit unions are to be found in every community in Ireland.  They are staffed and managed by committed workers who devote much of their own time to the service of their communities.  We should be proud that such a movement originated in Ireland, that it was founded by people who were committed to notions of social justice, equality and fairness, and that it has since been exported to developed and developing countries across the globe.</p><p>  Given its history and evolution and the key role it has played in Irish society and in bettering the lives of so many people, it is right that we approach any proposed changes to credit unions with caution and care.  Moreover, when one considers the current crisis of confidence in our financial institutions and the justified public anger at institutions and executives that have abused the people's trust, it is important to remind ourselves of the successes that endured even through the most reckless days of the boom.</p><p>  Credit unions are far from perfect and the Ireland in which they currently operate is dramatically different from that of the 1950s and, more importantly, from the Ireland of the Celtic tiger.  The credit union movement openly acknowledges that the regulatory context in which it operates is in need of reform.  In fact, the movement has been the leading advocate of this reform, which is the context in which this Bill must be set.</p><p>  In the main, Sinn Féin supports the Bill.  Our position is clear: we are in favour of effective and appropriate regulation for the credit union sector.  We want credit unions, their members and the communities of which they are a part to have the highest levels of protection, probity and governance.  However, we are also of the view that what is best and distinctive about the credit union movement - namely, its volunteer ethos and the fact it is rooted physically and ideologically in the community - should be safeguarded, valued and preserved.</p><p>  Some of the issues that are a cause of concern for credit unions are to do with the proposed governance changes, particularly the proposed term limits for directors and the prohibitions on board membership.  Sinn Féin agrees with the credit union movement that certain aspects of these sections of the Bill are unnecessary and that they could in effect undermine the volunteer spirit on which credit unions are based.  Indeed, small urban and rural credit unions could well end up in a situation in which they are unable to operate if they cannot meet the very strict exclusions that are set down in the Bill.  I know from first-hand experience that this is a real and genuine concern for people.  For example, in my own constituency of Cork East, volunteers are afraid that people who either are involved or who would like to be involved in their local credit unions might be excluded from doing so on the basis that they are deemed unfit.  In small towns and tight-knit urban communities, this would have a negative impact on community life and act as a deterrent against volunteering.</p><p>  The Irish credit union movement has made sensible arguments in support of the amendment of the relevant sections of the Bill, to which I hope the Government will respond positively.  There is a duty on us as legislators to ensure we do everything within our power to preserve what is a unique and valuable institution for future generations of ordinary working people.</p></speech>

Tá sé an-tábhachtach ar fad.  I am delighted to speak on the Bill.  Credit unions have served the people of Ireland well since they were first set up here in the 1950s to give ordinary families a hope of raising credit from their communities in order to build a home or a small business, and to help in their own way to make those communities thrive.  As other Deputies have mentioned, many of those people would never have set foot in a bank, as is so commonplace today.  The credit union was the financial institution of the common people, the ordinary working class people of Ireland.</p><p>The other option for the people it served were the moneylenders who charged high rates, kept people under their thumb and made threats to those who could not pay.  We do not need a history lesson on such lenders, although as many people are suffering from their practices now either from debts they racked up in the good times or small emergency debts they were forced to take on as their pay was cut, their tax was hiked and the austerity measures struck home.</p><p> While not an Irish invention the credit union has been taken to heart by Irish people.  With 2.9 million members in this State and in many areas, every man, woman and child has a few euro in the credit union.  People clearly understand through their credit union the solidarity at work in their communities and the way they have all contributed through this crucial institution to building a strong and vibrant locality.  In my area we have a number of credit unions which have served us well.  I am pleased that I contributed in my way to them personally and as an elected representative and community activist.  While many lending institutions have become pariahs, the credit union is still recognised as a valuable and respectable organisation which people trust and know that they are better off for having.</p><p> The ideals that founded the credit union movement are profoundly socialist, ones of co-operation between working people for the improvement of their conditions and life, a lesson we can all take something from as we approach a new budget and more expected hardship for those who can least afford it.  We in Sinn Féin broadly support the Bill, with a few exceptions.  It is essential to update the regulation of lending bodies in light of the problems created in the boom with the easy credit culture but it must be done correctly and tailored to specific institution types such as credit unions.  The Central Bank legislation which is to be applied now to credit unions is wholly inappropriate for such institutions.  It could be damaging to credit unions across the country which operate in a different manner to banks and should not be governed by the same regulation making them, in effect, one and the same.  That would be a great pity.</p><p> The Bill is lacking many of the positive recommendations made by the commission.  These include service sharing, social finance, microfinance for small business, co-operative ventures and the introduction of electronic payments.  I urge the Minister to consider my sincerely held views and ensure that the final Bill will be capable of enjoying the support of every Member such that it will be passed successfully, namely the services to which I referred.  The final Bill should include such measures for the improvement of credit union services to its members and its contribution to communities.</p><p> I cannot but heap praise on the credit unions in my area - Finglas, Ballymun, Santry and Whitehall.  The service they have given to the community is second to none, as is the respect they have given to customers.  As my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, stated yesterday, the ludicrous cap of €25,000 on borrowing for families from credit unions should come to an end.  However, we broadly support the Bill.

It has provided a culture of savings and prudent management of finance to thousands of individuals and families since it was set up by Nora Herlihy and her fellow pioneers and promoters of the Irish League of Credit Unions from its infancy.  The movement has developed to its current number of approximately 400 registered credit unions and a membership of approximately 3 million, which is by far the largest <i>pro rata</i> membership of any country in Europe.</p><p>  Following its inauguration in 1958 the credit unions mainly served the financial needs of disadvantaged communities and individuals who in many cases were denied access at the time to bank finance.  Due to extensive community involvement in the administration of credit unions they have progressed to being a distinct alternative to banks, especially in the context of the current financial climate.</p><p>  In drafting the credit union legislation we must be careful not to undermine credit unions or to kill them off.  No bailout was required for credit unions, unlike other institutions which cost the taxpayer up to &#8364;60 billion.  Credit unions do not provide large-scale commercial lending.  They provide vital support to small businesses and the community enterprises to which they cater, usually with modest loans.  The vast majority of such lending is for small businesses that cannot obtain funding from the pillar banks.</p><p>  The many people who are involved in the operation of credit unions across the country have serious concerns about the proposed legislation.  Despite statements to the contrary, little consultation has taken place with ordinary credit union activists who are genuinely fearful of the consequences of the proposed changes on credit unions and individual members.  The proposal in section 15 to introduce term limits and overly restrictive conditions on board membership will have significant implications for the recruitment of new directors.  There is also a major difficulty with section 20 which deals with the implementation of the proposed policy requiring the prior approval of the Central Bank for nominees going forward for election to officer positions.  Further restrictions outlined in section 18 on the tenure of the chair, as well as additional responsibilities of monitoring his or her fellow directors, will cause serious difficulties for credit unions.</p><p>  In section 24 the requirement to have a remuneration committee appears to indicate that in future directors will have to be paid for their services.  That will impose further costs on credit unions and sound the death knell for volunteerism in the movement.</p><p>  Despite the fact that the directors remain responsible for the control and direction of credit unions, the significant post of treasurer is being abolished.  One would have thought that at this time when the clamour of corporate accountability and openness is deafening the post of treasurer, which provides the board with the required degree of oversight and inquiry, would be retained in some shape or form.  Furthermore, it is the treasurer who reports on the credit union&#8217;s performance on behalf of the board to the general membership at the AGM, and as a result holds a special relationship with members.</p><p>  Other anomalies must be addressed such as the position of tellers who are board members and who undertake part-time duty on the counter.  In the event of a board meeting taking place on a particular night he or she would be unable to attend and would be prohibited, as such, from being a member of the board.  It would have a negative effect, in particular on smaller credit unions if qualified and well-trained staff are banned from holding a dual function.</p><p>  Last March the Commission on Credit Unions, which comprised the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Credit Union Development Association and the Irish League of Credit Unions, agreed a recommendation that would allow credit unions to invest in Government-sponsored projects and schemes.  The provision has been omitted in the final draft of the Bill.  The preservation and continuation of credit unions and their not-for-profit ethos and role in attaining the economic and social goals of members is paramount.  The recommendation should be included in any proposed legislation we put to the House.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the Bill, which I support.  I also commend the work of my colleagues in the Labour Party, Deputy Kevin Humphreys and Deputy Arthur Spring, on their work on the Bill in the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  A level of consensus is evident in the contributions of Members from all political parties and those of Independent Deputies on the need to regulate and reform the credit union movement.  It has also been acknowledged that the Bill is a work in progress and there is opportunity for reform.  We must take advantage of that.</p><p>  A number of issues have been raised in the discussion to date, in particular the concept of allowing credit unions to share services.</p><p>Under such a system, if a member of a Dublin credit union, for example, were to visit Galway, Limerick or even another part of Dublin city, he or she could enter a credit union there and lodge money or pay off a due loan payment.  Such a concept is logical and would be user-friendly for the consumer.  One must ask why such a measure is not included in the Bill and also about the degree to which the Irish Banking Federation lobbied against it.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on that point and will examine possible changes in this regard at further Stages of the Bill.</p><p> A second issue is financial inclusion.  Prior to entering the Oireachtas I participated in consultation between the Department of Finance, non-governmental organisations and community and voluntary groups on the topic of financial inclusion, which has the aim of ensuring that every citizen in the country has access to a basic bank account.  The credit union movement has the potential to unlock and develop such a mechanism.  A strong argument has been made that credit unions should be able to issue debit cards, for example, as distinct from credit cards.  They should be able to do so, allowing people to bank with them, because people on low incomes may not have a history of dealing with financial institutions, which, as we know, can be intimidating.  They have even proved intimidating for Ministers.  Credit unions are rooted in communities and can be a good starting point for people who wish to develop their financial management skills.</p><p> I cannot understand why a provision for credit unions to invest in Government projects has not been included.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government, agreed by the Labour Party and Fine Gael, to examine certain social investment bonds.  Such a concept would permit credit unions and other institutions that have a social as well as an economic function to invest in projects in this country, both in the interests of their members and with the aim of freeing up capital.  It would be a logical proposal and merits consideration in a time of scarce resources.</p><p> I see this Bill as part of a broader pattern of financial sector reform in this country.  The Minister is present in the Chamber, and the budget is only some weeks away.  I hope he will look closely at reform of the financial services sector and that he will change his position on the financial transaction tax.  Support for such a tax is a mainstream position in Europe.  My Labour Party colleague Nessa Childers, MEP, has done tremendous work in highlighting this issue.  As a Deputy from Dublin's north side, I am acutely aware that a possible risk to jobs is not something that should prohibit us from taxing those financial institutions that make massive profits and have done so much to decimate and destroy this and other economies across Europe.  I make this point because the Bill is part of a broader package of financial sector reforms.  I commend the Minister on the legislation and am happy to inspect it further.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to say some brief words on the Bill.  Coming from the constituency of Cork North-West, the home place of Nora Herlihy of Ballydesmond, I am acutely conscious of the ethos of the credit union movement and the reach it has into local communities.  The financial rot that engulfed the State in recent years did not happen only to high street financial institutions.  The fact that we are responding with legislation on credit unions reflects the involvement, to one degree or another, of all financial institutions in the State and our need to take another look at the regulatory framework within which they exist.  For that reason, I welcome the legislation.  Broadly speaking, it is the result of the work of the Commission on Credit Unions, which engaged extensively with stakeholders over a protracted period of almost a year.  It is giving effect, in legislative format, to some 60 recommendations made in the commission's report.  The Irish League of Credit Unions was party to the commission, but I understand that although it may have taken a view at a certain level, there are concerns within the movement.  I have been contacted about those concerns by communities who are at the coalface of delivery of services through the credit union movement.</p><p>  Primarily, however, the legislation is about prudential requirements for credit unions, which reflects the fact that we are dealing with local citizens' money and that we must be prudent in this regard.  It deals with governance and restructuring requirements.  Obviously, that will be unpalatable in local communities where the credit unions tend to be part and parcel of community identity.  Telling one local parish credit union it may have to merge or join with another is a difficult task.  There is also a commitment with regard to the State putting its money where its mouth is, and rightly so.  The State is saying, in effect, that it acknowledges the difficulty the credit union movement is in and is prepared to bail out individual credit unions.  That would be only fair given what taxpayers have been asked to carry already.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that.</p><p>  I acknowledge that there are difficult days ahead for individual credit unions.  The requirement to put terms on the length of service of directors is a difficult one.  We tend to celebrate the volunteer ethic, but if one looks at any community one will see that those involved are a handful of people, the same ones who volunteer in every organisation.  They are in the GAA, political parties, the credit union movement and the community council.  We are not oversubscribed with volunteers, and that will be a challenge.  None the less, the lifeblood of any credit union is in new voices.  If one becomes a prisoner to the same faces all the time, there is scope for complacency.  Although the directorial time limits represent a challenge, it is not a bad idea, and one we might tease out further on Committee Stage.  I refer to the issue of treasurers.  It is important to separate the governance role from the manager's role.  We can examine this on Committee Stage, but I do not think it is a bad idea.  It is important that the Central Bank recognises and differentiates its engagement with the credit union movement.  It must develop a protocol in that regard which recognises that credit unions operate based on a volunteer ethic whereby most of those involved do not work full-time.  </p><p>  I welcome the legislation.  It is important that we empower credit unions to respond to a changing 21st-century environment and that we put them on a firm basis.  Finding new blood and new directors will be a challenge but every credit union should aspire to having new faces and new ideas.  I disagree with Deputy Fleming on the issue of staff members being directors; in my view, that is not a good idea.  It could lead to capture in terms of the proper decisions that need to be made.  The proposed measures for clear differentiation and good governance show that the Bill is taking us in the right direction.</p></speech>

I recognise the special role credit unions play in the financial sector in Ireland and am keen to ensure the viability of credit unions nationwide.  It is clear, however, that systemic failings in the regulation of the financial sector in recent times have led to the requirement for the State to bail out our banks at enormous cost to the taxpayer.  Although I certainly do not wish to tar credit unions with the same brush, I accept that the outdated legislation from 1942 needs to be updated.</p><p>  The credit union sector has performed well in comparison to the banks, but some 30 credit unions have received emergency funds from a rescue scheme set up by the league that represents the sector.  It has been reported recently that worried regulators have 100 credit unions under close supervision because of fears about rising loan arrears.</p><p>These comprise one quarter of the credit unions in the State.  Thousands of loans at the affected credit unions are not being repaid and this is putting huge financial pressure on their balance sheets.  The State has set aside millions of euro to allow it to deal with weaker credit unions.  I hope the merger of weaker credit unions and their stronger counterparts will allow the credit union movement to emerge from this process in a healthy financial position.</p><p> The Credit Union Bill 2012 largely reflects the recommendations set out in the final report of the Commission on Credit Unions which was published in March.  The commission included representatives of all stakeholder groups in the credit union sector.  The Irish League of Credit Unions was centrally involved in the Bill's development, drafting and finalisation.  The league is not only a signatory to the agreed report, it also co-authored it.  It is important that all those who drafted and agreed to the commission's report continue to stand foursquare behind it, particularly as the difficulties being faced by credit unions and the scale of the challenge ahead require steadfastness and leadership at all levels of the movement.  The viability of the sector can only be secured through a fundamental reform of how credit unions are run and regulated.  The Bill legislates for this reform and is designed to ensure the credit union sector will never again be brought to the brink.</p><p> I am a great believer in the whole idea behind the credit union movement.  Credit unions can play a leadership role in local communities.  Above all, their strength lies in the fact that they have knowledge of the local people with whom they deal.  The banks did not possess such knowledge, which is why difficulties arose.  Credit unions possess an abundance of the knowledge to which I refer.  I hope the enactment of the legislation before the House will lead to the emergence of strengthened and better credit unions that will serve their members and the communities in which they are located.</p></speech>

I welcome the legislation.  There are a couple of issues which I have been discussing with Deputy Michael Creed and which I wish to raise with the Minister.</p><p>  My first point relates to smaller credit unions.  Like most other parts of the country, that from which I come, namely, south County Kilkenny, has a large number of very small credit unions which do fine and important work.  People who are involved with these organisations in a voluntary capacity have raised their concerns with me.  Such concerns relate to the limit being placed on the period for which directors can remain in position.  I agree with the principle of what the Minister is trying to do, which was agreed to by the representatives of the credit unions on the commission.  Many very small credit unions may only open for a number of hours in the evening a few days each week and will encounter grave difficulties in attracting a large turnover of new directors.  In such circumstances, there should be a mechanism whereby the directors of such credit unions could be allowed to remain in position for longer than that proposed in the legislation.</p><p>  The other issue raised with me involves those volunteers who work in credit unions in the evenings when they have finished working in their normal place of employment.  These individuals deal with members of the public who go to their credit unions in order to lodge money or avail of the other services on offer.  Many of the very small credit unions to which I refer rely to a large extent on voluntarism in order to operate.  A balance can be struck in the legislation in order to ensure this voluntarism will be protected and that the people who give of their free time in order to ensure these institutions remain in operation will be accommodated.</p></speech>

As stated in my initial contribution, the Credit Union Bill 2012 is an important step towards placing the Irish credit union movement on a sustainable path for the longer term.  The Government recognises the importance of the credit union sector as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between it and other types of financial institutions.</p><p>  The Government's commitment to implementing the report of the Commission on Credit Unions is backed by the solid, early delivery of major elements contained therein.  These include the publication of the Credit Union Bill 2012 which implements over 60 of the commission's recommendations, the commencement of fitness and probity measures and the requirement for contributions from credit unions under the deposit guarantee scheme and the establishment of the credit union restructuring board, ReBo, on an administrative basis - pending enactment of the legislation - in order to ensure the early commencement of its work.  The Bill sets out a package of measures which were agreed to by all stakeholders on the commission and which will underpin the stability of the sector into the future.  The Irish League of Credit Unions had the largest representation on the commission and agreed to all of its recommendations.</p><p>  The Government has already shown its commitment to credit unions by setting aside €500 million to ensure the viability and long-term sustainability of the sector at a time when the country's resources are stretched.  The provision of such funding, with necessary changes to prudential and governance requirements, is aimed at bringing about a strong and stable credit union sector in the future.  This would be an outcome that would be in the interests of stakeholders.</p><p>  I will reflect on the matters to which Deputies referred, including those raised on behalf of the Irish League of Credit Unions, and look forward to a constructive debate on Committee Stage.  However, there are one or two matters with which I would like to deal now.  The first of these is that there appears to be a major misunderstanding with regard to the application of banking legislation to the credit union movement.  A theory seems to have developed to the effect that the Central Bank never had a role in regulating credit unions, that the Bill is conferring such a role on it for the first time and that rules which previously only applied to banks will now apply to credit unions also.  That is not true.  The Central Bank Acts already apply to credit unions.  For example, the Central Bank Act 1942 sets out the role and responsibilities of the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Central Bank Act 1971 specifically exempts credit unions from the requirement to hold banking licences and the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 applies fitness and probity provisions to credit unions.</p><p>  The Commission on Credit Unions recommended that section 184 of the Credit Union Act 1997 regarding the Central Bank Acts be reviewed.  Among other reasons, it is necessary to unify the application of the Central Bank Acts in order to allow the commission's recommendations to be implemented.  I refer, for example, to the application of administrative sanctions to credit unions, the ability of credit unions to appeal directions to the Irish Financial Services Appeal Tribunal and the need to clarify the level of recourse to the Financial Services Ombudsman available to credit unions and their members.  Most of the changes outlined in the Bill give to credit unions provisions they have sought.  The theory that the Bill involves applying the Central Bank Acts that are applicable to banks to credit unions is simply incorrect.  I do not know from where that theory came.</p><p>  In the context of the term limits being imposed on certain officers of credit unions, I want to use the Bill to introduce the principle of renewal.  We are all aware of organisations which became moribund because there was no change in personnel at the top.  One of the biggest reforms in my party was introduced by the late Dr. Garrett FitzGerald in respect of officers of branches.  These individuals had previously served indefinitely, but a change was introduced to our constitution to the effect that an individual could only serve as an officer for three consecutive years.  This resulted in the required renewal.  Many members will be familiar with GAA clubs throughout the country which retain groups of gentlemen who discuss the make-up of teams outside the chapel gate each Sunday.  These are usually not the clubs that win club matches or county championships.</p><p>Those which can renew themselves are more vital.  It is also reasonable to introduce a renewal provision to the credit union movement.  The issue is not the number of years, one we can discuss on Committee Stage, but the principle of renewal of the officer boards of credit unions.</p><p> One Deputy mentioned the financial transaction tax.  What is being discussed in Europe is the payment of stamp duty on share transactions and perhaps other financial instruments.  We already do this in our tax laws.  Share transactions in Ireland are taxed by way of stamp duty at a rate of 1%.  What is being proposed is that something similar be introduced for share and other transactions, with a starting point of 0.1%, perhaps increasing subsequently.  We are not out of line with what is happening elsewhere in Europe.  However, we are not participating in the enhanced co-operation mechanism in which other countries are participating because we do not want to create a situation where the 33,000 jobs in the financial services sector in Ireland would be put at risk of transfer to a more benign tax regime in London.  That is the only issue involved.  We do not have a problem in principle with a financial transaction tax.</p><p> I look forward to a very constructive Committee Stage debate.  I invite Deputies to table any amendment they consider appropriate and it can be discussed on its merits.</p></speech>

I compliment the work of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, in dealing with the issue of domestic and sexual violence.  His address at the sexual and domestic violence conference earlier this month clearly demonstrated his support for the eradication or, at least, the amelioration of such crimes.  I welcome his commitment to introduce reformed domestic violence legislation.  I ask him to consider the points I raise in that context.</p><p>  I am very concerned about the occurrence of violence in the home and the risks posed to the safety of the injured parties, the majority of whom are women, and also children who are affected by domestic violence in many ways.  Often, they are the victims of the violent perpetrator.  There seems to be a myth that only the mother experiences domestic violence, but international research demonstrates the co-occurrence of child abuse and domestic violence.  Domestic violence has an impact on the physical safety and emotional development of the child.  The new Article 42A of the Constitution will ensure the voice of the child is heard in court proceedings on issues of access, custody and guardianship.  Children living in homes in which they experience domestic violence must have their voice heard in family law proceedings.  I ask the Minister to reinstate the makiing of child welfare and safety assessments.  It is not right that custody and unsupervised access can be granted to a parent who is a perpetrator of domestic violence.  The court must be satisfied that a child will be safe before granting unsupervised access.  Therefore, there needs to be a child welfare and safety assessment carried out by a professional probation officer or social worker.</p><p>  The argument made is that such provisions cost money and a moratorium on the making of public appointments is in place.  However, I ask the Minister to look at the system as it stands.  A person accused of an indictable crime is means-tested and may be granted immediate free legal aid.  This is not the case for victims of domestic violence.  Within the constraints of the budget available, I ask that X amount be granted for criminal cases and Y amount be retained for cases of domestic violence.  It seems more resources are being offered to criminals if they pass the means test, while women and children suffering from domestic violence cannot avail of services.  Children have no voice in the family courts and oftentimes are very distressed when sent back to the violent home.  They are emotionally abused when forced to witness the abuse of their mother.  Therefore, there needs to be a risk assessment carried out.  The commitment to Children First and Article 42A of the Constitution to give a voice to children must be upheld in law and also in its spirit.</p><p>  In criminal cases a court can be called to arraign criminals, but this is not the case for abused women who may have been battered, beaten and raped.  Victims of domestic violence need out-of-hours protection services.  If a domestic violence incident occurs on a Friday evening, there is no recourse to the courts until at least the following Monday.  While gardaí can arrest in certain cases, station bail is usually granted within a few hours.  In other cases, gardaí may be unable to make an arrest owing to a lack of evidence.  The perpetrator of violence who is neither arrested nor charged is free to return to the scene of the abuse which, in a case of domestic violence, is the home.  In these cases the only option for women and children who have reason to be fearful is to leave.  However, family and friends may not be willing to accommodate them, while the women's refuges are often full.</p></speech>

She placed particular emphasis on domestic violence against children as opposed to domestic violence against spouses.  Violence against children by parents is an aspect of child abuse within the home.  A feature of the spectrum of domestic violence is that spouses perpetrate violence against each other.  More frequent is violence by the husband against the wife, but there have been instances over the years of wives being violent against husbands.  Frequently, children are caught in the middle where there is domestic violence.  We should never simplify this area.  There are spouses who are violent towards each other but who are never violent towards their children.  However, children suffer severe psychological trauma and damage when they witness parents being violent against each other, or one parent perpetrating violence against the other.  Equally, there are parents who are physically violent towards their children.  This is of particular concern and it arises frequently in the family courts when dealing with proceedings taken by parents who are separating spouses or separated partners.  Those proceedings were taken under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  Under our statutory provisions, the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in making decisions about the custody of or access to a child.  As the Deputy stated, that protection is now enhanced by the constitutional amendment on children's rights, which seeks to ensure that, in dealing with guardianship, custody and access cases, the best interests of the child constitutionally will be regarded as the paramount consideration.</p><p>  It was my concern for some time prior to my becoming Minister that the courts did not have the back-up required in undertaking child assessments where allegations are made.  My experience as a family lawyer over the years demonstrates that allegations of violence against a child by one parent against the other are not always true.  Sometimes they are used as a weapon in a marital battle to try to prevent an appropriate parent from having contact with children.</p><p>  In July of this year, I announced we would proceed to have a constitutional referendum to facilitate the establishment of new court systems, including family court systems.  One reason is that we need to move away from the current court structure.  We need a unified and integrated family court structure with judges with expertise in this area and with the appropriate back-up assessment services.  The Deputy is correct to say there is a financial cost involved in this.  Some 20 years ago, when the probation service was called the probation and welfare service, the welfare side of the service was used in family disputes in the District Court to undertake child assessments to assist the judge in reaching decisions.  Some considerable years ago, that role was removed from the probation and welfare service, which is now essentially a probation service.  I have no doubt there is a need, in appropriate cases, for such assessments to be carried out.  There is a need for the courts to listen to what children have to say.  The amendment made to the Constitution on Saturday – the votes were counted on Sunday – gives a voice to the child.  It is important that the courts, considering children's age and level of understanding, take cognisance of what they say.</p><p>  In dealing with allegations of violence, it is terribly important that the courts be informed, not just in child protection cases but also in disputes relating to custody and access.  It is also important that false allegations not be used to prevent a child from having a right of contact with parents who can no longer live with each other.  I assure the Deputy that these are all issues in which I have had considerable interest for some substantial time.  The court system and assessment issues will be part and parcel of the reforms we hope to introduce, on condition that we have a successful referendum on the courts issue.</p></speech>

I have spoken about this in the Chamber previously.</p><p>  I reiterate the importance of out-of-hours cover.  Will the Minister consider what is being done in Austria, Germany, a pilot area in the United Kingdom and New South Wales.  Emergency orders are made through a police application to the court or an authorisation officer via telephone, fax or e-mail.</p><p>  Women experiencing domestic violence are often controlled, followed, harassed and stalked by their abusers during their relationships and after separation.  Stalking often escalates after separation as the perpetrator may want to continue to control the victim.  We need to introduce a specific offence of stalking into Irish law, as exists in Scotland and Victoria.  Stalking should be recognised as grounds for a safety order.  When formulating the definition of the offence, we must take into account new technologies, including text messaging, the Internet, social media, blogs, etc.  Currently, harassment is dealt with under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 but it is difficult to prove there has been harassment based on the definition contained in the Act.</p></speech>

Domestic violence legislation is now contained in more than one main Act.  Piecemeal changes have been made to the legislation and it is important that it be consolidated.  It is important to introduce additional reforms.</p><p>  It is, of course, important that victims of domestic violence, whether perpetrated by a spouse or cohabitant or directed towards the child, be aware that there are remedies within our court system to allow one obtain a protection order, safety order or, in appropriate cases, a barring order.  Protection orders can be granted on an <i>ex parte</i> basis.  I appreciate, however, that the Deputy is raising the issue of obtaining some protection at weekends.  The Garda is available to provide protection against domestic violence.  The Garda's policy on domestic-violence intervention clearly outlines the procedures to be adopted by all members of the force.  In cases of domestic violence, the Garda has a pro-arrest policy to protect spouses or partners and their families.  It also gives advice on local support services.</p><p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I appreciate that, in a Topical Issue debate, one cannot deal with the matter comprehensibly.  However, I am fully aware of the concerns raised by the Deputy and we will do our best to ensure they are properly addressed.</p></speech>

I commend the Minister on implementing the measure in this regard.  I have called for it for many years.  It was in the Labour Party's manifesto prior to the last general election and it is in the programme for Government.  It is one of many commitments in the programme for Government that have been achieved to date.</p><p>  The purpose of the residential property price register is to normalise the housing market and to give accurate and clear information to house purchasers.  The obvious question that needs to be asked this evening concerns why it has taken so long to arrive at this position.</p><p>  The United Nations, as part of its programme in developing countries and eastern European countries that are restructuring their social and private residential housing sectors, has as a basic criterion the putting in place of a house price database.  This is because the absence of such a database is one of the most significant causes of house price bubbles, such as that experienced in Ireland.  In this State, estate agents, valuers and others overinflated the prices of property.</p><p>They were advertised in newspapers and it became a major income stream for newspapers across the country.  They were advertising prices above the market value and there was no clear information for purchasers on the true value, which gave rise to a compound effect that resulted in house prices increasing indefinitely.  Now that the register has been established, there are some measures that could be introduced to improve it.  I would welcome the Minister taking on board some of the suggestions I will make.</p><p> When a property is sold, there is no indication whether it is an apartment, a house - whether it be an end of terrace, gable end or mid-terrace house - or the square footage involved.  There is no information other than its value.  When people log onto the website, as many do - it has proved to be very successful in terms of public access - all they see is a valuation of the property.  That is fine if one knows the type of property at which one is looking, but the website does not include a general scheme of the house, nor does it give the relative value.</p><p> I propose to the Minister that, as part of the conveyancing completion process - I know the information is assimilated by the Revenue Commissioners and sent to the database - including some additional boxes to be ticked in the system would allow for an indication to be given as to whether a property is a house or an apartment and has one or three bedrooms, as to the square footage and so forth.  That would lend itself to allowing more accurate information to be provided and achieve the goal we want to achieve in the residential property market, namely, to ensure people are given accurate information and pay realistic prices for their homes.</p></speech>

I know it is one in which he has a personal interest.</p><p>  The Property Services Regulatory Authority which comes under the aegis of my Department published the Residential Property Price Register as recently as 30 September.  All of the information on the register is publicly available, free of charge, on its website.  The register has been produced by the authority under section 86 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 which explicitly provides that the register of residential property prices shall contain the address of the property, the price at which the property was sold and the date of sale of the property.  The register includes information on residential properties purchased in the State since 1 January 2010, as declared to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes.  It contains the price paid for individual properties and details of all residential sales, both cash sales and sales with mortgages.  The particulars published in the register include the price, the date of sale and the address, including house number, of each residential property sold in Ireland since 1 January 2010.  The information will be updated on a regular basis and, for the most part, is published within one month of the date of sale of the property.</p><p>  The register can be searched by reference to a number of criteria, including all sales by county, city or town, individual property address and year.  This important new facility enables members of the public to discover easily and quickly prices paid for properties sold in Ireland.  It provides buyers and sellers of residential property with a service they have previously lacked, namely, accurate and up-to-date information on the market price of individual properties on the date of sale.</p><p>  The publication of the Residential Property Prices Database fulfils a key commitment in the programme for Government &quot;to improve the quality of information available on the Irish housing market by requiring that the selling price of all dwellings is recorded in a publicly available, national house price database&quot;.  The establishment of the database was first recommended many years ago.  In my first year in office as Minister I prioritised enactment of the required legislation, among other things, to facilitate the establishment of the Residential Property Price Register.  Accordingly, I formally established the Property Services Regulatory Authority on a statutory basis on 3 April last.  The register was put online with praiseworthy speed.</p><p>  In recent years, because of the steep downturn in the property market, it has been difficult to obtain accurate information on property prices.  This uncertainty has led to a lack of investor confidence and may have contributed to stagnation in the property market, particularly among first-time buyers.  The publication of the register should, I hope, help to remove some of this uncertainty, restore some confidence in the property market and provide for some transparency in residential property sale prices.  However, it cannot solve all of the problems impacting on the property market.</p><p>  I note the Deputy's view that other information should be included in the register such as whether a property is a house or an apartment, the number of bedrooms, the square footage, the site area and the local authority area.  It is important to note in this context that the register is not intended to serve as a property price index.  In accordance with the legislation, the details made available on the property price register are limited to price, address and date of sale.  They do not include such details as property size or number of rooms.  Individuals interested in particular properties who look them up on the website have the facility to visit the area if they are not familiar with it and readily identify whether they are talking about a detached house, a semi-detached house, an apartment, a cottage, a bungalow or any other type of construction.  The register has simply been designed to provide on an ongoing basis accurate prices of residential properties purchased on a particular date.  As I have mentioned, the information contained therein is derived from the information declared to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes.  The categories of information sought for inclusion on the register are not included in the information submitted to Revenue for stamp duty purposes.  Accordingly, it would not be possible to include the information the Deputy is seeking in the register.</p></speech>

The house price property database is a good idea, but I am proposing measures that would improve it.  We must focus on the desired goals and outcomes in having a house price property register.  The information to which I have referred that could be included in the register is already available because it is part of the conveyancing process.  People would lay out a description of the house and it would be a case of ticking boxes to indicate whether the property was a house, a flat, an apartment, a gable end, semi-detached or detached property, and the number of bedrooms.  One would be required to tick four or five boxes and this could be done as part of the transfer of the information to Revenue.  I am aware the information is used for stamp duty purposes, but as we move towards a more progressive property tax model and away from stamp duty, we need to adopt a more progressive approach to the way we determine the valuations of properties.  I impress upon the Minister that what I am proposing would make a good idea better and future proof what has been a missing aspect of the way houses are costed.</p></speech>

What he has said is interesting and I will bear in mind what he has suggested.  I do not believe, however, that it falls within the current requirements of the legislation which only prescribes the information currently on the register which has been furnished since 2010.  Such information could not be obtained retrospectively.  It may be at some future date by way of amending legislation or other statutory instrument.  It would be possible to expand the register further and it does provide substantial additional information.  It is a website that is very popular and which has had many thousands of hits.  It makes the information available readily accessible to many individuals.  It is a great pity there was such a site ten years ago.</p></speech>

I will not suggest we necessarily would not have had a property bubble or boom if such information was made available many years ago, as individuals might still have been stampeded into buying property and led to believe prices always increased and never collapsed.  We might still have had banks failing to undertake due diligence assessments of individuals and offering sums of money that were unrealistic to purchase property in circumstances where a due diligence investigation would have indicated such individuals were entering into unaffordable arrangements.  I do not, therefore, want to make wild claims for the register.  It is a brick in the wall of the protections necessary for individuals and provides for a degree of transparency.  I again thank the Deputy for his interest in the matter and the suggestions he has made.</p></speech>

Today we learned from a newspaper report that CIE’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, have stated the company’s status as a going concern is at considerable risk.  This should cause considerable concern to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the House.  The rail section of CIE recorded a deficit of approximately €22 million, even after receiving a considerable subvention for current spending of €149 million.  PricewaterhouseCoopers has warned about the company’s finances and whether it can be a viable business.  The auditors spoke of, “Material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group's and company's ability to continue as a going concern.”  When an auditor with the reputation of PricewaterhouseCoopers puts such a commentary in the audited accounts of a company, which were also overdue, then immediate action must be taken by the Minister and the Government.</p><p>  In July, I intensely questioned the Minister about his proposal to get an additional €36 million from other areas in his Department to shore up CIE’s financial position.  He assured me then it was available.  Last month, during Question Time we learned none of this money has yet been paid over.  Again, the Minister was quite vague and talked about the necessity of CIE to demonstrate to him its capacity to make significant savings in the years ahead.  He also stated that while he may be able to provide funding this year, he would not be able to do so heretofore.</p><p>  Depending on the strength of the Minister’s position, this news today could spell a serious disaster for the public transport network.  CIE, as the Minister of State knows, has cut rail and bus services in rural areas and across Dublin.  That is fine if the Government’s requirement is about just having CIE as a going concern.  It will be able to balance its books.  However, as a public transport company, I believe the Government must ensure it meets its policy platform of having an integrated network and providing public transport to the citizens of this State.  There is a significant difference between the fiduciary duties of CIE’s directors and the role of the Minister.  It is not good enough to say it is up to the board of the company to resolve the issues.  Quite frankly, it might not be in a position to do so.  It must get its accounts in order, the directors’ fiduciary duties require them to balance the books and meet the company’s financial commitments.</p><p>  However, the Minister has a different role in that he has to ensure we have a public transport network that is fit for purpose.  I am concerned the Minister is taking a hands-off approach.  I hope the Minister will give confidence to me and the travelling public that there will be no further diminutions of public transport services.  We need to have a viable public transport network at a time when we are trying to reduce the number of private cars on the road and assist the economic recovery.</p></speech>

In the absence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, who is abroad on official business, I have been asked to respond on his behalf to the issue raised.</p><p>  The 2011 annual report and financial statements for CIE were noted by the Government yesterday.  The accounts, and those of its three subsidiary companies, were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas earlier today.  The accounts have also been published on the CIE and subsidiary companies' websites.</p><p>  An unqualified audit report was issued by the group's auditors on CIE's 2011 financial statements.  However, the auditors have included an emphasis of matter paragraph regarding the group's ability to continue as a going concern.  The auditors note funding and trading difficulties give rise to uncertainty for the business and challenge the group's ability to continue to trade as a going concern.  The board of CIE expects these uncertainties can be addressed through a range of measures including the realisation of non-core assets, reduction in cost base including payroll reductions, multi-annual fare increases and curtailment of the own-funded capital programme.</p><p>  CIE suffered a loss, after exceptional items, of €6.1 million in 2011 compared to losses of €53.6 million in 2010 and €77.7 million in 2009.  The improvement in the operating result over 2010 arises from lower voluntary redundancy costs and a gain of €22.3 million in 2011 on disposal of assets.  The CIE Group is struggling with a difficult financial situation.  On 24 July last, the Government decided to provide additional funding of €36 million to CIE to ensure the companies could continue to operate for the rest of 2012.  This would bring the total subvention for this year to €278 million, higher than the subvention level for 2010 and the fifth highest level of subvention ever.</p><p>  To date, the total subvention paid amounts to €252 million.  At this very difficult time for the public finances, it was not easy to find a large amount of additional funds.  It involved difficult decisions in having to divert funding from other worthwhile and important projects and initiatives, as well as imposing sacrifices on others.  The Minister has indicated he wants to see significant progress made by CIE in the development of a realistic, sustainable and robust business plan to deal with the current economic realities, cost reductions with the CIE Group and employee support for same, the sale of non-core assets and the securing of new credit facilities.</p><p>  These various avenues are being explored and may reduce the need for the level of funding required.  The Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, are meeting regularly with the chairman and senior executives of the CIE companies as well as having met with union representatives.  The Minister has pointed out that the additional funding for this year only provides a short breathing space to CIE.  It is essential the management and staff in the CIE companies use this time productively to discuss and implement proposals to cut costs that can help address the serious financial position in which the CIE Group finds itself.</p><p>  CIE is progressing the preparation of a revised five-year business plan with aggressive targets that will support the reporting of trading improvements in 2013.  It is intended that the business plan will address the underlying financial challenges facing CIE so that CIE's public transport services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively over the plan period.  In publishing its accounts, CIE has reiterated it will continue to engage positively with the Minister, his Department and the National Transport Authority to plan its business taking account of the constrained funding environment.</p></speech>

It is clear to me that the Government has decided the resolution of this matter will be through the further diminution of services provided by the CIE companies.  I spoke to two Fianna Fáil councillors in Dublin today, Mary Fitzpatrick and Paul McAuliffe, about cutbacks in public transport services in Dublin.  Paul McAuliffe told me earlier this year Dublin Bus proposed new bus routes for the Finglas-East and Glasnevin areas.  After circulating the proposed routes to local residents, he received a large number of angry responses.  Following his intervention with a local campaign to protect the services, they managed to save the No. 19 bus route which provided services for Grove Park and Tolka Estate.  There is still a real loss of service in these areas.  Some areas will no longer have services that are direct cross-city or provide access to certain hospitals.  Mary Fitzpatrick informed me that Broomebridge railway station still needs building and structural improvements, new customer shelters and seating on platforms, improvements in lighting and upgrades of station and approach road signage.</p><p>These are all the things the Minister of State referred to as part of the reduction process.  Effectively we are going to downgrade our public transport infrastructure and we will damage our public transport network as a result.  There is a group outside the gate which the Minister of State can meet on the way out if he wishes.  They are from Roosky and Dromod and they are highlighting the fact that the Bus Éireann bus now bypasses those villages.  They are putting it to anyone who is prepared to sit and talk that the reductions are impacting on the Bus Éireann network and that as the Government starts to chip away at the services, it is dismantling a network that has been put together over many generations.  The Minister of State must try to protect what is in place and find whatever capacity he can to do so.</p></speech>

CIE has been increasing the fares but it simply cannot go on.  It will reach a stage when people will be unable to afford the fares.  We need to encourage more people to use public transport.  The reason buses, including the bus to which Deputy Dooley referred, are being taken off the road is that CIE and Irish Rail maintain that the problem is that people are not using them.  We need to get more and more people using public transport.</p><p>  I noted in my reply that the companies have received a record amount of subventions this year and the Government is committed to the €36 million.  Arrangements are being made to draw down the funding in the amount of €16 million but CIE cannot continue to come back to the Government.  CIE must put forward proposals and plans and put in place a business plan to ensure it is competitive.  Other people and services have lost out as a result of this.  Other commitments were made by the Department with that money in mind this year but we have had to use it to subvent CIE.  It cannot go on and CIE must start to work on it.  Deputy Dooley comes from rural Ireland, as do I.  There are empty trains going up and down.  Why is CIE not using the business brain to try to get more numbers on trains?  Why does it not put on special offers and deals rather than remain dependent on putting up fares?</p></speech>

My comments do not relate to any specific case but to the need to legislate for the X case.  The fact that 20 years after a Supreme Court ruling the Oireachtas has absolutely failed to vindicate the rights of citizens, or ensure that where there is a real and substantial threat to the life of a mother a pregnancy can be terminated, is a damning indictment of this country and of the legislators who have served in successive Dáil terms since then.  It is simply unacceptable for us to allow that situation to continue on our watch.  I understand the report of the working group was on the desk of the Minister for Health last night, according to the Taoiseach.  Has the Minister read the report?</p><p>  Previously in the House the Minister has stated that he would act.  Will the Minister give a commitment now to the people, especially to Irish women who are looking on with shock and disdain for the Oireachtas because of our failure to legislate on this crucial public health issue?  Will the Minister bring forward the necessary legislation to provide for the protection for women throughout the duration of their pregnancy?  Will he ensure that where their lives are at risk all procedures will be available in our hospitals including, where necessary, a termination to protect the life of the mother?</p><p>  The Minister will be judged on how he acts on this issue and on whether he fails to deal with it or whether he has the courage to act on it.  The thousands of people who have contacted us and who are in shock because of this issue want answers and an explanation about how this has been allowed to go on.</p></speech>

It was passed and now we will proceed to legislate for it, rightly so.</p><p>  There have been two referendums on the Supreme Court judgment of 1992 which ruled that abortion was legal in Ireland where a woman's life was at risk, including where there was a threat of suicide, but we have not yet legislated for it.  Six Governments have failed to legislate despite the people having spoken on two occasions.  Why is this?  When I challenged the Minister for Health in the Dáil in November last year about the Government's failure to prioritise the issue, he replied that the Government has many priorities.  Clearly, this is not at the top of the list.  When asked about abortion in an interview with <i>Time </i>magazine in September the Taoiseach stated that he thought the issue was not a priority for the Government at the time.</p><p>  The failure to pass the Bill, which we introduced last April, to legislate for the X case is damning.  Would Savita Halappanavar be alive today if we had done so?  The people expect us to legislate in their best interests.  Did we fail to do so?  Did a majority of Deputies here on that night last April believe it was right to vote &quot;Yes&quot; to legislate for something six Governments had failed to do?  Instead, they decided to play politics with us, set up yet another group to examine the matter and in the process the Government become the seventh to kick the can down the road.  Many people must dearly wish that vote result had been different.  In recent days Ms Halappanavar's husband said that if this had happened in the United Kingdom or India the whole thing would have been over in a matter of hours.  He also said that the matter was altogether in the hands of those in the hospital but that they simply let her go.  How could they let a young woman go to save a baby who would die anyway?  Savita Halappanavar could have had many babies.  It is difficult to understand how this could happen in the 21st century.</p></speech>

The situation that we warned about at that time, and hoped would never happen, has happened.  I am boiling mad that this has occurred in this country.  It would appear that this beautiful young woman is dead as a result only of political cowardice.  The failure of successive Governments, including this Government, to provide for a woman's constitutional right to an abortion where her life is in danger is absolutely outrageous.</p><p>  Today we have been inundated by the world's media about this situation and by citizens of every age, gender and class.  They have asked how this could happen in modern-day Ireland.  When we moved the Bill in April we were informed that it would not happen, that our Bill was unnecessary and that a woman's life was always protected in Ireland.  The people who said that were wrong.  The people who asked us to wait for the expert group to produce its report in July - I understand the Minister of Health received it last night - were wrong too.</p><p>  Death and loss are always tragic but when a death occurs for no reason it is truly and utterly heartbreaking and it enters the realm of being a crime.  The Taoiseach told us this morning that Savita Halappanavar could not be brought back and that nothing we could do would undo that fact and that is clearly true.  However, we can provide her family with answers and give citizens in this country an assurance that it will never happen to any other woman again.  We can only do this if we act now.  Will the Minister assure us that there are no similar cases in existence?  Will he instruct a full investigation of all maternity hospitals?  I understand there were two deaths in the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital recently.  Will the Minister act now on secure independent review procedures for maternal deaths in our maternity hospitals?  Will the Minister legislate now?</p></speech>

He has come out publicly because he does not want this to happen to any woman ever again.  He does not want any other woman to endure the tragedy he has had to face in recent days.</p><p>  On 21 October Savita Halappanavar presented at the University Hospital Galway with back pain.</p><p>She was informed that she was miscarrying and that it would be over in two and a half to three hours.  On Monday morning, in severe pain, she asked for a termination of the pregnancy.  She was refused and told it could not be done.  When she was in more pain on Tuesday morning, she and her husband asked the same question and again she was refused and told it was not going to happen until the foetal heartbeat stopped.  She became terribly sick on the Tuesday night, suffering from fever.  When the foetal heartbeat was checked on Wednesday, it had stopped.  The medical personnel removed the foetus from the womb, but in the next few days Savita became extremely ill, eventually dying of septicaemia.  From the time her cervix was dilated, she was open to serious infection - it was similar to having an open head wound - and Savita was left without proper care and without immediate action.</p><p> If our Bill had been accepted by the Government, we could have prevented this, as the doctors in that hospital would have been protected by legislation in assisting Savita.  It is a damning indictment of six successive Governments that they have refused to take matters into their own hands and make a decision on it.  It is a shame that we have allowed this to happen.  The European Court of Human Rights has found that successive Governments have failed to vindicate the Constitution.</p><p> We must hear the Minister's comments today on the following two matters.  There should be an independent public investigation into this incident within a specific timeframe, and the Minister should allow time for our Bill to become through.  He can propose amendments to it, but let us bring it into the Dáil immediately.</p></speech>

Twenty years on, after nothing but political cowardice and dithering, we have been led to a situation in which tragic and terrible circumstances have caught up with us and forced us to recognise the abysmal failure and political cowardice of successive Governments.</p><p>  The late Ms Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old woman, was the victim of that political failure and cowardice.  A woman in agony, begging for a termination of her pregnancy in order that she could be treated and possibly have her life saved, was denied such a procedure, according to the reports, because of the law that successive Governments have refused to change despite the will of the people and despite the terrible circumstances of the X case 20 years ago.  This is a tragedy resulting from political failure and cowardice.  Will the Minister do something about this to ensure that it never happens again, that there is justice for the late Ms Halappanavar's family and that there is an investigation that will establish how this awful tragedy could have happened?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400033#GG00300"><p>The tragic death of Ms Savita Halappanavar at Galway University Hospital followed the denial of a medical termination of an unviable pregnancy.  According to her husband, when Ms Halappanavar requested a termination she was refused and allegedly told, "This is a Catholic country."  Medical commentary today suggests a termination in Ireland under these circumstances would normally happen.  This raises the following questions.  Is there, in University Hospital Galway, a so-called ethos of opposition in principle to abortion to save a woman's life?  Are there other hospitals that demand a young woman's life to be criminally sacrificed for a Catholic so-called ethos?  If so, the Minister should name these hospitals.  This is a monstrous, medieval, obscurantist imposition on the Ireland of the 21st century.  We must have a directive forthwith from the HSE to all hospitals that necessary termination of pregnancies is provided for in any eventuality in which a woman's life is in danger.  Will the Minister insist that such a HSE directive issues immediately?</p><p>  The Taoiseach's response this morning to the tragic death of Ms Halappanavar was pathetically deficient.  Like a scared rabbit caught in headlights, he counselled that there should be no rush to make a judgment on legislation for the X case.  Would somebody tell this out-of-touch Taoiseach that it is 20 years since legislation was demanded?  I support the introduction of legislation on the X case judgment, but I must say as well that counterposing the health and life of a woman against those of her unborn child is unacceptable.  The health and life of women are paramount.  Therefore, we need to provide free, safe and legal abortion facilities, to avail of which is the choice of the women concerned.</p><p>  Lastly, people power - the power of women and men united - must be brought to bear immediately on this laggardly Government.  That is why everybody should support the Garden of Remembrance demonstration on Saturday in Dublin at 4 p.m., to ensure there is no further delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400033#GG00400"><p>It is appalling even to consider that a tragedy like this was allowed to happen.  There can be no argument with the assertion by the late Ms Halappanavar's husband, Praveen, that what happened to her cannot be allowed to happen in this country again.</p><p>  Earlier this year, I supported the Bill introduced by Deputy Clare Daly that might have prevented this tragedy from occurring, but unfortunately that Bill was defeated by the Government.  While action is now too late for Savita and her family, it is not too late to protect other women from this horrific experience.  The equal right to life for the mother and the unborn child must be acknowledged, and for that to happen we must take action immediately.</p><p>  The Offences Against the Person Act 1861 is the law that governs this area.  It imposes a penalty of penal servitude for life on a woman who procures an abortion, and provides that a medical practitioner who provides an abortion is guilty of a misdemeanour.  There would of course be potential professional sanctions, up to and including being struck off.  We are putting the patient and the practitioner in an impossible position by acknowledging the equal right to life but completely failing to create a mechanism to determine how that right can be vindicated.  The European Court of Human Rights has categorically concluded that it cannot be left in the hands of the individual medical practitioner, guided by only Supreme Court judgments, to determine what does and does not constitute a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother.  I emphasise &quot;as distinct from the health&quot;, as the difficulty lies with where one draws that line.  We cannot even seek best international practice on this because it is widely acknowledged throughout the world that it is an extraordinarily difficult distinction to make.</p><p>  Nothing can bring this beautiful young woman back to her family, but what we can do is to ensure no other woman suffers the same fate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400033#GG00500"><p>I extend my sympathy to the family of Ms Savita Halappanavar on their loss.  My aim and the role of my Department is to improve the health and well-being of all people in Ireland in a manner that promotes better health for everyone, fair access, responsive and appropriate care delivery and high performance.  In particular, our focus is on ensuring the provision of a safe, quality-assured, patient-centred and efficient health service.  Nationally, we are focused on ensuring patient safety, quality and excellence in dthe health care system.  It is important, therefore, that we have systems in place to minimise the risk of occurrence of such incidents and to detect and respond appropriately to them when they do occur.</p><p>  Deputy Mick Wallace has made a serious allegation before the full facts are known when he stated that this tragedy would have been avoided if treatment had been given elsewhere.  Deputy Clare Daly is prejudging the outcome of the coroner's report, which will be an independent report.</p><p>  Important developments in recent years in the area of health and safety include the establishment of the directorate of quality and patient safety, the enhancement of clinical governance and the ongoing development of clinical care programmes in the HSE.</p><p>Important contributions to patient safety have been made through HIQA's reports and the Safer Better Healthcare Standards, published in June this year, will also enhance patient safety.  I am as concerned as others about recent maternal deaths.  The death of Savita Halappanavar in UCHG on 28 October 2012, as reported widely in the media today, is a cause of great concern and was notified to my Department by the HSE.  The incident was escalated directly from the hospital for the attention of the HSE's national incident management team, NIMT, on 1 November, in accordance with its risk and incident escalation procedure, which outlines the steps that must be taken by managers to escalate risks and incidents, as appropriate, that occur within their own service.  This procedure is to be used in circumstances where a national or integrated response is required.  The two investigations referred to earlier are currently underway.  In addition, a coroner's inquest will take place into the matter.  The HSE investigations are being undertaken to establish the facts in this case and to identify the factors that contributed to this tragic death.  The outcome of the investigation reports must be awaited before commenting further.  In accordance with HSE policy, the investigation teams will work closely with family members at all times and keep them fully informed of the terms of reference of the investigation.  </p><p> As Deputies may be aware, the current legal position on abortion in Ireland, set out in Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>of the Irish Constitution and interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1992, provides that it is lawful to terminate a pregnancy in Ireland if it is established, as a matter of probability, that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother, which can be avoided only by a termination of the pregnancy.  In addition, the current Medical Council's <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners</i>, 2009, sets out the position on abortion as follows:<blockquote><i>'</i>21.1. Abortion is illegal in Ireland except where there is a real and substantial risk to the life (as distinct from the health) of the mother. Under current legal precedent, this exception includes where there is a clear and substantial risk to the life of the mother arising from a threat of suicide. You should undertake a full assessment of any such risk in light of the clinical research on this issue.<br /><br />21.2. It is lawful to provide information in Ireland about abortions abroad, subject to strict conditions.  It is not lawful to encourage or advocate an abortion in individual cases.<br /><br />21.3. You have a duty to provide care, support and follow-up services for women who have an abortion abroad.<br /><br />21.4. In current obstetrical practice, rare complications can arise where therapeutic intervention (including termination of a pregnancy) is required at a stage when, due to extreme immaturity of the baby, there may be little or no hope of the baby surviving.  In these exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to intervene to terminate the pregnancy to protect the life of the mother, while making every effort to preserve the life of the baby.</blockquote>The Deputies are aware that, on foot of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C <i>v.</i>Ireland case and to fulfil a commitment included in the programme for Government, the Government established an expert group, drawing on appropriate medical and legal expertise, with a view to making recommendations on how this matter should be properly addressed.  The deliberations of the expert group have concluded and its report was submitted to the Department late yesterday evening.  I will consider the content and implications of the report before discussing them with my Cabinet colleagues.  In this regard, I have asked my officials to examine the report and revert to me once that work has been completed.</p></speech>

They are entitled to their views, but what they are not allowed to do is obstruct or undermine the constitutional rights of citizens in this country.  Where, as the Minister stated in his reply, there is a risk to the life of the mother and where a termination is feasible, it should be allowed.  In this country we have failed to legislate for 20 years.  I have one question for the Minister, namely, will he, as Minister for Health, legislate for the X case - yes or no?</p></speech>

The 1861 Offences Against the Person Act states that the maximum punishment is "penal servitude for life" in the case of a doctor making a call in such cases and he or she can be prosecuted.  That law remains in place and there is no protection for a doctor who makes such a call.  Legislation can do that and I plead with the Minister not to waste any more time in legislating for the X case.</p></speech>

It is the case that abortion is lawful in Ireland where a woman's life is in danger but this woman's life was in danger and now she is dead.  Clearly, something is not right.  Clearly, legislation is needed.  It is not good enough to say we have to await the investigation.  We know enough to know that we can stand over everything we have said.  I must point out that we have a different system from that which operates in the UK, whereby we do not have a national independent review, systematically, of maternal deaths or automatic autopsies.  The Minister must put in place such measures.  He has not assured me that there are no other similar cases to the one we are discussing.  What will the Minister do to provide that information to us?  Will he assure the House that we will be able to discuss these issues next week when he has considered the report of the expert group?  Will he tell us when he is going to introduce legislation?  If he does not, we will re-introduce - with the amendments suggested by the Minister - the Bill we moved in April.</p></speech>

The Minister did not respond to Deputy Clare Daly's question as to whether there have been similar cases of maternal death in recent times.  I ask him to answer that question definitively - yes or no.  We will resubmit our Bill in the near future if the Government does not move on this issue.</p><p>  The expert group set up after the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights was due to report last December.  The deadline was then extended to the summer and then to the autumn.  At this stage the report is almost 11 months overdue.  We want that report in the public domain, that is, circulated among Cabinet members and then to all Deputies.  We want to see the report and we want change.  We want the necessary legislation introduced quickly.</p></speech>

The Minister seems to imply there is no impediment in law to a woman receiving necessary treatment in these circumstances, but there is.  At the very least, it is a grey area and we know that in this case, a woman begged, in agony, for treatment that could have saved her life but was denied it because the medical practitioner believed it could not be done within the law.  The Minister must act and must take responsibility.</p></speech>

There is <i>prima facie</i> evidence which makes a powerful case that her life could have been saved with the termination of her unviable pregnancy.  The Minister had a prepared script but now I ask him to answer the questions that are being put.  Are there hospitals in this State whose ethos denies a termination to a woman in these circumstances, where her life is in danger?  Is that the case?  What action will the Minister take?  Will he instruct the HSE to instruct each hospital, forthwith, to provide all medical procedures, including terminations, where a woman's life is in danger?  When will the Minister publish the expert group's report?  I ask him to give us a date, now that he has the report.  When will he publish legislation providing for this?

I recognise that Deputies wish to discuss broader issues and people have spoken about ministerial responsibility.  This Government has many responsibilities, one of which is not to prejudge a situation.  One of the Deputies opposite referred to the clinician concerned as "he".  Is that Deputy sure the clinician was male?  I make this point because while I am privy to certain facts I am not in a position to share them.  This is why I ask for time to prepare an independent report which will outline the truth of what happened.  Deputies have raised questions about a Catholic ethos inhibiting people from providing proper medical treatment as defined by the Medical Council.  I have no evidence of this but I will not pre-empt what a coroner's court may find.  I will await the conclusions of the independent investigation that a coroner always undertakes.</p><p>  I am the first to admit that in the past the independence of the HSE in investigating itself has raised questions.  However, the new structures we have put in place, with an individual of the calibre of Dr. Philip Crowley being involved in the investigation, give me much greater confidence than I would have had in the past.  I want to see a truly independent investigation which does not give rise to any question or perception of lack of independence.</p><p>  This is a terrible tragedy for Savita's family but it is also an emotionally traumatic time for the staff involved.  Some of the comments made today would seek to deny them the due process to which these individuals are entitled.  That is unfair.  My concern is to put the patient first and above everything else.  I cannot say one way or another whether there was hesitation because of moral or religious beliefs, although I doubt there was.  If there was such hesitation, however, it would be an extremely serious matter.  As a doctor, I am aware that in cases where a miscarriage is inevitable medical experts consider allowing it to occur naturally to be the safest option.  There may, however, come a point where it is not the safest option and intervention must take place.  That is a general comment and it does not relate to the specific case.  I again express my deepest sympathy on behalf of the Government to the family of Savita.</p></speech>

This was a murder, pure and simple, carried out by people who have no regard for human life.  The universal condemnation from across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland and the unified reaction from the two Governments underlined the solidity of the peace process.  Public statements made by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and me reinforced the message of solidarity with Mr. Black’s family and his colleagues in the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  The Minister attended Mr. Black’s funeral.</p><p>  I had an opportunity to speak with the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, MLA, at the North-South Ministerial Council on 2 November and I conveyed through him my sympathy and that of the Government to Mr. Black's widow, Yvonne, and his children, Kyra and Kyle.  I spoke with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the day of the killing and we discussed the matter again when we met on Tuesday, 6 November.  I underlined to the Secretary of State the Government’s determination to co-operate with the Northern Ireland authorities to bring David Black’s killers to justice.  The Secretary of State and I are of the same view that those responsible for this murder are criminal terrorists motivated by hate and an inability to accept that the vast majority of the people of this island want to move on and forge a better life for themselves.</p><p>  In addition to discussions at political level, strong and deep co-operation exists between An Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland to counter such individuals and groups.  The number of arrests made in connection with paramilitary activity in both jurisdictions continues to be significant.  The Garda and the PSNI will continue to co-operate closely to combat such activity on both sides of the Border and to ensure those who plan and carry out such atrocities are pursued and brought to justice.</p><p>  When I attended the remembrance day ceremonies in Belfast last weekend I had an opportunity to convey condolences on behalf of the Government to some of David Black’s colleagues in the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  I also had an opportunity to reiterate the Government’s condemnation at the SDLP conference which I addressed on Saturday night.</p></reply>

I condemn in the strongest terms the brutal murder of David Black, who was shot several times.  By all accounts he was an exemplary officer and it appears from newspaper reports that a new paramilitary grouping has claimed responsibility following the merger of other groups.  Such groups have no place in Irish society.  My party's leader, Deputy Micheál Martin, also attended Mr. Black's funeral.  I know from meeting the Secretary of State that the co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI is excellent.  I urge the Tánaiste to use every forum available to him, whether in this jurisdiction or in Northern Ireland, to send the message that such co-operation will continue at all levels of our security forces and everything will be done to bring those murderers to justice.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the claim of responsibility for this murder from a newly merged group of dissident republicans.  According to news reports, responsibility for the murder of Mr Black has been claimed by a group of so-called dissidents comprising the Real IRA, Republican Action against Drugs and various other activists.</p><p>These groups have no public support and no identifiable ideology.  Communities, North and South, have been united in their condemnation of this brutal attack.  Those involved are criminal terrorists who are motivated by hate and have an inability to accept that the majority on this island want to move on and forge a better life.  These criminal terrorists are stuck in the past that everyone else wants to leave behind.  I assure the Deputy and the House that the Government is working closely with the British Government, the Northern Ireland Executive, the Minister for Justice in Northern Ireland, Mr. David Ford, the Garda and the PSNI to bring to justice those responsible for this killing.</p></speech>

Tensions in the jail are not an excuse for violence, never mind the wilful taking of a life.  Groups commonly referred to as dissident groups can be the incubators of violent extremism.  Therefore, the activities of these and other vigilante groups must be dealt with.  Such groupls have been operating in Derry where there have been more than 20 pipe bomb incidents.  I share the Tánaiste's view that this issue must be dealt with on an all-island basis.  The people living on this island spoke at the end of May 1998, following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  There was virtually a unanimous vote in favour of the new political structures.  There are no grounds, therefore, for political or any other form of violence in this country.  This message must be hammered home to such groups on all occasions.</p></speech>

Ireland has no tolerance for fraud or any other form of financial irregularity in our development co-operation programme.  This is clearly known to all of our development partners, including the Government of Uganda.  I have suspended approximately &#8364;16 million of Irish development assistance which was due to be channelled through Government of Uganda systems in 2012 and initiated an immediate investigation into the misappropriation of funds by individuals in the office of the Prime Minister of Uganda.  This investigation has been undertaken by a team from the evaluation and audit unit of my Department which travelled to Uganda as soon as the findings of the Auditor General of Uganda were made public.  The team&#8217;s report will be presented to me shortly and I will closely examine it and give due consideration to any recommendation made.  I will release the report when it is finalised.  <i></i></p><p>  In addition to the team from my Department&#8217;s audit and evaluation unit, the director general of Irish Aid also travelled to Uganda.  Together with our ambassador in Kampala, he met the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance and Economic Development of Uganda to underline my deep concerns and insist on the misappropriated funds being restored by the Ugandan authorities.  As a direct result of this intervention, the Ugandan Government has since confirmed that all Irish Aid misappropriated funds will be reimbursed; that the officials against whom financial impropriety has been established will be fully prosecuted; and that measures will be undertaken to tighten their internal controls.  I welcome this commitment and have directed our ambassador to work with the Ugandan authorities to ensure the misappropriated funds are restored.</p></reply>

My question was submitted some time ago and I know the issue has been well ventilated in recent days at the meetings of the Oireachtas Committee Joint on Foreign Affairs on Trade and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and in statements made by the Minister.  I share his concern about the misappropriation of €4 million in aid funding.  My main concern is the impact this will have on the confidence of taxpayers in the provision of Irish aid.  The Minister has come out strongly on this issue and the fact that the Auditor General of Uganda picked up on the misappropriation of funds is positive.  Therefore, there is a positive side to the story.  The incident shines a light on the work of Irish Aid in Uganda and the fact that in recent years the level of poverty has been halved and the incidence of HIV-AIDS has been reduced from 18% to 6%.  Positive things are happening owing to the efforts of development agencies such as Irish Aid and others.  Some groups will argue that this aid should not have passed through government channels but through NGOs.  However, it was the Auditor General of Uganda who discovered the misappropriation, which is a positive argument for ensuring aid is channelled through the Ugandan Government.  Reassurance is required.  Yesterday I suggested at the committee that Irish Aid facilitate access to information from auditors in the Department and provide documentation on the issue.  It is important that we examine the scheme in place for the delivery of the aid.  Are there lessons we can learn from this incident?  People want to hear that it will not happen again and structures must be put in place to minimise this possibility.</p></speech>

It is important to remember that the misappropriation of funds was discovered by the Auditor General of Uganda.  We take reassurance from this because our aid programme has been working to support institutions such as the Office of the Auditor General of Uganda.  Therefore, the system worked.  Second, we should remember that not only Irish aid moneys were involved.  Aid moneys from Norway, Denmark and Sweden was also misappropriated.  I also understand some Ugandan moneys were misappropriated.  The misappropriation occurred in the case of moneys channelled through the Prime Minister's office.  As soon as we had received the report of the Auditor General of Uganda and become aware of the misappropriation, we acted on the report.  We suspended all aid channelled through the Ugandan Government and it remains suspended.  We sent our audit and evaluation team which has now made its report to us.  We sent the director general of Irish Aid who, together with our ambassador in Kampala, went to see all of the senior people in Uganda.  We have now received a written commitment from the Ugandan Government that the aid which was misappropriated will be reimbursed in full.  All of this has taken place within a very short period.  This is Irish taxpayer's money and taxpayers can be reassured that the system of the Auditor General of Uganda worked and that our audit and evaluation system has also worked.  We acted on the report immediately and the money is to be reimbursed.  In the meantime, aid moneys for Uganda will remain suspended.  When the audit and evaluation team's report, now with the Secretary General of my Department, comes to me, I will make it available and deal with the issue in an open way.</p></speech>

They are also vital for the promotion of good governance.  Tax avoidance and evasion, therefore, present a major issue for developing countries seeking to drive their own development.  Ireland is playing a strong role at national level and in global efforts to increase revenue generation and tackle tax avoidance and evasion in developing countries.</p><p>  Support for the strengthening of government systems is an essential element of Ireland’s overseas aid programme.  We also engage actively at the United Nations and in the OECD and the European Union on multilateral efforts to address tax evasion and avoidance.  These include the promotion of the better exchange of information on tax matters between countries, the implementation of agreed standards on tax transparency and support for the capacity building of tax administrations in developing countries.</p><p>Work at EU level includes negotiation in Brussels on the current proposals for the revision of the EU transparency and accounting directives.  The Government has been supportive of proposals to improve transparency among EU multinational companies involved in extractive and logging industries in developing countries.  With Ireland's support, the European Union has adopted an action plan to support tax administration and reforms in developing countries.  The Governments of developing countries increasingly want to take control of their own development and to end their reliance on aid.  The uncertainty created by the global economic crisis has underpinned the realisation that fair and efficient taxation is chiefly the best means of meeting the revenue needs of developing countries.  The formation of the African Taxation Administrators Forum by revenue authorities across Africa is playing an important role in advocating for reform and building capacity.  Ireland is supporting this work through our aid programme.  We will continue to support a more transparent global tax environment.  Irish Aid, in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners, will maintain our efforts to strengthen tax systems in developing countries so more resources can be made available for the fight to end extreme poverty and hunger.</p></reply>

There is no doubt that our relationship with countries in Africa and other parts of the developing world has another dimension now that there is a trade element to it.  While I accept what the Tánaiste said in his reply about the approach to illicit capital flight, I have to say it does not appear to be working.  I have read reports suggesting that amounts between €116 billion and four or five times that amount have been lost as a result of illicit capital flight.  I have read that the amount which has been lost is 20 times more than the amount which would be needed to meet all the millennium development goals in the countries of the developing world, which is a frightening statistic.  Ireland could take a stronger stance on a number of points, for example by insisting on country-by-country auditing, scrutiny of double taxation agreements and the automatic sharing of tax information between countries.  We could lead by example by insisting on the collection of the full rate of corporate tax in this country.</p></speech>

The members of both committees lobbied in support of Ireland's candidacy for membership of the UN Human Rights Council.</p><p>  Ireland has a strong record on the promotion of good governance in tax principles.  We are fully compliant with the EU code of conduct on harmful tax competition and the OECD standards on exchange of information.  Ireland's network of more than 60 double taxation treaties compares favourably with the records of larger OECD countries.  We have also signed tax information exchange agreements with 17 jurisdictions that were not previously co-operative.  Ireland is on the OECD G20 white list of countries that are fully compliant with the OECD standards on exchange of information.  Ireland also participates in the global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes.  A favourable peer review of Ireland was undertaken last year.  I am aware of some reports of tax avoidance and tax evasion in Africa.  I want to affirm this Government's commitment to the fight against poverty in developing countries, with a particular emphasis on Africa.  I assure the Deputy that we will continue to work at EU level, with the OECD and with the United Nations to ensure there is transparency in tax matters and to make certain that the problems associated with tax evasion and tax avoidance are addressed.</p></speech>

The audit approach in my Department is in line with international auditing standards.  The Department has taken a number of steps to review all systems governing the management of our aid programme, including our audit systems, since the misappropriation of funds was recently identified in Uganda.  The Deputy will be aware that I immediately sent a team to examine all matters arising from the auditor general's report on the misappropriation of funds.  This team has now returned.  I will receive its report shortly.  Following the consideration of this report, all of our systems, including our audit systems, will be reviewed and strengthened in light of any weaknesses the report may identify.  While the team was in Kampala, it held discussions with the Ugandan auditor general regarding the subsequent work to be undertaken by his office.  We have a policy of working closely with the auditor general because we believe he is in the best position to identify weaknesses and follow up on the issues that have been already identified.  I am satisfied with the programme of work the auditor general is undertaking on foot of his report.  This work includes an audit of internal controls within the Ugandan system of government and further investigative audits of expenditure programmes under the control of the office of the Ugandan Prime Minister.  In addition and as a precautionary measure, all Irish Aid heads of mission in the past week have been instructed to immediately interrogate control systems in their programmes to ensure all agreed procedures and protocols are being carried out.</p></reply>

Everyone agreed that the systems need to be robust and rigorous.  Mr. Rogers made the important point that this negative publicity is particularly "dispiriting" given that so much progress has been made in Uganda through the Irish Aid programme.  There have been substantial improvements in areas like health, education and development.  At a time when the misappropriation of funds obviously and quite rightly attracts negative publicity, we need to send a clear message to the taxpayer that exceptionally good work has been done through Irish Aid programmes over the years.  Mr. Rogers mentioned the work that has been done through Irish Aid, Irish missionaries and Irish public servants since 1994.  He also referred to the work of Mother Kevina, who apparently built up many schools, clinics and hospitals at the turn of the last century.  That type of Irish involvement in bringing services to the people has been of huge benefit to this very deprived country.  The Tánaiste will recall that in the report which was presented to him by the audit committee of his Department, Mr. Furlong recommended that a chief risk officer and a qualified head of finance should be appointed in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I presume Mr. Furlong is the former Secretary General and senior civil servant.  Is the Tánaiste giving consideration to the creation of such positions?</p></speech>

We will not tolerate any misappropriation of Irish Aid funds.  That is why we have acted so quickly in this matter.  I assure the Deputy who referred to the recommendations of the audit committee that my Department takes the issue of risk extremely seriously.  A risk register is maintained by a risk group, which is chaired by an assistant secretary.</p><p>In addition, risk is reviewed at monthly meetings of the management committee.  The Department also has professionally qualified staff employed in its finance sections.  The Department's audit committee has, nevertheless, recommended that the Department appoint a dedicated chief risk officer and a professionally qualified chief financial officer.  The audit committee recommends that these officers be appointed at assistant secretary grade.</p><p> The ability of my Department to respond to this proposal has been limited by the embargo on public service recruitment necessitated by the need to reduce Government expenditure.  Last June, following the publication of the audit committee's most recent annual report, the Secretary General of my Department invited the audit committee to meet with the management committee to discuss these proposals.  This meeting took place this week, following which the management committee, with my support and encouragement, accepted the recommendations of the audit committee.  An appropriate member of the management committee will assume the additional responsibilities of chief risk officer and sanction is being sought from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the recruitment of a professionally qualified chief financial officer who will sit on the management committee.</p></speech>

One other suggestion I made to his officials yesterday was that we need the utmost co-operation with the other donor countries working in those partnership countries, by and large, other EU member states.  This is to give out a message that misappropriation of even 1 cent will not be tolerated by any of the donor countries.  Working together with other donor countries can also impact on the message that misappropriation of taxpayers' money, from whatever member state, will not be tolerated and that the aid designated for people living in desperate circumstances in Uganda or other developing countries must reach those people.</p></speech>

As I said , the funds of three other countries - Denmark, Sweden and Norway - were misappropriated in this whole business in the Prime Minister's office.  Our ambassador in Kampala co-ordinated meetings of the embassies of the three other countries concerned and worked to co-ordinate a joint approach on the issue with the Ugandan authorities.  I was very pleased with the level of co-operation with the other three countries involved.  The Deputy may take it we will work very closely with other donor countries and we will, of course, also work very closely with the European Union where it is directly involved.</p></speech>

Respect for human rights, minorities and fundamental freedoms are core values upon which the European Union is built.  Turkey, as an EU candidate, is expected to uphold these values.  The European Commission’s October progress report on Turkey draws attention to where further progress is required, particularly respect for fundamental rights, and the need for legislation to distinguish clearly between incitement of violence and the expression of non-violent ideas.  The Commission’s report also notes Turkey’s progress, including positive steps in drafting a new constitution.  Ireland, as a supporter of Turkey’s EU perspective, welcomes these efforts and encourages the Turkish Government to continue reforms on its path to EU accession, including further outreach to the Kurdish minority and proper recognition of their rights.</p><p>  The Kurdish issue remains a key challenge for Turkey’s democracy, and the ongoing hunger strikes by Kurdish prisoners are a matter of particular concern.  Reports of deterioration in the health of striking prisoners are worrying.  I join with the European Commission in urging prisoners not to endanger their health or their lives.</p><p>  I also urge the Turkish Government to reach out to the Kurdish community.  The escalation of PKK terrorist attacks makes it much harder to reach a solution but the fight against terrorism must be conducted with due regard for human rights.  I would encourage all sides to redouble their efforts to address the Kurdish issue in a peaceful and democratic manner through dialogue.</p></reply>

There are approximately 20 million Kurds in Turkey but they have never been granted the same rights as ethnic Turks and are not even recognised as Kurds and are called mountain Turks.</p><p>  The Tánaiste referred to the fact there is a hunger strike in the jails.  There are some 700 prisoners on strike, some of them for 64 days at this stage.  In the last year, there has been an escalation in attacks, including tear gas attacks, Kurdish rallies are no longer allowed and lawyers, mayors and members of parliament have been jailed.  The situation appears to be escalating.</p><p>  What the prisoners are looking for seems fairly reasonable and non-threatening, for example, the right to education, legal defence in their native Kurdish language and the start of direct peace talks to resolve the outstanding conflict by peaceful and constitutional means.  These are issues with which I do not think anyone in this part of the world would have a difficulty.  The difficulty many of us have is that, of the 479 cases that have been taken in recent years to the European Court of Justice on grounds of freedom of expression, 207 have originated from Turkey.  The situation in the area seems to be getting worse and worse but, at the same time, Turkey is making an application to join the EU.  While I welcome the fact the Tánaiste is talking about further progress in regard to the expression of non-violent ideas, there is a contradiction in that, on the one hand, they are looking to join the rest of us in Europe but, on the other, they do not seem to take on board the rights of minorities in their own country.</p><p>  We are all familiar with our own history, not only in regard to the prisoners' struggle but also in regard to the attempt to wipe out the Irish language.  The &quot;bata scoir&quot; or &quot;tally stick&quot; is all they are short of in regard to the Kurdish language, the denial of Kurdish education and so on.  Something is radically wrong.  We talk in terms of the EU becoming a global leader.  It needs to speak out clearly in this regard.  I am concerned by this escalation and the situation of the 700 prisoners, many of whom will probably die in the next couple of days, given the length of time they have been on hunger strike.  Is there anything else we can do, as a country, to stop this oppression and support human rights?  Is it possible to use the Turkish EU application in this regard?</p></speech>

The latest report I have is that there are 707 Kurdish prisoners on hunger strike and that there is a core group of 64 who went on hunger strike on 12 September and who are now on their 64th day.  I understand three issues form the basis for the hunger strikers' demands.  The first issue is an end to the isolation of the PKK leader, Abdullah Öcalan, who was captured in 1999.  The Turkish Prime Minister has now said that Mr. Öcalan can have access to his family.  The second issue is the right of Kurdish suspects to defend themselves in court in the Kurdish language.  I understand the Government of Turkey yesterday submitted a Bill to Parliament which will allow suspects to use the Kurdish language during their defence statement and trials.  The third issue is the right to mother tongue education in Kurdish.  Again, I am informed that the Turkish Government is beginning to provide for elective classes in Kurdish.</p><p>  Clearly, this will be an issue in the context of Turkey's EU perspective and the issue of accession, and I expect this is an issue we will be handling during our Presidency of the EU next year.  We have said we would like to see progress made on Turkey's accession but, clearly, there are standards, criteria and human rights commitments and standards that have to be complied with for accession.  This issue will obviously form part of that discussion.</p></speech>

I condemn all acts of violence, including the recent bomb attack in Manama city which resulted in the deaths of two foreign workers.  I urge the opposition to refrain from violent provocation of any kind.  I have made clear in this House my view that all charges against the medical professionals should have been dropped.  Given the great concerns and doubts which have surrounded the case of the medics from the start and particularly in the light of the well documented reports of ill-treatment to which many of those originally detained were subject, it is my view that the Bahraini Government should consider exercising clemency and releasing the imprisoned medical professionals.  This would also be very much in the wider interests of promoting urgently needed reconciliation and national dialogue within Bahrain.</p><p>  More broadly, the Government has repeatedly conveyed its concerns at every suitable opportunity to the Bahraini authorities about the human rights situation in Bahrain, including our concerns about the case of the medical professionals, as well as that of the respected human rights defender, Abdulhadi Al Khawaja.  We have repeatedly raised these cases with the Bahraini ambassador in London and through our ambassador in Riyadh who is accredited to Bahrain, including after the Court of Cassation’s decision on 1 October upholding the prison sentences against the medical professionals.</p><p>  Bahrain has implemented some of the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry report, but renewed impetus in implementing the BICI recommendations is necessary.  This would help to create an environment conducive to reconciliation and dialogue and enable reform and change to take place as a result of a consultative process.  I strongly encourage the Bahraini authorities to focus on reconciliation and initiate a genuine process of dialogue and reform.</p></reply>

Our Oireachtas colleague, Senator Averil Power, and a former constituency colleague of yours, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Tánaiste, Mr. David Andrews, travelled to Bahrain some time ago to raise the issue.  I compliment the eminent and distinguished orthopaedic surgeon in Cappagh Hospital and the Mater Hospital, Professor Damian McCormack, who has commented on the issue on numerous occasions.  He has stated clearly that Irish-trained doctors have been illegally detained, tortured and convicted of the “crime” of treating injured anti-government protesters.  Does the Tánaiste agree that doctors who bravely defied government orders and did their duty in treating injured protesters during anti-government rallies in Bahrain deserve the utmost assistance from the international community?  Media attention seems to have drifted from Bahrain and the doctors remain under sentence.  Their treatment has rightly been roundly condemned by the United Nations and many international NGOs.  Will the Tánaiste consider raising the issue at European Union level?  It is a serious one.  Has the Tánaiste been in contact with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, the Irish Medical Organisation or the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland?  Eminent medical personnel such as Professor Eoin O’Brien, as well as Dr. Ruairi Hanley from Kilskyre, County Meath, have commented on the lack of a response and action by those internationally recognised professional organisations.</p></speech>

I met both of them in connection with their visit to Bahrain which this country has been pressing in multilateral fora to undertake human rights reforms.  At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva we raised our concerns about the grave allegations of mistreatment, amounting to the torture of detainees, documented in the report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry and urged Bahrain to undertake further steps to implement the full recommendations made in the report.  At the previous session of the UN Human Rights Council in June Ireland made a joint statement with 26 other countries urging Bahrain to enhance its co-operation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the special procedures of the UN Human Rights Council.  At Bahrain’s universal periodic review in May Ireland recommended that all decisions of the national security courts be subject to review in ordinary courts and that laws be enacted to prohibit civilians being tried in military courts in the future.  We have called on the Bahraini Government to exercise clemency and release the imprisoned medical professionals.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is a private institution, but I met its chief executive some time ago to discuss the situation in Bahrain.</p></speech>

People are discriminated against and denied jobs on the basis of their religion, yet an Irish company is operating within such a society in Bahrain.  What is happening is unacceptable.  Does the Tánaiste agree that, unfortunately, the situation in Bahrain is getting worse?  Recently, 31 dissidents, including lawyers, MPs and academics, had their citizenship revoked.  At the same time, an Irish company is stuck in the middle of it and appears to be propping up the prevailing sectarian ethos in Bahrain.</p></speech>

Recently, all anti-government demonstrations have been outlawed and the government has threatened to take legal action against opposition groups.  I accept that the Tánaiste has called for better behaviour on the part of the Bahraini authorities, but does he consider that the European Union should become more vocal in its opposition to this behaviour?  It is hardly news to anyone that there seems to be a bias in how we treat various countries according to on which side of the fence they sit, depending on whether they are with or against western powers.</p></speech>

We regard human rights as universal and want them to be applied in an even-handed way.  I am greatly concerned by the decision of the Bahraini Government to revoke the citizenship of 31 activists, including former Members of Parliament.  This renders some of those concerned stateless and deprives them of their most basic rights.  The decision will only serve to deepen divisions and tensions in Bahraini society.</p><p>  With regard to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, it has commented publicly on numerous occasions on the case of the Bahraini medics and urged the Bahraini Government to withdraw the sentences and release the medics.  It has also written to the King of Bahrain asking him to drop the charges against them.  It has appeared before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to answer questions from members about its activities.  It is important to distinguish between the involvement of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in the training of Bahraini medical personnel, which is entirely positive, and the detention of medical personnel by the Bahraini authorities.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is a private third level institution and its approach has been governed by its role as an education provider and its responsibility to its 900 plus students.  I also note that the RCSI campus is the one place where Sunni and Shia students are educated together.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland strives to place the focus on educational excellence, not on ethnic difference.  It has also been forthright in urging the Bahraini Government to exercise clemency in the case of imprisoned medics.</p></speech>

Ireland has contributed strongly to the development of this policy, which now commands near-consensus internationally.  Regrettably, progress towards this goal has been much less satisfactory.</p><p>  The European Union acts supportively in a number of ways.  First and foremost, we seek to encourage and press both parties into engaging in serious direct negotiations because we recognise that this is the only way to reach a comprehensive agreement and end the occupation.  Frankly, we have been disappointed by the inability to get talks restarted.  The reasons are complex but, primarily, there has been little real engagement by the Israeli Government in the process.  The European Union is also active in respect of specific issues on the ground which we believe are having a negative effect and threatening to make a peace agreement based on a two-state solution impossible to achieve.  In May the Foreign Affairs Council issued strong conclusions, to which Ireland actively contributed, which highlighted these issues and called for urgent changes in Israeli policy.  I am now pressing for a follow-up Council discussion.  On the Palestinian side, the European Union is the major provider of humanitarian support for refugees and technical support and capacity-building for the Palestinian administration.  Ireland plays an active role in all of these strands of engagement, including through support provided by Irish Aid.</p><p>  Although the European Union has been active and consistent on this issue, I cannot be satisfied while the situation remains so frustratingly deadlocked.  I believe the international community, including the Quartet, the European Union and the United States, needs to be more active and forceful.</p></reply>

We discussed this issue at length in the last session of Question Time.  My tabling of the question was to ensure it is kept on the agenda.  Will the Minister tell us at which Council meeting he hopes to have a full discussion of this matter?  Will it be before the end of the year or will it go into the Irish Presidency?</p><p>  It is alarming, and has been for many years, that since Israel's occupation of the West Bank began in 1967, settlements have been promoted and expanded under every Israeli Government.  The figure quoted, which I understand to be accurate, is that 42% of West Bank land has been allocated to establish more than 200 settlements.  The European Union is Israel's largest trading partner and therefore the notion of a ban on trade must be kept on the agenda.  The Minister gave us a detailed letter following the last parliamentary question on the subject, which mentioned a degree of conflict in regard to the merit such a ban might have.  Even if it is only a small measure, it is important to get the message out that a major trading bloc is seriously concerned about the ongoing impasse and the injustice that has been perpetrated on Palestinians for so long.</p></speech>

We had a discussion on it in October and another discussion took place at the informal meeting in September which focused largely on Gaza and the difficulties in that area arising from contamination, particularly of water.  What I am seeking is that at some point in the coming months the Council will return to the May conclusions, review what has been taking place since then and examine certain measures that might be taken by the European Union in order to pursue these conclusions.  The letter I sent to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade was intended to set this out in a comprehensive way.  I believed it was desirable that the committee members should have available to them the kind of assessment that is available to me, for example, concerning the prospect of a ban on settlement products, how that might be done and how we might pursue it at EU level.  There would also be an assessment of the likely impact of such a measure.</p></speech>

There certainly is none from the United States or the European Union, which has awarded Israel favourable trading status.  As we sit in this Chamber, a massive military attack on the people of Gaza is taking place.  In recent days an Israeli Minister is on record as having said that families in Gaza should have their water, food, electricity and fuel cut off as a collective punishment for resisting the Israeli invasion at the weekend.  This is the Government with which we are dealing.  There is no pressure.  The Minister is applying pressure but there is none coming from the European Union.  The situation between the Palestinians and the Israelis will not be resolved internally.  There is a need for an outside power to act.  What is happening is unequal.  People need to wake up to the fact that things are getting worse.  Life is untenable for people living in that region of the world and no pressure is being applied, unfortunately.</p></speech>

Given that President Obama has already asked the Israelis to withdraw, a request that was refused, it is up to Europeans to apply pressure to see that fairness prevails.  This is important, because it is at the core of so many of the problems of the entire region.</p></speech>

I reiterate that rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel must also stop.  Israel is entitled to security for its people.  Attacks of a terrorist nature from Gaza must stop, as must the attacks by Israel on Gaza.  Just before I came into the Chamber to take questions, I received a preliminary report of a rocket attack by Israel on Gaza in which a senior figure in Hamas is alleged to have been killed.  I have only just received this information and have not had an opportunity to get a more up-to-date report.  All of this is extremely worrying.</p><p>  In May the European Union issued its strongest statement to date about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, particularly in regard to the settlements.  We must bear in mind that there are divergent views among the 27 member states on this issue, as was seen in the UNESCO vote last year when the European Union divided evenly three ways: nine for, nine against and nine abstentions.  Securing agreement on that statement was therefore significant, and we can build on that.

Most of the temporary additional staff required by the Department for the Presidency are now<i> in situ </i>and have been assigned as appropriate.  The additional staff are directly engaged in Presidency-related activities in most cases, although some have been assigned to positions vacated by experienced officers who have been redeployed to Presidency roles.  Presidency responsibilities will also have varying impacts on the work of a number of the core staff of my Department at home and abroad.    </p><p>  At headquarters, eight staff have been redeployed to my Department from other Departments and offices, to which they are scheduled to return in summer 2013.  Ten administrative and eight clerical staff have also been recruited on fixed-term contracts through the Public Appointments Service and eight interns have been recruited on the same basis directly by the Department.</p><p>Furthermore, a small number of staff have been temporarily seconded to the Department from other EU member states and from the Union's External Action Service, at no cost to the Exchequer.  One retired officer has been temporarily re-engaged until July 2013.</p><p> In the context of missions abroad, the majority of Presidency-related posts have been assigned to the Permanent Representation of Ireland to the European Union in Brussels, with smaller numbers allocated to other missions including the permanent missions to the UN in New York and Geneva and those to the OSCE, the IAEA and a number of smaller international organisations in Vienna.  The Presidency staffing plan for the permanent representation in Brussels was prepared following a carefully co-ordinated interdepartmental needs evaluation.  Overall, the staffing of the permanent representation has been temporarily increased by 80 officers in various grades.  The majority of these individuals have been assigned by other Departments and offices, at their own expense and from within their own staffing resources, with some 30 temporary administrative and clerical staff recruited locally.</p></reply>

I take the opportunity to wish him and all his colleagues in government every success with the Presidency.  Each of Ireland's presidencies of the European Union has been extremely successful.  I do not doubt that this will also be the case with the forthcoming Presidency.  As the Tánaiste is aware, a new troika system applies and Cyprus and Lithuania are involved in our preparations.  By and large, member states are now involved with the Presidency for the 18 months immediately prior to the six-month period for which they hold it.</p><p>  I welcome the allocation of additional staff to the Tánaiste's Department.  The Permanent Representation in Brussels is a critical nerve centre for the entire operation.  Unfortunately, many highly qualified young people do not have jobs.  In that context, has provision been made in respect of the recruitment of interns?  Experienced people will naturally be given pivotal roles.  I presume the responsibilities of some senior officials will be reallocated when they are temporarily transferred to different positions.  Perhaps their routine duties could be undertaken by interns with relevant qualifications and ability, thereby allowing them to gain valuable experience.</p></speech>

We have taken on eight interns as part of the recruitment drive relating to the Presidency.  We have also reassigned some experienced staff to various missions and consulates in order that they might carry out specific duties in the lead up to and during Ireland's Presidency.  We have replaced them with temporary staff in some instances.  What the Deputy describes involves moving of experienced people to positions where they can carry out Presidency duties and replacing them with specifically recruited individuals.  We have done some such recruitment.</p></speech>

The Global Irish Network is a central element of the Government&#8217;s engagement with the Diaspora in support of our economic goals.  On 26 October 2012 last I published the 12 month progress report on the forum which can be viewed on .  The Deputies will wish to note that the Comptroller and Auditor General reviewed the forum in his report of September 2011.  The close alignment of the forum&#8217;s outcomes with key Government objectives, including the Action Plan for Jobs, has ensured that significant progress has been made in respect of all the key outcomes.  The report clearly demonstrates the ability of the network to deliver real, tangible economic benefits for the Irish at home and abroad in priority areas such as job creation, inward investment, support for the SME and export sectors and enhancing our international reputation.  In addition, we have been able to leverage the expertise and experience of the network in the agrifood and education sectors, all of which can benefit from enhanced partnership between the State&#8217;s agencies and the Diaspora.</p><p>  Progress is reported in the report in respect of a number of areas, including the establishment of the global Irish contacts programme, which directly links the Diaspora with Irish companies seeking to achieve international growth and to which 100 participants have signed up; Global Irish Network members across the globe are working with the tourism promotion agencies to promote The Gathering Ireland 2013 overseas and organising diaspora-related events in Ireland such the Spar international annual conference in Killarney and the &quot;Silicon Valley Comes to Ireland&quot; event in Cork in January 2013; the launch of ConnectIreland, which aims to create 5,000 jobs in the next five years - approximately 300 companies have been suggested to ConnectIreland from people all over the world since the initiative was launched in March 2012; directly facilitating job creation through the hosting of an &quot;Invest in Ireland&quot; round-table event with former President Clinton in New York and Dublin to coincide with the Navy versus Notre Dame American football game; 130 forum participants registered to become advocates for Ireland in sectors such as foreign direct investment, FDI, support for exporters, tourism, and culture; greater involvement of local network members in the planning and organising of trade missions in their respective regions - these members were involved in the &quot;Invest in Ireland&quot; round-table event in New York in February, the Taoiseach&#8217;s visit to China and all other Enterprise Ireland organised trade missions in 2012; and the expansion of the Farmleigh fellowship programme in Asia.  Some 45 fellows will have completed the latter by the end of 2012.</p><p>  The establishment of the Global Irish Network was an innovative and ambitious undertaking by my Department that has given far greater strategic direction and coherence to the manner in which the Government engages with our most senior Irish contacts across the globe.  In addition to contributing to initiatives such as the global Irish contacts programme, The Gathering and ConnectIreland, the network has proved to be particularly effective as a source of structured advice from key players in priority markets and sectors and within multinational companies.  The programme has also facilitated high level access for the Government and Irish companies to decision-makers in major corporations.</p><p>  In response to the strong wish among participants to be kept fully informed of developments, the Taoiseach and I now issue regular e-newsletters to them.  These short e-mails update network members on economic developments in Ireland and the progress being made in respect of the forum's outcomes.  I also established the advisory group of the Global Irish Network, which includes 19 members of the network from each of the main geographic areas represented at the 2011 forum.  This group is charged with reviewing progress on the forum outcomes, co-ordinating the overall work programme for the Global Irish Network and working with our ambassadors in keeping the wider network informed of developments.  Its first meeting took place in Dublin on 11 July.</p><p>  I hosted a meeting of European network members at the Embassy of Ireland in Berlin on 26 October.  This meeting brought together participants based in continental Europe, Russia and Turkey and provided an opportunity to examine the specific economic challenges and opportunities that exist for Ireland in the region and obtain their views on how the network can contribute to our goals.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400041#PP00900"><p>I thank the Tánaiste for his detailed reply.  The Global Irish Forum is an extremely worthwhile body.  It was established relatively recently.  To the best of my recollection, its first meeting took place at the end of September 2009 when Deputy Micheál Martin was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Gathering, ConnectIreland and the other specific initiatives to which the Tánaiste referred are also extremely worthwhile.  As he indicated, the Irish Diaspora is not confined to London, Birmingham, Coventry, New York, Boston or wherever.  Its members are located in other cities in many other countries on different continents.  We have important connections with those to whom I refer and these must be nurtured.  We must maintain constant contact with the Diaspora.</p><p>  One matter to which we often understandably refer is the importance of foreign direct investment.  Outward direct investment is also important.  Many Irish indigenous companies have grown to become multinational corporations.  There is no longer that big a difference between the number of American people employed by Irish companies operating in the United States and the number of Irish people employed by US companies operating here.  The fora to which the Tánaiste referred are all important in the context of maintaining opportunities for foreign direct investment into Ireland and outward direct investment from here, underpinning the process of networking and facilitating real engagement.  Such engagement should not just take the form of getting together once a year, it should also involve ongoing contact that can enable the creation of additional business that will be of benefit to Irish people at home and abroad.</p><p>We have developed this network quite considerably since the initial meeting which took place in Farmleigh in 2009 and which was convened by my predecessor, Deputy Martin, the leader of Fianna Fáil.  As the Deputy noted, the network has great potential.  The flow of investment is a two-way process.  Approximately 100,000 Irish people are directly employed in American companies investing in Ireland.  What is not so well known is that approximately 85,000 American people are employed in Irish companies investing in the United States.  The same applies to our trade with Britain which currently is worth about €1 billion a week.</p><p> The forum is enabling us to access leaders in the corporate sector and leaders in communications and education.  It has been a very successful network and we are examining ways in which it can be developed further.  This morning, I had a meeting with a delegation from the United States comprised of senior advisers to Secretary of State Clinton.  Because they want to develop the American diaspora and network they are interested in working closely with us because they recognise that we have done pioneering work in this area.  The Global Irish Network is very much a pioneering forum for developing a network of people around the world which will be to our advantage.  These are Irish, well placed people with an attitude of goodwill towards this country.</p></speech>

Their views and ideas need to be taken on board.  It is surprising that it is only a recent initiative because members of the Irish Diaspora always ask about home.  They are willing to help out.  The initiative has been slow in its initial phase but it has potential.  However, this needs to be a long-term policy to be continued by future Governments.  So many people consider themselves part of the Irish story and they want to help.  There should be a role for these people in the future development of the economy.</p></speech>

Approximately 70 million people throughout the world claim Irish heritage and there are 40 million people in the United States.  It is a huge network.  The traditional events such as St. Patrick's Day events are very important and they gather a big catchment of people.</p><p>  We have involved people who are well placed in the world of business and it has a number of advantages for us.  These are people who sit on the boards of directors of companies considering investment decisions.  Very often it is the Irish connection that turns the key decision our way.  Opportunities for trade are opened up.  Ireland is an exporting country which exports 80% of everything it produces.  Having people with an attitude of goodwill towards this country who can open doors for companies and help to develop new markets is very important.</p><p>  Ireland has a joint economic commission with Russia which deals with trade.  The education sector is a growing market in Russia and also in Brazil.  The President visited Brazil accompanied by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello.  An agreement was concluded to bring 5,000 students from Brazil to Ireland to participate in education in our universities.  The potential is endless.  I am committed to expanding our reach among the diaspora.  I want to mobilise the Diaspora to help the country, particularly at an economically difficult time.  There is a great level of goodwill for this country among the members of the Irish Diaspora and it would be a great mistake not to harness it.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.368.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400042#QQ00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 24, 39, 44, and 50, together.</p><p>  I am deeply concerned about the recent misappropriation of Irish development funding in Uganda.  Ireland has no tolerance for fraud or any other form of financial irregularity with regard to our development programme.</p><p>  I have suspended approximately €16 million of Irish development assistance which was due to be channelled through the Government of Uganda in 2012.  I initiated an immediate investigation into the misappropriation of funds by the Office of the Prime Minister.  This investigation has been undertaken by a team from the evaluation and audit unit of my Department and it will report shortly.  I have also emphasised that Irish funding must be repaid by the Ugandan Government and that all necessary actions must be taken by the Ugandan authorities to pursue those guilty of this crime.</p><p>  This fraud was uncovered by the Auditor General of Uganda who carried out a special investigation into the handling of Irish aid funds by the Office of the Prime Minister.  Ireland has been working with and assisting the Office of the Auditor General as an inherent part of our programme of building institutions which make governments accountable.  The Auditor General has found that funding of €12.6 million received from Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark last year was transferred to unauthorised accounts, of which the Irish Aid component is €4 million.</p><p>  The independence and strength of the Auditor General is a clear sign of Ugandan Government accountability systems working well and the importance of supporting this work.  While the findings of the Auditor General in this case are deeply disturbing, the fact that the Auditor General is now in a position to make these findings is a demonstration of the increased capacity and the determination of elements within the Ugandan administration to enforce accountability as to the use of government and donor money.  It is only by building such national accountable systems that corruption can be eliminated.</p><p>  Our ambassador in Kampala and the director general of Irish Aid met with the Prime Minister of Uganda, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance and Economic Development of Uganda, to underline my deep concerns and to insist that the misappropriated funds be restored by the Ugandan authorities.  The Ugandan Government have since confirmed that all Irish Aid misappropriated funds will be reimbursed, that the officials against whom financial impropriety has been established will be fully prosecuted and that measures will be undertaken to tighten the internal controls.  I welcome this commitment.  I have directed our ambassador to work with the Ugandan authorities to ensure the misappropriated funds are restored.  The suspension of funding channelled through the Government of Uganda remains in place until this matter is resolved.</p><p>  Senior officials of my Department have been in close contact with their opposite numbers in Denmark and Sweden since the publication of the Auditor General’s report.  There has also been significant communication between Ireland’s ambassador in Kampala and the ambassadors of all three Nordic countries.  Denmark, Sweden and Norway suspended funding through government systems.</p><p>  I emphasise that Irish funding is not given to the Ugandan Government to spend as it sees fit.  Rather, it is to complement programmes in key social, health and education sectors as agreed with Irish Aid.  Funding social programmes through government systems is an important tool in achieving strong results and empowering national governments to deliver and take ownership of the provision of sustainable services in the long term. </p><p>  Our aid programme in Uganda is regularly examined and evaluated in order to ensure we achieve effectiveness and value for money.  However, it is clear that notwithstanding all the checks and balances the funding of programmes through governments in developing countries can be very challenging, as demonstrated in this case.  I am committed to ensuring that we learn lessons from this case in order to strengthen our systems of risk identification, management, monitoring and audit so as to minimise potential for any misuse of funds in the future.  I will continue to ensure our development funding is directed to the poorest and most vulnerable in the countries where we provide funding and that it represents the best value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  We are working to have Irish funds restored as quickly as possible.  We will continue to put pressure on the Ugandan authorities to ensure this happens quickly.  The impact of this funding crisis has brought us to a crossroads in our long-standing historic relationship with Uganda.  We must now reflect on how we move forward so as to ensure that money given by the Irish people is fully protected while still offering hope and assistance to some of the most vulnerable peoples of the world living in northern Uganda.</p></reply>

We discussed this matter earlier.  I was interested in hearing about the connection we have with various countries on this matter.  It appeared at the time in question Ireland was acting unilaterally.  The Minister stated there was constant toing and froing by officials.  They did seem to adopt a different approach.  It has certainly worked in respect of Ireland and we have got the response we wanted.</p><p>  Yesterday, the anti-homosexuality Bill currently before the Ugandan Parliament was referred to.  This is linked to the issue of funding.  In this regard, the Minister's comments at the meeting yesterday are pertinent.  We are all anxious to promote human rights and are concerned about the impact of the anti-homosexuality legislation in Uganda, where it is threatened that homosexuals will be jailed for life.  Are we going to link the possible resumption of funding with developments regarding the legislation?</p><p>  Many of the officials from Irish Aid believed just one person seemed to be pushing the legislation.  The Minister stated yesterday he raised the matter very strongly and that he was in Uganda last year.  Will he raise concerns about the Bill again?  Does the Irish Government have any plans to open discussions, to hold workshops or to have interaction with communities on gay rights and LGBT issues in Uganda?  Does the Minister envisage a role for Irish Aid in discussions in this regard?  If the legislation is passed in Uganda, what action will the Irish Government take?  The proposed legislation is a worrying development and a negative step.  What it represents is certainly a million miles from where we are coming as a society.  What is going to happen is unacceptable and will have implications for our involvement in Uganda.</p></speech>

We are at a crossroads in our relationship with the Ugandan Government.  I am pleased the auditor general identified the misappropriation of funds and that we have a commitment from the Ugandan authorities to repay in full the money that was misappropriated.  I will have to reflect on the future direction of our aid programme in so far as moneys are channelled through the Ugandan Government.  Before doing so, I will examine the audit and evaluation report that has been prepared.</p><p>  Even if we had never had a problem with the aid programme, we would raise the issue of the legislation on gay people that is before the Ugandan Parliament.  I was in Uganda during the summer and took the opportunity to raise the issue at the highest level, namely, with the President of Uganda.  I expressed my concern over the legislation that was being passed.  At that point, it was not clear whether the legislation would be passed or who would support it.  I believe the legislation began as Private Members' legislation.  As one will appreciate, a Government is not always responsible for Private Members' legislation.  We raised the matter with the Ugandans and we have been keeping an eye on it.  Irrespective of the direction we take with our aid programme in Uganda, we will continue to raise the human rights dimension with the Ugandan authorities.</p></speech>

They provide a clearly measurable way to track progress in the fight against global poverty.  The goals are central to Ireland’s overseas development programme, and to the Government’s development policy.  As we approach 2015, it is clear that progress on the goals has been mixed.  As a result of the scaling up of development assistance, and the partnership which we and other donors have built with Governments and communities in the developing world, the targets set in some vital areas will be met by 2015.  For instance, the overall extreme poverty rate will be halved, as will the proportion of people without access to clean drinking water.  Considerable progress has been made in education, especially enrolment at primary level, and in addressing the HIV-AIDS pandemic. However, less positively, some targets remain significantly off-track, notably in the areas of maternal health and maternal mortality, access to sanitation and the fight against extreme hunger, which is a central priority of Ireland’s aid programme.  It is imperative that the entire international community strengthen and accelerate its efforts to achieve the remaining targets by 2015.  </p><p>  Next September, the UN General Assembly will hold a major political meeting to review progress in advance of 2015 and open substantive debate on the framework for international development after that date.  During Ireland’s EU Presidency in the first half of 2013, we will focus on the preparation for the UN meeting, commencing with a major discussion at an informal meeting of EU Development Ministers, to be hosted by the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, in Dublin in early February.  I look forward to working with our EU partners to develop the strongest possible EU contribution for the UN discussions, and to highlight the actions needed internationally to make maximum progress in the fight against poverty and hunger by 2015.</p></reply>

I hope we can make progress on this issue during the Irish Presidency.  We have a proud history of supporting developing countries in some of the most impoverished regions in the world.  In the past 15 to 20 years, in particular, this has been achieved through Government funding.  Before that, it was achieved through our missionaries, both lay and religious.  At a time when there is negative publicity over developments in Uganda, it is important to reiterate to the Irish taxpayer the considerable benefits that accrue to recipients of Irish development aid in various regions.  It is important that this message be got across, particularly when households are facing particular challenges.</p><p>  This year the overseas development aid programme of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was worth approximately €639 million, which is 0.5% of GNP.  I assume the Minister will not confirm this evening that this figure will be the same for 2013.  It is important, however, that we do everything to achieve the UN target by 2015.  Despite the challenges, it is important that our overseas development aid programme be maintained at the highest possible level.</p></speech>

We have always had a strong empathy with people and countries facing famine, hunger and poverty.  There are almost 1 billion people living in the world who are undernourished and lack basic nutrition.  Our aid programme is literally saving lives.  It is helping to feed hungry people and ensuring that babies and young children survive the critical first 1,000 days.  That is an initiative we took jointly with the United States which has now been mainstreamed, namely, the Scaling Up Nutrition movement.  I refer to the work we have done as a country in saving lives and rescuing people from the scourge of the HIV-AIDS pandemic and the work we are doing in providing basic education and health services, building on the heroic work done by religious missionaries over the decades.  We have a great record in that regard and Irish people have shown great generosity time and again, even in difficult times, when we see humanitarian crises in different parts of the world.</p><p>  We are committed to the 0.7% target, and it is critically important that we keep that target firmly in sight.  However, we must be realistic about our prospects of achieving it in the current economic circumstances.   The level of aid for next year will be a budget matter but we can be proud of the fact that in difficult times as a country we have maintained our faith and commitment with the poorest people of the world.</p></speech>

I recall one of the Minister's predecessors, Brian Cowen, saying, when we won one of the rotating seats on the UN Security Council some years ago, that we had people willing to support us based on the Irish contribution to their countries over many years.</p><p>  The Minister said that 1 billion people go to bed hungry every night.  I read some commentary recently in which that figure was revised downwards.  When he has an opportunity he might instruct his officials to find out the best estimate for that figure.  However, regardless of what the figure is, we all deplore the fact that so many people are hungry when so much wealth is lost under the many different regimes.  I ask the Minister to ensure that is addressed through the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.</p><p>  There are different agencies working in this area and there is a great transfer of knowledge from this country.  At yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade we had an informal meeting with a delegation from the Congo during which its representatives told us about their very rich farmland.  That is a country where there has been protracted conflict resulting in the deaths of more than 5 million people in a relatively short period.  At the same time, its rich resources are not being utilised.  There is a huge task ahead and I wish the Minister well in every forum available to him and urge him to use the Presidency of the EU Council to keep these issues on the agenda.  As he rightly said, we are all conscious of what our country suffered, and for those of us who come from parishes where workhouses were located, and the graveyards are located still, it is a constant reminder of what our previous generations experienced.</p></speech>

I was drawing a distinction between going to bed hungry and nutrition, but we can circulate information on it.</p><p>  It is important for us to remember that our aid programme is the right thing to do.  It fits in with our values as a people but it is also opening up doors and opportunities for us.  Let us consider what is now happening in Africa.  Seven of the ten fastest-growing economies in the world are in Africa and our record of aid in that continent is now enabling us to open up trade opportunities in those countries.  That is the reason we developed the Africa strategy, which is examining the major potential of Africa from a trade point of view.  One of the initiatives we took this year, for example, was undertaken jointly my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and I worked with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  We have now introduced a programme which is operating in Kenya and Tanzania involving the private food sector here.  It is exploring opportunities for developments in the agrifood sectors in Kenya and Tanzania.</p><p>  With regard to where this is going, our aid programme is a generous expression of our assistance to African countries and other poor countries, but in many cases we are now moving from aid to trade.  Regarding the potential in terms of food, natural resources, education and the development of services, Africa is growing rapidly economically and our presence there through our aid programme is opening up opportunities for trade and investment, as well as opening doors for Irish companies to develop their trade with Africa.  That is giving rise to much new economic potential.  People who question, from a selfish point of view, whether we should be providing aid and the amount of aid we should be providing should consider its potential to open doors in terms of trade and think in the longer term rather than thinking only as far as the next budget or the budget after that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400045#TT00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p><p>  I am pleased to address the House on Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012.  As Minister for Health, I am committed to major reform of the health system.  My objective is to deliver a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, in which access to health care is based on need and not on ability to pay.  The risk equalisation scheme in the Bill before the House today is an important element of this reform process.  It will be vital to helping to ensure a sustainable and competitive private health insurance market as we move to universal health insurance.</p><p>  There are several important stepping stones to achieving the programme for Government goal of universal health insurance.  This system will guarantee that every citizen has equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services.  The stepping stones to achieving this goal include the strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients; the work of the special delivery unit in tackling waiting times and establishing hospital groups; the introduction of a more transparent and efficient money-follows-the-patient funding mechanism for hospitals; and, from 1 January next, the introduction of a robust risk equalisation scheme for the private health insurance market.</p><p>  The Bill’s main object is to provide for a robust system of risk equalisation.  Its purpose is to ensure the burden of the costs of health services are shared by all insured persons by providing for a cost subsidy between the healthier and the less healthy, as well as between the young and the old.  The Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2011 provide the statutory basis for the regulation of the private health insurance market in the interests of the common good.  Unlike other types of insurance, in which insurers are free to price policies according to the individual risk a customer presents, the Oireachtas and successive Governments have supported the maintenance of a fundamental principle of community rating in the private health insurance market.  Under this principle, insurers must charge the same level of premium for a given level of service regardless of age, gender or health status.  This means the premium for a health insurance policy reflects the risk of the insured population in the community instead of solely the risks and costs of individual policyholders.</p><p>  The principle of community rating, together with lifetime cover, open enrolment and minimum benefit, provide an equitable non-discriminatory regulatory framework for voluntary private health insurance.  Under lifetime cover, an insurance contracts cannot be terminated by the insurer even as the insured person ages and, perhaps, becomes less healthy.  Under open enrolment, private health insurers must accept anyone under the age of 65 years who wishes to obtain private health insurance for the first time, regardless of age.  These principles can be considered as the pillars of private health insurance legislation underpinning the operation of the insurance market in the interests of the common good.  This long-supported policy is comparable with the way we fund overall health care costs, where the young support the old, the healthy support the less healthy and the better off support the less well-off.  This intergenerational solidarity is a fundamental cornerstone of our system.  It means that younger people pay more for health insurance premiums than the level of cost they are likely to incur, so that older people pay less as a direct consequence.</p><p>  The pricing of risk across the community of insured persons clearly requires robust mechanisms to share costs when there are several insurance companies in the market.  It is not in the interest of customers, or of our health insurance market, to facilitate insurers in cherry-picking more profitable customers who are less likely to make claims.  Internationally, other health insurance systems also work to discourage this practice.  Our four open market health insurers, Aviva Health, GloHealth, Laya Healthcare and VHI Healthcare, recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Without exception, they expressed full support for community rating but, unsurprisingly, they have different views as to how it should be supported across the market.</p><p>  This Bill seeks to strengthen and maintain stability in the private health insurance market.  Insurers with the worst risk profiles either charge higher premiums or incur heavy losses.  The problem can then be exacerbated as younger customers switch to other insurers where they may find more attractive plans.  An outcome of this imbalance could be the creation of a death spiral whereby the business of an insurer with a significantly riskier portfolio becomes unsustainable.  This is likely to result in destabilisation of the market, challenging the long-term sustainability of all insurers, with serious potential consequences for consumers as the next insurer with a disadvantageous risk profile then becomes vulnerable.</p><p>  The standard transfer mechanism to support community rating is called risk equalisation.  Community-rated health insurance systems across the world use this as a means of protecting the market.  Only through the use of risk equalisation can solidarity and cost-sharing be effectively implemented between the generations who hold insurance and across the insurance market as a whole.  The aim of risk equalisation is to look at the market as a whole and distribute fairly the differences that arise in insurers' costs due to the differing health conditions of all their customers.  The House will note that the Bill limits participation in this risk equalisation scheme to those insurers operating in the open market.  Several other undertakings exist which mainly provide health insurance for certain vocational groups and their families and restrict membership to those groups.  As they do not operate in the open market and do not compete for the business of all customers, it would not be appropriate for them to participate in this scheme.</p><p>  A proper and robust risk equalisation scheme has been long promised and is critically needed at this time.  As a forerunner, the interim scheme of age-related tax credits and community rating levy was introduced in 2009 and further extended for 2012 by legislation enacted in 2011.  The scheme has made a significant contribution to community rating since 2009 and is, to date, the only scheme that has succeeded in transferring funds from low-risk to high-risk groups.  The current scheme expires on 31 December 2012.  Accordingly, I am proposing this permanent risk equalisation scheme for the private health insurance market from 1 January 2013.</p><p>  The approval of the European Commission is required for the risk equalisation scheme provided for in the Bill.  The Commission is now examining the scheme's compatibility with the Single Market and, in particular, the conditions laid down in the EU framework for state aid in the form of public service compensation.  These conditions are focused on ensuring that a public service - in this case the provision of private health insurance cover - is clearly defined and the basis for the calculation of compensation provided under the scheme is established in advance in an objective and transparent manner.  The conditions also focus on ensuring arrangements are in place for avoiding overcompensation, including provision for repayment in the event of any such overcompensation.  My Department has been engaged with the Commission in an informal approval process since early this year.  Formal notification commenced some time ago and Commission approval is expected shortly.</p><p>  As I have outlined, the introduction of a permanent risk equalisation scheme will also assist in maintaining a stable and sustainable health insurance market.  As the original provider of health insurance in the State following its establishment more than 50 years ago, VHI has a much higher proportion of older customers than the other insurers and, therefore, has the poorest risk profile.  There is no doubt that the absence of a robust risk equalisation scheme would result in a more immediate challenge to that company's sustainability than would be the case for the other insurers in the market.  However, I emphasise that this Bill is intended to ensure the sustainability of the whole market, not just VHI.</p><p>  In September 2011, the European Court of Justice ruled against the State on a long-standing derogation from the EU non-life directives.  The effect of the derogation had been to exempt VHI from the requirement to be authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland.  For any insurer to become authorised by the Central Bank, it is critical for the business to demonstrate that it has a sustainable business plan over the medium term.  Accordingly, a corollary of the introduction of a robust risk equalisation scheme is that it would help facilitate the authorisation of VHI by providing greater stability and sustainability.</p><p>  It should be noted, of course, that risk equalisation alone will not suffice to bring VHI to a position in which it can make an application for authorisation by the Central Bank.  I have particular concerns, which I have articulated previously, about the level of costs being incurred by all health insurers.  To improve its solvency position, reducing its costs will be more beneficial to VHI than increasing premiums due to the way in which EU solvency rules operate.  I have been adamant that VHI must continue to focus on addressing its costs, including the underlying costs of procedures and treatments for which it pays, as well as volume.</p><p>  The total premium income for the three insurers in the market in 2011 was €1.92 billion, an increase of €360 million, or 23% more than the 2008 figure of €1.56 billion.  As of the end of September 2012, some 2.1 million people, 46% of the population, held inpatient plans.  In terms of market share, VHI has 57%, Laya Healthcare has 21.5%, Aviva Health has 17.3%, restricted membership undertakings have 4% and GloHealth, the most recent arrival, has 0.4%.</p><p> In the year to the end of September there was a reduction of 64,418 in the number of individuals holding private health insurance.  Laya Healthcare or Quinn and Aviva Health combined have a 48% market share in the 30 to 39 year age group but only 11% of those aged over 80 years.  At the same time, VHI Healthcare continues to have a much greater proportion of members in the older age groups.  In the first six months of 2012, it had six times the proportion of members in the over 80 year age group compared to Quinn or Laya Healthcare and five times the proportion compared to Aviva Health.</p><p> I am mindful that health insurance is becoming harder to afford, especially for older people, as insurers increasingly tailor their insurance plans towards younger, healthier customers.  However, the Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance in order that it is affordable for as many people as possible.  As Minister for Health, I have consistently raised the issue of costs with health insurers and I am keen to explore all available measures to limit the costs related to health insurance.  The challenge for all of us is to ensure the market remains viable and relevant, especially given its role in supporting the provision of services in the public sector but also as we prepare for the transition to universal health insurance.</p><p> There is a new chairman and chief executive at VHI.  I have made it clear to both that the focus must now be on cutting the cost of care.  This is something on which we are focused in the public sector and it must be the focus in the insured private sector also.  There is no clinical audit of VHI or other insurers.  This is a practice whereby a like-qualified medic or surgeon may challenge the providing surgeon on why various procedures which may not be deemed necessary were carried out.  There is insufficient audit in the ordinary sense in ensuring procedures claimed for were carried out.  Everyone in the House knows of anecdotal reports of people examining and paying their bill but not recalling certain named procedures being performed.  We continue to pay for procedures at the same rate, some of which used to take two hours and now only take 20 minutes.  This issue must be addressed also.  The practices we have started to introduce in public hospitals whereby we focus on same-day admission and reduced readmission rates must be introduced in private hospitals.  I have encountered cases where people were kept overnight or for several nights for procedures which did not require such a duration of stay.  However, because the public and private systems charge on a per day basis, it is in their interests to keep patients in hospital for as long as possible and to perform as many procedures as might be deemed appropriate but which on closer inspection might be deemed unnecessary.  We will enter into an arrangement with the insurers whereby the public system will pay per procedure.  The hospitals that are efficient and bring in patients on the day of the procedure and ensure early discharge and reduced readmissions will profit and flourish.  Those which do not will find themselves in severe difficulties.  Given the level of tax benefits given to private insurers, we demand that we receive value for money not only in the public sector but also in the private sector.  I am pleased that many private hospitals and VHI are engaging with the public sector clinical programmes to establish what they are doing to see if they can learn certain things and transfer these lessons to the private sector.  I welcome this.</p><p> I wish to outline the position on charging for public bed occupancy.  Under the current legal framework, private inpatients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge which ranges from €586 to €1,046 in most public hospitals.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of inpatients treated privately by consultants were not charged maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds in public hospitals.</p><p> As part of the 2012 budget, I announced my intention to bring forward legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of whether they occupied a public or private bed.  VHI claimed that this would lead to premium increases of up to 45%.  I was mindful of the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers and, as a consequence, customers.  In discussions with the insurers I indicated that I would be prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted in the 2012 budget could be raised through a system of improved cashflow.  Such a system has been agreed and the legal agreements are being finalised with health insurers.  I am considering several policy issues with a view to progressing the legislation in 2013 and their implications in advance of bringing the matter to the Government.  The issue will be dealt with as part of the budgetary process for 2013.</p><p> When I announced my intention to establish a robust system of risk equalisation last year, I made it clear that I would consult the commercial insurers on the details to ensure the scheme would be as efficient as possible and that it would avoid unnecessary administrative complexity.  My Department was pleased to be able to use the health insurance consultative forum which I established late last year for this purpose.  The forum comprises representatives of the four private health insurers, the Health Insurance Authority and my Department.  Originally, I set it up with a view to generating ideas to help address health insurance costs, while respecting the requirements of competition law.  My Department chaired three recent meetings of the consultative forum on health insurance, at which the central focus was on discussing the Bill before the House.  These meetings provided insurers with an opportunity to participate in, and directly contribute to, discussions on the planned working of the scheme.  I thank the insurers for their constructive input at these meetings and I am pleased to advise that following consideration of suggestions made, I have agreed to propose modifications on Committee Stage.  I will address these modifications later.</p><p> I wish to outline how the new scheme will support community rating.  There are several relevant measures in the Bill.  The first relates to the provision of risk equalisation credits, payable from a new risk equalisation fund and administered by the Health Insurance Authority.  These are in respect of private health insurance premiums of insured persons aged 50 years and over, based on age, gender and type of insurance cover; and a hospital bed utilisation credit covering each hospital stay involving an overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation.  The second relates to payments from the risk equalisation fund to be funded by a stamp duty payable by open market insurers in respect of each insured life covered.  The stamp duty will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners and transferred to the risk equalisation fund.  There will be four rates of stamp duty, depending on whether the policy provides for advanced cover or non-advanced cover and whether the insured life is that of a child or an adult.  The risk equalisation credits in favour of insured persons aged 50 years and over in respect of age, gender and type of cover will be provided at source, that is to say, the gross cost of the policy will be reduced by the amount of the credit.  In turn, the insurer will submit a claim to the Health Insurance Authority for reimbursement of the credit from the risk equalisation fund on behalf of qualifying policyholders.  This provides that health insurers receive higher premiums in respect of insuring older and less healthy people, and all insured persons continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product.  In this way, community rating is maintained, but insurers receive higher premiums in respect of riskier groups to partly compensate for the higher level of claims.  The health insurers will also submit claims to the Health Insurance Authority for payment from the risk equalisation fund of amounts due in respect of hospital bed utilisation credits.  </p><p> Community rating is decidedly important.  Many people now in the older age category who perhaps present a higher cost to VHI subsidised the generation ahead of them when they joined VHI.  In some cases, this was 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  They have a right of expectation and there is no disagreement in the House on the issue of community rating.</p><p> I wish to outline the specific provisions contained in the Bill.  Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994.</p><p> Section 2 amends section 1A of the principal Act.  That section sets out the principal objective which is a clear statement of the public policy objective that the provisions in the principal Act are seeking to achieve.  The amendment, first, broadens the scope for sharing the burden of the costs of health services between insured persons by extending the cost subsidy - currently, between the young and the old - to include the more healthy and the less healthy.  The more healthy are less frequent users of health services, while the less healthy are more frequent users.  Second, the amendment adds a further criterion to be taken into account for the purposes of achieving the principal objective of the Health Insurance Acts, that is, the importance of discouraging insurers from engaging in practices such as market segmentation which might have the effect of favouring the coverage of the more healthy, including the young, over that of the less healthy, including the old.  Sections 3, 8, 10, 11, 16 and 19 are technical amendments.</p><p> Section 4 amends section 3 of the principal Act.  This amendment provides powers for the Health Insurance Authority to make regulations to categorise products.  It also removes the requirement for regulations to be approved in advance by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This provision is no longer required as risk equalisation credit rates will in the future be set by an Act of the Oireachtas.</p><p> Section 5 substitutes a new section for section 4 of the principal Act to provide for offences.  It provides for the conviction of persons and organisations that contravene the provisions of the Act.</p><p> Section 6 substitutes a new section for section 6A of the principal Act.  It provides definitions and key terms relating to the interpretation of Part II of the Bill and Schedules 3 and 4.  Key definitions include &quot;hospital bed utilisation credit&quot;, ''relevant contract (advanced cover)&quot;, &quot;relevant contract (non-advanced cover)&quot;, &quot;risk equalisation credits&quot; and ''type of cover&quot;.</p><p> Section 7 amends section 7 of the principal Act.  In subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) the amendment extends the period of time for which an insurer must maintain the price of a health insurance contract to 90 days from 31.</p><p> Section 9 provides for the submission of new and changed existing health insurance contracts to the authority.  Clearly, my priority is the implementation of a robust risk equalisation scheme, while minimising the impact on insurers' ability to carry on their businesses.</p><p> As I noted, my Department had successful and useful discussions with the private health insurers on the Bill through the consultative forum.  As a result of these discussions, I propose to deal on Committee Stage with a number of concerns raised by insurers.  They relate, first, to the impact of the product notification periods specified in section 7AB of 90 days for new and changed products and, second, to the definition of products &quot;not providing advanced cover&quot;.  The amendments will provide for an objective delineation of the product categorisation which, in turn, will allow the HIA to categorise products in a more timely manner than previously envisaged.  I will bring forward Committee Stage amendments that will reduce the product notification periods specified in section 7AB from 90 days to 30.  I will also deal with the period for which a product must be maintained in the market at the same price, that is, in section 7(1)(<i>a</i>), by reducing this period from 90 days to 60.</p><p> Section 12 amends section 7D of the principal Act.  The amendment expands the breakdown of information returns which insurers are required to submit to the HIA to include the gender profile and type of cover of each age group in respect of the relevant period.</p><p> Section 13 amends section 7E of the principal Act.  The current legislation provides for the evaluation and analysis of information returns provided by insurers.  This amendment provides for additions to the elements to which the authority must have regard in carrying out its evaluation and analysis of information returns.  Following this analysis, the HIA will submit its report, including recommendations for rates of risk equalisation credits for the following year, to the Minister.  In the future average claims will be further broken down into sub-groups by gender and level of cover, as well as by age which is already provided for in existing legislation.  In addition, it will consider hospital utilisation in respect of each of these groups.  In coming to its recommendations the authority will be required to take two further criteria into account: first, the aim of maintaining the sustainability of the market and, second, the aim of having fair and open competition in the market.  It will have a serious role in ensuring products are fair and not being developed to segment the market.  </p><p> Having determined its recommended level of credits, the Health Insurance Authority will also recommend rates of stamp duty which it considers will be required for the scheme to be self-financing.  In advance of proposing rates for risk equalisation credits to be set in primary legislation every year, I will consult the Minister for Finance.  I will have regard to the principal objective and consider any report furnished to me by the HIA, as well as the aims of avoiding overcompensation of insurers, maintaining the sustainability of the market, having fair and open competition in the health insurance market, and avoiding the fund having a surplus or deficit from year to year based on approved accounting standards.  As part of my consultation with the Minister for Finance, I will make recommendations to him on the applicable stamp duty rates.</p><p> Section 14 amends section 7F of the principal Act.  A key issue for the Minister and the European Commission is to ensure there is no overcompensation of any insurer under the scheme.  Therefore, the provisions for conducting the test for overcompensation which have worked successfully under the interim scheme since 2009 will remain in force.  The amendment provides that the timeframe to be used for the annual overcompensation test will be a rolling three year basis.</p><p> Section 15 inserts new sections, 11A to 11F, inclusive, after section 11 of the principal Act.  Provisions for a risk equalisation scheme are set out, including to whom it applies, how it will operate and how an insurer can make a claim for risk equalisation credits.  The section outlines the powers of the HIA to establish and operate the risk equalisation fund, as well as powers to make regulations specifying which products it determines to be &quot;non-advanced cover&quot;.  These products will attract a lower rate of age-related risk equalisation credit and a lower rate of stamp duty.</p><p> As I indicated, the risk equalisation scheme will increase the factors to be risk adjusted to include a measure of health status.  Where available, pharmaceutical cost groups or diagnostic cost groups are used internationally as an indicator of chronic illness and attract risk equalisation payments accordingly.  While these data are not currently available in Ireland to the level of detail required, I am committed to developing proposals to risk adjust based on a measure of chronic illness when the necessary data are to hand.  This is an area in which I consider the market operators can be of particular assistance.  Once the required data are gathered, I intend to progress work on developing a usable risk adjustment measure for health status.  In the meantime, the Bill provides for resource usage to be used as a proxy for health status as a risk factor.  Resource usage data are readily available and easy to verify and used in other countries to risk adjust.</p><p> I will bring forward a Committee Stage amendment which will provide that in respect of policies effected from 31 March 2013, a hospital bed utilisation credit will be payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of each overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation by an insured person where the health insurance cover of the person's contract covers that hospital stay.  The rate which I will propose on Committee Stage to be inserted in Schedule 3 will be set at a level so as not to encourage inefficiencies in any way.  As I stated, we will be looking to charge more by procedure than by bed day because by procedure charging will ensure greater efficiency.</p><p> One criticism of the current interim scheme has been that younger persons taking out products with benefits below the standard level are potentially cross-subsidising standard level benefit products taken out by older persons.  The provision for differentiated levels of stamp duty and risk equalisation credits for the two types of cover - advanced cover and non-advanced cover - addresses this point.  Section 11E requires the HIA to evaluate and analyse each type of contract and ascertain to its satisfaction whether a contract provides for advanced or non-advanced cover and make regulations accordingly.  As I mentioned, insurers have been consulted on the Bill and I am happy to be able to signal my intention at Committee Stage to amend the definition of contracts not providing for advanced cover to reflect discussions between insurers, the Health Insurance Authority and my Department.  In addition, provision is made for the Minister to make regulations for the making and determining of claims under the scheme.  These regulations are being drafted and will be in place by the end of the year.</p><p> Section 17 amends the principal Act by inserting new sections 18E, 18F and 18G to provide for the appointment of and the powers of authorised officers of the HIA.  These officers will assist the authority and the Minister in carrying out their respective functions.</p><p> Section 18 amends section 21 of the principal Act.  The amendment gives additional functions to the HIA in administering the risk equalisation scheme.  Section 20 repeals sections 12, 12A and 33A of the principal Act.  </p><p> Section 21 substitutes a new Schedule for Schedule 2 of the principal Act.</p><p>The purpose of the framework is to spell out the conditions under which state aid can be found to be compatible with the Common Market, pursuant to Article 86(2) of the EU treaty.  An updated schedule replaces the existing framework, 2005/C 297/04.  The revised framework is entitled, Communication from the Commission: European Union framework for State aid in the form of public service compensation, 2012/C 8/03.</p><p> Section 22<i></i>provides for the title, collective citation and construction of the Bill.  With regard to Schedules 3 and 4 to the Bill, I expect to have the report of the Health Insurance Authority by the end of this week.  Following consideration of that report and consultation with the Minister for Finance, I will propose applicable rates on Committee Stage.</p><p> A robust and fair risk equalisation scheme has long been awaited to support community rating in the private health insurance market.  I am pleased that I can now deliver on this important programme for Government commitment to put a permanent scheme of risk equalisation in place.  This market, like all markets, requires certainty for those who seek to enter it and the availability of the Bill, although it is only now published, provided the certainty to allow a fourth player into the market.  That is to the benefit of insurance customers.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400048#WW00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill.  I also welcome the principle, namely, to place community rating and risk equalisation on a sound statutory footing to ensure that we have equity in the marketplace and that the young, the old, the ill and the healthy are treated equally.  That is something that must be part of any civilised society.  We must make sure that people have equality of access to private health insurance regardless of age, health status and so forth.</p><p>  One thing that was notable by its absence from the Minister's speech was the mention of people who take out private health insurance.  The Minister spoke a lot about private health insurance companies and the industry itself, but the key is that we have people who are willing to take out private health insurance.  In the context of the debate to date, I find it amazing that the view persists that those who take out private health insurance are in some way elitist and enjoy an advantage over others.  The vast majority of those who take out private health insurance have already made a substantial contribution to the Exchequer, which provides public health and other services, through general taxation.  It is after making that contribution that they pay for private health insurance to insure themselves in the event of illness or a need for medical treatment.  Very often, that medical treatment is provided in public hospitals.  The problem I have with full cost recoup for people who are treated in public beds as private patients is that it will inevitably lead to an increase in the cost of private health insurance.  We are talking this evening about community rating and risk equalisation, but for that to succeed we must have a continuous stream of young healthy people entering the private health insurance market so that there is cross-subsidisation of those who are older, sicker or require more treatments and who are, by extension, more expensive for health insurers.  What is absent from this entire debate is a policy that will encourage younger people into the health insurance market.  The four insurers recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Health and Children but not one of them could outline what is required to ensure that we have a continuing stream of younger people taking out private health insurance.  If one looks at the statistics, it is quite evident not only that young people are not entering the private health insurance market but that many who have entered it are leaving again or reducing their cover.  If that continues, we will not have intergenerational solidarity, cross-subsidisation, risk equalisation, community rating or whatever one wants to call it, because we will have a diminishing market in which only those who are older and perhaps less healthy will be cross-subsidising each other.  That will be utterly unsustainable in the long term.  We must have a health insurance market that is sustainable and that attracts younger people so that the cross-subsidisation and risk equalisation that this Bill proposes is possible.  That is not the case at present.</p><p>  If one looks at past statements by the Minister for Health one can see that he condemned any increase in insurance premiums, but we are now talking about increases of between 15% and 20%.  VHI stated that if the Minister went ahead with his proposals for full cost recoup from private patients in public beds, as announced in last year's budget, it would have cost that company approximately €200 million, which would have led to premium increases of as much as 45%.  How that proposal was included in the budget baffles me to this day.  Last year, the Minister announced in the House that he intended to charge insurance companies full cost for the use of public beds for private patients, which would be anything from €560 to €1040.  That would have had a devastating impact on the market.  I raise this issue because I am not sure that anybody in the Department of Health fully understands the complexities of health insurance.  If they did, they would have begged the Minister not to go ahead with this policy proposal.  How he could walk into this House and say he was going to do it is beyond me.  If he was allowed to do that, it suggests that those who are advising him - if he listens to advice - do not fully understand the market.  That policy would have had a devastating impact on the ability of insurers to keep their premiums low, to attract younger customers and to cross-subsidise.  Actuarial studies show that the only way a vibrant insurance market will work is to have a continual flow of new entrants who start early, contribute and cross-subsidise.  If we do not accept this simple premise then this legislation, while noble, will fail, because the market will not be sustainable.  The figures are there to prove the point.</p><p>  VHI, a State insurance company, is not sustainable as currently structured.  It must meet minimum capital requirements for licensing purposes but the fact that the profile of its customers is much older and it cannot attract younger customers simply means that it will haemorrhage money.  The more money it haemorrhages, the bigger the problem for the State in terms of trying to ensure it is fit for purpose, qualifies for licensing and can go about its business.  There is a lot of work to be done in this regard.</p><p>  My party has supported community rating and risk equalisation for some time, but Fine Gael previously opposed it.  In 2006 the current Taoiseach said he was not in favour of risk equalisation.  Deputy Olivia Mitchell, the party's former health spokesperson, said that she had major concerns and would oppose risk equalisation.  In that context, at least the party has come around to the idea that risk equalisation is part of social solidarity.  However, the Government must accept that the full cost recoup policy it is pursuing will have a very damaging effect on the health insurance market.  It will only lead to an increase in the cost of premiums, which in turn will lead to fewer people taking out health insurance.  That will mean that older people will have to pay more for health insurance cover.  It is as simple as that.  No matter what way one looks at it, that cannot be denied.  It is a mathematical, statistical, actuarial fact.  Until such time as we deal with that in an honest and fair way, we will have major difficulties.  We can have every insurance company there is entering the market and providing cover but the bottom line is that if they are providing cover in a shrinking market they will have to find some way of subsidising older people.  Otherwise the cost of cover for older people will not be sustainable.</p><p>  We must have an honest debate on the full cost recoup policy and I welcome the fact that the Minister has delayed its implementation.  I have heard people ask why the State should subsidise those who take out private health insurance, but such people are taxpayers and are making an enormous contribution through their private health insurance to lightening the burden on the State.  If it is not as if they are obtaining runaway supports over and above those who are uninsured.  If the private insurance market collapsed in this country the public health system could not meet the demand that would be placed on it to provide health care for those who currently have private health insurance.  It simply could not do it.  Privately insured people are lightening the burden on the public health system.  We can have an ideological or philosophical debate about what type of health system we want, but we must deal with what we have in place now.</p><p>The Minister has promised to change the system and stated that there will be universal health insurance.  The difficulty is that we are still unsure what type of universal health insurance model he prefers.  He had a fascination with the Dutch model but while that might be a very fine model I am not sure it is suitable for this country given the number of possible entrants to the market.  The Netherlands has a population of 22 million in a relatively small land area, which allows hospitals to be grouped.  I do not believe the number of entrants to the Irish market will be sufficient to provide competition for universal health insurance.  The then Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Róisín Shortall, stated in this Chamber that she was not sure what type of model would be used.  This is critically important.  Will the system be based on the European model or the United States model?  Will it be based on social insurance or the open market, which will mean the insurers can dictate the types of treatment and policies available to individuals?  The Minister asserts that a suite of treatments will be defined in legislation and made available.  First, however, we have to find out what type of model will be used.  His infatuation with the Dutch model appears to have diminished recently.</p><p> When a public health system operates alongside a system of private health insurance, private health insurers are equally subsidising the State because if individuals were not taking out insurance the State would have to provide care for them.  We are obliged to provide care for every citizen of this country.  It is not the case that the public purse is solely subsiding the private system.  Citizens who take out private health insurance are subsidising the State through their taxes and willingness to make sacrifices in other areas.  Many people cannot afford private health insurance, and we must provide proper facilities and supports for them, but many others make huge sacrifices to take out private health insurance.  These ordinary, middle-of-the-road people are subsidising the State because they are reducing the burden on the public health system.  There appears to be an undercurrent of sneering against those who take out private health insurance.</p><p> VHI is a critical player.  It is the dominant insurer in the market, with 58% of premiums.  Approximately 80% of insurance moneys paid out come from VHI.  That is not sustainable over the longer term.  If it is to be licensed to function without exemption it will need to meet capital requirements and develop a sustainable business plan.  It meets neither of these requirements.  It is trying its best to develop a business plan but it will need time and certainty regarding full cost recovery.  I welcome the fact that the Minister postponed the mad notion of introducing full cost charging from 1 January 2012 because of the massive impact it would have on VHI.  It must be delayed further, however, because it needs to be introduced incrementally over a number of years if the VHI is to have a chance of surviving.  We should be finding ways of making VHI fit for purpose in terms of universal health insurance.  It could be a State asset and if its sustainability is ensured it can be sold, developed or split up to ensure competition in the market.  It cannot be given away, never mind sold.  It is not a State asset; it is a State liability.  Its current customer profile, which is dominated by older people, is unsustainable.  It needs to become more efficient by ensuring the supplier-induced demand theory does not increase its payouts.</p><p> When premiums increased by a small percentage in January 2011, the Minister, who was then in opposition, claimed it would be the straw that broke the camel's back.  There have been several increases since then.  The camel's back is broken and it is lying in the sand.  Risk equalisation is a noble idea which promises intergenerational solidarity.  We supported risk equalisation from the outset, but if it is not sustainable it will fall down around us and universal health insurance will not function.  Last year the Minister waltzed in and announced that from January 2012 he intended to charge private health insurance companies full cost for treatment of private patients in public beds.  I was stunned when I heard that, as were the insurers and those who cannot afford to give any more.  We speak about the squeezed middle in Ireland.  Most health insurance customers are ordinary people.  They work and save to take out private health insurance for a rainy day.  It irritates me that premiums are continually hiked in the belief that people will continue to pay for them.  The figures reveal a dramatic decrease in the number of people who have private health insurance - a reduction of 60,000 over a 12-month period.  Others are downgrading their cover, and it is forecast that a further 120,000 people will drop out over the next two years.  These are the younger people.  If they are dropping out, who will subsidise the older people?  We have to be imaginative in persuading young people there is value in taking out private health insurance.  The uncertainty of the Minister's Holy Grail of universal health insurance does not encourage people to do so.  We were promised that the roll-out would begin with free GP care, but that is a myth because nothing is free.  The universal health insurance commission must publish its report so we can hold a debate on the type of model we want.</p><p> Supplier-induced demand is a concept most economic commentators understand, but it must be explained to lay people such as me.  I have seen supplier-induced demand in practice.  When one has private health insurance one gets the MOT at its best.  One is whipped in, gowned down and administered test after test.  The problem is that the tests may not be necessary.  A problem also arises in regard to going home from hospital at the weekend.  In some private hospitals it is not possible for a patient to discharge him- or herself until the following Monday.</p><p>They will keep the patient over as there is a charge per night, despite the fact that he or she needs little care or has no serious problem.  This charge is the cream or profit for the private hospitals and there is no point in pretending this does not happen.  It happens week in and week out.  VHI and all other insurers must ensure they tighten up on this issue.</p><p> We have all heard the anecdotal stories.  I am sure there is not a Deputy in the House who has not met somebody who questioned the amount of money paid to a private hospital by his or her health insurer.  A person came to me once whose Bill had amounted to €18,000 or €19,000.  When that person questioned the amount, he was told emphatically that it was not his concern.  However, it concerns all of us because these charges are lumped into our premiums.  We need to ensure there is a clinical audit to discourage induced demand in order that it does not encourage the medical industry to start providing tests and treatments and other ancillary services that are unnecessary.  Unfortunately, however, this happens from time to time.</p><p> Same day admittance is a key issue.  It is also important that people get home earlier and that they not be required to wait until the Monday morning to be discharged.  As we know, the only reason they are being kept in is the empty bed costs the private health provider money.  These issues can be dealt with through clinical audit and other forms of auditing to ensure efficiencies.  Private health providers must be forced to provide a streamlined and efficient health care system funded by private health insurance, without those paying for private health insurance being flogged to death by the need to save money to pay their premiums, but this is what is happening.  Recently, people spoke on radio programmes about the decisions they had to make.  They must choose whether to prioritise paying for insurance.  The father in a family of a husband, wife and three kids said he had to stop paying for insurance for himself because he could not afford to pay the premium, but his wife and three children are insured.  People must choose between filling their oil tanks and paying their private health insurance premiums.  They are being put to the pin of their collar.  Any forthcoming policy proposal from the Government must be focused on ensuring there is no upward pressure on premiums.</p><p> In the meantime, private health insurers and providers must be audited and monitored to ensure there is no fat or leakage with regard to costs and efficiencies in the system.  This is the key to ensuring that whatever insurance model we end up with will ensure we have a sustainable private health insurance market.  The Minister's policy should be to encourage as many as possible to take out private health insurance in the meantime.  He is moving towards a universal health insurance model under which it will be mandatory to have insurance.  Therefore, if people can afford it, they must take it out.  If they cannot afford it, a process will be applied whereby the State will pay.  I assume the model is of that nature.  We can argue whether it will be a social insurance model, but the principle behind it will be that it will be mandatory to take out private health insurance if a person can afford it and if not, the State will pay.  At this stage, the Minister should be trying to encourage as many as possible to take out health insurance in order that when the shift towards the universal health insurance model takes place, fewer people will have to start the process. </p><p> I welcome the consultative forum, although it is the oldest trick in the book to set up such a forum, let it play hard ball for a while, get involved in horse trading and eventually announce that it is very happy with the progress it has made with the Department and the Minister and that as a result some amendments will be made on Committee Stage.  It is a little presumptuous to expect the Bill will pass through the House.  Perhaps there will be no Committee Stage debate and the Bill will fall before that Stage is reached.  However, it is welcome that the consultative forum is working and that the Minister has made changes such as changing the duration from 90 days to 60 and other similar changes.</p><p> The consultative forum should, perhaps, have been set up earlier to avoid the difficulties we have with the overall budget.  Health insurers are providing cash flow for the Minister to keep the show on the road.  They are front-loading their payments to him to the value of €125 million for treatments that will be provided in 2013.  It is as if they are providing a short-term overdraft facility for him.  That is what it is and this has happened because he included this method of charging private health insurers the full cost of treatment in public beds.  That is why we have a hole in the budget and the reason we have had cutbacks to home help and home care packages and other difficulties.  It is due to the unsustainable nature of the health budget.</p><p> That brings me back to the question of how this could have happened.  Was the Minister not listening?  Was he not told, or does anybody know?  The proposal brought forward by him to apply the charge would have had a devastating impact on the capacity of insurers, particularly VHI, to continue to function as health insurers.  It would have cost VHI approximately €200 million, resulting in an increase of 30% to 40% in VHI premiums.  This would have had to happen within one year.  Thankfully, the Minister saw sense.  More importantly, he must now ensure the Bill is not introduced quickly such that it will cause panic next year.  We must ensure we allow for a sustainable, incremental introduction period in order that insurers can find their feet, the capital ratios and attract more people by retaining lower insurance premiums. </p><p> The figures for private health insurance are alarming, but I do not intend to read them all.  The total number aged under 17 years insured by the three insurance companies - before GloHealth which is at a figure of 0.4 % entered the market - Aviva, Laya and VHI, was 496,000 in 2007.  By 2011, this figure had reduced to 494,000.  However, there is a big problem in the case of those aged over 80 years.  In 2007 some 33,900 of those aged over 80 years were insured.  This figure has risen to 44,250.  What is happening is that younger people are dropping out of the health insurance market, at a time when people are living longer generally.  This shows that advances in medicine and changes in lifestyle and diet are having an impact.  Fewer people are smoking and people are living longer.  However, how can we sustain a position where numbers are increasing in the insurance market in the over-80 year age bracket, but fewer are committing to taking out private health insurance?  If anybody on the Government side can tell me how we can do this, I would be delighted to hear how.  Unfortunately, we are sitting on a demographic land mine in this regard.</p><p> While my contribution may have sounded negative, it is because I was trying to offer advice more than anything else.  I have always tried to be constructive in opposition, but it is very difficult to be constructive having observed destructive opposition for many years.  I am trying to change the tradition and come up with ideas.  I welcome the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill.  It is important it is being brought forward and that we promote the noble concept of intergenerational solidarity.  At the same time, if we are to be fair and honest, we must bring forward a mechanism and policy changes to ensure premiums will be retained at levels people can afford.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the broader discussion that will take place on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.403" nospeaker="true" time="18:20:00" ><p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Charlie McConalogue on Tuesday, 13 November 2012:That Dáil Éireann:

agrees that:- the new Student Universal Support Ireland central on-line system for processing student grants is failing abysmally to meet what is required for over 65,000 applications and this is causing undue hardship for third-level students awaiting payments; and

- sufficient extra staffing should be supplied immediately to correct this on-going problem so that student grants can be issued by Christmas;recognises that third-level students are facing year-on-year increases in their registration fees which are unfair and unjust in light of a promised reduction in these fees; and

calls on the Government to:- refrain from further cuts to the education budget and increases in third-level registration fees;

- ensure that all children who require Special Needs Assistants are provided with them;

- reinstate the Career Guidance Teacher provision; and

- preserve funding to Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.404" nospeaker="true" time="18:20:00" ><p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:To delete all words after &#8220;Dáil Éireann&#8221; and substitute the following:&quot;notes that:

&#8212; the annual cost of attending college increased by over 950% during Fianna Fáil&#8217;s time in office, from &#8364;190 in 1996-97 to &#8364;2,000 in 2011-12, effectively bringing to an end the era of free third level education in Ireland;

&#8212; sixty-six bodies around the country were previously tasked with the awarding of student grants &#8211; a system which involved significant duplication of functions and under which students in many parts of the country faced very significant delays in receiving student grants; and

&#8212; arising from its disastrous economic mismanagement of the public finances, the previous Government oversaw cuts to the staffing of primary schools, the dismantling of schemes to support those from Traveller backgrounds, reductions to the additional teaching posts for children who require support to learn English and the introduction of a cap on the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, who could be employed in schools;

further notes that:

&#8212; the Government continues to exempt more than 40% of students from any requirement to pay the student contribution, as well as providing tens of thousands of students with maintenance grants to assist with the costs of third level education; and

&#8212; the Government has protected the overall number of SNAs and resource teachers in schools, is rolling out high-speed broadband to every post-primary school in Ireland and has created programmes such as Springboard and the Labour Market Education and Training Fund that will provide more quality education places for those who are looking for work or seeking to upskill;

recognises that:

&#8212; there have been some delays with the awarding of grants by the newly established Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, service;

&#8212; the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee has arranged for the employment of additional staff by SUSI to bring such delays to an end and to ensure that all successful applicants receive grant payments by the end of December 2012;

&#8212; the Higher Education Authority, at the request of the Minister for Education and Skills, has written to all third level institutions asking them to avoid taking any action targeted at students who are awaiting the processing of student grant applications; and

&#8212; the establishment of SUSI in place of 66 separate grant awarding bodies will, in time, ensure that students continue to receive payments directly to their bank accounts and that student grants are administered in the most efficient way possible; and welcomes the significant reform agenda which has been undertaken by the Minister, including a new national literacy and numeracy strategy, the establishment of the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector, the overhaul of the existing junior cycle, a new examination of the points system and transitions between second and third levels, the announcement of a five year building programme, the reform of the VEC sector and the creation of a new national further education and training agency and the creation of a new landscape document for the higher education sector.&quot;- (Minister for Education and Skills)</p></speech>

Many of us linked the two of them together at the time.  The reality is that we are poor at putting good institutional architecture together when we need to reform things.  The main reason is that a raft of reforms tends to be needed as a consequence of the continual postponing of reform.  The reality is that the administration of a grant scheme is always most difficult in the first year of a degree course.  In my experience, it is quite easy once it has been done in the first year.  The odd case might differ in the years after that.  This has been an annual problem, mainly because the administration of a large volume of grants has to be shoehorned into a short period of time each year.  I suggest we could do things better, perhaps by organising the system over a much longer period of time so grants could be cleared from January onwards.</p><p>  I am particularly worried about the effect of these difficulties on certain students.  One often encounters cases of students who start a certain degree course only to discover that they would prefer to change to a course that is very different from the course they are doing.  If such a student changes his or her degree course early enough in first year, he or she will not be penalised for the change.  In the current circumstances, however, some students are likely to drop out at a sufficiently late stage to be counted as having studied for a full year.  The difficulty for such students is that they will be required to pay the full-year fee the following year, which might put it beyond their ability to do a degree in future.  We do not even know what changes in this regard might be in store in next month's budget.  We need to give serious consideration to how such people might be assisted.</p><p>  I would like to call for a proper debriefing on what went wrong in this instance.  That will help us to learn from the mistakes that have been made in this case, as well as in the case of the medical cards fiasco, when we are centralising other systems in the future.  Those of us who are in opposition usually have to spend weeks highlighting these issues before they are acknowledged by the Government.  I do not want to have to do that with another fiasco of this nature.  We need to learn from what has happened on this occasion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400051#ZZ00800"><p>Last night, we heard the Minister apologise to the country for this "fiasco", as Deputy Murphy has called it.  I wonder why he cannot accept that the centralisation of services of this nature is simply wrong and that the Government made a mistake when it centralised this service.  This service should be provided locally so applicants can interact with those providing the service.  The key problem in the case of SUSI is that there is no way for candidates and their parents to interact with the service itself.  When one contacts SUSI, one cannot get past the receptionist to speak to someone else.  This service should be provided at local county council or VEC offices, where applicants can speak to those providing the service.  Unfortunately, this Government, like its predecessor, has bought into a culture and an ethos which believes that centralisation is the best thing to do and big is always best.  Big is not always best, however.  It is certainly not best in the case of services of this nature.  It is the wrong option.  We should revert to the provision of these services at local level, even if it costs a little more.</p><p>  One of the arguments for this system was that it would cost €5 million less than the old system.  That was when it was not intended to provide the resources required, but now additional staff have to be brought on board to provide the service.  I remind the House that we are talking about first-year applicants only.  Students in the second, third and subsequent years of their courses are still being looked after at local level.  This is a service that should be provided locally.  Students who have called to my constituency office have told me they are no longer in a position to use IT services and cannot be registered permanently.  I know of older students on back to education schemes who have been told by their local social welfare offices that their payments will be cut off if they do not register permanently.  It is time to acknowledge that these services should be provided and properly resourced at local level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400051#ZZ00900"><p>I agree with Deputy Healy that this effort to achieve further centralisation has proved to be a step too far.  This new organisation does not have the experience to deal with these challenges and, clearly, is not able to cope with 66,000 applications, at least for now.  I am not saying this is the fault of the staff in question, as it is clear that the Government should have put a bit more thought into the matter.  I am sure every other Deputy in the House has, like me, been contacted by plenty of people who are worried sick about their kids who are caught in a predicament while they wait for answers and for funds to enable them to stay in college.</p><p>  The father of a second-year psychiatric nursing student in Waterford Institute of Technology contacted me because he is worried that it looks like his son will have to pack in the course.  When I examined the history of his application, I found the timescale involved a bit boggling.  He applied for his SUSI grant in June 2012.  He got acknowledgment of the receipt of the application five or six weeks later.  There was no word after that until 10 October last, when SUSI contacted him to look for his results for first year and his acceptance letter for second year.  He sent that information back two days later.  Almost four weeks passed before he got acknowledgment of the receipt of those details on 8 November last.</p><p>  It is clear that there is a massive problem in this regard.  The Government should give serious consideration to the possibility of engaging local authority staff throughout the country, who have the expertise and experience to deal with these issues, to help SUSI to deal with the backlog.  In the meantime, it must be possible to arrange some sort of short-term emergency funding to keep these kids in college.  It is an absolute disaster for them.  One has to pay for good service, like everything else in life, and if one does not, one will suffer the consequences.</p></speech>

Having worked as a guidance counsellor and as a teacher, I have experience of the previous system, which involved a multiplicity of agencies.  I have to say the local authority in my case - Dublin City Council - was very helpful.  No student ever came back to me in September or October to say his or her grant had not gone through.  When we try to introduce reform, there is always a danger that we will throw out what is good and positive as well as what is not needed.  I think that is what has happened here.  I appreciate that people in the education sector had called for the establishment of a centralised system.  I think too much was taken on initially.  The whole-country aspect of it has proved to be a disaster.  A regional approach might have been much better.</p><p>  Some of my friends who are guidance counsellors have told me that when this system started in May, they knew it was going to be a disaster.  The promotional CD that was sent to them at that stage was very complicated.  Their attempts to contact SUSI proved fruitless.  Representatives of SUSI also declined an invitation to attend a guidance counsellors' exhibition, where there could have been more engagement on this matter.  While I accept that extra staff are needed, they should have been deployed before now to avert this crisis rather than being brought in to deal with it at this stage.  I know how difficult it is to get forms back from students, but I suggest that the inordinate number of students who were unable to send back these forms is indicative of something wrong with the system.  It is too complex.</p><p>  I would like to make a brief point on special needs assistants, who help with classroom mechanics and ensure students with special needs do not pose a danger to themselves or others due to their physical or psychological conditions.  I think the system needs to be examined because I think many special needs assistants can do more.  This form of assistance needs to be considered in conjunction with the whole area of learning support and learning resources.</p><p>  The third aspect of the original motion relates to third level fees.  One of the reasons for the introduction of the current system was that the Government of the time wanted to increase the third-level participation rate of lower socioeconomic groups.  The system has to be examined because that did not happen.  The registration fee is now being increased by stealth.  I do not think that should be on the cards.  A lack of money should not preclude anybody from going to third level education.</p><p>Those are the three aspects I wanted to raise.</p></speech>

I want to focus in particular on the SUSI online system for grant applications.  I raised this matter as a Topical Issue three weeks ago when I saw the problems emerging and when Members began to be contacted.  As I said at that stage, while the leaving certificate means June is a huge month for students, August and September are even more traumatic in many ways because students must first get their results, then get their offer of college places, then go to the various towns and cities to their third level institutions to look for accommodation and then make their grant applications and wait for the results.  In other words, they have a lot to be doing besides having to cope with trying to find lost documents and the kind of thing that has happened.  In the middle of all of this, they are trying to check on the progress of their applications and are left hanging on telephones without getting replies and so on.</p><p>  In the short term, the first point is to recognise there are major difficulties with the roll-out of the system.  To be fair, the Minister and SUSI acknowledged that a number of weeks ago and in particular at the meeting of the Oireachtas committee yesterday.</p><p>  With regard to the suggestion that the system has totally failed at this stage, the solution is to address the problems, and they have been addressed, although I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's point that perhaps this has been reactive rather than proactive.  At the same time, I remember sitting on the education committee during the term of the last Government and appealing to Ministers to get grants out at the end of March, and some students had in fact finished their summer exams by the time they received them.  We must not forget the old system did not work that well either.  In the short term, the solution is to put in the staff and to get this sorted.  As I said, both the Minister and SUSI have acknowledged there is a problem, that mistakes have been made and that new targets need to be set.  For example, there is a target that new decisions will be made on 5,000 applications in the coming days and that, by the end of December, all students who are successful will have their grants.  That is the only thing within the control of SUSI and the Minister at this stage.  If it is achieved, well and good, even if it is reactive.</p><p>  The SUSI representatives told us yesterday about improving communications with students, including texting them and contacting them with regard to documentation that has been sought, but it is unacceptable that documentation for student appeals was lost.  When I made an inquiry about a particular student who had made an appeal, there was no record of the appeal and it had to be sent in again.</p><p>  I welcome the agreement of SUSI to take on board a suggestion I made in the House three weeks ago with regard to a tracking system similar to a passport application whereby, when a student makes an application, instead of hanging on a telephone or waiting for an e-mail reply, the student will be able to use a tracking system to see how the application is progressing.  The student should also be able to see the position with regard to the getting direct information from the CAO, the Department of Social Protection and Revenue, and the data protection position in that regard.</p><p>  What is vital is that all of the issues that have arisen this year should not happen again next year.  I also welcome the fact the Minister has requested third level institutions not to disadvantage or discriminate against students as regards libraries, the sitting of exams and the like.</p><p>  With regard to the overall education situation, it is a very difficult time but we must remember many good things have been happening in education this year, including the new junior certificate and the anti-bullying code that will be announced before the end of the year.  While it is a challenging time, the Minister has got to grips with many of the issues that landed on his desk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1041" speakername="Paul Connaughton" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400052#AAA00500"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the motion.  The introduction of any new centralised system will always have teething problems but special care must be taken when these problems can result in huge difficulties for students, many of whom are living away from home for the first time.  I am heartened to learn that a tracking mechanism is to be introduced for student grants as I believe the total lack of clarity in regard to the student grant application system was causing huge frustration for students and their parents in recent weeks.</p><p>  I have heard of many students considering dropping out of college because their parents simply cannot afford to sustain them through this torturous process, with no information as to when they could reasonably expect to have a decision.  In fact, many parents have told me of their frustration at the fact that when older children were starting college, they could at least go to a local office and speak to someone face to face about the documentation required or get answers as to when they could reasonably expect to have an answer on when the documentation would be reviewed.</p><p>  The centralised approach sought to create a more streamlined system but failed to provide for the human element of this thorny issue, or failed to take into account the very real worries of parents wondering what would happen in the event of their grant application being turned down after a number of months' rent had been paid.  The State's resources are being squeezed on every side and, in common with any household across the country, we have to spend within our means.  However, we should also consider the high cost in terms of economic, social and emotional costs when a student drops out of college because they are no longer able to finance their studies and remain unsure as to whether or not they will receive the grant.</p><p>  In recent weeks, I have met with representatives of students unions, with students and with many parents who were worried by the uncertainty of the situation in regard to their sons' and daughters' grants.  In particular, I have met with many parents who found they were spending large sums of money telephoning the student support line, money which was badly needed to support their sons and daughters in college.  The tracking system will allow people to see where they are in the queue and, while delays will always be difficult, at least people will have a better idea of when they can reasonably expect to hear back in regard to the matter.</p><p>  With just 3,000 grants awarded out of over 65,000, over 60,000 students are caught up in the current impasse.  I know more staff have been drafted into the centralised system in recent days and that is beginning bear fruit as, anecdotally, a number of students have received notice that their application has now reached the final stage of processing.  While there are problems with the system now in place in the City of Dublin VEC, it is worth remembering that, under the previous system, many students did not receive their grants until well into the new year, while the current system aims to have all grants administered by the end of this year.</p><p>  I also believe that there are many lessons to be learned from the centralisation of the student grant system.  First, in cases where people's very livelihood depends on getting the grant, greater care must be taken in the planning process for the introduction of a new system.  For example, if the SUSI system was first introduced in Leinster for 2012 to allow the system to be tested, while counties outside Leinster continued with the <i>status quo</i>, it would have shown up a number of inadequacies.  Then, in 2013, Munster could have been added to the centralised system, with Connacht and Ulster following the year after.  Such a phased introduction of a centralised system would have greatly facilitated the changeover and would have greatly reduced the number of parents and students affected by a difficult transition process.  I believe it is a lesson that can be learned from this process.</p><p>  Of course, another facet to this is the whole issue of centralisation of services.  A number of centralisation processes introduced in recent years have seen the national process centralised to a location in Dublin.  This flies in the face of our spatial strategy and we should be seeking to take the pressure off Dublin by locating more centralised processing services in regions outside the capital city, encouraging a greater balance in terms of population and enhancing the opportunity for young people from the western fringes of the country to work within commuting distance of their own homes.</p><p>  The operation of the SUSI grant system, even with the additional staff that have now been provided, must continue to be monitored to ensure parents and students are getting a service that meets their needs and one that is fair and balanced.  I know the Minister has recognised the difficulties being encountered in the SUSI system and has brought increased resources to the system, as well as greater clarity.  However, for most families, the only test of the success or otherwise of such a grant application scheme is how soon eligible students can receive the money necessary to ensure they can continue with their studies.</p></speech>

It is always good to have an opportunity to comment on yet another road sign on Fianna Fáil's road back to outright populism.  There is no doubt that the creation of SUSI has caused undue hardship for students.  There was a lack of sufficient planning and apportioning of adequate human resources to cope with the volume of applications.</p><p>That is plain for all to see.  The Minister has acknowledged the problems that have been created and has expressed his regret.  He is acting to rectify the problem.  Extra staff have been hired and targets have been set in order to process all successful applications by December.  I am confident that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, grasps the gravity of the problem and is putting in place measures to fix it.</p><p> The introduction of a single awarding body for third level grants to replace 66 awarding bodies was never going to be easy.  That said, there should have been better preparation and planning on behalf of City of Dublin VEC to ensure that it was capable of delivering the service for which it had pitched.  I raised the point directly with representatives of SUSI and City of Dublin VEC at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection yesterday afternoon.  I am confident the problem will be fixed and that SUSI will be in a much stronger position and will have learned from the current crisis.</p><p> The previous system was not fit for purpose.  All of us in this House have represented people who were let down by late and inefficient processing.  We now have a single grant-awarding body.  SUSI has got off to a shaky start, but once these problems are ironed out we will be in a much stronger position in future years.  I question Fianna Fáil's audacity in tabling a motion calling on the Government to refrain from implementing further cuts to the education budget and further increases in third level registration fees when its members are intimately aware of the scale of the economic crisis they created for this country.  It is an astounding example of opportunism, but people will see through it.  People will know it is opportunism when Fianna Fáil, the party that brought down the economy, calls for no further increases in third level registration fees.  This is despite the fact that Fianna Fáil itself increased the annual cost of attending college from €190 in 1997 to €2,000 in 2011.  People will know it is opportunism when Fianna Fáil, the party that suppressed 500 language support posts and removed 47 rural co-ordinator teaching posts in rural DEIS schools, calls for no more cuts in the education sector.  People will know it is opportunism when Fianna Fáil, the party that signed this country up to a four-year agreement to get our finances in order, call for a halt to any further cuts or tax increases in any particular sector.  The tragic reality of our situation is that cuts now need to be made and taxes need to be increased to restore our economic sovereignty.  It is left to the Government to make cuts and to introduce taxes in a manner that minimises the pain as much as possible.  The motion placed before us this evening does nothing to help this country tackle its economic difficulties; it provides no credible solutions and no credible alternatives.  As a party, Fianna Fáil made a commitment to provide credible and constructive opposition, but I see none of that reflected in the motion.</p><p> As we face into one of the toughest budgets in the history of the State, with inevitable further cuts in the education budget, we must look at areas in which changes can and should be made.  One such area that demands attention is bankers' pay and pensions.  The news last weekend that a new executive began work in the IBRC this week on a salary of €500,000 was like a dagger to the morale of the ordinary Irish citizen.  With salaries and pensions for executives still at exorbitant levels, the public are quite rightly seething with anger.  Action must be taken in this regard in the forthcoming budget.  We must take action, whether through a surcharge or a super-levy on the incomes of senior bankers and others who have retired on massive pensions.  The people of this country will not stand for further cuts in education and other front-line services unless we are seen to tackle those issues and deliver a fair budget.  The Labour Party is committed to doing that.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, is working hard to craft a fair budget for education but, unfortunately, he is distracted from that work by having to deal with the populist opportunism contained in this Fianna Fáil motion.</p></speech>

If it were not so serious I would say Fianna Fáil was trying to have a laugh with its Private Members' motion.  It is interesting to note that since Fianna Fáil has moved to the opposite side of the House it seems to have the answers to everything.  What a pity it did not have the answers when it was sitting on the Government side of the House.</p><p>  SUSI was introduced to replace the previous system under which 66 bodies around the country used to process grant applications for third level students.  In making this step forward, the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, sought expressions of interest from all of the previous grant awarding bodies to formulate the best way forward.  The merging of 66 bodies into one is no easy task and each new configuration requires time to settle and also time to evaluate.</p><p>  Delays have been experienced in the awarding of grants.  The Minister has accepted that to be the case and in a brave manner has accepted full responsibility for it.  He has stated that the SUSI system has not worked as well as he had hoped, but that is not to say it is not working at all.  Delays in students issuing grants are not a new phenomenon.  Under the previous system governed by Fianna Fáil the situation was no better, and was often worse, given that students did not receive confirmation of their grant status until well into the new year.  I have personal experience of that.  The academic year starts in September to October.  Perhaps insufficient staff were initially appointed or trained from the outset but all of the subsequent requests relating to staffing and other resource issues submitted to the Department of Education and Skills by SUSI have been granted to the extent that SUSI is now staffed to the level it has requested.</p><p>  We must look to the future.  The Minister has sought to provide confirmation to more than 30,000 students between now and Christmas that they will receive the grants to which they are entitled.  We must ensure that every student who is entitled to a grant and who has made a correct application will receive a payment before the end of the year.  Other speakers referred to the welcome tracking system.  However, the appeals process requires some work.  Appeals systems are in place for many schemes, including the medical card scheme.  One issue that adds to the difficulty of processing applications is the submission of incorrect information.  I do not say that is the cause of the delays but it can and does cause problems, as anyone who has tried to navigate the medical card system has found.</p><p>  Perhaps an interactive telephone helpline could be introduced to smooth the path of applicants.  The Minister has led the way in introducing a system that will flourish in the future.  All new systems have teething problems, but the option of speaking to a person should be considered.  I appeal to universities to take a pragmatic approach to those students who have not received their grants and to stop putting undue pressure on them.</p></speech>

However, recognition must be given to the Minister in acknowledging the problem and apologising for it.  It is to his credit that he has never shied away from admitting when something was wrong in his Department and he has always moved immediately to correct any mistake that has arisen.  I have every confidence that SUSI will perform better next year with the benefit of having learned from this year's mistakes.</p><p>  Once again, Fianna Fáil is seeking to make political hay out of the Government's attempt to deal with a mess created by it.  SUSI is a move in the right direction with respect to streamlining the grant system.  Delays were experienced in the previous system administered by VECs and county councils.  As locally elected representatives, we are aware of significant problems in all political spectrums.  The <i>Donegal Democrat </i>carried a report on 28 December 2009 complaining of such delays, with students still waiting for their first maintenance grants to arrive in December.  The article quoted a local councillor as saying at the time that &quot;the situation must be addressed to ease [the students'] difficulties&quot; and that &quot; the [then Fianna Fáil] government&#8217;s delay in confirming this year&#8217;s allocations put county council&#8217;s and VECs under 'severe pressure' to process grant applications quickly.&quot;  The then councillor said it was unacceptable that some of the applications were still outstanding and would not be paid until after Christmas.  That councillor's name was Charlie McConalogue, now Deputy McConalogue, a person for whom I have the height of respect in regard to the intention of this motion.</p></speech>

This is co-funded by Government and our European partners and acts as a lifeline for students who are most at risk of dropping out.  I appeal to the Minister of State to do everything possible within the discretion of a very challenging budget to ensure we maintain welfare services across student unions and student support systems for those students who find themselves in a distressed situation.  Between increased demand and recused funding, the payment from this fund has fallen.  I take UCD for an example.  The average payment there in 2007-08 was €750 but last year this had fallen to €400.  Many of my constituents report many difficulties.  This is a very small amount of money relative to the scale of our budget and I ask the Minister of State to keep that in mind when he speaks to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, in order to ensure that we maintain levels of welfare support for students at third level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1045" speakername="Derek Nolan" time="18:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012111400054#CCC00600"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion.  Today, approximately 500 students marched from Eyre Square in Galway to my office but unfortunately, because they had picked a sitting day, I was unable to meet them.  However, I had met them at a public meeting the previous Thursday, with my Galway colleague, Deputy Keaveney, where we discussed the issues facing the student population.  Nobody in this House denies there are acute pressures on students in the form of rent and other bills, as there are pressures on families struggling under the current economic crisis and recession.  The student protest was welcome because students need to be politically active and to engage in the political process.  As a student I did the same thing so I encourage them to continue protesting, something I view as positive.</p><p>  The ideal situation would be that which pertained just before I went to college, when there were no fees and a grant system.  That system was slowly eroded over the years.  Even in my time in university, from 2000 to 2005, the fees increased dramatically, doubling every year during my undergraduate years.  This Government came into office at a time when pressures on public finances were enormous.  Promises were made and commitments given in the course of the campaign which the Minister has acknowledged he regrets making.  Knowing the man, I believe he made these promises in good faith, believing he could implement them.  However, when he looked at his budget after coming into office and the decisions he had to make, he had to pick priorities.  There were the issues of SNAs and resource teachers and primary school class sizes which are all very sensitive.  Sometimes one must commend a person who breaks a promise to protect something larger, over a person who keeps a promise at a cost to even more vulnerable groups of people.  That is not easy to explain to people.  However, a right decision is a right decision and over time people will see that it was done for the betterment of society as a whole.</p><p>  The student movement is a very important one.  It should broaden its campaigning agenda, however, because the issues facing students nowadays are not only the costs of third level education but solidarity with their peers who are not in third level courses.  There are issues of youth unemployment, emigration and the need for a new deal for young people.  If it does not address such issues, the student movement is being neither fair nor true to its own origins and to the greater struggles for which it campaigned in the past.</p><p>  In my view, the Minister is doing his best amid undoubted challenges.  I commend the student movement for the role it has taken in this issue and for its advocacy on behalf of its constituent group.  I ask students for a broader debate and to engage in the greater discussions and the greater crisis in which this country is involved.  I certainly wish them well, and wish all students well in their third level education.</p></speech>

It is a driver of social mobility.</p><p>  Each year we are educating more children with less money.  I have enormous respect for the thousands of teachers, lecturers and assistants who work to educate our children.  Parents throughout the country are dedicated to providing a better life for children.  Most hope for this and work hard to ensure their children will have a better life than they had.  It is up to this Government to work with them towards securing their children's future by fixing the budgetary mess that was left behind for us.  We recognise there are problems with SUSI.  Last night the Minister apologised and I welcome the manner in which he spoke.  He recognised the difficulties in getting it to work.  Having worked with the City of Dublin VEC for many years, I know Jacinta Stewart and her staff will move heaven and earth to fix these problems and provide students with their grants.  If there is anything I can do I will assist them.  There were similar issues around the centralisation process for medical cards.  The system adapted and changed and the problems were fixed.  I hope and believe this is the last time we will see these problems with SUSI.</p><p>  This country is in the grip of a very great economic crisis.  This year we are borrowing almost €14 billion more than we raised in taxes in order to maintain services.  The Opposition fails to recognise the radical reforms that are taking place in education even given the need to reduce expenditure in the coming budget by at least €70 million.  The Government is committed to maintaining the number of special needs assistants and is spending €1.3 billion per year on special needs education.  There is a countrywide schools building programme that will ensure students of the future will have the classrooms they need.  There is investment in local jobs and communities.  When I was a councillor we used to look into fields where classrooms had been promised.  Now, during the biggest economic recession, this Government is starting to provide the classrooms needed for the next generation.  That is what planning means.</p><p>  We are overhauling the junior certificate to make it fit for purpose for the 21st century, something that has been talked about for decades.  We are rolling out high-speed broadband in schools throughout the country, connecting pupils to the world.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, is committed to improving literacy and numeracy skills, the building blocks of any education system.  As an urban Deputy I have seen those factors ignored in many underprivileged areas.  People did not have an opportunity to have a proper second level education, never mind getting inside the precious gates of universities, which I believe to be their right.</p><p>  Deputy Nolan referred to the USI campaign.  As a Deputy who has been targeted by it, I welcome the campaign.  I hope it broadens out further so we can fight the battle for everybody to have access to education.  I have spoken to many students who came to see me.  The vast majority have spoken about a vision for education in the future.  They have a broader vision that goes beyond the current problem, and I have come away wiser.  However, I must tell them the truth.  I tell them registration fees will increase by €250 each year until 2015, when they will reach €3,000.  I tell them I will work to try to maintain that limit because there is a need for certainty.  I tell them we are committed to ensuring that more than 40% of students will qualify for a maintenance grant and will not pay registration fees.  I tell them our current budget deficit is 8.5% of GDP, which means that we are borrowing almost €14 million more than tax revenue in order to fund day-to-day expenditure.  Every extra euro we borrow is money they and their children will have to pay in national debt.  I tell them my priority is to ensure that the maximum amount of resources are targeted at primary and second level schools, which I have seen ignored for decades in my community.  I have seen young children beginning their secondary education with no literacy skills.  Too many students from disadvantaged backgrounds in my community fall behind in all the early stages and never have the opportunity to reach third level education. This is where I want to see the scarce resources targeted.</p><p>  It is better to be honest and up-front about the difficult decisions we must take as a party in order to restore our country's fortune during a time of deep economic recession.  Deputy McConalogue moved this motion in good faith.  There are many good young Fianna Fáil Deputies with a clear vision for the future.</p></speech>

During my long years in politics, the payment of higher education grants has always given rise to many issues.  The first relates to the fact that people are obliged to supply so much detailed information with their application forms.  It is easier to deal with the applications process at local level than by means of a new centralised system.  There are, however, ways to proceed, to which I will return.</p><p>  The other issue which arises is that of duplication.  There certainly was duplication under the old scheme.  In Galway, for example, one could be obliged to deal with the county council and County Galway VEC.  If applications went to the wrong body, delays would result.  I accept that there was a need to rationalise the system.  However, the Minister and his Department should have made better preparations for the change to a centralised unit.  The Department had plenty of time to make such preparations.  Like previous speakers, I wish to offer the example of the changes made to the system for the allocation of medical cards.  In that instance, the relevant Department decided to introduce the scheme for those over 70 years of age before centralising the entire application system for medical cards.  As a result, there was a phased introduction.  The system to which I refer is not perfect, but I was glad to hear many colleagues - even those on the Government side - state there should also have been a phased introduction of the system for the awarding of student grants.  Perhaps it should have been introduced in Dublin and the rest of Leinster before being rolled out to other parts of the country.  The new system seems to have been introduced in a very confusing way.</p><p>  When the centralised applications unit for medical cards was established, many smallholders in my county were of the view that they should continue to do what they did previously, namely, provide details of livestock and herd tests for their local welfare officers.  However, this was not acceptable to the centralised applications unit.  The same issue arises in respect of the detailed information which must be submitted to SUSI.  We must ask whether it is possible to use new technology to transmit all the relevant information to a single unit.  I hope this proves to be the case.  I am concerned that when the new water services body and its centralised unit are established, similar problems will arise.</p><p>  As previous speakers indicated, the position on adjacent and non-adjacent grants has given rise to confusion.  In view of the number of applications returned to those who made them because they were incomplete, it will not be possible for the Government to honour its commitment that the processing of student grants will be completed by the end of the year.  Students will be obliged to resubmit their applications and will have to wait until after Christmas and into the new year for their grants.  I do not believe such students should be placed at a disadvantage in attending lectures and accessing library and other on-campus facilities.</p><p>  Last Saturday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> contained an article about students facing late fee penalties.  I have heard no response to this claim from the Government.  It is welcome, however, that the Higher Education Authority contacted universities and institutes of technology about this matter on students' behalf.  Third level institutions should ensure student grant applications are dealt with and that individuals will continue to have access to student services until their grants are paid.  The Minister thought that the new system would ensure students would receive information more quickly, but that has not proved to be the case.</p><p>  Third level students are waiting for their grants.  Huge numbers of applications are being classed as incomplete and students have been requested to provide further documentation.  I saw a report on television last night in which a student indicated that he had applied for a higher education grant five months ago and that he had yet to receive a response.  Students cannot wait any longer.  If delays arose in issuing grants under the old system, students would still receive approval letters from their local authorities.  As a result, they could register fully with the third level institutions they were attending.  Let us consider coming up with a way to fund the third level sector without placing a burden on students.  I understand third level fees are going to increase by &#8364;1,000 by 2015 and that a capital asset test will be introduced next year.  That test will make it more difficult for farming families and the self-employed to qualify for student support.  I am very much opposed to the increases to which I refer.  I am concerned about the fact that SUSI does not have sufficient staff to allow it to deal with the applications submitted to it.  Students will be obliged to drop out of college, which will be a disappointing development.</p><p>  There are two issues on which I wish to make a brief comment.  I would not like there to be further cutbacks in the part of the education budget relating to special needs assistants, SNAs.  Children with autism and special educational needs require the services of their SNAs.  Career guidance is an integral part of the school curriculum and the decision to remove the specific allocation for guidance counsellors from second level schools was heartless.  This decision affected 1,000 guidance counsellors in 700 schools and impacted on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged students.  I hope the Minister will reverse the decision to which I refer and reinstate the ex-quota allocation of guidance counsellors.</p></speech>

When my party raised this serious issue which relates to what is happening within the grant awarding body, SUSI, on Thursday morning last, the Tánaiste dismissed our concerns.  If they were honest, every Member of the House would state he or she has been inundated with queries from families clearly under the limit relating to grant aid in respect of the paperwork to be submitted to SUSI.  The families to which I refer find the process completely frustrating.  There is also another group of individuals who have not yet been contacted and consequently do not know where they stand.</p><p>  A raft of issues arise in respect of this matter.  I refer to student grants, access to third level education, encouraging individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds to pursue higher education courses and ensuring people are able to obtain the grants for which they qualify in the shortest possible period.  However, there is a particular issue to which I wish to refer and it relates to project maths.  The Minister should learn from the disaster that was his introduction of project maths on a phased basis.  Many of those from the education sector who have approached me about this matter have indicated that the main beneficiaries of the introduction of project maths were book publishers.  It has taken years for the new syllabus to be fully introduced and students have been obliged to buy new books each year.  These books are unsuitable to be passed down to siblings or sold second hand.  Maths teachers throughout the country have shelves of books on the new project maths course.  They have not been given adequate in-service training or sufficient information on project maths and were not consulted on its implementation.</p><p>  Do people know that the teachers to whom I refer are unaware of the format that next year's leaving certificate maths paper will take?  Do they know that the students who will sit the leaving certificate examination next June have not yet received sample copies of the examination paper from the State Examinations Commission?  Even if that paper was issued today, it would be one month before the publishers interpreted it and produced sample examination booklets for students.  Are the Minister and the Government aware of this problem?  Teachers have not been provided with the sample paper, the format the examination will take or a breakdown of the marking scheme.  Effectively, they are working in the dark and the Minister is concentrating his energies on dreaming up phased changes to the junior certificate programme.  Again, these changes were launched without the major partners in education being consulted.</p><p>Are teachers not important enough to be consulted?  Is their opinion and their contribution to such a change not necessary?  It is very unfair to introduce such a large charge without consulting one of the most important partners in the education sector.  Will the Minister immediately inform leaving certificate students as to the format and the marking scheme for next year's leaving certificate maths examination?  We are facing into the third week in November.  The students are studying for their important examination next June at the end of a two-year course but the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills have not given the format of the examination.  It shows a lack of awareness on the part of the Government.  The same lack of awareness was apparent last week with regard to the student grants issue and there is now a sudden realisation on its part.  It is important that the mistakes made with regard to this process and the awarding of grants are not being made in other sectors of education.  Grandiose notions must be changed to action.  There must be fairness and proper procedures.  At this late stage it should not be beyond the Minister to inform those preparing for the leaving certificate as to the format of the examination in June 2013.</p></speech>

Many students with applications for grants pending with the new body, SUSI, are experiencing serious difficulties.  SUSI has taken over the processing of student grants from 66 different authorities.</p><p>  When the new system was introduced the Minister said it would be quick and easy.  It is clear it has turned out to be neither quick nor easy.  Only 18,000 applications have been processed to date.  This leaves in the region of 50,000 still awaiting processing.</p><p>  We are all realistic enough to know that new public bodies will have teething problems, in particular, a move from administration by the local VEC structures to a more centralised system will result in problems.  Hence the importance at the planning stage to have ensured there would be sufficient staff, indeed additional to sufficient staff, to deal with problem cases expeditiously and to avoid a backlog of applications.</p><p>  Many students are at college today and they are unsure as to when the grant money will arrive.  They or their parents have been forced to borrow in order to tide them over until they are given an indicative position on their grant application.  The danger is that the whole educational process will be delayed.  I refer in particular to the settling-in period which new students in third level colleges must undergo.  It can become disconcerting and there is a danger that such students may drop out of their courses.</p><p>  The Minister made very extravagant promises about the student grants scheme before the last election.  These promises were far too extravagant for the circumstances of the time.  I am sure he has had plenty of time to reflect on his promises.  I do not know whether he regrets what happened at that time.  Many students believed that their man was now in Marlborough House and that he would look after their interests.  This has not transpired.</p><p>  There are significant difficulties with the new system which require action now.  Given the quite catastrophic position that obtains with the processing of applications, there must be a case to be made for the establishment on a transitional basis of an advisory office structure in each third level college around the country.  Students encountering problems with compiling and providing the details required for a grant application could be helped in these offices by means of a face-to-face meeting from an official of the new agency.  Students or their parents could discuss the application, identify any deficits in information and be given a reasonable timescale to provide the information.  This transitional arrangement might be of assistance in overcoming the serious backlog.  The hope that all applications will be processed and the system will be fully functioning by Christmas is unsatisfactory for students, for parents and for the system.  We need emergency measures now.</p></speech>

Níl a fhios agam céard atá á dhéanamh ag comhghleacaithe an Aire Stáit sa Rialtas nach féidir leo córas riaracháin a rith.  Tógann sé bliain ar an Aire Coimirce Sóisialaí, an Teachta Burton, carer's allowance a cheadú agus ní féidir leis an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna, an Teachta Ruairí Quinn, córas a chur i bhfeidhm leis na deontais a cheadú le haghaidh mic léinn triú leibhéal.</p><p>  Tá rud i mo chloigeann ag rá go bhfuil ceann de dhá rud i gceist, iomlán mí-éifeacht agus daoine i mbun chúraim riaracháin nach bhfuil in ann an jab a dhéanamh.  Nó b'fhéidir go bhfuil siad níos glice ná sin.  B'fhéidir gur é an rud atá i gceist acu ná an caiteachas a bhí le titim i mbliana a chur siar go dtí an chéad bhliain eile.  Mar a deir siad i mBéarla, táthar ag ciceáil an canna síos an bóthar.  Is ceann den dá rud sin atá i gceist, agus tá sé in am a rá linn cé acu - mionrachas nó mí-éifeacht.  Is náire é seo do dhaoine a gcaithfidh fanacht ar a gcearta.  Nuair a bhí na hAirí atá anois mar Airí sa bhFreasúra, b'iad ba thúisce a bhí ar a gcosa ar an taobh seo den Teach ag fiafraí cén fáth nach raibh rudaí níos fearr.</p><p>  It seems that the Minister of State's Labour colleagues are either completely inefficient or perhaps they are very clever.  It could be that with these manufactured delays in process is pushing the money down into next year in order to keep the budgets right.  It takes a year to get a carer's allowance and people are stacked in a queue.  The officials in the Department of Social Protection used to remind me that relatively speaking, very few people get supplementary welfare allowance while they are waiting in the queue.  By pushing people into a long queue, the pay date is put off.  It will inevitably catch up on the Government unless it keeps making the queue longer.  However, this policy buys a bit of time.  Either they are completely inefficient and are unable to run a Department or they might be a bit clever by trying to hide the fact that they do not have money.  They may be trying to push the money onwards because the State works on a cash paid basis, not on an accrual basis.  They are trying to keep the Estimates right for the troika and put the expenditure into the following year.  One way or the other, it will catch up with them.  The people waiting for the Labour Minister for Social Protection or for the Labour Minister for Education and Skills, those who badly need money and who need to know so they can tell the colleges that they are eligible for a grant and should not be charged a registration fee, need answers.</p><p>  The situation with regard to SUSI is ludicrous.  The amount of information sought for the most obvious of questions is ridiculous.  I cite the case of a farmer with a seven hectare farm - a small Connemara farm.  It was known from the beginning that SUSI would require farm accounts.</p><p>The individual had made a profit of €132.  I accept the authorities must ensure one is not making a profit by writing off depreciation on tractors, for example, because this does not comprise an eligible expense.  We sent the authorities a little profit and loss account that showed that the total income on the farm in question was €3,000, that the individuals concerned were in receipt of means-tested social welfare, and that all the expenses related to the purchase of materials such as fertiliser and fencing wire, which comprise the normal day-to-day purchases on a farm.  Despite this, the authorities wrote back looking for a balance sheet.  It was obvious that the farmer could not have been presenting depreciation as an expense in the accounts.  The authorities wanted a profit and loss account for a second time and a lot of other information on the farm although it was clear that the farmer did not have any farm machinery and that the only asset was the land itself.  This is mindless bureaucracy.  The same applies in the case of medical cards.  Mindless bureaucracy is totally ridiculous when the answers to the questions asked are obvious.</p><p> In fairness to the local authorities and VECs, when they were handling applications they did not ask for an additional heap of paper when the answer to a question was obvious.  In most cases, they asked for information only when one rang them to ask why a grant was not sanctioned.  What I have described is an utter administrative mess.  It is vital that people have their grants sanctioned immediately and that the Minister scrap the absolutely ridiculous mechanism for doing the job.  He should not be dealing with people who have not a clue about the realities of life and return to a system in which applications are processed near to applicants' locations.  Thus, the staff would have some idea about the realities of people's lives.</p><p> The Government promised so much.  Unless my more malign theory is correct, the Government is totally inefficient.  The theory is that the Government is delaying everything on purpose so the balance at the end of the year will come right.  The Minister needs to tell us what he will do next year to ensure grants are sanctioned quickly.</p><p> The Minister has many highfalutin ideas.  One of the great ones was to stop the support for people proceeding to fourth level education.  In a country in which we have said time and again that we need workers with the highest qualifications, the Minister has imposed an income limit of €27,000 in respect of fourth level education support.  Thus, students whose parents earn gross salaries of €32,000 or €33,000 will receive no support in fourth level education.  Many working families can no longer afford to give their children the opportunity to obtain Masters degrees and doctorates, which are so important in the high-tech economy we are trying to build.</p><p> I do not have to stress what the Minister is doing for rural areas.  He is closing the small schools which are getting fantastic results and in which 70% of children proceed to third level education.  In addition to taking people's incomes, the Minister proposes to count the value of their assets when determining eligibility for the third level grant.  Most people who inherit farms and small businesses never regard them as tradeable assets.  They regard the assets as assets to be held in trust for the next generation but it seems the Minister wants people to have to sell land to send their children to college.</p><p> If the Minister believes this measure will not affect considerable numbers of people in urban areas, he is incorrect.  It will affect them because large numbers of people in urban areas own second properties whose values are lower than the mortgage values.  If the Minister starts to assess asset values, he will find out that many working families will not be eligible for a third level grant.</p><p> The Minister signed a pledge to reverse the increase in the registration charge.  He will not apologise even though it was he who was exaggerating, before the election, the scale of the challenges we face.  On the other hand, he was promising what could not be delivered.</p><p> Is náireach an mhaise don Rialtas é.  Tá sé in am ag an Rialtas a bhfuil ag dul go dhaoine óga na tíre, agus dá dtuismitheoirí, a íoc amach.  Muna bhfuil siad in ann an córas riaracháin a stiúrú agus muna bhfuil na hAirí as Páirtí an Lucht Oibre in ann a gcuid Ranna Stáit a stiúrú agus córas éifeachtach riaracháin a chur ar bun iontu tá sé in am acu éirí as na postanna sin agus ligint do dhaoine eile dul isteach, daoine as a bpáirtithe a bhéadh in ann córas riaracháin a riarú.</p></speech>

Earlier this year - in June I believe - the Minister announced with great fanfare that SUSI had gone live.  He was pictured in every national newspaper and on television and he contended SUSI would solve all the problems arising from having 66 grant-awarding authorities.  He stated their problems would be a thing of the past.  If we are honest, we must accept that SUSI was never going to solve the problems given that there are only 65 staff in Dublin to deal with 66,000 applications.  There was no way the 65 staff could deal with so many applications and award the grants without delay.</p><p>  There are many staff with considerable experience in the local authorities and VECs that used to allocate grants.  They dealt with grant applications for years and they should be seconded into the SUSI system within the next week to deal with the backlog.  They sometimes wonder what their role is now that there is no grant system in their areas.  Surely their vast experience should be drawn upon.  I suggest the Minister of State and Minister consider using the staff to help out in what has become a farcical set of circumstances.</p><p> There is a very good article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>written by John Logue, president of the Union of Students in Ireland.  It is not a political article but one outlining the facts with regard to the difficulties faced by students in not getting their grant approvals.  They find they are unable to avail of many of the facilities within the college because they do not have a letter of approval.  In the past, when the VECs and councils dealt with this issue, they would get the letter of approval to the student and the student could go to the credit union or bank and use it to acquire finance, but as John Logue pointed out in his article, that cannot happen now because they are not getting the letters from SUSI.</p><p> The Minister made great play last night about the fact that he had contacted all of the universities to tell them they were not to kick out the students, so to speak, but to be lenient.  However, when I spoke to some members of the management of colleges in Waterford and Carlow, they said they needed the money to survive.  It is important that the grants be paid as quickly as possible.</p><p> The Minister said the SUSI system would be foolproof and would eliminate the issue of incomplete applications, but we are being told now that SUSI has a large number of incomplete applications.  I have come across many cases in which students are being told by SUSI that despite the fact that it has evidence that their applications were received, the applications have been mislaid and they are being asked to reapply.</p><p> The Minister might indicate in his reply how the appeals system will work.  A huge number of appeals have been submitted to the Department.  They have been put to one side because SUSI is trying to deal with the current applications, and it appears the appeals will not be dealt with until way into the new year.  That will cause great hardship for students and their families and, if we are to be honest, we know it will lead to a situation in which many students will drop out because they do not have the finances to remain in the absence of approval from SUSI.</p><p> The Minister should second the people in the VECs and local authorities who have experience in this area to SUSI.  I am sure they would be only too glad to come to Dublin and help out for three or four weeks to deal with the backlog.</p></speech>

It is important to reiterate that whatever delays have arisen, the decision to centralise the processing of student grants was and remains a solid decision.  Maintaining a system of 66 separate grant-awarding bodies in the face of rising demand was not sustainable, and I am confident the creation of SUSI will serve us well in future years.</p><p>  We have had many genuine and heartfelt contributions across the House on this issue over the past two evenings, including the contribution from Deputy McConalogue last night, but the contribution earlier by Deputy Ó Cuív, who is rapidly becoming the primary purveyor of conspiracy theories in this House, suggesting that somehow the Minister or SUSI has deliberately delayed payment of grants to students, is so deluded it does not bear any further comment.</p><p>  I acknowledge the issues that have arisen in the past two evenings and I welcome the apology made by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, last night to students and their parents for the distress that has been caused.  It was refreshing to hear a Minister speak honestly about his role and responsibilities.  It was equally refreshing to hear a Minister not attempt to abdicate responsibility and lay the blame at the door of others, a practice that was all too common in past Administrations.</p></speech>

No new staffing request was received today.  In total, there are now 96 staff working in SUSI and they are supported by 79 other staff working on document processing and queries from students.  This is a combination of core and temporary staff who have been hired to help work through the delays that have arisen.  SUSI is now staffed to the level requested.  We expect it to get on with the job it has been asked to do and to ensure that all students receive their grants as soon as possible.  It is now time for all those involved in SUSI to focus on delivery and to make sure that by Christmas the target of 33,000 grant applications has been met.</p></speech>

In its short 18 months in existence the Government has already established a strong track record in education, from protecting SNA and resource teacher numbers to ensuring that more than 40% of students remain exempt from the student contribution and substantially increasing the number of training places available for the unemployed.

A new national literacy and numeracy strategy was launched in 2011 to raise educational standards in primary and second level schools, and €6 million is being spent on the roll-out of that strategy this year.  The recommendations of the forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary sector are being implemented to bring about greater parental choice within our education system.  The junior cycle is to be overhauled, with a new school-based approach to assessment starting for students entering post-primary education in 2014.  A national anti-bullying forum was held for the first time in May, and an action plan on bullying will be published by the end of the year - coincidentally, this is a matter that was under discussion in the Seanad this evening.</p><p>  We have also announced for the first time ever a transparent and honest five-year building programme for the school capital programme.  We are reforming the VEC sector by creating 16 new education and training boards; that legislation is currently before the Dáil.  I have been overseeing the creation of SOLAS, a new further education and training agency which will give this sector a clear direction and a new vision for the future.  Early this year we announced a ground-breaking ICT action plan that will see the ICT sector and my Department working hand-in-glove to address skills gaps in this sector to ensure that Ireland remains at the forefront of the technology industry worldwide, and work is under way to re-examine the entire higher education landscape.  In just 18 months, therefore, the Government, despite the serious economic challenges we are facing, has built a firm foundation for what I believe will be one of the most ambitious educational reform agendas undertaken by any Government.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Charlie McConalogue for bringing this motion to the House.  I pay tribute also to Deputy Joanna Tuffy who, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, ensured, along with Deputy McConalogue, that SUSI executives were brought to account yesterday afternoon.</p><p>  I agree with the Minister of State that the apology from the Minister, Deputy Quinn, is welcome.  However, the difficulty we have is that the Government amendment displays the same arrogance that blinded it to the problems of SUSI right up until yesterday when the SUSI representatives appeared at the committee and before Deputy McConalogue's motion came before the House.  It must not be forgotten that last Thursday the Tánaiste sat where the Minister of State is sitting now and more or less said there was no problem, that it would be fine and that all the money would be paid out.  The Government has now realised, after some sort of conversion over the weekend, the full extent of the problem.</p><p>  The problem has not gone away despite the Minister's apology.  The Minister of State has confirmed on the record of the Dáil that 33,000 people will receive their grants by the end of December.  If he is not sure about that, I ask him to clarify it now.  Unfortunately, there are 66,000 applications.  What about the other 33,000 students who have to submit information?  They are still in college and they want to know if they can return after the Christmas break.  They will need library access, but we still do not know their position.  If one is unlucky enough not to be on the pile that is dealt with before SUSI goes on its Christmas holidays, when will one's case be dealt with?</p><p>This is the problem with this issue and that is why Fianna Fáil will not go away on it.  We will continue to ensure SUSI, Student Universal Support Ireland, and its Government parent are held to account for the lack of delivery in the system.</p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, must ask why we are here again.  At the same time as SUSI was being planned and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, was doing up his press statements, we were debating in this House the debacle of the centralisation of the medical card system.  The same issues applied in that case such as not enough staff, too much information required, information being lost and not enough communication with stakeholders in the system.  At the same time as these problems were apparent in the medical card system, the Department of Education and Skills was planning the roll-out of SUSI.  Surely, someone in the Department must have thought the same could happen to SUSI.  Did anyone in the Department get out of their glasshouse and think to talk to officials in the Department of Health?  Surely the Minister of State, knowing from his constituency work dealing with medical card applications, must have thought about putting a similar problem happening with the SUSI roll-out on the table at a ministerial management meeting.  Surely, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who is a little bit more isolated from reality than those of us serving constituencies, would have thought the same.  However, they did not think to put this question.  It is not purely their fault.  Those departmental officials hiding behind the Ministers and SUSI need to be held to account as well for once again rolling out and implementing a flawed system as a result of which citizens of this Republic are tonight suffering.  Once again, the faceless officials who run Government get away with it while the politicians and the delivery agencies are hung out to dry.  If the Government does anything at all, it can at least put a stop to that.</p><p> The Minister of State claimed SUSI has all the staff it needs.  It cannot if there are still 33,000 applications for which we do not have a target deadline for their completion.  If SUSI is telling the Minister of State it has all the staff it needs, then that assumes he is comfortable in accepting there will be further delays in the system and people will have to wait until February, March or April to get their grant.  If only Labour Members bothered to come into the Chamber for a debate on education - I cannot blame them for not coming in because there is nowhere to hide their blushes - I could quote them section 6.3.1(<i>i</i>) of the Croke Park agreement which states &#8220;it will be necessary from time to time to increase staffing in certain designated priority areas in accordance with government policy&#8221;.  It continues, &#8220;redeployment of staff/posts may be necessary for temporary or long-term needs on foot of changing business patterns or priorities or to respond to urgent work demands.&#8221;  What is more urgent than giving assurance to 33,000 applicants that they have a future in third level education after Christmas?  The Minister cannot seriously tell us SUSI and Abtran, the company which only came into the equation yesterday and the Minister never told us about, are happy with their staffing levels but they cannot give us a deadline for when the entire grant applications for first-year students will be paid.</p><p> The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, accused Deputy Ó Cuív of conspiracy theories.  Deputy Browne and I attended a meeting in Wexford last night where the theory that the Government is deliberately delaying the paying out of grants was floated by a retired senior civil servant.  If the Minister is serious about disproving the conspiracy theory, he should put the staff in the agencies to deal with those stuck in the quagmire of the grants system.  It is not fair on the staff in SUSI.  They are trying their best to engage with people affected but there is not enough of them nor is sufficient backup being given to them.</p><p> The one good point these 66,000 applicants having going for them is that they are the last class to have had proper guidance provision in school.  I noted when the Minister was stating all his accomplishments, he did not mention that one.  He did, however, mention the work his Department is doing on bullying in schools.  Great work and great talk.  When one takes the guidance counsellor who will deal with bullying out of the schools, as will happen next year, then all it will be is talk.  Future SUSI applicants will be at a disadvantage because they will not benefit from guidance on third level applications and careers thanks to the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and their colleagues in Fine Gael and Labour.  There is no sense in the Minister of State talking about combating bullying, building up technology skills and career progression when the guidance counsellor, the engine for seeing all of this through, has been removed from schools because of Government cuts.  Will the Government please reflect on this when it is making its forthcoming budget choices?  As the Minister of State with responsibility for skills, Deputy Cannon must be aware the most of what the lack of proper guidance in our schools will do to our skills base.  We are already having difficulty matching up skills to industry requirements.  The Minister of State cannot make it worse by cutting off guidance counsellors.</p><p> Earlier I listened to a normally sensible Labour Deputy - I do not know what got into him tonight - talking about Fianna Fáil using this debate as its revision to populism.  All I can see is the Minister, Deputy Quinn, climbing a ladder outside Trinity College Dublin with his little biro to put his name under a Union of Students in Ireland, USI, pledge not to reintroduce fees.  This was the man who put himself forward as the economic guru of Labour, who understood the nation&#8217;s problems and would be a potential Minister for Finance after the last election.  He understood the gravity of the challenge Fianna Fáil faced but he put his name to a pledge and told the USI he would be with them in their corner.  He was no sooner in the door in the Department than he wished he had an eraser to rub his name off that pledge.  That is the difficulty even with his apology last night.  It is welcome.  However, if one is to put a bet on a horse called Ruairí Quinn, one does not look at his track record if one wants to win.</p><p> The Minister of State must solve this issue.  He cannot leave this Chamber tonight in the comfort of abandoning 33,000 student applicants.  If he is serious, he will solve it.  He must give us a deadline on when this backlog will be cleared for which we can hold SUSI and the Government to account.</p></speech>

I must also acknowledge the efforts of Deputy O’Brien and the chairman of the education committee, Deputy Tuffy, for bringing SUSI before the committee to get to the bottom of this matter.  This is what the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and his political team and Ministers of State should have been doing a long time ago.  I commend those student unions working with the many students in distress as a result of this crisis created by the Government’s inaction and inattention.  Many of them have been in contact with me and other Deputies seeking a resolution to this problem.  I welcome many of them to the Visitors Gallery tonight.  I also commend my colleagues in Ógra Fianna Fáil on bringing this matter to my attention.</p><p>  I welcome the humble approach taken by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in the Chamber last night when he apologised for the financial distress many students find themselves in as a result of these delays in processing their grants.  I also welcome him taking responsibility for this issue.</p><p>Unfortunately, that has been the case on too many occasions in the past and it is the case again with this Government.  We saw an example of it last week involving the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, with regard to the children's referendum whereby there was a refusal to take political responsibility.  Nothing drives the public as mad as people not taking responsibility for things they should be doing.  It was only right for the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to have taken responsibility for this issue and for the crisis that has been created.  It was created due to his inaction and his refusal to get involved or take control.  He should have done so weeks ago before this became the crisis it is now whereby only 3,000 students of the 66,000 who have applied are in receipt of their grant.</p><p> Yesterday on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, commented that he was not entirely sure why there was a backlog.  That was yesterday morning.  Last night in the Dáil after he made his apology to me he stated: &quot;I will be having a conversation with SUSI and, on foot of this Legislature stating publicly and democratically that we have a problem, I will ask officials whether they need additional resources.&quot;  Last night the Minister, Deputy Quinn, said that because the Dáil told him there was a problem he would talk to Student Universal Support Ireland.  However, had he listened to students and other Deputies he would have started discussions with SUSI weeks ago.  Deputy O'Mahony, who contributed to the debate earlier, raised the matter as a topical issue three weeks ago.  I raised it as a topical issue along with Deputy Nolan as well.  Had the Minister been listening rather than hiding from his responsibility to monitor what was going on we would not have found ourselves in the quandary we are in today, nor would the many students throughout the country who are struggling to continue to keep themselves in college as we come up to Christmas.  I put it to the Minister that he should have intervened before now.  He replied across the floor of the Dáil that, &quot;There was no reason for me to intervene&quot;.  That was his response.  He then went on to tell the House that he expected 33,000 students to have their grants confirmed before Christmas.  He used the word &quot;confirmed&quot;.  I asked him whether he could guarantee that.  His response in the Dáil last night was, &quot;I would love to say that I am satisfied but I cannot do so because I do not know&quot;.</p><p> It is only right that he apologised for the debacle up to this point.  Unfortunately, taking responsibility is not simply about been man enough to take responsibility or the blame for where we are.  It is also about taking responsibility for sorting out the problem.  It was obvious from the Minister's contribution last night that he has not yet taken responsibility.  It is obvious from the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, that this is still the case.  The Minister of State has made a fresh commitment that 33,000 will be paid as opposed to the Minister's commitment last night that 33,000 would be confirmed.  It is obvious that the Government has not yet taken control of this problem.  As a result, no one can assure the students here tonight and throughout Ireland that they will get their grant before Christmas.  It is clear from this debacle that many will be waiting to be paid their grant until well after Christmas.</p><p> The Minister should take responsibility to deliver a solution rather than simply take the responsibility of the blame.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, along with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the other Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Sherlock, make up the team in the Department.  They should sit down with SUSI and work out what is required to ensure that the students who depend on the assistance of the State to stay in college get it quickly and before Christmas.</p><p> The way the Government has gone about this will ensure the crisis will continue.  It is simply not good enough.  I hope the Minister of State will take away the message given tonight by all Deputies in the House and by many in the Gallery that this must be resolved.  The Minister of State should take that message and find a solution such that the students of Ireland are paid their grants and can stay in college.  They should be relieved of the financial desperation that many are experiencing as a result of the ineptitude of the Government up to now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.459" nospeaker="true" time="20:05:00" ><p>Question again put: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2012-11-14a.460" nospeaker="true" time="20:05:00" ><p>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin: This is important legislation and a significant updating of the regulatory regime for the health insurance sector in this State.  The Bill continues the necessary system of community rating which ensures that all consumers are charged the same premium for a particular plan regardless of age, gender or health status, thus preventing price discrimination against those more likely to require medical treatment.  The Bill amends Section 1A of the 1994 Health Insurance Act by making the provision for community rating more specific, extending the cost subsidy currently between the young and the old to include the more healthy and the less healthy.  

  As long as we have the type of health insurance market and the type of health funding that exists in this State, the regulatory regime provided for in the Bill will be necessary.  It involves a complex system of risk equalisation to support the community rating principle.  This entails the transfer of compensation from insurers who carry lighter risk burdens to those who carry heavier risk burdens.  All this requires regulation, monitoring, enforcement and penalties.</p></speech>

The system requires regulation, monitoring, enforcement and penalties for infringement as provided for in the Bill.  Without legislation, the unregulated market would discriminate against the old, the sick and any other group or individual insurance companies decide are a greater risk.  The Bill is, therefore, supposed to provide protection against the working out of the raw profit motive in the health insurance sector.  It is supposed to be based on solidarity between generations and the healthy and the sick.  That is welcome in so far as it goes, but we in Sinn Féin would go much further and extend the principle of solidarity to the way we fund, organise, structure and manage the entire health care system.  I will return to this point in due course.</p><p>  The Bill is before us at a critical time for the health insurance sector and in the midst of a crisis for the health care system.  There has been a massive decline in the number of people with private health insurance.  In 2008 there were 2.3 million people with private health insurance, but that figure has decreased to 2.1 million in 2012.  Over 60,000 people have dispensed with private health insurance in the last year alone.  Meanwhile, the cost of premiums is rising.  People who have dispensed with insurance because they can no longer afford it are now dependent on a public health system which is under attack from the Government's failed austerity strategy.  The State continues to heavily subsidise the private for profit health system with private beds in public hospitals, a fast track to treatment for private patients, while public waiting lists grow with the dual working of hospital consultants in the public and private sectors.</p><p>  The Government's proposed solution is to move to an entirely health insurance based system of funding, managing and delivering health care.  It is important to note that the health insurance policies of both Fine Gael and the Labour Party were conceived at the height of the Celtic tiger when record numbers had private health insurance.  Perhaps it appeared to these parties that the ready-made solution for the State was to extend health insurance cover to everyone, while subsidising those who could not afford it.  During and after the general election of 2011, Fine Gael and the Labour Party managed to paper over the differences in their respective models of universal health insurance.  It is now clear, however, that the Fine Gael approach won out in the programme for Government and, subsequently, in the stewardship of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  In the now famous Dáil speech last September the then Minister of State, Deputy Róiin Shortall, who resigned a few days later, asked a number of pertinent questions, while failing to express confidence in the Minister.  She asked: <blockquote>Are we going to reform and strengthen our public health services, or privatise large parts of it?  How do we ensure equity and access in the health service?  What model of universal health insurance best suits the situation here in Ireland?  Should it be a commercial insurance model or a social insurance model?</blockquote>If one reads Fine Gael's FairCare policy, it is obvious that it favours privatisation and the commercial insurance model.  It states with what I can only describe as overblown confidence that once universal health insurance is introduced &quot;the insurance market will double in size.  This will attract new entrants, increasing competition and driving down costs&quot;.  This is a pure market approach which treats health care as a commodity and believes consumers will benefit from competition.  However, the Bill highlights a contradiction in the approach.  The Bill is based on the recognition that there has to be social solidarity in the insurance sector.  The market has to be regulated to prevent price discrimination against the old and the sick.  There cannot be normal commercial competition because otherwise we would have a US-style law of the jungle where the young and the fit would benefit from cut price health insurance, while the old and the ill would be fleeced or driven out altogether. </p><p>  Given that the principle of social solidarity is recognised, why not extend it across the entire health care system?  If one takes that concept of solidarity to its logical conclusion, one moves to a system of universal provision of health care based on need rather than ability to pay.  The question arises of how one pays for such a system.  Contrary to the frequent assertions of the Minister, we in Sinn Féin recognise that health care is hugely expensive and has to be paid for.  The question is how to pay for it in a way that ensures the best possible health care for all who need it with the best achievable value for money.  The Government is proposing to bring forward universal health insurance, with the State subsidising those who cannot afford to pay insurance premiums.  Given that the State will still have a huge regulatory, managerial and funding role, why would it give private for profit insurance companies such a central place in the system?  What contribution will they make?  They are funded by the consumers who buy their products.  The insurance companies, on behalf of policyholders, will buy services from private or public hospitals or other service providers and will have to make a substantial profit in the process.  Why not cut out that profit for the privateers and keep the money in the health system and the pockets of citizens?  The only possible reason for not keeping out the profiteers is commercial.  In opting for the privatised insurance model, albeit including a slimmed down VHI in the mix, the Government is putting business before health.  For citizens, the bottom line is that when they need health care, they need it promptly and they need the best care possible.  That is why Sinn Féin advocates universal health care based on equal access for all.  We want it to be State provided, funded from fair general taxation and free at the point of delivery.  This would involve a higher contribution in tax from the highest earners than they contribute at present.  How could this be wrong?</p><p>  We do not favour the model of insurance based funding for the reasons I have outlined.</p><p>If health insurance is to be the basis for funding, then it should be a State insurance scheme.  The Labour Party once claimed to be in favour of this, but its former policy has been suppressed in favour of that of Fine Gael in the authorship of the programme for Government and in the outworking of that over the period since.  As far as Sinn Féin is concerned, the least desirable model is an insurance system based on competing private health insurance companies.  In that case, the profit motive and the interests of shareholders become paramount, rather than public health.  This is the Fine Gael model and it won out in the programme for Government.</p><p> On 8 November, the trade union IMPACT published an important paper, entitled The Future of Healthcare in Ireland.  I commend it to the Minister of State if she has not already read it.  It says of the Government's plans:<blockquote> The Government model of competing private sector insurers has not been properly tested.  Delays in its implementation suggest that Government plans for UHI have been poorly thought out.  If implemented, the model is unlikely to deliver equity, value for money, quality or universal access.  Quite the opposite: lessons from the Netherlands show that a profit-driven commercial model led to an inequitable and inefficient system of funding, different tiers of entitlement, rising hospital deficits and even bankrupt hospitals.</blockquote>That is a very different view of the Dutch system compared to the glowing reviews of Fine Gael.  The IMPACT paper recommends examination of what it calls a single payer social insurance model along the lines of those in France, Germany and the Nordic countries.  It states, quite rightly, that the &quot;competing insurers&quot; model should not be adopted, at least and until all the options have been evaluated in terms of equity, quality, access to services and value for money.  I appeal to the Labour Party Minister of State and her colleagues to be the brake on this runaway proposal with which the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is most comfortable.</p><p> At present, we have decreasing numbers of people with health insurance, rising premiums for those who have insurance, more pressure on the public health system from those coming off insurance and the persistence of the two-tier public-private system, with the struggling public system subsidising the private system.  We have calculated, based on figures from Government, that if the Government applied the full cost of private beds in public hospitals, it would save &#8364;432.5 million - a sum that could then be spent in the public system reducing waiting times and overcrowding in our hospitals and on improving services.  We must ask what is the real prospect of change under this Government, particularly if the Labour Party allows Fine Gael run away with the ball.</p><p> Already, the promised extension of free GP care has been postponed.  The programme for Government promised a White Paper on financing universal health insurance early in the Government's first term.  The Department of Health's recent briefing for the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children stated the White Paper will be published &quot;as early as possible within the Government's term of office&quot;.  We are still waiting.  Going the insurance route is a mistake.  It offers the increasingly remote prospect of reform, while the deeply flawed current two-tier system deteriorates, especially as a result of the austerity policy and health cuts of this Government that are undermining the public health system.  We have ample evidence of this the length and breadth of the country.</p><p> This Bill is a necessary measure for the insurance sector as it stands and we will, accordingly, accommodate its passage.  However, overall the future of health insurance and of the health system generally under this Government is fraught with uncertainty.  I urge the Minister of State and her colleagues in the Labour Party to utilise their special place in the coalition to bring real consideration to the alternatives that have been documented by many voices, not only domestically but internationally, and to recognise there is international experience of the model being proposed, including that of the host country from which the idea has been borrowed.  That experience is far from the picture painted by the Minister and other voices here over the past 18 months.  It is time for a reappraisal.</p></speech>

The Bill raises fundamental, serious and significant issues for the health services of this country.  What type of health service do we want?  What type of health service have we got?  Do we want to follow the private health care model?  Do we want to privatise facilities?  Do we want to have the health care system driven by health insurers?  How do we fund the health care system?  How do we pay for the system?  Are the budgets provided for the system adequate?  Should we continue to maintain the two-tier system we have currently?</p><p>  In my view, the provision of health services here should be on the basis of equal and timely access, based on medical need.  Services should be free at the point of use and should be funded through general taxation.  One of the fundamental problems with the health service here is the model we use and the manner in which the system is funded.  This has resulted in a system in crisis.  It is worth examining the current situation and what the austerity measures and cutbacks in health services have meant for the service and for those who require it, such as patients requiring hospital services and patients requiring community based services.</p><p>  What is the vision for the future of health services here? </p><p>As the Minister and a Fianna Fáil speaker said earlier, a person with private insurance who is in a private hospital or a private bed in a public hospital receives what is known as the Rolls-Royce treatment.  Such a person gets every examination, regardless of whether it is necessary or appropriate, so that the health insurers can make a commercial benefit - a profit, in other words - from his or her hospital stay or health care service.  However, it is evident in places like the United States that when the system is dominated by health insurance companies, they will do the exact opposite and start to tell medical people, consultants and hospitals what services to provide.  At that stage, it will be a question of reducing the various services and examinations that might be needed.  We will go from one extreme to the other.</p><p> Our current two-tier system, which has not worked, can be described only as a system in crisis.  It is important to paint a brief picture of a system that is simply not working by referring to the number of people on trolleys in hospital corridors throughout the country.  According to today's figures, a total of 287 people are on trolleys, including 25 at Beaumont Hospital; 14 at Connolly Hospital; 28 at St. Vincent's University Hospital; 12 at Cavan General Hospital; 28 at Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick; 30 at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda; ten at South Tipperary General Hospital; seven at Waterford Regional Hospital; 11 at Mercy University Hospital, Cork; and 13 at Cork University Hospital.  Similarly, figures that were issued yesterday indicate the budgetary difficulties that are being experienced in our hospitals.  The extent of the trolley problem is a feature of hospitals throughout the country.  It is not something that can be attributed to particular difficulties in one or two hospitals.  It is a systems problem throughout the country.</p><p> The budgetary problem in hospitals throughout the country is also a systems problem.  It is not a question of rogue management or inexperienced management in one or two hospitals.  Every hospital in the country has a significant over-run.  I will give some of the figures.  Budgets have been exceeded by more than €2 million at Waterford Regional Hospital; €2.5 million at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; €3.1 million at Wexford General Hospital; €3.2 million at South Tipperary General Hospital; €12.3 million at Cork University Hospital; €790,000 at Mallow General Hospital; €2.5 million at Kerry General Hospital; €2.4 million at Mercy University Hospital, Cork; €7.4 million at Sligo General Hospital; €8.05 million at Letterkenny General Hospital; €6.4 million at Mayo General Hospital; €1.3 million at St. John's Hospital, Limerick; €19.1 million at Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick; €6.7 million at Portiuncula Hospital; and €23 million at the Galway hospital group.  On and on it goes throughout the country.  As I have said, these difficulties indicate that there is a systems-based crisis.  It is not something that can be solved by dealing with one, two or three hospitals.  It is clear that this country's health services are significantly under-funded.  These chronic difficulties need to be addressed urgently and immediately on the basis of the public funding of a public health system.</p><p> The question of waiting lists is another issue that indicates this is a systems problem.  The difficulty relates to how we provide the system.  There is no vision of how the system should be provided.  It is clear that outpatient waiting lists are absolutely huge at present.  Approximately 385,000 people are on outpatient waiting lists.  That represents an increase of 20,000 on last month.  More than 115,000 people have been waiting for more than 12 months for appointments.  Some 185,000 people have been waiting for longer than six months.  Approximately 11,000 patients have been on waiting lists for more than four years.  This crisis has been driven by a lack of vision.  The State has failed to deal with this difficulty by providing a public system that is free at the point of use and based on medical need.  The problem is that our two-tier system does not provide for access to services on the basis of medical need.  Under the system that is in place, medical services can be bought, in effect, and private medicine takes precedence over medical need in many cases.</p><p> The funding of the system is a core issue.  I believe we should have a public system that is funded by the State.  I know it will be said that it is not possible to provide for such a system in the current circumstances.  As I have said previously, where there is a will there is a way.  A small but significant number of people in this country - approximately 5% of the population - are very wealthy and have significant assets and income.  They have increased their assets and their income over the course of this recession.  It is clear from CSO figures - they are not my figures - that the assets of the 5% of people who are very wealthy increased by €46 billion in the 2009-10 period.  That pattern has continued since then.  The same CSO figures have also shown that the people in question have increased their incomes by 4% or 5% at a time when the rest of the population has experienced an average income reduction of approximately 18%.  I believe these people have significant leeway to pay a wealth tax.  The figures show that the total assets of the 5% of people in question are worth approximately €239 billion.</p><p> A modest wealth tax would bring in significant income that could be used to ensure our health services are properly funded.  I know it will be said that this cannot be done without driving the people in question out of the country.  The fact of the matter is that wealth taxes are accepted as a form of taxation in many European countries and many states of the United States.  Such a system was introduced in this country by a previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.  If the system introduced by the former Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan, was in place today at a modest rate, significant moneys would be available to fund a public health system in this country.  </p></speech>
