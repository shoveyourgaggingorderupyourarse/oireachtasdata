    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200003#A00400"><p>Parents will be very much starting to worry about how they will pay for the next school year.  It is always an enormous expense of several hundred euro and often more than &euro;1,000 for families that have multiple children in school, for books, uniforms and voluntary contributions.  We are in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis that families are grappling with, so what will the Minister do to make the return to school as affordable as possible for families?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200003#A00500"><p>A range of measures are in place to reduce back-to-school costs and also to help families with these costs.  The Department published a circular in 2017 which sets out principles of cost-effective practice to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of returning to school.  Under these measures, schools are required to select school uniforms that are generic and can be purchased from an array of retailers and only iron-on or sew-on crests should be used.  The circular also sets out that schools should consult with parents on their views and suggestions on cost-reduction initiatives for school uniforms.</p>  <p>  The Department also supports schools to help reduce the cost of schoolbooks.  Schools are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books.  Under the book-rental scheme, the Department provided funding of &euro;17.2 million in 2021 to schools.  Some 96% of primary schools and 69% of post-primary schools operate a book-rental scheme for parents.  Additional funding of &euro;1 million was provided under budget 2020 to provide free books in delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, primary schools on a pilot basis.  Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per pupil.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per pupil enrolled in the school.  This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the real cost of school, which states that &euro;85 is the average cost of schoolbooks at primary-school level.  This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020-21 school year.  This funding has continued for the 2021-22 school year.</p>  <p>  The aim of this pilot is to provide free schoolbooks for students in the schools involved and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of schoolbooks for parents.  It will continue to run for the 2021-22 school year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation.  It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I recently announced the expansion of the DEIS programme benefitting 347 schools.  Some 310 schools will be included in DEIS for the first time and 37 existing DEIS primary schools are being reclassified and will be eligible for increased supports.  Schools in the DEIS programme are provided with additional financial support by way of a DEIS grant and an enhanced schoolbook grant rate.</p>  <p>  I also understand the need for improved capitation funding to schools for running costs and I am pleased that budgets 2020 and 2019 provided for increases in standard capitation funding for primary schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200003#A00600"><p>People across the State are doing all they can to keep up with sky-high bills and runaway price increases.  The cost-of-living crisis is not new and it has been going on in education for some time.  The idea that we have a free education system at primary- and post-primary levels is a myth.  The Department of Education is one of the only Departments that has not put forward any serious proposals in recent months to tackle increasing costs within its portfolio.</p>  <p>  I am not blown away by the Minister's answer.  She instanced a five-year old circular, two pilot programmes and the expansion of DEIS, which is welcome but, ultimately, the vast bulk of families are not going to see any reduction in the multi-hundred euro bills and neither are they going to see any reduction in the bills of more than &euro;1,000.</p>  <p>  There is a programme for Government commitment to reducing the high cost of education and in particular to provide free schoolbooks.  We are two years into the Government's term and, aside from the pilot programme the Minister referred to in a small number of schools, there is no progress towards free schoolbooks.  Is this something the Government is going to deliver?  How is it going to deliver it and when is it going to happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200003#A00700"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire needs to take a more holistic view of the various measures we have in schools.  For example, as I already referenced, significant funding has gone into DEIS.  We have more schools than ever in DEIS, following the single biggest increase in the DEIS profile for schools, costing to the tune of &euro;18 million this year and increasing to &euro;32 million in 2023.</p>  <p>  In addition, specifically in terms of measures of late, in recognition of the pressure facing families, this year the Government reduced the cost of school transport, which will come on stream for this school year.  The cap on school transport fees that currently stands at &euro;220 for families at primary level and &euro;650 for families at post-primary level will be reduced to &euro;150 for a family at primary level and to &euro;500 per family at post-primary level.  Furthermore, in recognition of cost-of-living expenses, all examination fees have been voided this year, so there is no cost to families in that regard.  That is in addition to the suite of measures that have been introduced by the Government across various sectors such as the fuel allowance and the electricity credit payment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200003#A00800"><p>The Minister said I must take a more holistic view.  I very much welcome the expansion in DEIS.  While I would have appreciated more engagement at the time, I very much welcomed it.  It is very beneficial, but it is focused on tackling disadvantage and ensuring that every student has the same opportunity to progress.  It is not focused on reducing costs, which affect every family across the State.  The costs are enormous.  I want to come back to the point about schoolbooks.  It must be the loneliest sentence in the entire programme for Government in that it is often talked about, but no action is taken on it.  Not for the first time, the Minister has neglected to answer the question.  Is that something she is going to do?  When is she going to do it, and how is she going to do it?  It has been done in many other jurisdictions.  It is the case in the North and in many European jurisdictions.  People who arrive here are often amazed that they have to fork out for the significant cost of books.  Is the Minister going to do it?  When is she going to do it, and how is she going to do it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200003#A00900"><p>I reiterate that the book scheme was extended and the pilot programme has run for two years.  We have given a commitment that we will review the programme and look at the potential going forward for it to be either continued or extended.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is aware, that is a budget consideration.  It is important that we allow the pilot to complete and for it to be fully reviewed.  He would accept that is best practice in regard to any model.</p>  <p>  Equally so, it is important to acknowledge that under the book-rental scheme, more than &euro;17.2 million has been expended by the Department of Education to ensure that families have access to books.  Some 96% of primary schools and 69% of post-primary schools are availing of the book-rental scheme.  Notwithstanding that, in recognition of the opportunity to do something more with books, going forward, when the pilot scheme concludes it will be reviewed and appropriate action will be taken then.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200003#A01200"><p>It is mid-May and the special needs assistant, SNA, allocations have yet to be published.  SNAs across the country speak regularly about the lack of respect shown to them by the Department of Education.  It is hard not to agree with them when it comes to the middle of May and the allocations for next September are not available.  They must plan for their own lives and planning is required for the young people they work with, as well as their schools.  Everything is still up in the air in the absence of the publication of the allocations.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200003#A01300"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for raising this important matter.  Suffice to say that the timeline for SNA allocations is always May.  Work is ongoing at present on the SNA allocations and they will be announced this month, as promised.  There will be no deviation from that, and certainty will be given to SNAs and schools in terms of their re-allocation.</p>  <p>  We are specifically talking about the front-loading allocation.  The Deputy will be aware that it was delayed as a result of Covid, and it was put back again to the 2022-23 school year.  It will be in operation from September of this year.  It will be a very positive development for schools and for SNAs.  The Deputy says the Department has not given them much respect.  The lives of SNAs will improve dramatically over the years to come.  Even at present, when we look at the SNA training programme in UCD, for example, which was the first ever training programme, it is a ten-month programme encompassing five different modules.</p> <p>Approximately 3,500 students are availing of it and the outcomes have been positive.  We will examine what we can do for those SNAs in the future.  By the end of this year, we will have 19,169 SNAs, an increase of 81% since 2011.  This year, in the budget an additional 1,165 SNAs will be allocated to schools.  Some 574 of those will be in special classes, 46 will be in special schools and 545 will be in mainstream schools.  SNAs are critical to the lives of children in schools, whether in mainstream special class or special school.</p></speech>

When I tabled this question last week I assumed the allocations would have been published by the time we discussed it.  I do not need to know how many SNAs there are or how good a job they do.  I need to know when the allocations will be published by the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department so SNAs, schools and families can plan for September.  It is not good enough to tell me the allocations are always made in May because it is not good enough that they are made in May.  The Minister of State is telling me they will be made by the end of the month but second level schools effectively close up at the end of the month.  Can the Minister of State give me a definitive date for when these allocations will be published?  Can she give a commitment that the allocations will not be made in May next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200004#B00300"><p>As I stated in my first contribution, we indicated that the SNA allocation would take place in May, as it always does.  That is the timeline for allocations and it is done on the basis of ongoing collaboration with our education partners and everybody else.  The SNA allocation will be announced by 31 May.  It is important to consider the front-loading model when we are talking about the profile of schools because schools are front-loaded with resources.  The allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child will receive a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school or even where new pupils are enrolling in the school.  There are many benefits of this approach.  It is also intended to ensure that the SNA posts will be in schools and available to students immediately on their arrival.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200004#B00400"><p>I do not think the Minister of State is hearing what I am saying.  It is not good enough to say the allocation is always made in May.  SNAs are telling me it is not good enough and that the same thing happens every year.  They cannot plan for September.  They are the last group of school workers who are ever thought of.  This year, the staff schedule came out in April whereas it has come out in February in previous years.  It is not good enough to tell the House this always happens in May and sure that is the way it is.  Nor is it good enough to say it is going to happen by the end of this month.  I would like to hear some level of regret in the Minister of State&rsquo;s voice.  SNAs waiting for this allocation to come out cannot plan for September because they do now know what their personal situation will be, or what will be the circumstances of the young person or child they will be working with or those of the school, school principal and school community.</p>  <p>  Can we work towards a scenario where the allocations will not be made in May next year?  Can the Minister of State give a date on which the allocations will be released?  If an SNA feels disrespected by the Department, he or she will continue to feel disrespected if this happens every single year and the Minister of State shows no ambition to change the position for next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200004#B00500"><p>The Deputy needs to be aware that this decision is not solely for me, as Minister of State with responsibility for special education, or the Minister for Education to take.  There are a lot of moving parts when making a decision of this nature.  We have stated previously that the allocation will be made in May.  That gives certainty to schools as they know an announcement will be made on the allocation for September and they can plan for that.</p>  <p>  When the front-loading model is implemented it will improve job security for SNAs in schools because it will ensure greater certainty for SNAs in relation to their employment status as the school allocation of SNA support will not be based on an annual application process.  That is important.  It would enable a school to allocate SNA support to a pupil who does not have a formal diagnosed special educational need but needs support.  We also have to accept that many students with special educational needs in the mainstream do not have significant care needs.  They are supported through the special education teacher, or SET, allocation.  Notwithstanding all of that, it is important that there is clarity for schools.  That will be provided this month, as promised.</p></speech>

Eight weeks and more is an incredibly long time for children who are autistic or have profound intellectual disabilities or other special needs not to have any contact with education.  That is why the programme is so crucial.  Very often, parents find that the programme does not last long enough or that they are unable to find a tutor or school-based programme.

It is very much looked forward to by children with additional needs and their families.  We are encouraging as many schools as we can to participate this year in the summer provision programme.  As the Deputy will know, all 4,000 schools are eligible to participate.</p>  <p>  Last year, we established a review of the summer provision programme, which fed into the consultative forum.  This dictated some of the new measures we have introduced this year to try to make participation in the programme more streamlined for schools.  We have provided funding for a programme overseer, which should assist, and have helped with preparation time and faster payments for staff.  We want to ease the administrative burden on schools and give them greater guidance materials on the programme content.  We have also allowed the schools flexibility regarding when they can run the programme.  It is at their discretion to decide whether it will run in July - it used to be known as July provision - or in August.  That gives the schools some autonomy over their calendar. </p>  <p>  Schools can also recruit staff final-year students who are graduating this summer, undergraduates or newly-qualified teachers.  There is a centralised application process to reduce the administrative burden, which was a key concern raised last year.  I am satisfied this will go a long way towards making the programme more attractive for schools to participate in.  The Teaching Council and the Irish Primary Principals Network will promote the summer programmes as well.</p>  <p>  Last year, we provided &euro;40 million for the summer provision programme, which was double the funding from the previous year.  We have matched that sum again this year.  Approximately 48,000 young persons participated in the scheme last year and we are hopeful that a significantly higher number will participate this year.</p></speech>

Some of the measures outlined will indeed assist.  Last year, a significant number of schools contacted me about delays in providing details of the summer provision programme, which prevented them from being able to provide the programme to students.  The timeframe meant they did not have time to prepare and organise summer provision.  I wrote to the Minister of State in March urging her to release details of this year's programme as soon as possible because I was concerned that history would repeat itself.  While nothing can done for this year, I urge the Minister of State to take seriously the matter being raised by schools and ensure the programme is advertised as early as possible next year.</p>  <p>  I welcome the measures that have been taken.  Have they been widely publicised and promoted to schools?  We need to be as creative as possible to incentivise the greatest uptake possible.  Has the Minister of State engaged with the trade unions and school management bodies about other forms of incentives?  These could include expanding the hours available under home tuition and addressing the issues of late pay, additional leave and low levels of pay for SNAs.  Has the Minister of State engaged with the unions and management bodies about ideas such as those?</p></speech>

The findings from last year indicated primarily that the programme was very beneficial and successful.  We wanted to build on that to inform this year's summer provision.  Schools can have as many pupils as they have capacity for.  The guidance materials went to schools after engagement with management bodies and unions that they should prioritise those students with the most complex needs.</p> <p>As the Deputy knows, staff get an extra week's pay, which is a doubling of their salaries.  One of the most important things about this is it is not about location; it is about the level of the child's need.  We have seen an increase of 64% in special schools and special classes availing of this programme between 2019 and 2021.</p></speech>

I urge the Minister to look at that because SNAs are very often crucial in providing the programme.  A significant issue raised each year is that of the late payment of staff who volunteer their time to facilitate summer provision.  This comes in the context of many schools and staff feeling very burnt out and feeling that the past two years have been very challenging.  If we are asking teachers and SNAs to take up this programme, and I hope many will because it is vitally important, we need to ensure their goodwill is responded to.  Last year, the Minister made a big deal about earlier payment of staff, but staff and teachers who were waiting for payment for work done in July still contacted me in November and December.  The administrative hurdles some had to jump through were extremely stressful.  I hope the online payment system will address those issues, but will the Minister make a firm commitment that staff will be paid by September at the latest?</p></speech>

Most were paid by 28 October, while 76% were paid by 11 November and those in the bands by 25 November.  As the Deputy mentioned, this year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payment details for those staff taking part in the school-based summer programme.  We hope this will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.  When they get paid will depend on when they submit their claims but, as there is this new online claims system, if they get the claims in as soon as possible we are working to pay them as they are received.  As the process is streamlined and online, it will be faster than last year.  There are also enhanced payments for special schools and special classes in order to get them more involved.</p></speech>

The Department of Education continues to work closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to give best effect to the commitment in the programme for Government to develop inclusive and age appropriate relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex, LGBTI+, relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary.  The work of the NCCA draws on its report on the review of relationships and sexuality education in primary and post-primary schools, which was published in 2019.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware from the Second Stage debate of the Private Members&rsquo; Bill tabled by him, arising from recommendations in that report the NCCA has been following a two-track approach on this work.  First, the NCCA has a focus on developing support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the online guidance toolkit.  The toolkits will support teachers in their engagement with the current SPHE-RSE curriculum in a confident and holistic manner and in a comprehensive way that meets the needs of young people today.  Separate toolkits, which are being used by schools, are available for the primary, junior cycle and senior cycle curriculum areas.  In tandem with this work, the NCCA is progressing the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum, with an initial focus on junior cycle.  A draft revised junior cycle specification is due to be agreed at the NCCA council in advance of the summer, with a public consultation to follow.  The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022 and rolled out in 2023 and will be followed by revised specifications for senior cycle and primary.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, I have recently announced the Department's intention to provide funding for a new postgraduate programme to upskill registered post-primary teachers teaching SPHE and RSE.  In the course of the programme, it is intended that each participant will be provided with high-quality content knowledge and will be empowered to become an effective and enthusiastic teacher of SPHE-RSE.  The Department has recently engaged with higher education institutions and it is hoped that a number of them will be interested in designing and developing this programme.</p>  <p>  I am keen to allow the NCCA time to complete its development work in this important and sensitive area.  This is why, as the Deputy is aware, on Second Stage of the Bill on 16 November, the Government tabled a timed amendment that the motion be read in nine months&rsquo; time.  My Department continues to engage closely with the NCCA to assist completion of this work.</p></speech>

I am very conscious that all the great work that has been done in respect of the online resources, and the work of the NCCA that started several years ago at this point, will be rendered somewhat meaningless if there is not a standardisation across all publicly funded schools that means they will have to enact particular programmes.  The situation we have at present involves a scenario where schools, depending on the management organisation, the board of management and the ethos, simply do not have to employ particular criteria in the teaching of RSE because it is not standardised.  My Bill sought to do exactly that, namely, to standardise the teaching of it.</p>  <p>  My specific question is whether we will have the motion in nine months' time.  We brought it in in November and nine months will be completed in August.  Will we see it in July or September or has it just been taken off the table to an undefined point in the future?</p></speech>

I also acknowledge we have made significant progress in progressing this.  As I have articulated, I can point to the fact that specifications for junior cycle are due to be published very shortly, followed by public consultation, which has marked this process.  At the same time, preparation has begun for senior cycle and we are also looking at the revision at primary level.  It is equally important to say that all children and young people have a right to access correct and factual information.  That is an absolute given.  Equally, as part of my intention to advance this, we are doing all that we can to ensure teachers will be properly trained in all areas so there will be what the Deputy called continuity across all schools.  I am rolling out the upskilling programme for teachers, which is covered through funding by the Department.  As I said, there is an absolute commitment to allowing the work of the NCCA to progress and to read the Bill again in nine months' time.</p></speech>

She also mentioned the potential for legislative changes in her initial response.  She has said this several times.  I note she said this to the press a year ago following the announcement of the Flourish programme, she said it during the contribution in November at the second reading of our Bill and she has just mentioned it.  What legislative changes does she anticipate may have to be made in order to standardise this?  Is it something we can expect in the legislative programme before the end of the year, for example?  I am very conscious that all this good work is somewhat meaningless if there is no standardised approach across schools.  Some schools can say they will initiate the rights of the child to access this information as set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and some schools may simply say they will not do that, and if students want that information they should go home to their parents who may be able to give it to them.  It requires legislative changes.  Does the Minister agree with that?  When can we anticipate seeing them?  If it will not be in nine months, will we see those changes this year?</p></speech>

All schools must follow it and all students are entitled to the full and factual information as presented by our curriculum.  In anticipation of that, we have very clearly set out the process to ensure our curricula are as current, up to date and appropriate as is necessary and possible.  The work is ongoing, which I appreciate the Deputy referenced.  While the work is being completed in updating and reviewing the present curriculum, we have ensured we are putting in place a variety of supports for our schools that can be drawn down by our school staff.  We are now putting a postgraduate programme in place, the cost of which will be covered by the Department, that will be open to our schools to ensure our staff are fully trained.  As I said, there is an absolute commitment to advance this in as timely a manner as we possibly can.</p> <p>We have made significant progress.  I am committed to ensuring that is completed.</p></speech>

One of the key demands they are making now relates to respect and their qualification criteria.  The request is not big or excessive.  It is that there would be an independent review to examine the minimum essential qualifications of SNAs.  Will the Minister of State commit to such a review and the implementation of its recommendations?</p></reply>

It advised that there should be adequate and comprehensive training for SNAs.  I mentioned this earlier to Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  The first SNA course was established in UCD and five different modules were offered over ten months.  Some 3,500 people have already availed of the programme.</p>  <p>  The review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs, including in respect of their training needs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at level 5 of the national qualifications framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  That is what we did.  The programme is fully funded by the Department and was delivered at no cost to SNAs.  As it is the first programme, it is appropriate to take time to review the outcomes that will inform any future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs.  That will include accreditation.</p>  <p>  Raising the minimum qualification for appointment as a special needs assistant has been raised by the F&oacute;rsa trade union and the matter has been referred to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  The Department is engaging in that process.</p>  <p>  The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualification has in any way impacted on the calibre of appointments.  People with experience or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.  That said, the Department is open to reviewing its position.  It has also agreed to review the SNA contract.  It  was agreed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement.  Once the review of the SNA contract has been carried out and implemented, we can look at everything else.</p></speech>

I am trying to imagine an alternative discussion.  Imagine the UCD course did not exist.  We might figure out exactly what we are asking SNAs to do before we design a course.  The course is very beneficial.  There were difficulties with accreditation and we had many debates about that but that is not fundamentally the issue.  The existence of the course is all very well but the place to start should have been the criteria.  I fully agree that there has been no impact in the quality but some of this is about special needs assistants' sense of their role and its future.  As we continue to expand the number of SNAs, we need to ask what shape that role will take.  To try to include this issue with public sector pay talks just rolls it on much further and puts the cart before the course.  We need an independent review in advance of that to inform those talks.</p></speech>

It is important to stress that the review process for the SNA contract will begin in the next two weeks.  That is my understanding.  That will be helpful for progress.  The Department has agreed to review the contract as part of Building Momentum.  It is of the view that the forthcoming review should be carried out and implemented before the minimum qualifications for SNAs are discussed at the WRC.  The fact the contract review will take place in the next two weeks indicates progress.  It is important that SNAs feel they are valued and respected.  Their role is integral to the progress of children with additional needs in schools.</p></speech>

Let us play this forward.  The Department carries out the review and there are public sector pay talks, followed, I presume, by an agreement.  I then come back and raise the question of holding an independent review in, say, a year and I am told there was a review of the contract and it is the way it is.  The public sector pay deal lasts for four or five years and at the end of that we will have a discussion around criteria.  The contract was agreed, however, on an agreed definition of what an SNA did on the contract that was in place at the time.  As such, as I see it, the Minister of State is effectively tying SNAs into the current criteria for the next five years if she does not do this now.  The current criteria are decades old and do not reflect the essential role SNAs play, the complications involved or the expertise required for the role.  We need to address those issues now.  The Department is putting this on the long finger and could do so for years.  The pay talks should go hand in hand with a review of the criteria.  The review should not be put back.</p></speech>

The training is very important for SNAs.  It is important that we look at the outcomes and findings to enable us to inform the review which, as I have said, will take place in a couple of weeks.  The Deputy says he would like it to be done now.  There are lots of things we would like to have done yesterday but it is not always possible.  When we need to get evidence and feedback and talk to everyone involved, there are processes in place for doing so, and for very good reason.  It is to ensure the matter is looked at fairly and in a way that serves the best interests of the SNAs and, ultimately, the children with additional needs who will avail of their expertise.</p></speech>

It is anticipated that it will support up to 48,000 children with special educational needs and children at most risk of educational disadvantage.  It is on the back of the supplementary programme and the Covid learning support scheme.  We know that these children suffered significant regression during the pandemic so it is important that they get access to this programme.  In 2021, the numbers availing of the summer programme increased by 60% from the previous year and we expect them to increase again this year.</p>  <p>  It is not the case that English as an additional language for pupils has been dropped from the eligibility list for the primary inclusion programme.  All students who are eligible for the programme last year will still be eligible this year.  That includes migrant students who are availing of English as an additional language.  The summer programme for all primary schools clearly states that it offers an opportunity for schools to address the needs of migrant students such as addressing English language skills and integration.  This includes students who have recently arrived in Ireland from Ukraine.  Some of those will be very interested in doing this programme and schools have expressed the wish to take in many Ukrainian students.</p> <p>The inclusion programme is open to pupils who have complex needs, pupils who are at risk of educational disadvantage and pupils in mainstream education who are accessing the higher level of continuous support.  That would include a small number of students with enduring needs that significantly affect their capacity to learn and function independently and to participate in education.  The inclusion programme is also open to those students who require highly individualised and differentiated learning programmes that are significantly different from their peers.</p></speech>

When the summer programme was recently published in <i>The Irish Times</i>, following the Minister of State's announcement, the headline in the newspaper stated &quot;'Summer school' plan to include thousands of Ukrainian students&quot;, but the reality is they were only being allocated the places left over after the other groups of students listed in the guidance document.  Migrant students, including those recently arrived in Ireland from Ukraine, would only have an opportunity to take part in inclusion programmes or if schools themselves decide to prioritise this group, but the Department has not prioritised these students and to suggest otherwise is misleading.  In fact, it has been taken down the pecking order from last year's programme to this year's programme.  The Department has also failed to provide adequate time for school leaders to confirm they have enough teachers and SNAs available to run the school-based programme.</p></speech>

This is not about the location of where children are or their backgrounds; this is about their levels of need.  The schools have indicated they will be welcoming of Ukrainian and all migrant children and I accept their bona fides in that.  The schools will be supported to include Ukrainian children in their programmes and they are focused on supporting the individual needs of those children.  The flexibility at school level means schools can target those who they believe would most benefit from the intervention.  On languages at primary level, the evidence would suggest that supporting migrant kids is best done through activity rather than through individual language classes.  Post primary, more instruction can be given on language.  I mention the English for speakers of other languages, ESOL, panels under the 16 education and training boards, ETBs, and they will help with that.</p></speech>

Will she specify for me how schools will be supported to ensure there are enough teachers or SNAs?  How will that support manifest itself in real terms for schools that are already struggling to ensure they have enough teachers and SNAs to meet that need?  Are all autistic children eligible for this year's summer programme and July provision?</p></speech>

Children who have complex needs in mainstream education are eligible, as are special classes and schools.  They are fully supported.  First, is the funding of &euro;40 million, which is important, and there is an extra week's pay for staff, so that represents double funding to incentivise them.  There is also extra and enhanced funding for special schools and special classes above mainstream schools to get more of them involved.  It is about &euro;30 per pupil in a mainstream school, which comes to &euro;60 per pupil for a special school or for special classes.  Staff can now recruit final year students who are graduating this summer, undergraduates, and newly qualified teachers.  Where a school has full capacity, a child can avail of a programme in another school once it has been agreed with all the people involved.</p></speech>

In the next year a cohort of Dublin 12 children will need autism classes in secondary school.  Children who may not have needed a class in primary school usually need one in secondary school as navigating secondary school is a lot harder.  The question asked by the Dublin 12 campaign for autism spectrum disorder, ASD, inclusion is, if this is not provided, where will these children go?</p></reply>

From a general perspective, we have increased the amount of special classes since 2011 by 386%, which we can all admit is significant, although that is not to say there are no pinch points, particularly in Dublin, Cork and other areas.  This year we opened 269 classes and next year we will open 287, which will create 1,700 additional special class places.  We have a total of 2,148 special classes open nationwide.  In Dublin 12 we have a total of 21 special classes, 15 of which are in primary education, including two early intervention classes, and there are six post-primary classes as well.  Of those 21 classes, four of them opened this year, including Loreto Senior Primary School, Loreto Junior Primary, St. Damian's National School, and the Marist Primary School on Clogher Road.</p>  <p>  The majority of special classes open in Dublin are in primary level as distinct from post-primary, and that is a matter I am looking at.  There is a gap and a disconnect there I am trying to fix.  One of the ways we are doing that is with our collaboration with The Spiritan Education Trust, which is a patron for fee-charging schools, six of which are post-primary and three of which are primary.  One of those is in Templeogue, which is in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency.  It is a ground-breaking and major policy breakthrough that the fee-charging schools will open special classes and I am hoping that will fill the gap.  There are four schools that have projects in train in the Deputy's constituency.  There is the Holy Spirit Primary Schools in Greenhills in Kimmage west.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has met them and they are parents who are concerned about their children.  They are campaigning hard to ensure those children who are moving from primary education, especially over the next year or two years, have clear direction to go into post-primary or secondary school.  They made the point to me that it is harder for children who have autism to navigate secondary school and that is one of the reasons they are seeking to ensure classes are in place.  They are campaigning so that children will not be forced out of the area to access a school when they should be getting services at close to home as possible.</p></speech>

The National Council for Special Education, which I have to hold to account in its planning for current and anticipated demand, is critical, and that is primarily done through the special educational needs organisers, SENOs, even though there can often be a narrative that it is under the section 37 mechanism.  It is generally done through collaboration with schools that engage with parents, HSE officials and other stakeholders.  We have to look at the special educational needs, SEN, capacity over the next ten years from primary to post-primary level.  We have to look at the space capacity in schools, the schools building programme, the expansion of projects and approval under the additional school accommodation schemes, where they can get that scheme and where it will be of assistance to open a special class.</p></speech>

We should not have this issue every year where we are scrambling to facilitate children with special needs.  As I mentioned earlier, based on current and anticipated demand, we have a forecasting model in place.  The planning and building unit is now sharing its geographical information system with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, so the NCSE can see building projects that are planned in each geographical area in real time.  That was not done previously.  The Deputy is right that we need to ensure we have adequate capacity five, ten, 15 and 20 years into the future.  I am endeavouring to work on that daily.</p></speech>

The project for Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers is included in the Department&rsquo;s construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan as part of Project Ireland 2040 framework.  Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion in capital investment over the period from 2021 to 2025.  This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high-quality building projects with a real focus on sustainability for school communities across Ireland.  This investment will build on the good progress being made in adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs.  This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.</p>  <p>  The brief for this project for Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers is the development of a new 16-classroom Gaelscoil with two classrooms for pupils with special educational needs and all associated site works on the site adjacent to the current school at Farranferris in Cork city.  The major building project will be delivered under the Department's ADAPT programme.  ADAPT is an acronym for the accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering.  The ADAPT programme uses a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the design team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the project through the stages of architectural planning to tender and construction.</p>  <p>  The tender process to appoint a project manager will be completed this week.  Once appointed, the project manager will commence the tender process for the appointment of a design team for each of the projects on this ADAPT programme, including a design team for Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers.  The Department will keep the school authorities informed of the progression of these appointments as they proceed.</p></speech>

Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers was originally founded in 1986 when a group of people who wanted to develop the Irish language on the northside of the city came together.  For 36 years the school has had no permanent home.  It has been brilliant to see how people have been encouraged to speak the language and the interest in Gaelscoileanna in the northside of the city.  Students come from throughout the northside to attend the school.  The school has now got a reputation for being a hub for the language and heritage, something I am very proud of.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's announcement today that appointments will be made this week.

As the Deputy indicated, it is a positive step that the process to appoint the project manager will be completed this week.  Once fully appointed, the project manager will meet departmental officials and will put in train their programme for appointment of the design team for each of the projects in this ADAPT programme.  The project manager will also be in direct contact with the school.  After the appointment of the design team, it will take approximately 12 weeks to appoint the consultant architect, quantity surveyor, civil construction engineer, building services engineer etc.  I appreciate this has been a long process, but the appointment of the project manager by the end of this week is very positive.</p></speech>

My youngest and eldest daughters went to the school.  My eldest daughter is in sixth class and so she will not see the delivery of the new school.  However, for the other children who are in Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers it will be wonderful to have a purpose-built modern school with special needs units.  The school wants to be inclusive of all the children.  The staff and in particular the principal, Adrian Breathnach, have always encouraged that.  For the 300 children and their parents this is welcome news.  Ten years ago, that school had 89 students and now it has almost 300.  For the northside this is welcome.  It is long overdue.

It is a series of processes but, as I have articulated, the tender process to appoint a project manager will be completed this week, and after that it rolls on.  It is my intention as much as possible to expedite all of these issues.  As I said earlier, it is usually a 12-week programme for the appointment of a design team.

When I say protect, I mean more than just the essential protection from bullying and harassment.  I mean protection from being marginalised, excluded and made feel invisible, which is what many relationships and sexuality education, RSE, programmes do.  It is also about a culture in staffrooms that the religious ethos has inflicted on teachers.  We heard that mentioned at the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, conference a few weeks ago.

For example, since 2013, the Department has provided funding to BeLonG To for StandUp! Awareness which is a campaign that supports school communities to take a stand against bullying that is homophobic, transphobic or biphobic.  The Deputy observed that there are issues other than bullying but it is all part of creating a good atmosphere in schools.</p> <p> The campaign also seeks to raise awareness in schools about the experience of LGBTQI+ students.  The Department has also collaborated with advocacy bodies and partners to prepare a resource document for schools to support LGBTQI+ students, which has been made available online and to schools.</p> <p> The action plan on bullying and the anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools set out the Department's approach to tackling bullying and promoting an anti-bullying culture in schools.  As the Deputy is aware, the Department has recently commenced a review of the action plan and the anti-bullying procedures that will take account of research and developments since they were published.  It will specifically consider cyberbullying, identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas.</p> <p> Access to relationships and sexuality education, RSE, is an important right for students, as was referenced earlier, and it is important that the social personal health education, SPHE, and RSE programmes in place in our schools are relevant, up-to-date and inclusive of all our students and staff.  This is reflected in the programme for Government commitment to develop inclusive and age appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula.</p> <p> Following an extensive review of the RSE curriculum, focusing on a range of topics including healthy positive sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQI+ matters, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, published the report on the review of relationships and sexuality education in primary and post-primary schools.  I earlier outlined to the Deputy the progress we are making in that regard, particularly in respect of the specifications for the junior cycle that will be published imminently, followed by public consultation and roll-out into our schools.  In tandem, preparation work is under way for similar reviews of the senior cycle and at primary level.</p> <p> Specifically in terms of staff, it is also worth noting that under employment law, employers, including schools, have a duty to ensure the health and safety of their employees in the workplace as set out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p></speech>

We have also heard stories from teachers that show there is still a fear of having one's sexuality known about within the school community.  During recent teachers' conferences, I read a report in a newspaper about a teacher who could not talk about the grief he felt over the loss of a loved one for fear of what it would mean for his role in the school and potential progression or otherwise.</p>  <p>  The 2020 equality survey report of the Irish National Teachers Organisation reported that only 18% of respondents in the Republic of Ireland and 12% of respondents in Northern Ireland were out within their school communities.  I appreciate we have legislation but we also must face reality.  This is an issue we need to take infinitely more seriously.  Our schools should be part of a foundational knowledge when it comes to learning about respect for others and tolerance and yet we know that is not how many in the teaching profession feel in their place of work.  Will the Minister assure me this will be a priority for her Department?</p></speech>

Employment law is important, as I said earlier and the Deputy acknowledged.  That is an important point.  It means that employers, including schools, have a duty to ensure the health and safety of their employees in the workplace.  The Department offers an employee assistance service for all school staff, including LGBTQI+ employees.  This free service includes a wide range of supports including a confidential 24/7 helpline, short-term counselling, a wellbeing portal, webinars, podcasts and blogs.  It also provides advice and support to managers to help them deal with wellbeing issues among the staff.</p>  <p>  The bottom line, as the Deputy has articulated, is about fostering a safe, happy and inclusive environment in our schools.</p></speech>

RSE, sexual education and LGBTQI+ matter are not mentioned.  If this is a priority, as I fully believe the Minister feels it is, why is it not mentioned in the strategy for 2021 to 2023 when teachers raise issues about feeling uncomfortable in their place of work every year?  Can we place emphasis on it and place it into our strategies?  If it is written down, it becomes an action to be fulfilled and not just a matter of rhetoric.</p></speech>

Section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 states that certain institutions, including schools, should not be taken to discriminate against a person if their decision is made in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution.  I know that is still felt in staffrooms.  I have taught with people who have felt like they had to obscure their sexual identity for reasons that fall under that provision.</p>  <p>  We know that over 90% of our primary schools, in particular, are based on a Catholic ethos.  What about Muslim teachers, teachers from another Christian denomination or atheist teachers when they go for interviews in such schools?  Do they have an equal chance of being employed?  I think of the children in those classrooms and the oft-heard phrase that if you cannot see it, you cannot be it.  A Muslim child has never looked to the front of a class in my school and seen a Muslim teacher, an openly atheist teacher or a teacher from another denomination.  That needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

There are a number of issues tied up in this.  There is a need to expedite divestment but even within that, we need to ensure there is a bare minimum standard in terms of RSE that every school can expect.  The Minister will know that attention was recently drawn to a dispute in a school in County Wicklow that touched on the boxing off of certain topics that was proposed by the school.  As far as I am concerned, it is unacceptable if what was reported was accurate.  It is vital that we ensure every child has the same access.  My concern is that the progress made by the NCCA in that regard is not quick enough.  I urge the Minister to attempt to expedite that.</p></speech>

Deputy Gannon mentioned the fact that if you cannot see it, you cannot be it.  I am hugely supportive of achieving the greatest diversity possible within our schools for the benefit of our school communities, our students and our staff.  I recently attended the graduation in Marino of migrant teachers.  It has been a phenomenally successful programme through which we are getting the best of experience and diversity to enrich our schools.  I intend to support and progress that as much as possible to the benefit of our staff, students and schools.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked about divestment.  He will be aware that we have already rolled out a significant pilot programme to promote divestment in our schools.  That was born of a lot of engagement and consultation with all of the stakeholders.  I am optimistic.  We are already seeing how well that is progressing in terms of independent mediation.</p>  <p>  As I have already said, we are progressing a new RSE curriculum at pace.  We are looking initially at the publication of specifications for the junior cycle.  The preparatory work for a similar programme for the senior cycle and at primary level is under way.  There is an absolute commitment to advancing new curricula.</p></speech>

I know he has an interest in the area of special education.  As he knows, the most recent budget allocated &euro;2.2 billion to the area, which is over 25% of the entire education budget.  That is in recognition and acknowledgement of the importance of special education.  The Government respects the fact that this is an area that needs funding, support and care.</p>  <p>  We have at present 14,385 special education teachers.  That is an increase of 48% since 2011.  Our complement of SNAs has increased by 81% to over 19,000.  The role of special education teachers is obviously important for our children.  They provide additional teaching support for students with special educational needs enrolled in mainstream classes in primary and post-primary schools.</p> <p>That special education teacher model was rolled out a couple of years ago and we have based, to a certain extent, the SNA front-loading model on that.  It takes account of the profile of the school.  There is a baseline component, gender is taken into account, as is geography and the socioeconomic background of the school.  The special education teachers and the SNAs are available to children when they go into a school and there is no delay in children getting the resources they need.  Obviously, if a school believes that its special education teacher allocation is not sufficient it can, in exceptional circumstances, have that allocation reviewed.  It is important that schools do that if they believe they do not have sufficient resources for their children.</p> <p> In terms of the schools building programme, under Project Ireland, the education sector will receive a total of &euro;4.4 billion.</p></speech>

By way of a supplementary question, will she outline the extent to which there is an awareness of the increased demands arising from increases in the population, both natural and indigenous increases as well as increases in the number of refugees who have to be accommodated in the country.  Are sufficient resources readily available to ensure there is a smooth transition between the demand and the requirements in terms of the availability of the necessary accommodation and staff?</p></speech>

Schools can also apply for additionality in terms of accommodation through the additional school accommodation scheme.</p>  <p>  On demographics, population increases and provision for those coming from Ukraine and other migrant children as well as children with additional needs, it is very important we have sufficient capacity over the next ten years.  The Department will initially consider spare capacity within schools themselves to see if they have room.  We will then consider the schools building programme and the expansion of projects, including an integrated approach for primary and post-primary schools.  The Department will also consider the additional school accommodation scheme or the building of new schools, where needed.</p></speech>

In respect of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and its appeal system, is the Minister of State aware of the length of time it takes for appeals to be heard?  Furthermore, very often when appeals are upheld, nothing happens and schools are told they must go through the whole process again.  I suggest the NCSE may not be fit for purpose any more and may need to be overhauled.</p>  <p>  I also ask the Minister of State to comment on the need for special schools, especially in my area of east Cork where children with special needs are travelling very long distances, in some cases between 40 km and 100 km, to special schools because of the lack of same in their local area.</p></speech>

Indeed, for all children, not just those with additional needs, that geographical information system is important in the planning and building unit.  It is important there is capacity there, that we know current demand and can anticipate future demand when planning for schools.  We must now take into account Ukrainian children, but we do not know, as yet, how many we are going to have in the future.</p>  <p>  Deputy Stanton and I have spoken many times about the NCSE.  It will comfort him to know I recently met the new CEO, Mr. John Kearney, who is going to be very much concentrating on operational issues.  A lot of work needs to be done there in terms of engagement.</p></speech>

In the current school year more than 121,400 children, including in excess of 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported every day to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of more than &euro;289 million in 2021.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the school transport schemes, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post-primary school or education centre as determined by the Department or Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Department commenced a review of the school transport scheme in February 2021.  The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, how it operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families. The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs and the primary and post-primary school transport schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operates, including eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that also use transport services.</p>  <p>  Following commencement of this review, the steering group presented me with an initial interim report in June 2021.  Following consideration of this report, I approved the extension of temporary alleviation measures for the 2021-2022 school year for transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second-nearest school and had applied and paid on time.</p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the next phase of the review which is under way.  The technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation over recent months, including running a public survey for parents and guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to do so.  The group has also consulted a broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments.</p></speech>

I would have hoped to see some movement forward since then.  For many children, the school bus is their first experience of public transport.  Indeed, that was the case for me, back in the middle ages when I was taking the school bus.  Perhaps we should not base policy on specific instances but parents in Butlerstown, my home parish, are paying privately for school bus transport to Tramore and the costs are going through the roof.  The need is already proven.  They are doing this themselves to get children to the nearest available school.  I can say, as a vocal advocate for active travel, including walking and cycling, that there is no earthly way I would put my 14-year-old on a bike on those roads, knowing the traffic.  The need is there and has been proven and we need to build flexibility into the system.</p></speech>

Significant progress has been made.  The Deputy will be aware, for example, that last year as an interim measure, eligibility criteria were adjusted.</p> <p>Rather than eligibility revolving around the nearest school, I put in place measures so that students would be facilitated if they were opting to go to their second-nearest school.  This has alleviated quite considerably many of the difficulties that heretofore had been experienced.  To be fair, I believe there has been a general acknowledgement of the importance of this progressive move.</p> <p> The steering group has undertaken extraordinarily efficient public consultation that involved meeting with pupils and parents and consulting the broadest range of stakeholders by actively seeking their opinions so we could have a system in place that would meet the demands of the time in terms of climate and the demands of the time in terms of capacity for students.  That work is nearing completion.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the good work that is under way and the additional flexibility that is being built in.  It would be churlish not to.  I would like to have an idea of the actual timeline for that review being completed.  We were initially given an indication of quarter 1 of 2022 and we would like to see it over the line.</p>  <p>  I will refer to a specific instance where flexibility is needed.  There is school transport available that is passing quite close to the area in question.  It passes from Dunhill into Tramore.  The people in Dunhill satisfy the eligibility criteria for distance.  Not every seat on the bus is full.  It makes eminent sense to me to try to build in that flexibility to maximise the transport capacity we have and to provide a sustainable service for those parents who want to get their kids to school safely and in a sustainable way.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister that it has made a huge difference.  Will the Minister clarify if it is in place again this year?  Perhaps she is familiar with the route between Carrigtwohill and Cobh.  Can girls from Cobh now get transport to the school in Carrigtwohill, which would be their second-nearest school?  Would this measure apply in those instances?  As the Minister is aware, children going to St. Aloysius College from Cobh must pay privately.  It is very expensive.  There is no real transport there.  It would take a lot of cars off the road.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that.  The same applies on the Knockraha to Carrigtwohill route, with Glanmire being the nearest school and Carrigtwohill being the second nearest.  Would this apply also in these instances?</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to look again at the need to appeal the application of the section 29 model that is there at the moment, which is quite legalistic.  If parents must get transport to school, that is the method they must use if the nearest school is full.</p></speech>

Providers are under huge pressure with costs.  The Minister is aware of this.  The Coach Tourism and Transport Council has indicated that 95% of providers are under pressure to deliver services until the end of year.  We have seen flexibility from the Government as announced in recent days around construction costs.  School transport providers are similarly locked into contracts that are unviable for them.  We want to see school bus transport expanded but will we have the service providers to do this?  I am concerned about that.  I am aware that there are discussions between the Department, Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Can I get an update on those discussions?  When can providers expect to hear from the Minister?</p></speech>

There are particular sensitive issues in many cases where parents, including the parents of children with special needs, are forced to drive their children to school even though the relevant bus already passes their door.  They must drive their children to school and travel the same road on which the approved school bus travels, behind the school bus, and enter the school premises at the same time.  Despite the extenuating circumstances of any special needs or responsibilities, no movement has been made so far in accommodating them.  I believe there is a compelling case there and I would strongly urge it.</p></speech>

It is an issue I am very familiar with, given my constituency.  There has been a body of work.  I am glad there is an acknowledgement that the improvements made in the interim, and particularly around the second-nearest school, have considerably helped with access.</p>  <p>  I was asked a direct question about the measures for the 2022-23 school year.  They will be announced imminently.  The work of the review group is continuing apace, but it is my intention that in the shortest timeframe possible, very shortly, I will be making an announcement on the measures for the 2022-23 school year.  The focus here is to ensure there is flexibility, access and greater ability for people to avail of the school transport system.</p>  <p>  A specific issue was raised around fuel.  The Deputy is correct.  The discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are ongoing.  It is my hope and expectation that they will conclude as soon as possible.  Those discussions are continuing with the Department.</p></speech>

I have visited many schools across the length and breadth of the country and I have seen at first hand the professionalism, the care, the welcome and the efforts that have been made to provide a happy and inclusive atmosphere for Ukrainian families.  The Department is working to support education provision for arriving children with immediate education needs.  Utilisation of each school&rsquo;s existing capacity is the most flexible way possible to do that.  There is generally good capacity across the country, albeit there are capacity pressures in some areas greater than in others.</p><p>Many resources for teaching, learning and inclusion of Ukrainian pupils have been published to date, including a central repository of information and continuing professional development resources for school leaders and teachers to support cultural and linguistic diversity, which is available at <i>www.scoilnet.ie</i>.  The supports include those designed by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, to help children suffering from trauma.  NEPS psychologists are available on the ground to consult schools and provide support as needed.  A helpline for school principals is also in place.  Schools that have enrolled students from Ukraine can apply, and have successfully applied, for additional English as an additional language support and hundreds of schools are already receiving this support.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, we have set up regional education and language teams, known as REALT, to help to ensure good co-ordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children arriving in Ireland.  REALT services are hosted by the 16 regional education and training boards and are staffed by existing regionally-based education support personnel.  The primary role of REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures.  The initial focus is on assisting families in securing school places when they are ready to engage with the school system.  REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support my Department in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area.</p><p>Overall, it is estimated that approximately 25,000 school places at primary level are available, along with some 20,000 places at secondary level.  These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the huge work that has been done by schools to try to facilitate them by going to significant lengths.  Is there a specific funding stream in place for schools and Ukrainian families for the purchase of uniforms and schoolbooks for Ukrainian students?  Concerns have been raised with me that some schools are strictly enforcing uniform rules and book requirements for Ukrainian children.  For example, one family had to pay for school uniforms for three children in secondary school, at &euro;200 per child.  This is for a school that they may not be attending after the summer if they are moved to more permanent accommodation in another area.  Will the Minister encourage schools to show flexibility in these instances?  Finally, are there pressure points at this time in relation to school places?  If the Minister does not have time to respond, perhaps she will do so in writing.</p></speech>

We have ensured that where schools requested additional teaching staff, which could have been teaching staff for additional hours or English as an additional language, or whether they requested furniture or whatever, that has all been put in place.</p><p>Specifically, in relation to the students-----</p></speech>

It has proven very successful, which I want to acknowledge.  These locally-based regional teams are aware of the issues within schools.  They are open to the principals but also to the families to address any of the needs that need to be met for the students.  I acknowledge that schools have done tremendous work on their own but they are being very ably supported by the REALT teams.</p></speech>

How will the Minister ensure that these targets are met?  Can he lay out a timeline for achieving that?</p></reply>

The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces made it clear that the level of ambition for the Defence Forces must be elevated beyond that at which it is operating at the moment.  The report outlines three levels of ambition.  Level of ambition 1 is essentially proceeding as we are at present and trying to move back to a full establishment figure of 9,500.  The commission concluded that this would leave the Defence Forces unable to mount a credible defence of the State.  Level of ambition 2 would address specific priority gaps to improve on-island and overseas capabilities.  Level of ambition 3 would bring Ireland in line with other small neutral European countries in terms of spend.  I am on the record as saying that level of ambition 2 is the minimum for which we should aim.  This level of ambition will require an additional 2,000 personnel beyond the establishment figure of 9,500 and an increase in the defence budget of some 50%.  The Defence Forces are responsible for recruitment and I have requested them to examine their recruitment practices and structures to facilitate this increase in numbers.</p><p>This commission report also includes,<i>inter alia</i>, consideration of issues relating to culture, recruitment and retention, working hours, work-life balance, training, promotion, diversity and a host of other matters, all of which will have an impact on job satisfaction and morale.  Following relevant consultation, I will revert to the Government with a proposed response to the commission's recommendations and a high-level action plan, which will set out proposed timelines and oversight arrangements for its implementation.</p><p>In the interim, my focus remains on restoring all branches of the Defence Forces to the current agreed strength.  In that context, a number of initiatives are presently being implemented to counter ongoing staffing challenges.  There is ongoing general service and direct-entry recruitment and some 110 personnel have been inducted to date in 2022.  Retention measures include service commitment schemes in the Air Corps and Naval Service, and the seagoing naval personnel tax credit.  Pay has improved as a result of increases arising from the Public Service Pay Commission report and from recent pay agreements.  Agreement has also been reached on the extension of service limits for privates and corporals, with discussions ongoing relating to sergeants.</p><p>With regard to recruitment and retention, as the Deputy knows, because we discuss it every time we have questions in this Chamber, there are challenges to which we are trying to respond.  I have visited virtually every barracks around the country to speak to serving personnel about their issues and concerns and what drives them in terms of staying in the Defence Forces to maintain a career there.  The process we are going through at the moment seeks to put a credible action plan in place with the necessary budget, policy changes and restructuring within the Defence Forces, with the support of the Department of Defence, to be able to plan for a future in which we will have significantly more personnel in the Defence Forces, with increased resourcing to deal with the capacity challenges that the commission report has exposed.  That is a huge piece of work.  A civil military team from the Defence Forces and Department of Defence is working on that now and talking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I will be briefing the party leaders in a couple of weeks in relation to our ambition in that regard.</p><p>I hope this significant piece of work will result in the Government, as a collective, making a decision to significantly increase investment in the Defence Forces to respond to the evidence base, which is very clear in the commission report, but also to the international context in which we are living at the moment in respect of the war in Ukraine.</p></speech>

Along with the difficulties regarding recruitment, there is a dysfunctional cycle of turnover in the Defence Forces.  I think that is having an effect on the operational effectiveness of the Defence Forces.  The latest figures, of which I know the Minister is well aware, indicate that we are below strength to the tune of 1,134 members in the Defence Forces across the three areas of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  Then we have all the cultural issues that need to be resolved.  A process needs to be put in place to ensure the Women of Honour group, and women generally within the Defence Forces, feel they have a role and feel comfortable within the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>   We have a programme and a plan in the commission report that was laid before the Government.  For the last two years, I have been pushing the Minister on the issue of Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, affiliation.  Key to addressing all the issues and challenges of pay and recruitment and retention issues is the right to affiliate with ICTU.  The Minister's Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, sat down with representative bodies regarding the upcoming pay sector talks.  The one voice that was not at the table yesterday was that of the representative bodies from the Defence Forces.  Can the Minister outline clearly when he will allow representative bodies to affiliate with ICTU?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200012#K01100"><p>I wish the Minister a good morning.  I very much welcome the realisation that an additional 3,000 personnel are needed to staff our armed forces.  I certainly agree with it.  There needs to be more of an emphasis on retention as well as recruitment.  On "The Late Late Show" last Friday, retired sergeant, Mr. Ray Goggins, was asked straight up by Ryan Tubridy whether he would have stayed in the Defence Forces if the pay was better and he said that yes, of course he would.  That is the key solution here.</p>  <p>  There were four key recommendations by the Commission on the Defence Forces, which really need to be implemented as soon as possible.  The first is that the military service allowance be increased for personnel with less than three years' service.  The second is that additional long-service increments be brought in for people.  The third is that a new pay grade of lance corporal be established, which would assist 840 personnel.  The fourth and perhaps most important recommendation is that offshore allowances for the Naval Service be increased.  Could the Minister kindly indicate if those four measures will form the basis of the memo he is going to bring to the Cabinet in a few weeks&rsquo; time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200012#K01200"><p>There were a number of questions.  First, with regard to strength, as colleagues will know, in the Army, the establishment is 7,520 and the current strength is 6,778.  In the Air Corps, the establishment is 886 and the current strength is 733.</p> <p>In the Naval Service, the establishment is 1,094 and the strength stands at 855.</p> <p> We have a challenge here.  While it is about recruitment, it is also about capacity in terms of training and about retention, on which the commission carried out quite a lot of work.  In some parts of our Defence Forces, there is not, in fact, a significant retention issue relative to that in other defence forces and other sectors of the economy in the context of turnover rates.  Nevertheless, in other areas of the Defence Forces there is a high turnover rate and we need to respond to that with targeted policy and funding initiatives, which I hope we will be able to do.</p> <p> I cannot yet confirm what I will bring to the Government.  Of course, anything to do with pay and allowances involves a discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister at that Department, Deputy Michael McGrath.  Those discussions are under way, as might be expected given we are planning to bring a memorandum to the Government next month.</p> <p> On the ICTU issue, this is not as straightforward as some people make out, according to our legal advice.  We have received legal advice from the Attorney General on what we can and cannot do and how to do it.  As I have said to many serving personnel I have met in the past week, we are very close to making a final decision on this issue.  I hope to be able to do that before the middle of next week.</p></speech>

Along with the representative bodies, I have been calling for and demanding this because it is a key aspect of addressing the haemorrhaging of members from the Defence Forces and ensuring it will be an attractive career for members of the community to want to join.  I contend that the Minister has deliberately excluded those representative bodies up to this point, which has led to the current circumstances we face.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact there has been some movement on it and I hope the correct decision will be taken, but there is another issue on which we need movement, namely, the working time directive.  That, too, has been a key issue in making the Defence Forces an attractive career which people will want to remain in but also to join.  The Minister might update us on what will be done to address the issue relating to the working time directive.  Has the Attorney General given any advice in that regard?  It is a key element in addressing the haemorrhaging of members.</p></speech>

There is virtually unanimous cross-party support for this.  I have not heard a single dissenting voice in the Chamber on the issues of improving pay for our troops, increasing the number of personnel and improving the infrastructure and premises throughout the Defence Forces.  I urge the Minister to capitalise on that common ground and that consensus.  This is a golden opportunity to finally fix defence and to restore the pride of a once-proud &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

At the same time, I am being asked by the very same people to increase pay in the Defence Forces as though it was not a public sector pay policy issue at all.  Let us have some consistency and honesty here.  My view is that we need to address pay and conditions and allowances issues.  We need to try to use allowances, in particular, strategically within the Defence Forces to maximise take-home pay, incentivise recruitment and retention and reward the extraordinary service in uniform to which people choose to commit by joining the Defence Forces.  Nevertheless, we also have to be honest in the context of the broader considerations regarding public sector pay negotiations and to recognise I do not make decisions on pay.  I can make recommendations, but it will be the Government generally, on the advice of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that will make decisions on public sector pay policy, and we are about to head into a discussion and negotiation process regarding public sector pay.</p></speech>

Briefly, on the working time directive, which is an important issue we have discussed at length as we have moved through the barracks, we are making really good progress.  The Government is fully committed to ensuring the working time directive will apply to the Defence Forces, but there will have to be exemptions in certain areas to facilitate military service and the role of the Defence Forces in the context of the work they do, such as on peacekeeping missions overseas or on patrol of the coastline.  We have to ensure the Defence Forces can operate as a military efficiently, can make decisions and so on, but we also have to ensure that, where possible, the working time directive will apply to how hours are set and so on for serving personnel.  I think we are very close to reaching a final agreement on that.  There has been much back and forth in civil and military consultation on the issue, as there has been on the ICTU issue, on which I have heard very strong and varied perspectives from different elements within the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

Am I correct in stating that entire increase in spending will be capital, such as on new military equipment and so on?  Will pay be covered by another Department or will it be covered as part of the increase in defence spending?  What kind of breakdown does the Minister envisage between pay and the other elements?</p></reply>

I will come to the specifics of the issue after I have outlined my prepared contribution for the record.  The Commission on the Defence Forces was established on foot of a commitment in the programme for Government.  As Minister for Defence, I welcomed the publication of the report of the commission on 9 February.  There is an ongoing requirement to consider whether the capabilities we maintain are appropriate, having regard to the security environment, the roles we wish the Defence Forces to undertake and the likely risks that come with that.  This is the work the Commission on the Defence Forces was requested to undertake.  The commission undertook a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference.  It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and defence provision and covers high-level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and overall funding.</p>  <p>  Given the significant recommendations contained in the report, their detailed consideration is required.  This involves significant interdepartmental consultation, and my officials and I are engaging with key stakeholders to ascertain their views.  Following this engagement, I intend to return to the Government with a proposed response to the commission&rsquo;s recommendations and a high-level action plan to implement them.</p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces.  As the Deputy will be aware, the current public service pay agreement, Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021&ndash;2022, provides for increases in pay and allowances to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces.  A general round increase in annualised basic salary of 1% or &euro;500, whichever was the greater, came into effect on 1 October last.  The current pay agreement also provides for further increases in 2022, namely the equivalent of a 1% increase in annualised basic salaries to be used as a sectoral bargaining fund, in accordance with chapter 2 of the agreement, on 1 February 2022; and a general round increase in annualised basic salaries for all public servants of 1% or &euro;500, whichever is the greater, on 1 October 2022.</p> <p>In addition to general round pay increases arising out of ongoing national pay agreements, members of the Permanent Defence Force have also benefited from the implementation of increases in Defence Forces allowances recommended by the Public Service Pay Commission in 2019.  I will come back to the Deputy on his specific question in a second.</p></speech>

Is the Minister going to take the pay increases out of that &euro;1 billion or will they be covered by another Department?  Will the Minister give us a breakdown of where he sees the increases going?  How much will there be for capital spending, for military equipment and for pay, if his Department is to cover the pay element?  I am hearing a lot about 3,000 extra personnel and new military equipment but I am not hearing a lot about the issue of pay.  That is the number one issue and must be addressed before anything else.  If 3,000 new personnel were recruited in the morning, how many of them would still be in the Defence Forces in a year's time given the numbers leaving because of pay and conditions?  Relatively recently, 85% of Defence Forces were earning below the average industrial wage.  What measures does the Minister intend to take on that front?  Will he give me clarity on my question?</p></speech>

Let us be clear on that.  Let us also be clear that Deputy Barry and others want to ensure that the Defence Forces are part of the ICTU negotiations on public sector pay agreements that are to get under way in the coming weeks.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  He cannot say he wants to see significant increases in pay for the Defence Forces while at the same time wanting them to be part of broader public sector pay agreements and so on.  It is important to say that.  Pay is a very significant part of the defence budget and will continue to be so.  Many of those increases in defence spending we talk about are associated with pay.  That is why the estimated cost to achieve level of ambition 1 in the commission's report, which involves staying where we are but reaching the full establishment of 9,500 personnel, involves increased expenditure associated with pay.  Pay is a big part of our broad defence budget.  Pay comes from the defence budget rather than the budget of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  Of course, decisions on pay involve other Departments but it comes under the defence budget.</p></speech>

Pay talks are about to get under way.  Are the representative associations going to be not only present at the talks, but given a full voice and full say at them?  On the issue of the democratic rights of Defence Forces personnel, in other jurisdictions, including Sweden, defence forces personnel have the right to strike.  It is a democratic right and its absence is a key factor as to why we have had so many problems with pay and conditions.  I am talking about those workers in uniform having the right to have their grievances aired but also acted upon.  I would like the Minister to state his position on that.  I know what it is but I would like to hear him tell the D&aacute;il why he opposes that democratic right for Defence Forces personnel.</p></speech>

What they have asked me to consider and what they have taken legal action on is the right to allow ICTU to negotiate on their behalf through their having associate membership of ICTU, which is a very different thing.  We are looking at the legalities.  I hope we will be in a position early next week to write to all of the interested parties to let them know the decision we have made on those issues.  However, PDFORRA is not advocating for the right to strike.  By the way, I do not believe the Swedish defence forces have the full right to strike either.  Perhaps they do but that is certainly not my understanding.  Should Defence Forces personnel have the right to air grievances and concerns?  Absolutely.  We have to make sure that people serving in the Defence Forces have protections and that there are complaints procedures in place.  We have clearly seen that there is a need for reform and cultural change in this area.  I meet the representative bodies all the time to ensure they can air grievances with me, which we try to resolve where possible.  However, that is a very different thing from having the full right to strike, which is not going to happen and which no one is looking for.</p></speech>

Concern was expressed in the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces that less than one third of the RDF is considered to be operationally effective.  Will the Minister make a statement on that matter?</p>  <p>  While I am on my feet, I will make a brief point.  I heard Deputy Barry state that the Minister and the Government are committed to level of ambition 2, as set out in the commission's report.  I absolutely salute that.  I was delighted to hear that.  The Government should go there and go even further, if it can.  I just wanted to express that view as a side note.  The more we can do for our Defence Forces and the greater their capabilities, the better.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200014#M01700"><p>That commitment to level of ambition 2 has not yet been confirmed by the Government.  It is certainly my view, as Minister for Defence, that we have to be at least where the Commission on Defence Forces recommends that we need to be, rather than where we would like to be, to have at least a basic defence capacity.  Let us not forget that the commission carried out its work and finalised its report before the war in Ukraine so the context has already changed.  That is an important issue.  Some of my colleagues in government are working with us on this.  The party leaders will also have to consider these issues in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Reserve Defence Force has an establishment of 4,069.  As of 31 March 2022, the effective strength of the Army Reserve is 1,380 and that of the Naval Service Reserve is 114, with 271 personnel in the First Line Reserve.  These combined strengths account for 43% of the establishment figure, which is clearly not good enough.  In order to qualify for retention on the effective strength of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve, members must, in the course of each training year, satisfy certain obligations set out in section 39 of Defence Forces regulations.  These include specified minimum attendance at RDF training activities.  Members of the RDF who do not meet the specified training or attendance targets are classed as non-effective.  The military authorities have advised that the substantive strength, inclusive of both effective and non-effective members, of the Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve at the end of March was 1,616, with the effective strength accounting for over 92% of this total.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces contains many detailed recommendations, including recommendations on the future structure and role of the RDF.  A process is under way to consider these recommendations in consultation with my ministerial colleagues and stakeholders.  The intent is to revert to the Government with a proposed response and a high-level action plan in advance of the summer recess.  It would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt the outcome of that process but I will say for the record that I am absolutely committed to revitalising the Reserve and getting it back up to its full establishment.  I am committed to putting the resources in place to make sure that happens.  Legislation has already been passed to change the Defence Acts 1954 to 2015 to allow the Reserve to serve overseas, which was not previously possible.  I hope people have taken note of that signal of intent.</p></speech>

I note it has not been officially confirmed or decided yet and I encourage the Government to go to at least level 2.  As the Minister said, the plan arose in the pre-Ukraine context and while many of us could see what was on the horizon globally, it is now beyond doubt.  Some of those who opposed those plans used throwaway headline remarks, such as "Why does Ireland need fighter jets?"  Another question I would put to some of those advocates is whether it is suggested that we should abandon our Atlantic coastline or that, by not escalating to level 2 or above, we should abandon our responsibilities across hybrid warfare and leave the shipping lines into Europe and Ireland exposed, including the transatlantic cables.  There is all of that infrastructure and the significant maritime resource and footprint that we have across our coastline.  We need aerial defences, naval defences and conventional defences.  This is very important and I want to express my full support for the Government in doing that.</p>  <p>  On the Reserve Defence Force, I know morale has been low and there have been some question marks around its activities.  We have seen many non-traditional situations where the Defence Forces have been employed in recent years - everything from the big snow to the pandemic, and there was even a suggestion to use personnel at Dublin Airport recently to clear backlogs.</p></speech>

The commission is made up of 15 defence experts, including those from academia, former military personnel and senior civil servants.  It is a very experienced group of people.  The commission's work is probably the most important defence document we have had in 50 years and I think it is a very credible evidence base for us to now act on.  However, these are difficult choices for the Government because it involves a lot of money and, of course, there are a lot of competing interests for limited and finite financial resources.  What is envisaged is a multi-annual commitment for the next five to ten years to get the Defence Forces to where they need to be in the context of this report and the evidence base that it provides and, of course, there is the international context that we are living in.</p></speech>

It is a difficult choice for the Government but it is a very important strategic one, given our position in the emerging global structures and the threats and challenges that prevail.  It is time that Ireland stood up and took its place among the nations of the world.  I wish the Minister well in those deliberations and he has my support.</p></speech>

I believe and hope I have the support of most parties in this House, even though sometimes we have a very abrasive political system here in terms of disagreement on policy and so on.  I hope the vast majority in this House will support this because it will be for future Governments too and is not just about this Government.  I hope we can listen to and take in what the commission has said to us because it is very direct and blunt.  There is a need for fundamental modernisation, restructuring and cultural change in the Defence Forces.  There is also a need for the Government to look in the mirror and ask whether we are giving the Defence Forces the resources they need to match what we are asking of them in terms of delivery of outputs, services, capacity and so on.  The clear answer to that question from the commission is that, no, what we are asking of the Defence Forces versus how we are resourcing them is not matched and that needs to change.</p>  <p>  It is a very fundamental core issue in terms of the functioning of the State, namely, basic defence capacity around protecting sovereignty.  The context is what we are seeing at the moment in Ukraine and all that flows from that in terms of uncertainty, instability, tension, security considerations and so on.  We are likely to see Finland announce today, if it has not already announced it, that it is going to apply for NATO membership.  We are likely to see Sweden do the same in the next few days.  We are not likely to do that any time soon, but we certainly need to make decisions in regard to our own security and defence arrangements and capacity and resourcing.  It is as fundamental as that.  Hopefully, we will be able to find a way of getting agreement across Government by the time we bring a memorandum to Government next month.</p></speech>

I know it was there historically but through various agreements, such as the Haddington Road agreement and so on, it was taken out at one stage.  What is the view on its reinstatement?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200015#N00900"><p>I have some sympathy for that but I also need to put on the record what has happened here so it is clear from the Government's perspective.  The Deputy may be aware that, with the agreement of RACO, the specialised instructors allowance for officers was bought out under the defence sector collective agreement of the public service agreement 2013-2016, which was the Haddington Road agreement.  There was a negotiated buy-out, essentially, of that specialist instructors allowance under a pay round discussion and negotiation.  While the May 2019 report of the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force made a recommendation regarding Defence Forces allowances, it did not make any recommendation on the re-establishment of any allowances which were abolished under the Haddington Road agreement.  Rather, the commission recommended that Defence Forces allowances, which were retained under the Haddington Road agreement but reduced above and beyond any reductions made under FEMPI, would have their reductions restored.  Given that the specialised instructors allowance for officers was abolished rather than reduced, it was not encompassed by any recommendation of the commission.  I point out that is not the Defence Forces commission but the previous commission.</p>  <p>  In 2017, RACO submitted a claim to the conciliation and arbitration council of the conciliation and arbitration scheme seeking reinstatement of the specialist instructors allowance for officers.  As the claim was a cost-increasing measure, under the terms of the pay agreement of the day, the Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the claim could not be considered.  RACO has since reinstated this claim and the matter is being processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  As discussions on the scheme are confidential to the parties concerned, I am constrained in what I can say.  There was scope in the context of the current pay agreement, Building Momentum: A New Public Service Pay Agreement 2021-2022, to which RACO signed up, to have the matter of the restoration of the specialist instructors allowance considered under the sectoral bargaining element of that fund.  RACO members chose a general pay increase instead.</p>  <p>  I will come back with a more positive response because I do have some sympathy for this and I want to outline why I do.</p></speech>

The defence committee visited Haulbowline, the Curragh camp and other places, and we heard this from many front-line officers and personnel, who want to serve, are very proud to serve and enjoy their career, but are struggling to make ends meet.  We are all aware of those challenges and it is a challenge for the country as a whole.  It strikes me that the reinstatement of this allowance may be one among a palette of options that might go some way towards addressing this and might be useful in those negotiations.</p>  <p>  While it is welcome and is extremely positive news that a minimum of 3,000 new personnel are required within the force to ramp it up again, instruction will be needed for all those new recruits and those instructors will have additional duties, as they have always had.  I note that in a submission, either on the Haddington Road or Croke Park agreement, the Department of Defence acknowledged the responsibilities of an instructor as being above the normal required of such a grade and as qualification-based.  The argument was made previously to retain the allowance, possibly during the negotiations on the Croke Park agreement.  Therefore, the Department does acknowledge the time commitment and skills required.  I ask the Minister to consider that.</p></speech>

It has repeatedly raised it with me and that is fair enough.  It has a slightly different version of what happened to specialist instructors' allowances.</p> <p>However, there is a broader question here that we must address.  If we are going to be successful in recruiting the numbers we need to recruit and in maintaining standards in the Defence Forces, there will be a great deal of pressure on training within the Defence Forces in the context of upskilling and accommodating the numbers we have to bring into the Defence Forces over a relatively short period of time.  The record over the last ten years or so in terms of recruitment and retention shows that we have an enormous challenge to add a net 3,000 to the Defence Forces over a number of years.  That is going to put a lot of pressure on instructors in the Defence Forces.  In that context, I believe we should look at this issue again to see how we can accommodate the concerns that have been raised by RACO.</p></speech>

The scale of the reform, change, growth, expansion and investment that will have to be delivered in partnership between the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will involve a great deal of disruption and change, all of it for the better.  This is not about change that is downsizing for cost savings.  It is the opposite.  It is about upsizing in terms of capacity, people and resources.  It is also about modernisation, change of culture and change of structure to make the Defence Forces more family-friendly, attractive and flexible for more people to join.  However, all of that requires strong co-operation between me and my office, the Chief of Staff and his team and the representative bodies.  It is hoped that we will be able to find a way forward on this issue in that context.</p></speech>

Allowances are part of the pay.  There are key areas of concern with regard to particular allowances.  There is the Naval Service tax credit, the sea-going service commitment scheme and the patrol duty allowance.  Concerns have been raised time and again about those.  What are the Minister's views?  Have those concerns been addressed to the Minister?  What actions will he take to address them?</p></reply>

The associations that have since been established are RACO and PDFORRA.  The conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force provides a formal mechanism for the determination of claims and proposals from the Permanent Defence Force representative associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department continue to work with the representative associations in a positive and collaborative process within the conciliation and arbitration scheme to resolve issues.  There is also ongoing engagement on a regular basis between the official side and the representative side on a range of items which are processed through conciliation and arbitration.  Since my appointment as Minister for Defence, I have met with RACO and PDFORRA on numerous occasions.  I will be meeting both representative associations again on 1 June next, when they will have the opportunity to raise any issues of concern.  I may well meet them in advance of that on other issues.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the particular difficulties faced by the Naval Service in terms of recruitment and retention issues and of how the three schemes mentioned by the Deputy are an integral part of addressing these issues.  As such, I welcome the opportunity to discuss any views the representative associations may have on the operation of these schemes at future meetings.  I look forward to further continued constructive engagement with the representative bodies.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that we have introduced a number of schemes.  We have increased the Naval Service tax credit.  There is a patrol duty allowance and we have added the sea-going service commitment scheme to that.  There are approximately 106 people on the sea-going commitment scheme.  It is a popular scheme and more would like to be involved in it.  I can return to the details of that.</p></speech>

On many occasions they are on the same operations and in the same ships, yet there is no parity.  What people in the Defence Forces are seeking is parity across the board to ensure that issue is addressed.</p>  <p>  With regard to the other schemes, only 30% of members are eligible for the commitment scheme.  The Minister mentioned a figure of 106.  More people want to avail of that but they are precluded from doing so because of the restrictions that have been put in place.  That has seriously undermined the credibility of the scheme.  That must be addressed.  There is also the issue of taxation.  Members of the Defence Forces are taxed in respect of many of these allowances whereas other members of the public sector are not.  Again, all that people are seeking is parity.  These are issues that have been highlighted time and again, but there must be action on them.</p></speech>

It is quite different.  However, I take the point.  The truth is that it took us many months to negotiate the terms and conditions for the sea-going service commitment scheme because there was a legitimate concern in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that if everybody could avail of this, it would just be seen as a pay increase.  We were looking for agreement on this at the same time as the last public sector pay round was under discussion.  These things are not straightforward.  It is not in my gift, as Minister for Defence, to simply just announce a scheme and start paying people more.  We have to negotiate that with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it has to be consistent with public sector pay policy and precedents can be set and so forth, so it was in that context.  It is not so much that the scheme's credibility was undermined because the conditions were clear from the outset.  Certainly, many more people would like to join the scheme if possible.  The question is whether we can broaden the qualification criteria to allow more people into the scheme, which is something we are examining.</p></speech>

He said that was bought out.  RACO and other representative bodies would contend that this is not the case.  That is something that must be addressed because it is a major concern.  These allowances were cut and unlike in other public sector areas where some allowances have been reinstated, they have not been restored for the Defence Forces.  The specialised technician pay is another allowance that needs to be addressed and reinstated.  If we are serious about making the Defence Forces a career path for members of the public to join, we must address all these issues.</p>  <p>  Key to that is the right to affiliate with ICTU, and I welcome the Minister's announcement that there will be a decision next week.  I hope it will be the right decision because that will be key to allowing the representative bodies to articulate in the room where these decisions are made and to ensuring their voices are heard and acted on.</p></speech>

The Deputy might note that we are dealing with that issue well in advance of bringing the memorandum to Government on the Commission on the Defence Forces, which made a recommendation on this issue.</p> <p>We have separated that issue out because we know the timelines require us to provide clarity on it and justification for whatever decision I make.  I want that decision made as soon as we can possibly make it, which will be in the first few days of next week.  That is the commitment I have given to the representative bodies, and I intend following through on it.</p> <p> On all of these schemes, it is a matter of negotiation.  My job is to get as much as I possibly can for the Defence Forces within the confines of public sector pay policy more generally.  That is what I do and I will continue to do it.</p></speech>

This allocation provides for the pay and allowances of more than 10,400 public service employees, the upgrade and replacement of essential military equipment and infrastructure, ongoing Defence Forces operational and standing costs, as well as funding in respect of Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society.</p>  <p>  Gross expenditure to the end of April 2022 was some &euro;230 million, representing 27% of the defence Vote allocation.  This level of expenditure is some &euro;14 million or 6% below profile and is broadly in line with comparable expenditure trends observed over recent years.  My Department will continue to monitor expenditure on the Vote over the coming months and, at this stage, it is expected that the overall expenditure outturn will be substantially in line with the provision at year end.</p>  <p>  I am very aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the current strength figures and those of the establishment and I remain committed to addressing the ongoing challenges in relation to recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces.  In that regard, a range of actions has been taken to address these issues, which includes the 15 projects undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the Public Service Pay Commission report on recruitment and retention.  Most of these projects have been completed, with others being considered in the context of wider public sector pay arrangements.</p>  <p>  The overall pay allocation provided to the defence Vote is &euro;545 million.  In the event that any pay savings arise at year end, these savings, in accordance with Government accounting procedures and in agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will be used to address other non-pay spending pressures throughout the Vote.  I think we are the only Department that has that arrangement.</p>  <p>  Defence was provided with a capital expenditure allocation of &euro;141 million for this year.  Progress on capital projects is reviewed on an ongoing basis and where any unforeseen delays arise on particular projects, other capital equipment and infrastructural projects are brought forward insofar as is possible.  There are a significant number of ongoing defence equipment programmes.  I have a list of them, which I will send on to the Deputy.</p></speech>

There is a recognition that we need to spend much more money on our defence capacity, but the concern is that the money received is not all being spent.  I listened carefully to the Minister's answer and I note what he says about the &euro;836 million.  It appears that part of the problem is that although we have a minimum requirement of 9,500 members of the Defence Forces, we are not getting up to those numbers.  We are significantly below that figure, which is a contributing factor to this under-profile spend.</p>  <p>  What can the Minister do to ensure he is not in a position whereby money being allocated to the Department is not being spent and must be sent back?  Given that we all recognise that defence spending must be increased, it is disappointing that some of the funding has to go back because it is not being spent.</p></speech>

That is the reason we have an arrangement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have a budget and Estimate for 9,500 personnel and when currently have money than we need to cover pay and conditions because we are just over 1,100 people short of where we should be.  However, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform knows and understands that we are short and has effectively given us the flexibility to divert unspent money in the pay area into other areas.  It could be used for capital costs or other current expenditure costs outside pay.  We have used that facility to a significant extent in recent years and we will do so again this year.  In the first half of the year, before we are sure of our recruitment and retention numbers, it sometimes looks as if an underspend will build up but we make up for that in the second half of the year.</p></speech>

We must identify how we can get Army strength up to the 9,500 members we set as the minimum requirement.  I know that is a difficult task and that pay is part of it but there must be other elements to recruitment as well.  Part of the reform of the Defence Forces in the future will be how we make it more attractive for people to join them on the basis that there is a good career ahead of them.  I do not know if the Minister has any proposals in that respect.</p></speech>

Three chapters in the commission's report relate to how we treat people in the Defence Forces; how we manage them; transparency around promotions; complaints procedures and how they function; the cultural change that is needed; and the fact that many women in the Defence Forces do not feel safe and welcome, which must and will change.  A whole range of factors contribute to the recruitment and retention challenge on which we need to deliver.  Pay and conditions are part of it but the commission was very direct with me that these are certainly not the sole element on which we need to focus.  While we need to address pay and conditions, we also need to look at other issues around modernising the Defence Forces, having much more success in terms of gender balance, making a career in the Defence Forces more flexible and family-friendly and taking a much more modern approach to how we manage people.</p></speech>

That is a worthy endeavour which I hope we achieve.  In the meantime, how is it intended to ensure we keep the staff we already have?  We talk a lot about pay and conditions but what other steps does the Minister intend to take to ensure we keep existing Defence Forces staff?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200017#P01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 20 together.</p>  <p>  As I have just outlined to Deputies Brady and Berry, the Permanent Defence Force is currently under strength by just over 1,000 personnel.  The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces has made it clear that the level of ambition, LOA, for the Defence Forces must be elevated beyond that at which it is operating at the moment.</p>  <p>  The report outlines three levels of ambition.  LOA 1 is essentially proceeding as we are at present and trying to move back to a full establishment figure of 9,500.  The commission has concluded that this would leave the Defence Forces unable to mount a credible defence of the State.  LOA 2 would address specific priority gaps to improve on-island and overseas capabilities.  LOA 3 would bring Ireland in line with other small neutral European countries in terms of spend.</p>  <p>  I am on the record as saying that LOA 2 is the minimum we should aim for.  This level of ambition will require an additional 2,000 personnel beyond the establishment figure of 9,500 and an increase in the defence budget of some 50%.  When I gave those figures to the media in response to a question, it was not the case that I was announcing there would be an additional 3,000 staff; I was simply reflecting what the commission recommends.  I have to get agreement across the Government that we can support that financially.  I hope the Government will make such an announcement in the next six weeks or so but, as of now, it is simply a recommendation that I was reflecting in my commentary, and one which I regard as necessary.</p> <p>The Defence Forces are responsible for recruitment.  I have requested them to examine their recruitment practices and structures to facilitate this increase in numbers.  This commission report also includes a consideration of issues relating to culture, recruitment and retention, working hours, work-life balance, training, promotion, diversity and a host of other matters, all of which will have an impact on job satisfaction and morale.</p> <p> The Deputy has probably heard most of what I have in my answer, so I will answer him directly.  One of the reasons I wanted to travel to barracks after barracks and talk to serving personnel is so that I could hear from them about their frustrations and concerns and how we could respond to them realistically while at the same time maintaining military discipline and structure.  It has been a good exercise.  The commission has given a clear recommendation that we need to have a head of transformation in the Defence Forces, and that person will be a civilian, not a military person, reporting directly to the Chief of Staff and working out of Defence Forces headquarters, to bring about the kind of cultural, structural and HR attitudinal change that is necessary within the Defence Forces for it to modernise and to make it a more attractive career choice for men and women in the future.  We can learn lessons from what others have done internationally in this space.  We are not the only country that is trying to make this change.  Other countries have been very successful and other countries have made mistakes we need to learn from.</p> <p> That is the kind of work we are doing at the moment.  We have quite a large civil and military team working together to try to put an action plan in place that I can bring to Government that will be credible and that will justify increased expenditure.</p></speech>

He has answered my question about the other factors, so I will go a bit further.  In terms of the message Minister gave to media about the potential for the recruitment of a further 3,000 staff, what units would those staff be in?  Could the Minister give us some sense of this?  Would that be in the Defence Forces?  Would it be in the civilian department?  Would it be in the Department of Defence, for example, in terms of recruiting more specialised personnel?  In terms of where the Minster perceive that recruitment going, where would those units be expanded?</p></speech>

We are approximately 1,100 below that figure.  I gave the figures earlier that we are short of in the navy, the Air Corps, which it is hoped will become the air force in a few months&rsquo; time, and the Army.  We need to get back up to the establishment figure of 9,500.  It is pretty self-evident where we are short there.  The numbers are clear.</p>  <p>  Beyond that, the commission recommends an extra 2,000 people.  Seven hundred of those are for the Naval Service for a specific purpose.  The commission recommends we have what is called double crewing on ships.  We have a big problem at the moment with recruitment and retention in the Naval Service because many people do not want to spend weeks and weeks at sea every year, away from family and so on.  It is a big ask.  Even if we do reward it financially, it is a big ask.  The recommendation is that we introduce what is called double crewing, which means people would not have to spend as long at sea and we would have crew turnover more frequently.  Of course, that means significantly more personnel in the Naval Service.</p></speech>

We need to be careful with that because the Defence Forces operate on the basis of structure, discipline, common standards and so on.  We need to ensure that if we introduce civilians into the Defence Forces, we do it in a targeted way that does not undermine military structures, efficiencies and so on.  There is a role for that.  Again, we can look at other militaries to see how that is being done, where certain specialties can be brought in either on contract or by bringing people in to fit into the Defence Force structures as civilians, just as we have seen in Garda stations, for example, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  We need to have an open mind on all of this.  We need to work with the Chief of Staff, with his team, with the Department of Defence and with the head of transformation to deliver the numbers we need to deliver over the next few years.</p></speech>

As the Deputies are aware, following the Government decision on 25 January last, I announced the establishment of a judge-led independent review to examine issues relating to bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual misconduct, as well as workplace culture, in the Defence Forces.  This is seen as a critical step in ensuring that there is a zero-tolerance approach to unacceptable behaviour for serving members of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  There are three aims of the independent review, the first of which is to advise on whether the current legislative frameworks, policies, procedures and practices for addressing incidents of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace are effective.  The second is to assess independently whether the pervading culture in the workplace is fully aligned with the principles of dignity, equality, mutual respect and duty of care for every member of the Defence Forces.  The third is to provide recommendations and guidance on the measures and strategies required to underpin a workplace based on dignity, equality, mutual respect and duty of care for every member of the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  I have received three monthly reports to date from the chair of the review group outlining the progress of the review to date.  I look forward to further monthly reports, in line with the terms of reference, including any interim assessments or recommendations on addressing any issues arising which may require immediate action.</p>  <p>   In addition, I recently had a fruitful meeting with the group, namely, with Ms. Justice Bronagh O'Hanlon, Ms Jane Williams and Mr. Mark Connaughton.  The review, as the Deputy will be aware, will include the receipt of the views and experiences from both current and former Defence Forces personnel of workplace incidents of alleged unacceptable behaviour.  The sharing of such views and experiences by interviewees will be entirely voluntary and will be treated in confidence.  The independent review group is also continuing to accept submissions from individuals and organisations on issues relating to its terms of reference.  These submissions will form an important input to the group&rsquo;s final review report.  Details of how to make a submission are available on its website.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may additionally wish to note that I have recently received a report from Raiseaconcern on the work undertaken by the confidential contact person, CCP, to assist members of the Defence Forces affected by issues relating to bullying, harassment, discrimination or sexual misconduct in the workplace.  As agreed, I have submitted the report, which is entirely anonymised, to the independent review group. This report will be an important input into the ongoing deliberations of the group.</p>  <p>  The final report from the review group, which is due to be completed within 12 months of its establishment, will be brought to Government and thereafter will be published.  I hope to have an interim report by mid-summer.  I think the target date is the end of July.</p></speech>

He has clarified some of my questions, but it is important to place on the record again that this independent review arises from reports of sexism, bullying, sexual assault and rape in the Defence Forces, which was made public by RT&Eacute; Radio 1&rsquo;s documentary "Women of Honour", which aired on 1 September 2021.  I do not wish to keep repeating that, because there are serious allegations and there is such serious suffering.  It is important to bear in mind that this independent review did not come about proactively.  It came about on the basis of the suffering and the courage of the women.</p>  <p>  One of my questions was on the interim report that is due under the terms of reference within six months.  The Minister is telling me that is on target.  Is there any update on the Women of Honour who, I understand, had reservations from day one and who are not participating in the process?  Is that still the position?</p>  <p>  On the Minister&rsquo;s engagement and fruitful meeting with the independent group, how is that being done in terms of the independence of the review?</p> <p>What is the process around ensuring independence and the Minister meeting members of the review group?  I am not saying it is wrong or right.  I am simply asking what processes are in place.</p></speech>

It is led by a judge.  She is a very able person who has the support of two other very able people.  I simply wanted to get an update on how its work was going to make sure it remained on schedule and whether it needed any further resources for the work it is doing.  That is the update I got.  I will certainly not be involved in any way in discussions around what the group will recommend and how it will get to those recommendations.  The whole point of an independent review group is that it is independent and will make recommendations regardless of how difficult they may be to implement and so on.  That is the whole point of this.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the bravery of members of the Women of Honour group in talking publicly about their experiences and concerns.  It triggered a whole series of things that has resulted in this independent review.  I hope they will engage with this judge-led process to ensure we get the benefit of their experience and concerns.</p></speech>

On his communication with the independent review group, a process is in place to ensure there are minutes and a record of his interaction with that group, which will be available.  I welcome that the monthly meetings and monthly reports are coming in as per the terms and the six-month and 12-month reports are on target.</p>  <p>  My final issue relates to what themes or issues have arisen, if any, in the reports the Minister has been given to date in his contact with the review group, and in relation to the independent confidential person whose report has gone to the independent review board, which I welcome.  What are the issues, if any, and recommendations?  Has the Minister been asked to take any steps?  Has anything of urgency arisen in respect of this process?</p></speech>

The Minister outlined that if anything urgent arose from the body it would be brought to his attention and action taken.  Is there an opportunity, with the provision of the interim report at the end of July he mentioned, for that document to be made available to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for review?  Is that his intent?  Will he outline any follow-up changes that might arise if that interim report is provided to the committee?</p></speech>

I committed to, and wanted to have, an interim report because I wanted there to be an opportunity for the independent review to address issues early if it needed to, within six months rather than 12.  It will be up to the group to decide what it wants to put in the interim report, whether that is reporting progress towards finalising at the end of the year or specifically dealing with certain issues, making recommendations around those issues, and having the evidence base to be able to do that by the end of July.  I do not know which approach it will take but it has the option to do either of those things.</p>  <p>  If there are early actions the review group would like us to take, those may well be consistent with the action plan for the implementation of the Commission on the Defence Forces because there are quite a lot of recommendations and statements around cultural change, complaints procedures, the environment for women in the Defence Forces and a whole range of issues around that, which will also be part of our action plan for change I will bring to Government next month.  We will be informed by the end of July in the interim report, but to have a complete picture we will need to wait for the full 12-month period.  The time to go to the committee will be when we have a full picture of what has happened and a series of recommendations that will go with that.</p></speech>

The Minister has read it, is very supportive of it and will not let it gather dust on a shelf.  When will he bring proposals to Government in respect of the implementation of the recommendations in that report?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200019#R01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 12, 27, 41 and 48 together.</p>  <p>  The answer to that is next month.  The initial commitment was to do so before the summer recess.  I then said we would like to do it in June so there will be an opportunity to debate it before we break up for the summer recess.  This is arguably the most important reform and change to the Defence Forces since the establishment of the State.  It is that important.  We do not yet have consensus and agreement in the Government on the ambition levels we will have financially to respond to in this report.  It is my job to go through the process of getting there, which is not straightforward because there are so many competing demands on the Exchequer at present.  This is something fundamental to a sovereign state, especially in the context of the instability we see globally right now.  Let us not forget the recommendations and work of this report were concluded before Russia invaded Ukraine.  The new context in which the evidence base we now look at, which is highly credible in this report, is even more stark and more relevant in terms of the need for action.</p>  <p>  It will not be easy to agree on this but there is a sense in Government of the need to do something of real significance and substance in this space.  I hope that will be supported by Opposition parties too.  It is my job to make sure that what we commit to do is credible in respect of timeline and budget, and that we do not overpromise and under-deliver.  What we are asking of the Defence Forces in this report is very significant in terms of reform and change and we also have to make sure we deliver, as a Government, our side of the bargain, which are the resources needed to go with that change.  This is about upsizing, modernising and growing capacity, strength and numbers over a sustained period.  This simply cannot be done except over a five- to ten-year period to get to where we need to be.  That is in process at present.</p>  <p>  I hope those Deputies who are interested in defence issues will be vocal during that process because this is something about which we need to speak honestly to the public.  I do not believe we have had an honest discussion with the public on defence issues for many decades in Ireland.  This report gives us a real focus for discussion.  What we are living through on the Continent of Europe at present gives us a context that cannot be ignored either.</p></speech>

I suspect the world will change even further by next month when we stand in the Chamber again for questions on defence.  If we look at the fact that Finland and Sweden have indicated they will join NATO, the map of Europe will change significantly.  The only EU members who will not be in NATO will be us, Austria, Cyprus and Malta.  I am not advocating that we join NATO.  Irish neutrality has served this country well, but we need to recognise it will be us, Malta and Cyprus, all island states to a certain extent, that will be seen as the sections within Europe that do not have the perceived protection of NATO.</p> <p>I am happy to stay out of NATO and promote Irish neutrality.  If we are going to do that we need to increase spending and have a coherent and proper defence strategy so I welcome what the Minister has said.</p></speech>

It should have taken place many years ago.  I welcome the Minister's response.  I support my colleague.  Things are happening quickly now.  It is much more quickly than in the past.  They are likely to happen equally quickly in the future.  One thing we need to do now is to recognise the pivotal role that will likely be played by our Defence Forces in the medium- and medium-to-long-term and the necessity to protect the State and its interests and to be able to do that in a meaningful way notwithstanding all the other exigencies within which we must operate including the compelling demands on finance.  This is also a compelling demand.  It requires a rapid response now.</p>  <p>  At every question time on Defence in my time in the House I have raised the need to equip the Defence Forces that they be ready, capable and able and to be properly and effectively run at every stage.  I ask the Minister to convey to the Government the urgency of this situation as it unfolds before us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200020#S00300"><p>It is important that we set aside the debate that has arisen as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in the context of the commission on the Defence Forces report and the course of action that the Minister and the Cabinet takes and that this House will then endorse by way of majority, which I assume it will.  That is primarily because the conversation about neutrality is completely different from the conversation about ensuring that we have a Defence Force that is capable of meeting the responsibilities that we set out for it in terms of the defence of the nation.</p>  <p>  There are various issues that have been highlighted in the commission's report around force strength.  The Minister went into that in great detail.  There is also structure, capacity, primary capabilities and the matter of personnel, their treatment and the practices within it.  These are all of crucial importance.  If we have a conversation, as I am sure we will, in the next six weeks about the ability of the Defence Forces to meet the demands that we set for it the minimum of option 2 which the Minister outlined is what we should pursue.  I ask that he urge the Cabinet to support his own position on that.</p></speech>

One reason why I wanted to be back in the Defence brief was because we had committed to a commission that I expected would make some very telling interventions on the considerations around defence that are necessary and can not be avoided any longer.  We have fantastic Defence Forces.  They do a brilliant job as peacekeepers and in the roles that we ask of them within the confines of the resources that they have available to them.  But it is not enough in today's world to have the level of defence infrastructure that we have available to us when we know that more is needed.  This is not about the militarisation of Ireland or anything like that.  If we move to level of ambition 2 we will simply move from spending about one third of what other countries our size in Europe spend on defence to spending about half of what they spend on defence.</p></speech>

We cannot overemphasise the urgency and necessity to implement the commission's recommendations.  I know that when the time comes at Cabinet everything gets pushed to one side.  The Ceann Comhairle will know about this because we have seen it in our respective constituencies in the past.  I ask the Minister to become really aggressive at the Cabinet table in dealing with the needs of the Defence Forces to ensure that they are adequately equipped, in personnel and equipment, to carry out their duties.  There should never be a situation when we do not have enough ships to go to sea at any time or enough staff on board to be able to do the job.</p>  <p>  The world has changed.  That is true across Europe and we had better change with it.  If we think our neutrality will defend us in the event of attack we have another thing coming to us.</p></speech>

After the Cabinet comes to its decision on the course of action to take implementation will be crucial.  Our ability to detect and dissuade are two of the most important aspects of the commission's report outside of the personnel, force strength etc.  On that I re-emphasise a point I have made in this House on a number of occasions around primary radar and our ability to detect aircraft which may or may not have their transponder operational.  From a civilian perspective, never mind a military one, that is important.  It is in the commission's report and it is important that the Minister would outline his commitment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200020#S01700"><p>The commission went into quite a lot of detail about what moving to level of ambition No. 2 means.  It also goes into a lot of detail about what it would cost.  That gives us a good basis for putting an action plan in place.  But this is not a question about me being aggressive at the Cabinet table but about working with colleagues.  I have already spoken to the three party leaders about this and I will meet them again.  I think there is a recognition in the Government that we need to act in this area.  There is not a country anywhere in Europe that is not currently reviewing its defence and security arrangements on the back of what it happening in Ukraine.  Therefore, as Deputy Farrell said, this is not a debate around neutrality at all but about capacity and resourcing and the ability of the Defence Forces to be able to deliver the tasks that we ask of them in a safe manner with the resources they need to do it, both at home and abroad and whether in the air, at sea or on land.  I do not think that we have ever had a report that goes into the detail that this one does in terms of outlining where the capacity gaps are and where they need to be filled.  Deputy Farrell mentioned primary radar capacity but there are other examples of areas where there is clearly a capacity problem that needs to be addressed.  It does not happen by itself.  The Government needs to make a decision to commit to that and put the resourcing in place to make it happen.  The Defence Forces need to adapt to those new realities.  All of that can and will happen under the guidance of the Government.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Ceann Comhairle has little to do with this but the groupings this morning on the Defence questions were most peculiar.  A number of questions were totally separate to the commission on the Defence Forces but the vast majority of the questions that were inter-related were not grouped.  Some were grouped and some were not.  It was a most peculiar set up.  I have been watching and present since 10.30 a.m.</p> <p>I ask the Department of Defence public servants who are grouping these questions to take a more favourable view of them.  I do not know if questions on defence will be taken again before the Government will make a decision on the commission's report but it is important to put that on the record.</p></speech>

We probably could have grouped 20 questions on the commission report and had a discussion on nothing else.  That is because of the scale of the recommendations in it and how relevant they are at the moment.  By the time we have the next round of questions, I suspect that questions will be put on the commission report as well, but it will be more focused on the Government&rsquo;s action plan on the back of the report if, as I hope, we can get that agreed in June.</p></speech>

With every week that passes, the housing crisis continues to spiral out of control.  Rents are rising, house prices are rising and social housing needs continue to grow.  The latest rental report published by Daft.ie this morning shows that the average asking rent is up by nearly 12% across the State and that 22 counties are seeing double-digit rent inflation.  Rents are increasing by over 20% in counties Roscommon, Leitrim and Donegal, my county.  The consumer price index that was published this morning shows that the rent paid by all private renters, including new and existing tenants, has risen by 9.3% in the past year.  This is madness.</p><p>By every meaningful measure, the Government's housing plan is failing and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is failing.  His latest plan is to give developers between &euro;120,000 and &euro;144,000 of taxpayers' money for each apartment they build.  The Minister has said that the aim of this scheme is to enable affordability for people to be able to buy and that the beneficiaries would be the public, who will be in a position, he says, to buy apartments in city schemes.  On the radio this week, the T&aacute;naiste's colleague Senator Cummins claimed that this was a subsidy for the purchaser but the reality and the kicker are as follows: the scheme the Government claims is aimed at increasing affordability explicitly rules out discounts for purchasers.  It is a big payday for developers but there is zero, zilch, <i>nada</i>for those who desperately want to purchase affordable homes in our city.  It means that purchasers will still have to fork out between &euro;500,000 and &euro;600,000, or more, because these apartments will be sold at market prices.  Who on Earth can afford these off-the-wall prices?  The Government's scheme is not about creating affordability for those on ordinary incomes.  It is clear from this scheme that at best it will lock in sky-high and unaffordable prices, and at worst it will drive up housing prices even further as developers will simply price in the subsidy.  Of all the pro-developer schemes that the T&aacute;naiste and his Government have come up with, this one takes the biscuit.  This is absolute madness.</p><p>The big problem with the Government&rsquo;s housing policy is that all the measures it has introduced so far are driving up the cost of homes.  Is it any wonder that so many people have given up, right across this city and beyond, on the aspiration of owning a home?  The T&aacute;naiste has said he believes in home ownership but he has a funny way of showing it because people are looking on at this latest scheme in complete disbelief.  It is bonkers for the T&aacute;naiste, his Government and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to be giving &euro;120,000 to &euro;144,000 to developers for each apartment they deliver and not to deliver any price reduction for home buyers because that is what this is.  Housing can be fixed, and this generation can have a real chance, but to do that the Government needs to turn away from the policies that prioritise the profits of developers and finally put a focus on meeting the housing needs of ordinary workers and families.  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the Government should scrap the scheme of handing out &euro;450 million to developers.  What about the following for an idea?  What about using that &euro;450 million to directly deliver homes that people can afford to buy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200021#T00600"><p>There can be no doubt that rents are too high in Ireland and that far too many people have to spend too much of their income on rent, often at the expense of other things such as saving to buy a house, paying into a pension fund or investing in their education or that of their children.  It is a dual crisis; one of affordability and availability.  Sometimes when you try to improve one of those things you can make the other worse.  That is why we need to be careful about the policy interventions the Government makes.</p>  <p>  On affordability, as the Deputy knows we have brought in rent controls for most renters and the maximum increase possible is 2% in any given year.  That is much lower than the rate of inflation, which is running at around 6%.  The Daft.ie report that the Deputy referenced acknowledges that.  It says that stayers, people who have stayed put, have faced a 10% increase on average since 2017.  That is about a 10% increase over the course of the past four years.  These are not my numbers; they are from the Daft.ie report the Deputy referenced.  It is a different picture for new tenancies, with a 38% increase in the last four years.  That is a reflection of the fact that so few homes and apartments are becoming available for rent for the first time.</p>  <p>  I refer to what we can do around availability.  We can ramp up social housing and we can provide cost rental housing, which we are doing.  In social housing, we anticipate that about 10,000 new social homes will be added to the housing stock this year.  That is important as it gets people off the housing list but it also frees up other properties that people may rent or buy, which can also help a lot.  It started before this year but for the first time we are seeing cost rental becoming available for people as an option.  That is a good option because it is Government-provided rental accommodation which people can rent at a rate that is significantly lower than the market average.  That is becoming a reality for people now.  It has been planned for years but it is very much an option for people now and we need a lot more of that.</p>  <p>  We have to consider what more we can do to improve the situation.  It is clear that small landlords are selling up and leaving the market.  I often hear the Deputy and others make out that they are making a killing but that is not the case.  If that was the case they would not be selling up and leaving.  We have to look at ways to encourage small landlords to continue to rent out their properties and maybe we should encourage others to rent out properties for the first time.  We also need to scale up cost rental, something this Government and I are big supporters of, and provide more cost rental units for people to rent.  We have set a target of at least 2,000 cost rental units per year and we believe that is achievable.  We also need to increase the supply of homes for people to buy and we are seeing some good signs in supply.  We will get about 25,000 new homes built this year and that will be the highest in a long time, with 35,000 under construction and 45,000 going through planning permission.  We can see an encouraging pipeline coming through in additional supply.  We need to do more to fast-track the planning process and reform our planning laws to make sure more developments do not end up stuck in judicial reviews, which is a big problem.  We have two affordable housing schemes coming on stream this year, one that is local authority-led and one that is private sector-led.  Those will allow people on middle incomes to apply for affordable housing, which will help a lot of people to buy their first homes.  In addition, we have the help-to-buy scheme where people get their taxes back, including income tax they have paid for the past two or three years, something Sinn F&eacute;in opposes.  That has already helped 32,000 individuals and couples to buy their first homes.  These are people who otherwise might not be in homes and would still be renting.  I encourage Sinn F&eacute;in to end its opposition to that scheme.</p></speech>

Is it ten or 11 years?  Over that period when the T&aacute;naiste has been sitting around the Cabinet table we have seen rents double.  He was tweeting two years ago about how Government policies were working.  He tweeted:</p> <blockquote> 	Rents down, homelessness down, house prices levelling off.  Our policies are working. </blockquote>  <p>Let me put some facts to the T&aacute;naiste; not Sinn F&eacute;in's facts but the facts of the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  In the last year rents have gone up for new and existing tenancies by 9.3%.  Housing prices have gone up by 15% in the last year.  In the last two years the number of people in homelessness has increased by 15%.  On any viewing of those numbers, the Government's policies are failing.</p> <p>We have warned time and time again, as have some within the Department and other external agencies, that the initiatives the Government is bringing in will increase house prices and push up rents further.  This hare-brained idea the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has and which the T&aacute;naiste obviously supports will give away &euro;144,000 of taxpayers' money to developers to build apartments while ordinary workers and families will be asked to fork out between &euro;500,000 and &euro;600,000 for those same apartments.  How can the T&aacute;naiste stand over such a hare-brained scheme?</p></speech>

This Government has been in office for just over two years.  The party I lead has been in office for about 11 years.  No party has been in government on this island longer than Deputy Doherty's party in the past 20 years.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been in government in Northern Ireland for most of the past 20 years.  I am very happy to compare our record in government over the past ten years with that of the Deputy's party.  His is the party that increased rents in Northern Ireland.  His party increased the property tax, which is the domestic rates system in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

First, I thank the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for his engagement with the Labour Party Parliamentary Party yesterday evening.  We were very appreciative of the opportunity to engage with the Minister, clinicians and legal advisers to hear more about the Government's proposals, to dig into the legal documents somewhat and to hear more about the choice of the St. Vincent's site.  While we did receive clarity, our concerns remain.  We received much greater clarity as to why the St. Vincent's site is optimal in the view of clinicians.  It is clear from the view of senior clinicians that this is almost the only site on which they might envisage that the new maternity hospital would be built.</p>  <p>  However, this clarity just crystallised the position for us which is that if that is indeed the optimal site, the optimal approach to acquiring that site for the building of the hospital is to acquire it freehold, to ensure it is either gifted or sold at a nominal fee to the State.  That is why we renew our calls today, as we renewed them last night with the Minister, for the State to consider the compulsory purchase order, CPO, option.  If this is the optimal site, we need to look at the best approach on which the site is to be held.  That is clearly a freehold ownership by the State.  That is clear from the evidence given by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to the health committee yesterday where he stressed that successive Ministers for Health including the Minister, Deputy Harris, repeatedly asked the Religious Sisters of Charity and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to gift the land to the State but that this had been refused.</p>  <p>  We say that the Minister should now have the courage to take on the successor company that holds the land and to seek that the land be gifted, to renew calls that the land be gifted or sold at a nominal fee to the State or indeed to take up the CPO option.  The State has real history of taking up the CPO option.  It is not some kind of far-fetched notion.  Our colleague Deputy Howlin, who has extensive experience, has advised that this is a realistic option.  It is time that we stood up to the religious orders and their successor companies.  For far too long, the State has been submissive in enabling ownership of land to continue in the hands of religious organisations, and the lay-run trusts that have succeeded them in property ownership, in our school system and in our hospital system.</p>  <p>  If we know that the optimal way to have this hospital built is on land that is owned freehold, then let us go back and ensure that that is done, that the land is gifted or sold to the State for a nominal fee.  I know the health committee has sought a further short delay on the making of the Cabinet decision in the interests of further engagement to allow us to hear from further stakeholders.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to consider that request and to consider the Government's policy by looking now at taking on the power of the religious orders and successor entities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200022#U03100"><p>About two weeks ago, the Government decided to pause making a final decision on this matter.  I think that was a sensible approach.  It allowed people to ask questions and, in many cases, to get answers.  It allowed for transparency and the publication of documents.  It allowed for some people to be reassured and also allows us to consider what additional safeguards we might be able to add to the Government decision next Tuesday.  I expect there will be a Government decision on the matter next Tuesday, but we will see how things develop between now and then.</p><p>Above all, we should not lose sight of what we are trying to achieve here.  This is the biggest single investment in women's health in Ireland since the foundation of the State.  It is part of an overall strategy to improve women's health, maternity care and neonatal care, including improvements at the Rotunda, the new Coombe hospital, a new hospital in Limerick, a new unit in Galway as well as community units.  We want to achieve a world-class maternity hospital.  I worked in Holles Street hospital and I know it well.  It is a great hospital but it has conditions and infrastructure that are from 50 or 100 years ago.</p><p>In the new facility, every woman will have a single room <i>en suite</i>with the dignity that comes with that.  In addition, there will be much better infection control.  There will be a state-of-the-art newborn intensive care unit, NICU, for those little babies born prematurely who are most vulnerable.  There will be five theatres instead of two.  Think what that will do for gynaecology waiting lists.  It will co-locate with a major adult teaching hospital, St. Vincent's.  That means if something goes wrong, such as a woman having a major haemorrhage, cardiac arrest or stroke, within 20 minutes she can be in the ICU or in theatre in the adult hospital with all those specialists around her.  At the moment women need to be transferred into an ambulance, through the streets of Dublin, out of the ambulance and into St. Vincent's Hospital.  That is very much suboptimal.  That is the prize.  If we go for the plan in front of us, we can have that new hospital under construction as early as next year or, if not, the year after.</p><p>The CPO approach Deputy Bacik proposes does not give us that guarantee.  The difficulty with the CPO, which was considered by the Government, is that we would not have the co-operation of St. Vincent's when it comes to that CPO.  It would need to be a compulsory purchase, not a voluntary purchase.  That would definitely mean additional costs and additional delays.  At the end of it, the CPO might be refused because we would need to prove to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and to the courts that the CPO is necessary.  We are being offered a 300-year lease.  Deputy Bacik is a lawyer and she will know that a 300-year lease is considered to be secure title.  That would make it very hard to give the women of Ireland any assurance or guarantee that the CPO would be successful.  The alternative the Deputy is proposing - I understand the purity and rationale behind it - would definitely involve higher costs and further delays, and it might actually fail in the end.</p></speech>

All of us want the same outcome, which is a state-of-the-art, fit-for-purpose new national maternity hospital for women's healthcare in Ireland.  We have heard why that should be at the St. Vincent's site.  However, it is time to call the bluff of the owners of that site.  It is time to call them out.  While a 299-year lease is certainly better than the previous alternative that was offered of a 99-year lease, it still remains different from freehold.  It still remains conditional ownership and not outright ownership in perpetuity.  That is the difficulty we have.  We believe it is time to call the bluff of the owners of the site and to say that we, as a State, wish to take ownership in perpetuity of the land on which the new national maternity hospital is to be built, to put beyond doubt the future ownership and future availability right into the next century of all necessary maternity and reproductive healthcare services for women.  For too long women in this country have been failed by the State and by the church authorities, often working in tandem.  We need to call them out on it now.</p></speech>

It has been very clear with us that it does not wish to sell the site.  If the site were at the edge of the campus, like the BreastCheck building, it might sell the site as it did in the case of BreastCheck.  It is very clear that this site is in the middle of its campus and it does not want to sell it.  That would mean we would need to go down the route of a CPO.</p> <p>It would mean they would withdraw co-operation from this project.  They would cease to be partners in the project.  That would absolutely mean additional cost.  I cannot quantify what the additional cost would be but it would certainly be tens of millions, if not more.  It would absolutely mean further delay.  Instead of the hospital being under construction next year or the year after, it definitely would not be.  Even at that point, the compulsory purchase order might fail, and then we would be back to square one with no hospital at all.</p> <p> I appreciate the Deputy is being honest and is putting forward an alternative but I do not think it is a good alternative and I could not recommend that to the women of Ireland.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the tremendous work they do.  An issue that came up with a number of different agencies was the difficulties they are having in trying to secure accommodation for clients in the rental market.  I was told that most of the funding they receive is used to rent accommodation and they get very little capital funding to purchase properties.  Some landlords will only rent a property for a three- or five-year period, which is causing significant difficulties as many landlords are now looking for their properties back as some want to sell to capitalise on escalating property prices and others want the property for family members.</p>  <p>  I will give the T&aacute;naiste a brief outline of a case that was given to me by one agency.  The agency rented a four-bedroom bungalow for a five-year period at a cost of &euro;1,600 per month.  HIQA insisted that works be carried out to bring the house up to its standards and to ensure the accommodation was safe for the residents, and rightly so.  It cost in the region of &euro;155,000 to carry out those works and now the landlord wants the house back and returned to its original condition.  Some &euro;96,000 was spent on rent over the five years, &euro;155,000 was spent on bringing the house up to HIQA standards and &euro;78,000 was spent to revert the house to the way it was originally.  That is a total of &euro;329,000, which is a pure waste of taxpayers' money.</p>  <p>  This is happening all over the country.  These agencies, which look after the most vulnerable in our society, are finding it nearly impossible to source suitable houses in the rental market.  It is a very big worry for them because they may not be able to house their clients.  These agencies should be given multi-annual funding to purchase accommodation and to bring that accommodation up to HIQA standards so they can house their clients without the worry of having to move out after a few years.  I am aware that some disability agencies work with local authorities and housing agencies to source accommodation but this only provides a small amount of accommodation overall.</p>  <p>  Will the Government carry out a full audit of disability services and see how many properties are rented by them?  I ask the Government to consider providing multi-annual funding so those agencies can buy and own their own houses.  That would be more cost effective for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

I appreciate the fact that he gave us some notice that this question would be raised because it allowed me to get some further information.  Generally speaking, what the Government does is to provide funding to local authorities, charities or housing bodies either to build or purchase a house, and adapt it for people with disabilities.  It makes much more sense, on many levels, that we would purchase a house and adapt it for people with disabilities or alternatively build a house from scratch, which has to be done sometimes, for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  On occasion, and I do not know how often it happens, a house is rented instead.  The rental house is then adapted to make it appropriate for people with disabilities to live in.  That is done on the understanding that the house will be leased for a prolonged period of 20, 30 or 40 years.  The example that the Deputy gave is, quite frankly, something that should not happen.  It sounds like a poor use of taxpayers' money that a house would be rented, adapted at considerable expense to the taxpayer and then taken back by the landlord.  If the Deputy will give my office more details of that case, we will look into it because it is definitely not a good use of taxpayers' money and is far from ideal.  I do not know how common that is but it is something we should and will look into.</p>  <p>  The whole issue of housing for disabled people is now dealt with under a joint strategy of the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Health.  The joint strategy was published in January and as part of that, &euro;96 million is provided every year under the capital assistance scheme for housing.  That can be accessed by approved housing bodies for housing for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

If this problem is not addressed, it will continue to cause enormous difficulties for agencies trying to secure suitable accommodation for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The rental market is already in crisis and not every house is suitable to meet the needs of this group of people.  As I stated previously, it is a waste of taxpayers' money to adapt properties to HIQA's standards only to have to give up the property in a few years and incur the expense of returning the property to its original state.</p>  <p>  Will the Government look at devising a capital scheme to be introduced over the next couple of years to enable these agencies to purchase their own properties?  That would ensure that the homes of the most vulnerable are protected and would result in massive savings for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  I am dealing with Galway County Council at the moment and I know my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, is involved.  A development is taking place in a small village.  I have asked Galway County Council to work with the disability agencies to build a number of houses to suit people and, in all fairness, the council has contacted Mr. Liam Hanrahan of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  A number of houses are now going to be built to facilitate people in wheelchairs.  That should happen a lot more.</p></speech>

Funding for people with disabilities is integrated under the social housing capital delivery schemes, such as the capital assistance scheme, the social housing capital investment programme and the capital advance leasing facility scheme.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage also provides funding of approximately &euro;30 million per year to provide approximately 4,000 grants under the housing adaptation grant for people with a disability.  That assists people who live in their own private homes to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs.</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste knows, Letterkenny is part of the Saolta group of hospitals.  This group has seen waiting lists increase by over 45,000 people in the past seven years.  Letterkenny has seen an increase of 19% in that time, maybe not as high as other hospitals in the group but that is because we were starting from a higher base and a longer ongoing problem.</p>  <p>  More than 2,800 people in Letterkenny have been waiting for ear, nose and throat, ENT, orthopaedics and cardiology appointments for over 18 months.  There are over 1,000 patients on the three largest lists for inpatient treatment at the hospital.  Indeed, we even have a situation where a consultant surgeon has been appointed but has not done any surgery because he cannot get theatre time.  That is the crazy kind of situation with which we are now dealing.  If it was in the film "Catch-22" we would say it was unbelievable but this is everyday life in Donegal.</p>  <p>  Figures have shown that of 806 beds added nationally to the hospital services, only 36, or 4%, have been in the Saolta group.  Sadly, I think that the Saolta group is focused on Galway and Letterkenny is at the end of it thoughts.  All told, Letterkenny and Donegal are at the end of the line as far as the Saolta group is concerned and the Saolta group is at the end of the line as far as the national picture is concerned.  That does not augur well for the people of Donegal who depend on Letterkenny for their healthcare needs.</p>  <p>  Some 33% of approved consultant posts are either vacant or filled on an agency basis in Letterkenny General Hospital.  The recruitment campaigns for two geriatric medicine posts were extended four times and the positions remain unfilled.  A consultant microbiologist post is unfilled despite the campaign being extended seven times.  The campaign for a new ENT surgeon has been extended three times.  That position remains unfilled.  Even if those posts are filled, we end up with surgeons who do not do surgery because they cannot get theatre time because there are not any staff to run the theatres.</p>  <p>  What are the T&aacute;naiste and the Government going to do about this situation?  Are they simply going to continue to move patients to private hospitals or are they going to come up with ideas to sort this situation out?  The people of Donegal deserve better and deserve solutions that will deal with recruitment problems.  Surely the T&aacute;naiste would agree that there is something badly wrong with a health system that does not even seem to be trying to address these problems or is it simply about forcing people onto private hospital lists?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200023#V00700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I appreciate that the issue he is raising is that of waiting lists at Letterkenny hospital and the waiting times for people who live in Donegal.  He is also raising the wider issue of hospital overcrowding.  I do not have updated information on Letterkenny with me so I do not want to give the Deputy information that may be incorrect.</p> <p>However, I can speak about the general picture in relation to what the Government is doing to reduce waiting lists.  We do acknowledge that there are far too many people waiting on healthcare for far too long.  Even before the pandemic this was an issue but of course, it has become a much more serious issue because so much care was delayed, and had to be delayed, as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.  That was further affected by the cyberattack on the HSE.  The Government has a plan to reduce waiting times considerably.  We have set aside a dedicated budget for this plan of &euro;350 million per year.  It is a huge budget to implement the waiting list plan and that will go to public hospitals and also to private hospitals, where appropriate.  We need to use whatever capacity we have to get people the treatment they need.  If the waiting list plan works then by the end of 2022 the number of patients on active waiting lists will be at its lowest point in five years.  I cannot guarantee that is going to happen but that is the plan we are working on.  If it does happen, it will be a minor achievement, at the least, to have waiting lists at their lowest in five years by the end of this year.  That is the Government's objective and of course, that applies to Donegal and Letterkenny as well.</p> <p> We will offer treatment to all 75,000 patients on the active inpatient and day case waiting lists at the end of 2021 by the end of 2022 and will ensure that 1.7 million people are removed from waiting lists for scheduled care in 2022.  In addition, we are expanding the capacity in our existing hospitals.  There are between 800 and 1,000 more beds in the system than before the pandemic and we are continuing to add to that.  We need to do that because we have a population that is increasing and aging all of the time, with the additional healthcare needs that come with that.</p></speech>

I gave the up-to-date figures in my opening remarks and they show the seriousness of the situation.  Unfortunately, even if the Government's plan works, it will not solve any problems in Letterkenny because what needs to be addressed there is the recruitment and retention of consultants and of ancillary staff to allow those consultants actually to do their jobs.  That is the reality.</p>  <p>  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, has said that the maintenance of the FEMPI wage cuts is causing the problem of the recruitment of consultants.  Reversing those cuts might go some way towards alleviating the problem.  I also suggest that there is an alternative, which is to do a deal to recruit Cuban doctors into the Irish medical system.  This has been working in Portugal and Sweden, both of which are in the EU.  Cuban doctors are working in both countries and are alleviating some of their recruitment problems.  We should do that now, as another step to try to deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  For years to come, the pandemic and the cyberattack are going to be used to explain why we have not delivered but that is not good enough any more.  Even if we deal with these issues, Letterkenny will be back in the same situation it was in prior to the pandemic.</p></speech>

That is very much a global phenomenon.  There is not a health service that I am aware of, certainly not in Europe, that does not have a difficulty recruiting and retaining staff.  There is much more demand for healthcare than there are qualified doctors, nurses and midwives in the world.  That is why, just like lots of other countries, we rely so much on people coming from overseas to help to staff our health service.  We are very grateful that they come here and do that.  I do not have exact details on Cuba but I certainly do not see any reason why somebody in Cuba could not apply for a work visa to come here and work in our health service.</p>  <p>  We should acknowledge, and this is not often acknowledged, that we have more doctors working in our public health service than ever before.  One would get the impression sometimes that the number of doctors in our health service was going down and that more people were leaving than were coming in but that is not the case.  We have never had more doctors working in our health service than we do now.  We have never had more staff in our health service than we do now.  We are up to about 40,000 nurses and midwives in our public health service now, which is more per head and more per bed than almost any country in the western world.  That is part of the story and it should be acknowledged.  Yes, we do have a recruitment and retention problem and it is a big one.  We are struggling in that area, as are lots of other countries but we do have record numbers of doctors, nurses and midwives now working in our health service.</p></speech>

This has been raised with the T&aacute;naiste directly by many of my colleagues in the D&aacute;il over a long period of time but he has given no clear response.  The families who have suffered for decades deserve the truth.  The hundreds of children who were born in this State with serious health issues as a result of the prescribing of this drug deserve the truth.

The T&aacute;naiste will understand the utter outrage and disgust of the women of Ireland and activists on CervicalCheck when the Minister could not give any update on when this national laboratory will be set up and operational.  Furthermore, not one sample is currently being tested in Ireland at this time, despite the fact that the Coombe Women and Infant's University Hospital returned to full operational capacity in December 2021 following the cyberattack.  While we do not have exact figures on delayed diagnoses of cancer, at a conservative estimate cancer diagnoses dropped by between 10% and 14% in 2020 and in 2021 only six in ten patients were referred, as against the HSE's own service plan target of 95%.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to provide an update on when the laboratory will be up and running.</p></speech>

CervicalCheck is currently up to date with invitations for screening and by the end of 2021, it had screened the same amount of people as in any other two year period, notwithstanding the cyberattack and the pandemic.</p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;20 million has been committed for the construction, fit-out and staffing of a new national cervical screening laboratory.  The cyberattack in 2021 meant that the Coombe hospital lost IT connectivity with CervicalCheck and could not accept samples for testing.  Prior to that, the Coombe hospital was processing about 10% of community samples.  CervicalCheck has increased its capacity with the main provider of the testing programme and is currently meeting all testing standards and turnaround times.  The Coombe hospital has recently restored its IT connectivity and it is envisaged that it will be in a position to recommence sample taking in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

While there I visited the La Guajira region and the notorious Cerrejon coal mine, from which Ireland, through the ESB, purchased much of its coal supply until 2018.  As a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we rightly will not be engaging with Russia on the purchase of coal but is it our intention to purchase coal from Colombia once again?  Will that coal come from the Cerrejon mine?  If so, has a human rights assessment been carried out or will the Government commit to one?</p></speech>

This is the latest part of the cost of living crisis.  We hear from the CSO that inflation has hit 7%, making this the sharpest cost of living crisis and squeeze for ordinary people since the 1980s.  Irish banks are already charging the second highest rates for mortgages in the eurozone, with average borrowers paying &euro;2,000 more per year than their counterparts in other European countries.  These are the same banks that were bailed out by the public and are now again hugely profitable.  This is profiteering, pure and simple and it should be stopped.</p> <p>The Government is pushing ahead with privatisation of AIB when the banking sector should be brought into public ownership and run on a democratic, not-for-profit basis as a public utility.  Will the Government, at the very least, act now to empower the Central Bank to cap the interest rates that can be charged for mortgage holders?</p></speech>

At the moment, tens of thousands of individual customers and business customers of Ulster Bank and KBC are trying to find a new bank.  Among the reasons those banks are leaving the country is that while they can make profits here, they actually would make more profits for their capital in other countries.  That is one of the stated reasons they are leaving Ireland.</p>  <p>  It is true that interest rates are higher in Ireland than in other eurozone countries.  It is also true that bank charges are lower.  There are signing fees that do not exist in Ireland.  It is the case in Ireland that we have a much lower level of repossessions, which is a good thing by the way.  That has a knock-on effect of socialising the cost of that in higher interest rates.  There are many reasons as to why interest rates in Ireland are higher than in other European countries.</p></speech>

In the three years from 2019 to 2022, of 134 blue-light ambulance transfers from University Hospital Waterford to Cork University Hospital, not one arrived within the 90-minute treatment window.  In fact, the time from call of ambulance to Cork University Hospital patient hand-over averaged three hours and 14 minutes.  A three-year audit of heart attacks by the National Office of Clinical Audit, NOCA, has just been published and supports the evidence on transfer times.</p>  <p>  As a doctor, the T&aacute;naiste knows well the catastrophic damage resulting from this delay to emergency cardiac intervention.  Will he, as a clinician and the leader of Fine Gael in government, immediately designate University Hospital Waterford a 24-7 cardiac centre and commit the requisite funding to fulfil a 24-7 service plan?</p>  <p>  The pending Nolan report now has overwhelming evidence from the HSE and NOCA.  In the opinion of clinicians, any counter conclusions to 24-7 service delivery at University Hospital Waterford would amount to snake oil.  The evidence is clear.

The Deputy will be aware of the work being done to construct and fit out the second cath lab in University Hospital Waterford.  Obviously, when the laboratory is ready staffing it will be a challenge.  Finding staff to staff two cath labs 24-7 will be a real difficulty.  It is in large cities and it will certainly be a difficulty in Waterford too.</p>  <p>  I cannot make any commitments of the nature the Deputy requested.  I do not have the authority to do so.

It is a scandal that people have to wait that length of time.  It is a two-tiered system for the people of the south east, Tipperary included.  There is a further problem, apart from the cath lab not being open.  There is a huge problem with the National Ambulance Service and waiting times.  People are dying on the roadside and in their homes while waiting for three, four, five and six hours.  Ambulances are flying all over the country because boxes are being ticked regarding the time a 999 call is responded to.  The ambulance service may have responded but it will not say the ambulance could be 120 miles away in Donegal.  A farcical game is being played with people's lives.  It is not good enough.</p>  <p>  This issue has been raised countless times in this House.  Ambulance staff and personnel are fatigued.  Ambulances are becoming burned out with the distances they travel.  They are doing nothing but meeting each other on the road and failing to collect sick patients.  People have lost their lives.  We are going to continue with this farce.  It is disgraceful.  The people of Ireland, rural and urban, are entitled to and deserve a better service.  The two issues are linked.  The T&aacute;naiste knows that 90 minutes is a crucial time for heart attacks and any other service.  People have to wait or go by car.</p></speech>

There is a better understanding of that in recent years.  I appreciate the comments the Deputy made but perhaps the best place to raise this matter would be during health questions with the Minister, or perhaps as a Topical Issue matter.</p></speech>

It is self-evident as to why we need it.  A report from the Department of Justice found a lack of effective oversight of the implementation of the second strategy, a fragmented approach and a lack of action on decades of recommendations.  In 1997, we had a task force and here we are in 2022.  Specifically, when will the report be published?  It was due before the end of last year.  We were promised it at the end of April and now we are into May.</p></speech>

I take Deputy Connolly's point entirely that a strategy on its own is not enough, the strategy must be implemented and implementation in the past was fragmented.  The Minister is very keen to establish a new dedicated agency to deal with the matter of the epidemic of gender-based and sexual violence.  She believes the best way to do this is under a new agency, which she intends to bring forward.</p></speech>

In the past few days, it would appear that a new form of the disease has been identified. Tragically, this has resulted in the death of at least one child.

Thankfully, hepatitis C can now be cured.  There is a tablet for it that eliminates it from your system.  It is an extraordinary miracle of modern science that this is now possible and available.  It appears, however, that there is a new form of hepatitis in the world.  It is not hepatitis C.  We do not know exactly what type of hepatitis it is.  I am sad to report that the HSE has confirmed that at least one Irish child who was being treated for this new form of hepatitis has died.  A second child who is being treated for the same illness has had to receive a liver transplant.   Both children were considered to be probable cases of an unexplained type of hepatitis that has been reported in children worldwide.  The Health Behaviour in School-aged Children, HBSC, network reports that over the past two months, six cases of children with hepatitis of an unknown cause have been detected in Ireland.  The six children were aged between one and 12 years and all were hospitalised.  None of the Irish cases tested on admission to hospital had any evidence of Covid-19 infection at the time.  Ireland is liaising very closely with our European, UK and World Health Organization colleagues in an effort to identify the cause of this illness.  It is a matter of concern that we are very much aware of and plugged into.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.</p></speech>

They are essential workers and are expertly trained.  They deliver a 24-7 service 365 days a year.  Next Wednesday, in frustration at long-standing pay and career development issues that are affecting recruitment and retention in the sector, they are taking industrial action.  They have engaged in negotiations but these have been unsuccessful.  The Medical Laboratory Scientists Association, MLSA, which represents medical scientists, is seeking meaningful talks.  It should not have come to this.  It sends a terrible signal to young people who might be considering entering STEM, or science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

The Government appreciates the work they do in our laboratories and other facilities around the country.  They may not be seen by patients very often but without them, there would be no patient care.  It is essential that we support them in their work and recognise their role.</p>  <p>  The issue raised by the Deputy is an industrial relations matter and there are mechanisms by which disputes such as this can be resolved.  These include the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court, which are offices of my Department.

Obviously, we cannot have a return of the spectre of a hard border in Ireland.  The British may be looking for a game of chicken with the European Union.

I can understand the concern with regard to this issue.  Secretary of State Truss and Vice President &Scaron;efčovič had a telephone call this morning.  We will get a detailed read-out from that telephone call later today.  Clearly, what the British Government has now said is that it intends to move ahead with domestic legislation of its own if it does not see the compromises it is demanding in the context of the protocol.  That is deeply unhelpful and has gone down very badly across the European Union.  It has ratcheted up tension between the UK and the EU at a time when we do not need it in context of the bigger issues we are trying to deal with together, in partnership, in respect of Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Our message is simple.  We want partnership, dialogue and negotiation.  We believe there is a landing zone that can deal with legitimate issues that have been raised regarding the implementation of the protocol by the unionist community and business community in Northern Ireland, representatives of both I met yesterday in Belfast.  We will continue to maintain that position in dialogue with the British Government.</p></speech>

Recently, not only in Dublin but right across the country, we have had a number of incidents that have led to a number of deaths.  Last year, a number of colleagues and friends of mine in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party met the family of Jennie Poole, whose case is well-documented.

As a member of the Government, I have not seen that legislation yet.  I am not sure what its status is or whether it has been published.  I do not think it has been published yet, but once the Government sees it, we will be able to give it consideration.  We are certainly happy to take on board any helpful suggestions that might help us tackle this problem.</p></speech>

We need to work on the relationship between Britain and Ireland on these issues.  The British and Irish Governments understand better than anybody else the complexities of politics in Northern Ireland in the context of what we have just seen in an election that was quite polarising on certain issues.  We have a partner in the European Commission, and many other partners across European capitals, to help us do that.  As I said earlier, I believe there is a landing zone that can be negotiated and agreed through partnership, where both parties agree to compromise and move towards middle-ground positions.  The EU has been trying to do that now for well over a year, with new papers, new ideas, new concessions, more flexibility, extended grace periods and all the other things it has been trying to do to build partnership and trust with the British Government to try to resolve these problems.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, what we have seen, particularly over the last 48 hours, is a completely unnecessary ratcheting up of tension at a time when it is not needed or wanted, and a threat of unilateral action and legislation, which will be a breach of international law and will undermine trust.  Instead of the European Union focusing on solutions and compromises, it will be forced into a reaction to a British unilateral breach of international law, which is the last thing we want.</p></speech>

In two months' time, the Clondalkin Equine Club, which promotes urban horse ownership and equine education, will close.  This is incredible because thus far the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has spent &euro;800,000 building and funding the project.  I cannot fault the Department whatsoever; it has done a brilliant job.  We are in a situation where 20 young people will have nowhere to stable their horses come July.  This is a travesty when we consider the amount of money - up to &euro;70 billion - that has been paid to the horse industry.  The club is looking for a fraction of that.  We speak about young people's health and well-being.  In July, this club will have to close for the sake of a small amount of money.  I appeal to the Government to come together and develop an interdepartmental response to fund this project.</p></speech>

I am sure we will find a mechanism to fund the project so that it keeps going.  I am not sure whether that will be done through the local authority.  I know that in my part of Dublin, Fingal County Council funds such projects, so perhaps the local authority is the solution.

Her parents are in their 60s and both have been through cancer twice.  Louisa suffers from severe epileptic seizures and needs residential care.  At the very least, her family need respite care.  I have written to and spoken with the Minister of State about this case and I thank her for her support.

Following a review of the project bundles for Project Boyne, Project Dargle and Project Nore under the devolved schools building programme, DSBP, 2, on the NDFA website, I note that none of these lists features Enfield Community College, yet all are at pre-procurement stage in preparation for tender in 2022-23.

Some, of course, receive some level of care and have been approved for more, while others have been approved and are not receiving anything.  It is now being reported that some older people are staying in bed all day.

However, I understand the group is not due to report until September.</p> <p>In the meantime, can immediate measures be put in place through the Minister engaging directly with providers who know the challenges and the solutions?  There are issues with pay and terms and conditions.  Mileage costs, in particular, have become an issue.  The sector is growing commercially but there are no regulations or HIQA standards.  I appreciate legislation in this area is under way.  Could we have an update on that?  This is a very important sector.

As she said, this is a very important sector.  Currently, 55,000 people receive home care in their own homes.  The Government is very serious about home care and I have a budget of &euro;670 million to deliver it.  Last year, we increased the level of home care by 2 million hours, bringing the total to 21 million hours delivered in that year.  Unfortunately, we are challenged from a workforce point of view.  Approximately 5,300 people are awaiting home care.  That figure increased by 1,000 in April alone, even though we had delivered 7% more hours than we had by the same point in the previous year.  More people are being referred for home care.</p>  <p>  The strategic workforce group, which is meeting, will not report until September, as the Deputy noted, but we are trying to make home care a viable career choice such that we can encourage more people to go into it and to see it as a long-term career opportunity.  I will bring that legislation to the House before Christmas.</p></speech>

We are starting to see improvements in waiting times.  For critical skills permits, the waiting time is now back to six or seven weeks, which is pretty good.  For the general employment permit, it is still about 20 weeks, but we expect that to fall in the next few weeks.  It is something we are getting on top of.  We have trebled the resource behind it and many more staff are now working on the issuing of permits.  The waiting times are a function of the huge increase in demand for work permits, given how difficult it is to find staff not just here in Ireland but throughout European Union at the moment.

While remote working and hot-desking will be an element of the offering, the partnership needs anchor tenants to provide that stable revenue stream.  Does the T&aacute;naiste see a role for Enterprise Ireland in helping to direct the demand for high-quality office spaces to those in the likes of Lismore and Tallow, rural towns where that economic boost would be most keenly felt?</p></speech>

I think there is a role for Enterprise Ireland in that regard, and for IDA Ireland because sometimes, when new companies invest in Ireland for the first time, they want to set up in an available premises with a small number of staff before they develop their headquarters.  There is definitely a role for both agencies in that regard and that will form part of my discussions with them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="13:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200028#EE00200"><p>I might be sharing time with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.</p>  <p>  The proposed new building for the National Maternity Hospital is probably the most important investment in women's healthcare in a generation.  It is widely agreed that the midwives, nurses and doctors in Holles Street provide great care and that they are leaders in advancing women's healthcare.  After repeal, Holles Street was one of the first hospitals to provide termination services.  It was one of the first sites for the new specialist menopause clinics.  It has been involved in many of the new services rolled out around Ireland last year and this year.  It is involved in the advances in midwifery-led maternity care, gynaecology, genetics, endometriosis, fertility, mental health and much more.</p>  <p>  It is also widely agreed that the building in Holles Street is no longer fit for purpose.  The vision of the national maternity strategy is one in which women are treated with dignity and respect in an appropriate modern environment.  The facilities at Holles Street simply cannot provide that environment.  Women occupy Nightingale-style accommodation, sharing wards with up to 13 other women and with only a thin curtain separating the beds and inadequate shower and toilet facilities.  It increases the risk of infection and compromises the privacy and dignity of patients, who are forced to queue in public corridors to use bathroom and shower facilities.</p>  <p>  The new building will meet the needs of these women.  It is about having enough beds, theatres, diagnostic facilities and day-care facilities.  It is about having appropriate bereavement supports.  While the new building will meet these needs, it will do much more.  Every woman will have her own en suite room and there will be many more maternity beds.  There will be separate and appropriate space in the tragic cases of bereavement.  Instead of 11 delivery rooms, there will be 24 modern delivery rooms.  Instead of 18 gynaecology beds, there will be 31 beds.  Instead of 35 neonatal intensive care cots in shared spaces, there will be 50 individual-room neonatal intensive care cots.  The new neonatal intensive care unit has been designed in a way associated with reducing the stay for neonates.  All parents want and need to be by their baby's side day and night, especially when the baby is critically ill.  Parents will be able to room in with their sick or premature babies.  This enhances mother&ndash;baby bonding and breastfeeding rates.  This new building means the teams in Holles Street will be able to expand services for women, to make sure there is rapid access when it is needed, and to do it all in a modern hospital.</p>  <p>  It is also widely agreed that co-location is important.  Every year, hundreds of pregnant women need to be transferred to St. Vincent's University Hospital, as inpatients or outpatients, for treatment they cannot get at Holles Street.  Every year, a number of critically ill women are transferred to St. Vincent's, often for life-saving interventions and intensive care.  The midwives and doctors are telling us that, as maternity care becomes more complex, the need for access to the services in a large adult hospital is continuing to grow.</p>  <p>  It is widely agreed &mdash; indeed, it is demanded &mdash; that all healthcare services must, under law, be provided at the new hospital.  This demand is absolutely correct and appropriate and must be met.  The new hospital is being set up to do exactly that.  The new hospital's constitution guarantees its clinical and operational independence in the provision of any maternity, gynaecology, obstetrics or neonatal service that is lawful in the State.  However, we have gone much further than that.  Not only is independence guaranteed to provide all services but the hospital will be required to provide all services.  This includes terminations, tubal ligations, gender affirmation and everything else permitted under law.  Added to that, if for some reason the hospital were not to provide all services, the State, via the Minister for Health, would have the power to intervene directly to direct it to provide all services.</p>  <p>  It is also being demanded, quite rightly, that there be no religious influence in this new hospital.  Ireland has a dark history when it comes to the church and women's reproductive health.  I fully understand and fully acknowledge the deep sense of mistrust of many people in Ireland on this issue.  I fully agree with the demand for a fully secular hospital.  The new national maternity hospital will be fully and completely secular.  There will be no religious influence; there can be no religious influence.  The hospital's constitution explicitly states the services must be provided "without religious ethos or ethnic or other distinction".  This is stated six times in the hospital's constitution.  As with the provision of all services, the State, via the Minister for Health, can directly intervene to ensure there is no religious ethos in the provision of any services.</p>  <p>  St. Vincent's is also a secular, voluntary, not-for-profit healthcare provider.  Dr. Rhona Mahony, a member of St. Vincent's board, has pointed out that the board has been working for years to create a secular healthcare provider.</p>  <p>  Citizens with very understandable concerns were outside the D&aacute;il yesterday with signs that demanded that the National Maternity Hospital not be handed over to the nuns.  That is what was written on the signs.  Several colleagues here were outside with the concerned citizens.  I want to be absolutely clear: the nuns are gone.  They stopped their active involvement five year ago and in the past few weeks transferred all their shares to St. Vincent's.  In fact, I waited until that share transfer was completed before bringing any proposals to the Cabinet or the Oireachtas for consideration.  There is no mechanism for any religious involvement, now or in the future, in St. Vincent's or the new national maternity hospital.  I would never propose a new maternity hospital that had or could have any religious influence.  Dr. Rhona Mahony, Professor Mary Higgins, Ms Mary Brosnan, who is the director of midwifery, and the midwives, nurses and doctors in Holles Street, who are begging for us to listen to them, would never agree to anything other than a fully secular hospital.  These clinicians are the women and men providing all services in Holles Street today.  They will be providing all services in the new hospital.</p>  <p>  The nuns are gone, and we are not handing over our National Maternity Hospital.  We are not gifting it to anyone else either.  This is a partnership between the State, St. Vincent's and the National Maternity Hospital.  The National Maternity Hospital will provide the staff and run the new hospital.  The State will fund and own the new hospital building.  St. Vincent's will provide the land for 300 years.  This gives the State leasehold ownership in the same way as people own the apartments they buy.  Each party &mdash; the State, St. Vincent&rsquo;s and the National Maternity Hospital &mdash; will appoint three of the nine directors to the board of the new national maternity hospital.  The National Maternity Hospital will in turn appoint directors to the board of St. Vincent's.</p>  <p>  The two hospitals will be physically connected to ensure seamless and rapid access for patients, particularly critically ill patients.</p> <p>Both hospitals will provided shared services to be used across the healthcare campus.  Many clinicians will work in both hospitals.<br/><br/>A structure was agreed in the 2016 Mulvey agreement whereby the shares in the national maternity hospital charitable company will be owned by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group charitable company.  This provides St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group administrative rights, for example, for accepting annual accounts at general meetings and approving the appointment of auditors.<br/><br/>The new national maternity hospital will be fully clinically, operationally and financially independent.  It will have its own constitution and its own operating licence with the HSE.<br/><br/>It is worth comparing the National Maternity Hospital today and the new national maternity hospital that is being proposed.  Today, the land under Holles Street, the freehold ownership, is with the Earl of Pembroke.  The State owns neither the land nor the building.  There are two priests on the board of the National Maternity Hospital today, including the Chair, who is, and has always been under its articles of association, the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.  In the new national maternity hospital, the State will own the building and it will own the land under leasehold ownership for the next 300 years.  The State appoints three of the directors.  The Minister for Health will have broad powers to intervene and direct the hospital.  All services must be provided, there can never be any religious influence and, of course, healthcare services for women and infants will be modernised and greatly expanded.<br/><br/>While more and more people who are partaking in this discussion about the new hospital are concluding based on all of this that there will be no religious influence - indeed, there can be no religious influence - and that all services not only can but must be provided, some are demanding that the State's ownership of the land should be in the form of a freehold ownership rather than a 300-year leasehold ownership.  St. Vincent&rsquo;s has been clear from day one that freehold would not be considered.  Regardless of what any of us may think, that has been its position.  The reason it gave us for this is the ongoing management of the healthcare campus.  It points out that there needs to be one owner to ensure it is managed for the multiple services on site.  This includes St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, the private hospital, the new national maternity hospital, screening services, GP day care, research facilities, the UCD education centre and, quite likely, more in the coming years.  It points out that the shared services on this site are provided via single integrated systems, including heat, power and essential piped gases vital for patient areas.  It points out that the service corridors for the entire campus run through the new national maternity hospital building and that the new development includes facilities for shared services for the overall campus.  I was in Texas recently, at the biggest healthcare campus in the world.  It is a not-for-profit healthcare campus and it has many providers.  It is huge.  There is the world's leading cancer centre and many other providers.  However, the entire site is owned and managed by one company, the Texas Medical Centre.<br/><br/>Some do not accept this.  They do not accept the position being put by St. Vincent's.  They do not accept that 300-year leasehold ownership is enough and they are demanding freehold ownership.  To this end, many have accepted that St. Vincent's will not do that voluntarily and are saying, therefore, we must engage in a compulsory purchase order, CPO.  What if we engage in a CPO?  It might well collapse the partnership, which would end co-operation on co-location.  The courts may well rule against the State and I would imagine could point out that we already have lease ownership of 300 years.  A CPO could take years, due in part to the complexities involved given that what we are looking for here is a site in the middle of a larger health campus.  Imagine the complexities involved in a CPO if the State were to look to CPO land in the middle of Intel&rsquo;s manufacturing plant in Leixlip.  The new hospital building, which has been agreed and which we have planning for, would be compromised as the current design includes space that currently St. Vincent's is on and some of St. Vincent's current university hospital has to be knocked down and provided for the new building.  The building works, under a CPO, could also take years longer, as it would inevitably be more difficult for two separate site owners to work through the highly complex areas, such as shared services.  Future clinical care could become higher risk as separate owners of lands would need to participate, for example, in the upgrading and fixing of services that are on each other's parcels of land.  There would, of course, be a much higher cost to the State, including legal costs, a purchase cost - would that parcel of land be worth &euro;50 million, &euro;100 million or &euro;150 million - and there would very likely be additional costs due to ongoing delays in the building works.  It is not reasonable to put a project as important as this at such risk, to delay it potentially for many years or derail it entirely, in order to move from a leasehold ownership to a freehold ownership.<br/><br/>Women&rsquo;s healthcare has never been sufficiently funded.  It has never been sufficiently prioritised in Ireland.  We are changing that.  This year a new national network of services is being put in place.  Contraception is becoming free, starting with women aged 17 to 25.  Next year I hope to secure funding to start publicly-funded <i>in vitro</i>fertilization, IVF.  More HSE hospitals this year are beginning to provide termination services.  The new national maternity hospital is an essential part of the change, improvement, modernisation and investment in women's healthcare.  We have been talking about this hospital for nine years.  It is time to act.</p></speech>

My constituency includes the National Maternity Hospital.  My son has been a long-term critically-ill patient of the neo-natal care unit.  I am one who knows well exactly how deficient the National Maternity Hospital can be and has been.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for his engagement with me over the past year.  It is particularly in relation to the public interest directors and increasing their number from one to three.  It has been necessary because the current structure, as I have said in this House, is not open enough to those who raise complaints and concerns.</p>  <p>  I would very much like to see this hospital go ahead.  Obviously, like many other people and like the Minister, I would like to see public ownership of it but that has not been possible.  Can I get to 95% happy?</p>  <p>  The questions around religious influence were answered in large part for me by speaking to one of the doctors this week about the provision of HIV services in the HIV clinic in St. Vincent's that is operating daily, giving out free condoms and providing PrEP medication for gay men, in particular, 40 or 50 times a day, with absolutely no religious influence.  I spoke to a doctor on the ethics committee who assures me that there has been no religious influence in his work over the past number of years.  I accept that and the need for the hospital is clear.</p>  <p>  I also accept the position in relation to freehold versus leasehold.  Obviously, good legal title to any property in this country is either freehold or leasehold with 70 years left to run.  Anybody who has bought a house or an apartment will have gone through that process.  If I were to buy an apartment and there was a leasehold title with more than 100 years left to run, that is perfectly good title equivalent to freehold.  This is a leasehold title with 299 years and I accept that as being appropriately good title.</p>  <p>  Perhaps in part because of the constraints while the Minister is in negotiations, the communication of these issues has been only in the past two weeks.  I can understand why that may be so but it has impacted upon trust.  Women are already distrustful of some of the maternity hospitals.  They are already distrustful, for very good reasons, of religious institutions.  Their recent experience of the differential treatment in different hospitals of maternity services during Covid has amplified that distrust.  An inability to access equally abortion services across the country in HSE hospitals has impacted upon that trust.  Not only women, people across Ireland want to know and they want to get answers.  This pause in this period has been useful.</p>  <p>  I will be going back to my constituents - I had planned to do it today - to answer the different question.</p> <p>I will be going back to my constituents with the answers I have to their questions about, for example, compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, leasehold and freehold, and the term "clinically appropriate and legally permissible".</p> <p> Without being able to go into it, I want to acknowledge that it has been possible to provide better and better answers.  As somebody who was waiting to see the constitutional document of the new national maternity hospital, I do believe more can be done.  I appreciate the Minister does not want to reopen negotiations but he could get agreement to an addendum to the constitutional document specifying a non-exhaustive list of those services that shall be provided in the hospital.  He could also advance funding for a centre for reproductive excellence at the site to be a leader in this area and so that people could see our commitment.  He could also find ways to roster out the conscientious objection problem that can limit access to services not just in the new national maternity hospital but across HSE services more generally.  There is also capacity within the Government decision for the Minister to come back to the D&aacute;il when the hospital is built to update the House on the services that are being provided in the national maternity hospital every year.  It is about ensuring trust.  I have a little more research to do but I am at 95% on this.  The hospital is needed.</p></speech>

That is what I am trying to get at.  We know it was complex.  That is one of the arguments we are making.  All of this is very complex.  I imagine co-location is part of the reason for that complexity.  The lease arrangement is also a complex aspect.  Why is the lease arrangement complicated?</p></speech>

Look at the debate we are having.  People have very understandable concerns.  None of us is expected to walk around knowing the difference between rent, leasehold ownership and freehold ownership.  People are not expected to know that apartments are typically bought under leasehold ownership whereas houses tend to be bought under freehold ownership.</p></speech>

I will get to what St. Vincent's Healthcare Group may want later.  I am just establishing facts here.  The Minister came into office and made it clearly known to St. Vincent's Healthcare Group that it was his preference for the land to be transferred into public ownership.  That was his preference and he has just explained the reason.  However, over recent days, particularly in the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health yesterday, the Minister and many others were telling me and others who have concerns about the ownership that it does not matter.  They were asking us why we were raising these issues, what our concerns were and telling us it was dealt with.  Despite this, the Minister is also telling us he went into the process and asked the question that should be obvious to everyone in the House should be asked, which is why the site is not brought into public ownership.  That is also what I would have done.  My point is the Minister cannot have it both ways.  He cannot say this was his stated objective and what he sees as the best outcome but that we have not got the best outcome.</p></speech>

I am open to correction if the record shows otherwise but I believe my position, which I have stated very freely on many occasions, has always been that I would prefer public ownership and to own the freehold.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I both asked for that.</p></speech>

We have been having a very open debate.  The Deputy and many of our colleagues here are asking the exact same questions I asked.  I acknowledge the questions he is asking are absolutely legitimate.</p></speech>

I will not go back and quote what he and others said because that would just waste everybody's time.  It is accepted.  Why did he have that position before he himself was involved in talks?  Why did he initially carry that position into the talks and request public ownership?  What was the reason?</p></speech>

For historical reasons, there is a very understandable and deep mistrust in our country.  Any complexity in a proposal such as this can therefore add to the concerns people have.  We want this to be as clear and as clean as possible.  For the reasons we have all been debating for the past two weeks, having the site in leasehold ownership requires additional engagement beyond that required for freehold ownership.</p></speech>

I will move on to the issue of potential ambiguity in respect of phrases in the text of the lease and the constitution.  I refer to the term "clinically appropriate".  We have been through this an awful lot.  Yesterday, the Minister offered to write a letter of comfort and express his interpretation of that phrase.  He made that offer yesterday.  Does he accept that such a letter would have no legal standing, however?</p></speech>

The advice I have received previously is that Oireachtas debate does have some legal standing and that, when the courts are seeking to interpret things, people can refer back to the Oireachtas debate.</p> <p>I am not a lawyer, so I would prefer not to make a definitive statement on this.</p></speech>

That is why it is important that we get this right.  There are concerns.  Whether the Minister agrees with those concerns or not, given there are concerns about phrases, and we will hear in the health committee today from a number of legal people, is the Minister open to any changes of the text in regard to the lease, the constitution or any of the other elements of the legal framework in terms of that phrase or any other phrase?</p></speech>

Second, I do not know if the health committee accepts it, but I am absolutely willing to write to the health committee-----</p></speech>

We have a very complicated healthcare system in this State, which we agree on, I imagine.  It is a two-tier system with a mix of public and private, which is not ideal.  We have voluntary hospitals, independent hospitals and HSE hospitals.  We have section 38 organisations and section 39 organisations.  It is very complicated.  We had Sl&aacute;intecare, which we all agreed was about a single-tier health service in a public system.  This is the first hospital that is being built or signed off on since Sl&aacute;intecare yet it will be a private company that will be established.</p></speech>

It is all very complicated.  We are writing a cheque, or the HSE will write the cheque on our behalf, as taxpayers, for up to &euro;1 billion.  This is why I am concerned.  It is the reason we are in the position we are in.  The Minister himself used the words &ldquo;complex&rdquo; and &ldquo;complexities&rdquo;.  We are establishing this company, which is a charity, yes, but it is still a company, the National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC.  That will have directors coming from three different sources - from the State, from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and from the existing National Maternity Hospital.  That company is a subsidiary of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which will own the land and will be the landlord.  There is the lease arrangement between St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and the HSE.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has its own constitution and its own board.  That, in itself, is a subsidiary of St. Vincent's Holdings CLG, which has its own constitution and its own board.  We then have a licence, a lease and all of these constitutions.  This ambiguity is being raised, not by me, but by some who are legal experts.  All of that would be absolutely avoided if we had a public hospital on public land in public ownership.  For the life of me, I do not understand today why we are not getting that.</p></speech>

Since this project was announced in 2013, we have had four separate Ministers for Health and three separate Attorneys General.  What I would like to know is how many of those Ministers sought advice from how many of those Attorneys General, given there is overlap between the various roles, with regard to submitting a CPO for that land?  Was there one ask or two asks?  Did the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, ask?  Did the Minister, Deputy Harris, ask?  How many advices came back?</p></speech>

He just plainly set it out straight.  Our sense that anything is going to change, be subject to change or have the scope for change diminishes almost by the hour and, for me anyway, it diminished further when the T&aacute;naiste said that.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the Minister about the role of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  It became clear over the course of recent months, particularly over the course of engagement in the last couple of weeks, that the level of clinical engagement between Holles Street and St. Vincent's Hospital is very strong, with the same clinicians working in both hospitals - I know there are clinical reasons for this and all the rest.  As part of a process, it meant that this was not so much a selection of a site based on separate and different criteria, but it was more like an arranged marriage and they were so interlinked at this stage that a decision had to be made and there was no other choice.  That has been made clear through the various committees and the various engagements that have taken place.</p> <p>Would the Minister accept that this is not a great starting point when selecting a site for any new piece of State hospital infrastructure?</p></speech>

It is not perhaps the best starting point and this was more a <i>fait accompli</i>in terms of it going to St. Vincent's rather than an objective study of what may be the best site.</p></speech>

For example, there is very close co-operation between the Rotunda Hospital and the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and between the Coombe Women and Infant University Hospital and St. James's Hospital and, potentially, Tallaght University Hospital as well.  It is quite regular for there to be co-operation between major adult teaching hospitals and maternity hospitals.</p></speech>

There was no way it would be anything but St. Vincent's.  Does the Minister accept that this was always going to be case?</p></speech>

For example, the Rotunda Hospital has a very close working relationship with the Mater Hospital and, in the same way that critically ill women are moved from Holles Street to Elm Park, critically ill women are moved under blue light from the Rotunda Hospital to the Mater Hospital, yet the proposal that has been in place for many years for the Rotunda Hospital is to move it out to Blanchardstown and co-locate it with Connolly Hospital.</p></speech>

Does the Minister think that he and the State have used their leverage enough with St. Vincent's Hospital?  At the end of the day, the taxpayer pays the wages of all the senior staff in St. Vincent's Hospital.  St. Vincent's Hospital seems to have dictated almost everything in this regard.</p>  <p>  My time is running out.  The Minister has acknowledged there is very understandable concern about ethos and the role of the religious bodies in this.</p></speech>

I have doubts that this golden share model is an example of a model we will ever see used again.  The Minister said it is a model he would not mind seeing used.  Would he acknowledge that the golden share model, by definition, enshrines that concern forever?  The women of Ireland will always have that concern because the Minister had to put in this golden share model just in case these services were not delivered.  That is part of the PR that has been put forward on this golden share model.  I know it is an ownership model as well, but part of what the Minister said is that if the hospital is not providing the full spectrum of legal services the Minister can tell it that it has to provide these services, whatever the case may be.  Does he accept that this model by definition means that the concern and worry that exist now will remain in perpetuity because of that model?</p></speech>

In the context of our country's history regarding women's reproductive health, having an extra layer where the State, via the Minister for Health, has this very broad power to intervene and compel the hospital to do what it is meant to do is a good thing.  In fact, I would like to see it in other voluntary hospitals, to be honest.</p></speech>

I have listened intently to the debate, the language, the concerns and the pros and cons.  I have been in the House for the last two weeks listening to every debate I can and, between meetings, I watched the proceedings of the Oireachtas committee yesterday.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for his speech on the issue, which I believe sets out clearly the reasons for, and the benefits of, the chosen course of action.</p>  <p>  What do we all agree on?  We all agree that the clinicians in the National Maternity Hospital provide excellent care to women and infants.  They have been leaders in modernising women's healthcare.  A new modern hospital building is needed urgently for the National Maternity Hospital.  The new hospital should be built beside a major adult hospital to ensure women have access to the widest possible range of healthcare.  The new hospital must be fully clinically independent and there must be no religious influence now or into the future.  The new hospital must provide all services and procedures that are legally permissible.  The State's investment must be protected.  The Government's plans for the new hospital meet all these goals.  The new national maternity hospital will be clinically, operationally and financially fully independent.  All procedures that are currently carried out in the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street will be provided in the new national maternity hospital.  This includes terminations, tubal ligations and gender-affirming procedures.  The new hospital will provide all maternity, gynaecology, obstetric and neonatal services that are legally permissible.  My understanding from what I have listened to is that there is agreement there.</p>  <p>  However, the most important and relevant fact in this debate is how vital this development is to bring Irish maternity care into the 21st century and beyond.  It is recognised as a piece of critical infrastructure for the continued development of maternity and women&rsquo;s health services, and it will help to cement the momentum and achievements we have seen in women&rsquo;s healthcare over the last few years.  We are building a once-in-a generation, world-class national maternity hospital, ensuring world-class facilities for women, girls and babies for generations to come.  We are already aware of the importance and benefits of co-locating maternity services with adult services.  The National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital have worked together for decades, and approximately 40% of consultant staff at the National Maternity Hospital are employed by, and work between, the two hospitals, creating the ideal platform to achieve the clinical ideals of co-location.</p>  <p>  Both yesterday at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and again here today, the Minister has comprehensively addressed the concerns raised.  He has given very clear explanations on the legal agreement and the significant work that has been done to ensure the full range of services will be available.</p>  <p>  The referendum in 2018 was very clear.  People in Ireland voted overwhelmingly for abortion to be legal.  Abortion is permitted in Ireland during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and later in cases where the pregnant woman's life or health is at risk or in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.  I am just stating the facts.  The figures show that approximately 21,000 abortions have taken place over the last three years since the legislation changed.  The facts speak for themselves.  Abortions happen every day of the week, every week of the month and every month of the year.  My question is: why are there concerns that all services permissible under law will not be carried out in the new national maternity hospital?  They are already happening in the current, not-fit-for-purpose hospital.  It is not fit for purpose from a condition and infrastructure point of view, not in respect of the staff and the care.  The religious orders have left the scene.  They no longer provide healthcare.  They have not interfered in the last three years when 21,000 abortions were recorded.  This is fact; this is reality.  It is muddying the waters.</p>  <p>  All procedures that are currently provided in the National Maternity Hospital under Irish law will be provided in Elm Park.  I will state again that they include termination, provision of contraception services, tubal ligation, fertility services and gender-reassigning procedures.  It cannot be clearer.  Clinical services will not be provided according to any religious ethos, but according to the best national and international clinical practice.  All lawfully permissible services that should be provided in a maternity hospital will be available here.</p>  <p>  Over the last few days the very clinicians who provide such care have come out in strong support of the project.  I do not believe any Member of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, apart from the T&aacute;naiste, has worked in Holles Street, although I am open to correction on that.  We have to believe the clinicians.  Clinicians at the National Maternity Hospital have spoken passionately about the project and have urged us to press ahead.  What they clearly recognise is that there is now a range of legal stipulations to guarantee that all procedures will take place.  These are the clinicians who annually see several hundred pregnant women transferred to St. Vincent's Hospital as inpatients or outpatients for treatment that is not available in Holles Street.</p> <p>These are the clinicians who every year see a number of critically ill women transferred to receive intensive care that is not available onsite at Holles Street.  The physical transfer of such high-risk clinical cases between two separate sites is not in keeping with best practice, but Members should not take my word for it, they should please read the correspondence and listen to the likes of Dr. Rhona Mahony, Professor Mary Higgins and many others.  They, along with many clinicians across maternity services, have expressed their confidence in the agreements that have been brokered between the relevant parties.  It is my belief that their confidence is well founded.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has made himself available to answer questions.  He has made the necessary documentation available for openness and transparency.  We have debated for far too long.  While we debate here in the D&aacute;il, it is business as usual in Holles Street where there is a 14-bed Nightingale ward, and where women are queuing to go to the bathroom.</p></speech>

I fully support the view that the project should go ahead.  I am extremely astonished at the interpretation by some members of the legal profession of what a leasehold title is.  As someone who has practised and been involved in the purchase and sale of leasehold title for more than 25 years, it is clear that there is misinterpretation being given to what a 299-year lease is.  A 299-year lease gives absolute power to the lessee to manage and run the facility in the best way they want.</p><p>It is important that the lease sets out six covenants on which the lessee is answerable to the landlord.  The first relates to the primary responsibility for the funding of public hospitals and the provision of public healthcare facilities.  The second is that the tenant cannot assign without the consent of the landlord.  The third is that the lessee cannot change the permitted use.  The fourth is that the premises is actively used throughout for the provision of public health services.  The fifth is not to abandon the use of the premises.  The sixth and final covenant is about the freehold title issue.  Here is a lease for 299 years, which is about providing where a new hospital can be built to provide up-to-date care for maternity services and related healthcare for women in this country.</p><p>It is important to note what is clearly set out under clause 6.1 of the lease, which relates to &quot;quiet enjoyment&quot;:</p> <blockquote> 	The Landlord hereby covenants with the Tenant that so long as the Tenant pays the rents and observes and performs the covenants and the conditions of this Lease the Tenant may hold and enjoy the Premises and the rights hereby granted peaceably during the Term without any unlawful interruption by the Landlord or any person lawfully claiming under or in trust for the Landlord. </blockquote>  <p>It is clear that the lessee, which in this case is the new national maternity company, will in fact have total freedom in the management.  There is misinterpretation on whether it is freehold or leasehold title.  It is interesting how the current National Maternity Hospital is held under a lease; it is not freehold title.</p><p>Then we go on to the issue relating to compulsory purchase.  People are being quoted extensively in the media saying there should be a compulsory purchase order.  Let us look at one of the opinions provided by a legal counsel and quoted extensively in the media.  It states on page 62 of the opinion:</p> <blockquote> 	Insofar as the State proposes to compulsory acquire the lands, the appropriate legislation is under the Health Act 1947 which confers on the HSE the power to compulsorily acquire lands.  However, significant issues relate to whether the procedure under Health Act 1947 is constitutional in affording sufficient independence in the process for confirming a CPO. </blockquote>  <p>On the one hand we have the person being quoted extensively in the media to the effect that we should compulsorily acquire the site, yet on page 62 of the opinion he clearly flags that there may be difficulties if the State goes down that road.  The Minister clearly outlined that this is a partnership between the new national maternity hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital Group.  We are delivering a comprehensive health service on the one site, which is extremely important.</p></speech>

It is not a Nightingale ward.  The Minister of State is in the Department of Health.  At the very least, she should please get the absolute basics right.  When issues and questions arise, it is thrown out that, for example, the religious have left the scene, or there are loads of Nightingale wards, but there are none.  The Minister of State should withdraw that statement and correct the record, because there are not any Nightingale wards in the National Maternity Hospital.  There is one inappropriately large ward.  Nobody is disputing that we need a new national maternity hospital.  I have never worked in the National Maternity Hospital.  I have represented workers who have worked in it, I have given birth in it, and my grandson was born in it, so I have an association with the hospital.  I am an Irish woman, the same as the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I have an interest in ensuring the new national maternity hospital is built on land that is controlled by the State.  That is why people have concerns.</p>  <p>  Five years ago, the D&aacute;il passed a Sinn F&eacute;in motion unanimously, with the support of everybody.  The motion stated very clearly that we must ensure that the new national maternity hospital is built on the St. Vincent's Hospital campus as quickly as possible; remains entirely in public ownership; and is legally guaranteed independence from all non-medical influence in its clinical operations within the laws of the State.  The Minister of State supported it, as did the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  There was cross-party support.  There were concerns over religious influence at the time, which is why we proposed the motion.  There were concerns that the hospital and the clinicians would not be able to operate freely and provide all legally permissible services.  Those concerns have continued.  We would not be here having this debate if those concerns had gone away.  We simply would not be using our time to have this debate if all of those concerns had been allayed.  Does the Minister acknowledge that concerns remain?  Does he acknowledge that people have genuine, heartfelt concerns about the building and location of this hospital?  We all want the hospital built.  Nobody is disputing that.  Everybody wants to see it.  The hospital was not fit for purpose in 1995 when I gave birth to my daughter in it.  We all want to see the new hospital built, but we need to get it right.  It will cost &euro;1 billion.  Given the Government that we have, we will probably be looking at &euro;1 billion in the rear-view mirror at some point.  It is a lot of money.  There is a huge amount riding on this.  People have genuine concerns.</p>  <p>  I do not want to let this opportunity go without mentioning Sheila Hodgers.  I think of her often.  She died in a hospital.  She was not killed by a nun, by the way.  There were no nuns running around.  That is not what people are afraid of.  She was killed by an ideology, by an ethos.  She died and her baby died.  For her and for all of those women who are put into the National Maternity Hospital as it stands now, we have to get this right.</p>  <p>  In June 2021, the Taoiseach said that when the State is making a significant investment, it should own it "lock, stock and barrel".  I rarely agree with the Taoiseach, but I agree with him on that.  We will not own it.  Could the Minister outline what he will do between now and Tuesday?  Who will he be talking to in terms of the genuine concerns he has acknowledged have been raised?  Who will he be meeting and how will he ensure those concerns are addressed?  Is it his plan to meet the St. Vincent's Hospital Group?</p> <p>If so, what will be on the agenda and when will he inform us of the outcome of that meeting?</p></speech>

That is particularly baffling given that there are six pages of definitions in the lease agreement.  Across all of the other legal documents that have been released, there are pages and pages of definitions.  Why is there no definition of the term &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; given the confusion that seems to exist around it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200034#LL00900"><p>That is a very fair question, and one that is being asked repeatedly.  The advice I have from the legal team, to which I posed exactly the same question, is that for lawyers and clinicians, the phrase &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; is a normal phrase used all the time.  It is used in every hospital, on every ward and by every clinician.  The legal team told me that in the same way that it would not define "obstetrics", "gynaecology" or "neonatal", for example, &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; was in that category.  However, if I may say so, the Deputy&rsquo;s question is very fair and reasonable.  Clearly, for non-lawyers or non-clinicians, the phrase does not sit in the same place as the term "gynaecology" or "obstetrics", for example.</p>  <p>  As per the conversation we had yesterday, at a minimum, the issue has been described and discussed at great length in the Oireachtas.  I can yet again give an unambiguous assurance regarding the concern that people have that it could in some way be used to give a clinician some right to withhold services from women.  That is not the case.  I will finish on this point because I want to respect the Deputy&rsquo;s time.  I will write to the health committee and make that very clear.  I also want to reflect on the totality of the debate as well on this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1567" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200034#LL01000"><p>That is the very point.  It is baffling that the Minister is not prepared to provide a definition.  I put it to him that there is no equivalence between the phrase &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; and names of different branches of medicine.  That is a completely different thing.  The term &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; is open to ambiguity.  Even those who are in favour of this project are interpreting it in different ways.  For example, the obstetrician, Professor Mary Higgins, says that it means future-proofing.  However, that is not the case.  We know that we can provide a list and we can future-proof that by simply saying, &ldquo;but not limited to&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Minister and the Taoiseach have both said that the meaning of that phrase is to be very clear that it is only maternity-related services that are to be provided.  Yet, we discovered just in the last few days that dermatology is to be provided in that building.  Who knows what other services will be provided and who knows whether they are public or private and what that is all about?  We also know that Professor Shane Higgins believes that the term means that this is to be clear about the services that will be performed at the new hospital.  Clearly, therefore, there is a lot of confusion and whole series of different interpretations of that phrase.  The Minister has committed to providing a note to the health committee to explain his understanding of that.  If he is prepared to do that, why would he not be prepared to provide a definition in the legal documents?</p></speech>

I want to listen carefully to the contributions of the Deputy and all colleagues.  I will then reflect on those.  I agree with the Deputy and other colleagues.  Deputy Cullinane and others have said it and  Deputy Duncan Smith may have said it as well.  For people watching this debate who are coming from a baseline of mistrust for real and legitimate reasons, we need to address those concerns.  As I said, I am not ruling anything out.  I want to listen to this debate very respectfully and then reflect on what is needed.</p></speech>

The Minister has accepted that we have a point, that there is confusion and there are problems associated with this phrase.  He is saying he is prepared to provide a definition of that to the committee and he will send us a note on it.  Why then would he not include a definition in the legal documents?  That could be done in a matter of minutes.  Would he regard that as a substantial change to the legal documents?</p></speech>

I hope we will have a little more time because one of the things I want to do is talk to a legal or governance expert from St. Vincent's Hospital to ask why it would not consider giving the land to the State.  Considering the way other sites in the State work, I am not sure I accept the current explanation.</p> <p> I have many other questions around this deal.  I would have liked more time to consider the business case and why it has been returned for review.  I would have liked more time to think about why it came to Cabinet when the business case had not been signed off because this is a major project.  Why have we managed to get to that &euro;1 billion figure we talked about yesterday when, I am sorry to say, the construction costs just do not indicate it would cost &euro;1 billion?  Why do we have an empty hospital, block 1 in Elm Park, sitting empty for ten years, which the National Maternity Hospital, NMH, agreed in 2012 was suitable for its needs?  Why is that empty and sitting there?  What does this hospital mean for Sl&aacute;intecare contracts?  I would have liked time to consider all of that, but we do not have time for that today.</p> <p> We all want the maternity hospital built and we all want it to proceed, no one more than me who has small children.  I was very glad to hear the Minister talk about and recognise the dark history of women's health in this country.  If we are to recognise that, we have to address the lack of faith, not dismiss it and call it a red herring, but actually recognise it.  I have suggestions for how we could recognise it so that extra time would be helpful.  We also need to release all legal documents relating to the share transfer and take up the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, suggestion of encouraging the NMH to have a professorship of abortion care because our maternity hospital must be a centre of excellence.  It is not just that it should allow abortion and sterilisation.  It must be a centre of excellence for that care.</p> <p> As Deputy Shortall spoke about at length, the term "clinically appropriate" should be removed, clarified or added to, either in the documents or as an addendum or memorandum of understanding.  There is a lack of faith and trust from the public in Irish institutions.  We can solve that in a number of hours and days.  It worth doing that.  I point out that many of the parties in this Chamber found themselves massively out of step in 2018.  Not just the Government but those in the Opposition were out of step with the public mood in 2018 when it came to abortion.  Let us not go there again and let us not contextualise this debate as Government versus Opposition because I do not think it is that.</p> <p> Yesterday, we talked about listening to doctors and I said "No".  That is not what I walk the streets for.  I walk the streets to listen to women.  The women of this country care about this and my voters care about this.  I suspect those who are actually giving their votes to the Minister and the Minister of State care.  Make no mistake, I do not want to see this Government and the institutions of this State continue what we have done in the past, which is to assume we know better when we do not.  We should listen and clarify before we sign off.  The people involved in this discussion are not just the Minister - I thank him for this time - but also the three leaders of the coalition parties and the master of NMH.  If we are truly listening to women, I ask and implore those five men to act.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200035#MM00200"><p>I greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this very important, very sensitive and very emotive debate for everyone in the House, including the Minister.  I appreciate the decision taken by the Government to pause for two weeks in order to address many of the very understandable concerns and suspicions held not just by members of this House but the vast majority of people in this country and, most importantly, the women who have been betrayed institutionally by this country for so long up to this point.  We hold a very clear responsibility to be their voice in this Chamber and to ensure they are not betrayed again.</p>  <p>  The concerns I referred to have been raised by others this afternoon.  I make the point that, like everyone, I want to see this hospital built urgently.  It has taken nine years to get to this point, plus another two weeks.  If it has to take another two weeks for the Cabinet to reflect, as the Minister rightly said, on the mood not just in this Chamber but in the Seanad and the health committee, it is worth waiting to assuage those fears that can be assuaged.  I appreciate that for some people this deal will never be perfect.  That will lace their opposition to it, which is understandable and a perfectly just opinion to hold.  However, I want to make sure the best possible deal can be secured, not for me or the Minister but for the very many women we represent, be they in Wicklow or Dublin Rathdown.</p>  <p>  I will return to the points raised by Deputies Hourigan and Shortall relating to the phrase "clinically appropriate".  I was very grateful for the briefing the Minister and his officials gave to my parliamentary party the other evening and I look forward to the press conference to be held tomorrow by officials.  I will repeat the concern I expressed at the briefing that there should be an addendum, or a rolling update from the Minister of the day, to ensure that every single service the women of Ireland are legally entitled to and allowed to have is guaranteed.  We cannot go back to the ridiculously dark days where, on a whim based on the ethical opinion of the person who was there, using the State's laws and supposed public opinion as a defence, women in this State were absolutely robbed of the best possible maternity healthcare.</p>  <p>  I put that very sincerely to the Minister.  He has asked for and wants reflection and to listen to us.  As a Government backbencher, I am saying to him we need to have that clarity of definition.  It is not for me.  We need to have that reassurance for the dozens and dozens of women and their husbands, brothers, children and parents who are flooding my office.  They are not the usual suspects.  They are not the campaigners.  They are people I know personally and are my friends on Instagram.  They have genuine, heartfelt, understandable concerns.  Those concerns do not need to be assuaged to satisfy the 160 Members but, more important, the people of Ireland who will foot not just the financial bill of the establishment of this new hospital, but the moral and social bill.  That is a very grave responsibility and I very much hope that is resolved.</p>  <p>  I fundamentally accept the basis that there is no religious influence on this hospital.  I accept that.  It has been made very clear.  As the Minister will understand, however, the history of this State means there is understandable concern over what religious influence can be.  I spoke with a former Church of Ireland chaplain to the National Maternity Hospital.  He is a very progressive and understanding man who knows this issue in and out.  He came up against a system, when dealing with patients of a minority faith background, like me, who were not allowed access care because of the religious ethos of the hospital they were going to for supposed best care.  Many people in the State have no religious ethos.  He said he went up against this for decades as a chaplain to the National Maternity Hospital and he wants to know the detail, not just on his behalf but on behalf of the very many women he was able to talk to, many of whom he had to counsel and ensure could be accompanied to the United Kingdom to receive the level of care they were entitled to.  He wants to know where the detail is.  What is in the letter from the Vatican to the Sisters of Charity?  What are all the legal documents allowing for this transfer?  It may be a very simple matter for that clarity and confirmation to be given to those people.  If it is, I implore the Minister to lay it all out on table to make sure there is not any suspicion because, sadly, too many people in this State have died, suffered and been robbed of very basic decent human rights due to the suspicious and malevolent actions of this State over its centenary history when it comes to the care of our women. </p></speech>

It is written into our Constitution, the foundational document of the State, that a woman's place is in the home.  Until 1957, a married women became the legal property of her husband.  Until the 1970s, a marriage bar forced women to resign from work upon getting married.  Marital rape was not made a criminal offence until 1990.</p>  <p>  We have all heard the apologies from previous Governments over the years.  Only a year ago, the Taoiseach apologised in this House.  On that occasion, he apologised for the institutional abuse suffered in mother and baby homes.  As the Taoiseach said, "The State failed you", and we need to recognise a profound failure of empathy, understanding and basic humanity over a very lengthy period.  We need to have that empathy and understanding at the core.  Two years before that apology, the T&aacute;naiste also stood in this House and apologised on behalf of the State.</p>  <p>That time it was to people who were sexually abused in day schools and for the delay afterwards and acknowledging its responsibility to protect them.  In that very same year, he gave another State apology.  That time it was for the CervicalCheck screening programme.  He said &quot;we vow to make sure that it never happens to anyone else ever again&rdquo;.  <i>The Irish Times </i>reported at the weekend, the HSE is continuing to outsource cervical samples. <br/><br/>Before that the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessor, former Deputy Enda Kenny, also stood up in the D&aacute;il and he issued a State apology.  He issued a State apology for the Church-run Magdalen laundries.  No sooner had he issued this apology, than the HSE had to issue its own apology to Praveen Halappanavar, the husband of the late Savita Halappanavar, who died needlessly in my local hospital, Galway University Hospital.  She died because religious ethos took primacy over that poor woman's right to life.  Galwegians like myself and all those who marched for women's rights to choose remember the pictures of Savita which were present at every single march; her smiling face watching down over us, driving us to ensure that it would be a case of &ldquo;never again&rdquo;.  We have heard the apologies.  We have heard the &ldquo;never again&rdquo; and the &ldquo;lessons have been learned&rdquo; lines yet here we are.  I am not going to rehash the legal arguments around the leasing arrangement with St. Vincent holding company or the separation of religious orders from their stakeholders.  Many legal experts and people far more qualified to speak about this than me have raised serious concerns.  I think these concerns compounded by the appalling track record of the treatment of women in this State lead me to fear that we will at some point hear more apologies in this House.<br/><br/>I will conclude by telling a story about a good friend of mine.  She is living proof of what happens when a religious order does have a share in the hospital.  In 2018, she was allowed sign for a hysterectomy when her life was in immediate danger.  Thankfully her surgeon was skilled enough to remove an ovary, tube and growth without the clinical necessity of a hysterectomy.  A year later, it became clear that she required a radical hysterectomy to have any quality of life.  Her condition was life limiting but not life threatening.  While a hysterectomy was clinically appropriate it was not deemed necessary and hence permissible.  As a result, other treatments were prescribed: months-long cocktails of Pethidine injections, morphine patches, Oxycodone and Fentanyl were prescribed destroying her quality of life.  Because she was 26 and had no living children, the hospital's religious ethos deemed a surgery that would improve and eventually save her life to be inappropriate.  In fact, she later discovered that her medical team could not mention the possible need of a hysterectomy with her at that point due to that ethos.  That was despite her uterus slowly perforating.  Eventually she had to travel to England for this operation.  Another Irish woman forced to cross the sea to seek the medical services denied to her in her own State.<br/><br/>We must have, as so many women have said in the past weeks, months and years, a public hospital on public land to ensure that women get the healthcare that they need and that they have full confidence within it.  We can see from the last number of weeks how important that is to women.<br/><br/>I only had five minutes and I have used all of my time.  Maybe in his own summing up, the Minister will address some of the concerns that were raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.509" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200036#NN00200"><p>Today the T&aacute;naiste said the two weeks that we were given to consider the deal around the new national maternity hospital were given to look at what additional safeguards could be added.  That question remains.  What additional safeguards can be added?  I am standing here because I am sore sitting.  We have been sitting at long meetings about this issue all week.  I will sit at more of them next week and the week after if necessary.  But we have to make progress.  The progress we have to make has to be based on a certain amount of honesty and openness and more honesty and openness than we have had so far.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, it was very interesting to hear the consultants and the clinicians who deliver the services to women.  They are very anxious to get this hospital built as are all decent-minded people in the country.  They have fought long and hard to get that hospital built.  They outlined to us very clearly why the current facilities are inadequate.  However, I am still unconvinced that there is not something deeply wrong about this deal that has not been addressed or resolved and that the information that we have been provided with has simply highlighted and crystalised that concern for us, despite assertions from the Government and the Minister that this new state-funded facility to be built by the State in the coming years will be truly State owned and solely State controlled.  That, as I pointed out to the Minister yesterday, is refuted by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Its fact sheet says the opposite to what the Minister is putting across as the case.  Yesterday was interesting because we were once again drip-fed information that had not yet been put on the table.  For example, there will be facilities that do not pertain to maternity or reproductive care located in the new national maternity hospital because other areas of the existing hospital will have been discommoded.  The facilities for dermatology will be there although it is not clear whether those are to be public or private dermatology wards, departments, suites or consultant rooms.  That flies in the face of the excuse that is given to us consistently around why we need the words "clinically appropriate" in the deal and why they need to be repeated six times all over the deal alongside "legally permissible".  The reason we were given was because the consultants and the obstetricians need to know that the new maternity hospital is only for the purposes of reproductive health and maternity purposes.  Yet here we have dermatological clinics, suites or whatever sharing the space of the new maternity hospital.  That does not stack up.  I am extremely worried that that wording will be left in.  Again, I ask the Minister to remove that wording and give a guarantee to the women of Ireland that "clinically appropriate" does not mean that some clinician or a team of clinicians makes decisions over women's lives but that women have control themselves over decisions that need to be made.  We have just heard testimony of one very stark case of why that needs to be done.</p>  <p>  I am also very concerned because during questioning on this here the other day the Taoiseach told us that we had inherited a health and maternity system that is overwhelmingly private and voluntary and has a history of religious and mostly Catholic influence.  He told us that it was not ideally where we would start from but it is where we are.  We are where we are.  It seems that the health service that we have is just an artifact of our history like the natural landscape.  It is there and there is nothing we can do about it.  We have a dysfunctional and broken system for a reason.  It is because political choices were made over the last 100 years by parties, some of which are still in this House and others which are not, that they would hand over chunks of vital public services to be run by the religious orders, namely health and education.  That was not an accident.  It did not happen like the mountains appeared in Kerry.  It was politically and ideologically motivated.  This deal commits to the continuation of that broken system of private, often religious, interests in the care of women's health with the control to some extent over the choices that women want to make not being in their own ambit.</p>  <p>  My opposition to this deal has hardened over the last week.  It hardened further when the Minister said yesterday that even if we fully owned the hospital we could not guarantee that all services would be delivered.  Other HSE hospitals, eight according to the Minister, are not delivering reproductive care that should be available to women, namely abortion.  I asked the Minister in the corridor for the names of the hospitals.  He could not remember them but he said that he would send them to me.  So far, I have not received them.  He then told me that the main reason they are not delivering the service is funding.  Funding has been an issue for most of those hospitals.  That is not the impression he gave Joe Public or the committee yesterday.  The impression he gave was that there was an ideological issue that was crippling the HSE-run hospitals from delivering abortion care.  He has to square that circle.  We need more time, more discussion and more answers.  There is a Byzantine complex structure with guarantees, golden shares and balances in board membership.  There is the exit of the sisters and the promise of an evolving secular group.  All this is necessitated by the determination and utter insistence of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to hold onto the land and to refuse to gift it to the State.</p> <p>At least the nuns were willing to do that.  They want to retain dominance, influence and control over the new national maternity hospital.  I know the Minister does not want that.  He probably thinks the way the Taoiseach does in that we are where we are and we cannot aspire to a fully State-owned and run hospital, although that is what he would like.  If that is what the Minister would like, he should join us on the protest on Saturday at 2 p.m. outside the D&aacute;il, where women in this country will be saying to the Government that we have to move on and that we have to move away from an old and failed model with a suspicion and mistrust of the way business was done written all over it.  We need to control and own that land in its entirety.</p></speech>

Taking a pause over the past ten days was the right thing to do because people have questions and it is up to all of us who have questions, including public representatives, men, women and today's children who may someday be using the new national maternity hospital, to get those answers.  I thank the Minister for already answering some of my questions today and in the briefing he provided to Fine Gael Deputies, Senators and women's network members during the week.  I am glad we had that opportunity to talk this through with the Minister because it is such a complex issue.  It is also an extremely important issue when it comes to the future of women's healthcare.  We should acknowledge that even by having this discussion we are showing how far society has come because as a nation we are seeking assurances there will be no role whatsoever for the church when it comes to the provision of healthcare in Ireland.  Not so long ago we would have accepted religious influence in so many areas of our lives with no questions asked but that time has well and truly passed.</p>  <p>  As a young woman in my 30s, I do not want the church next or near my reproductive rights.  I stood outside the gates of this House demanding that women who were going through maternity care would have their partners with them.  I marched with these women, I campaigned on the repeal of the eighth amendment and I campaigned for the legislation for terminations in Ireland.  It is because of the murky past and the blurred lines between State and church that I am glad the nuns are gone from our healthcare system.  I am glad the Vatican has no role whatsoever in healthcare or maternity care in Ireland because religious influence in healthcare would be as inappropriate as me asking the parish priest to say something in his sermon at Mass.  It is Irish law and not canon law that determines our laws and values as a nation.</p>  <p>  It is the detailed legal advice and political assurances that terminations, sterilisations like tubal ligation and gender-affirming surgeries will all be carried out in our maternity hospital that I trust in.  We need to have the highest standards in healthcare when it comes to our new maternity hospital.  We heard so much discussion of the term "clinically appropriate", which has caused confusion and we need to clear that up.  If that means, as my colleague, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, has said, providing a non-exhaustive and non-exclusive list of procedures and treatments that will take place in the hospital, then that is what we have to do.  We have to spell it out in black and white so there can be no confusion whatsoever that all legally permissible procedures are to be carried out in the new national maternity hospital.  I ask the Minister to provide people with that piece of mind because that is the most important reassurance women need.  We need to know the hospital is legally obliged to provide terminations, sterilisations and gender-affirming surgery.  I know this is the case.  I would not vote for a hospital if I did not believe that, but people watching at home have not had the opportunity to pore over all the legal documents and they need that assurance.  The Minister needs to listen to that request and respond to it.</p>  <p>  From the briefing this week, I understand the Religious Sisters of Charity was sent a one-page document approving its request to divest its interests in healthcare to a secular organisation that we know as St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG.  Just knowing that cleared up so many questions I had, but the public still have those questions.  Will the Minister seek a copy of that formal approval from the Vatican to transfer the Religious Sisters of Charity's shareholding in the group to the new charitable company, thus fully divesting it of any influence over healthcare?  If we had that document and if it could be published, that would alleviate people&rsquo;s concerns.  It would prove the nuns are gone and that they are out of the picture.  There is a narrative out there that they are still involved which we need to clear up, and furnishing a copy of that document would help.</p>  <p>  It is so important we completely alleviate the concerns of the public on this matter because we desperately need the new national maternity hospital.  I want a hospital that is state of the art.  I want a hospital that is co-located so that it is integrated into the existing hospital.  The new hospital will have corridors and not ambulance rides to bridge the physical distance between maternity care and intensive care to provide the best possible care for women and their children.  I cringed when I heard Professor Shane Higgins, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, tell us that, right now, surgeons are packing up surgical tools, putting them in the boots of their cars or in taxis and battling traffic across the city to deliver critical care to women who need it.  In 2022, that is unbelievable.  It is also unbelievable to think our current national maternity hospital, which we are so happy with in so many ways, has two religious appointees on its board and is chaired by the Archbishop of Dublin.  What some might find totally unbelievable is that it still carries out terminations.  Thankfully, our new national maternity hospital will not have any religious ethos, religious representation on the board or religious interference, and it too will carry out terminations.  We need this investment in women&rsquo;s healthcare, we need this state-of-the-art hospital and we need it now rather than later, or as soon as is possible.  We hear from our clinicians and from the people who deliver this care day in, day out.  In them we need to trust.</p></speech>

On that occasion I said I did not believe any Member of this House wanted the national maternity hospital run by a religious order and that is still the case.  Not only is it the case but, following the publication of the documents, it is clear the Government&rsquo;s strategy has been to ensure all legal protections are put in place to make sure there is no religious interference with or limitation on the services that will be provided in the national maternity hospital.</p>  <p>  I echo the points a number of other speakers have made.  I appreciate the time that has been put in during recent weeks to read the documents and for the Minister to do exactly what he promised he would do a number of weeks ago in the House, that he would give time for us to do that.  That has been beneficial and it has allowed us to answer and ask many of the questions because other speakers are correct that we have a long, dark, unhappy and unpleasant history on this issue.  Sometimes answering concerns, even if legal experts believe they are unfounded, is appropriate and it is useful in a public debate on the national maternity hospital.  That is not to undermine the necessity to deliver this project but these two weeks will not significantly delay it and I welcome that.</p>  <p>  I am no expert in any of these areas but I have taken the time to read these documents, particularly the lease because the issue of ownership of the public land seems to be of particular concern.  I can find no legal mechanism in the lease which allows the landlord to interfere with or limit the services in the national maternity hospital.  If there are Members who believe there are ways for the landlord to do that and that therefore freehold is important, I ask them to plot that out.  How do the Pope, the cardinals or the heads of the religious order practically limit the services?  I invite them to show me the conditions in the lease that allow them to do that.  They are not there and, therefore, that issue of public ownership of the land is not one we need to surmount to protect the legally permissible services that will be provided there.  If Members believe we need to surmount this issue, I would like to see the reasons for that, but I cannot find any mechanism in the lease which would enable the landlord to interfere.  Then you move to the issue of the ownership and management of St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, of the clinically independent national maternity hospital and of the combined campus.  In the operating licence and in all the other documents, I cannot find a way where that would happen.</p>  <p>  In all the times I have talked to the Minister about this, I have never mentioned the following.</p> <p>Deputies might be surprised to hear - I was certainly surprised - that I am a former governor of the National Maternity Hospital.  I was very surprised because when I was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin, I was made a governor of the National Maternity Hospital.  The reason I was there was because when the Archbishop of Dublin, who is the chairperson of the National Maternity Hospital, was not able to chair the meetings, I had the responsibility of chairing the meetings.</p> <p> My two children were born in the National Maternity Hospital.  There is much debate about the building being outdated, but the governance model of the current National Maternity Hospital is completely outdated because the Archbishop of Dublin and the Lord Mayor of Dublin chair the board.  I remind people who believe the current model is appropriate or that it allows all legally permissible services that the Archbishop of Dublin is the current chairperson of the National Maternity Hospital.  Based on my assessment as a layperson, I believe the current legally permissible services are available.</p> <p> I welcome the Minister's comments that he will look at that issue of the term "clinically appropriate".  He has done everything to reassure people to this point and I hope he will continue to do that.</p> <p> I stress to people that we need this hospital.  If the current National Maternity Hospital, which is chaired by the Archbishop of Dublin and whose freehold is owned by the Earl of Pembroke, can provide legally permissible terminations and if St Vincent's hospital, which is now a secular hospital, can provide terminations at the moment, then in a hospital which has far greater secularisation - in fact, not only do we have one secular hospital, we now have two secular hospitals as a result of this process - and with all the guarantees I have seen, I can see no reason or method whereby those services could be limited.</p></speech>

Fine Gael helped by Fianna F&aacute;il has already made a fine mess of the financing of the national children's hospital.  Now we have the current debacle with the new national maternity hospital.  The main problem with the national maternity hospital is ambiguity.  We all know the dangers of ambiguity and what can happen when what are understood to be long-standing agreements or principles break down.  Let us consider Roe <i>v.</i>Wade in the United States.  Established law from the early 1970s protecting women's rights to healthcare may be overturned on ideological grounds 50 years later.</p><p>We need to introduce safeguards against any kind of ambiguity or uncertainty.  The best way to do that is to build a public hospital on public land.  This is the very best way to guarantee all services required will be offered to women attending the hospital and it is the best way to protect the State's investment.  I do not understand why the State cannot just own the land.  As it is obviously not a financial issue, what is it?  Why does St. Vincent's Healthcare Group want to keep control over the site?</p><p>I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and we have seen countless times the consequences of major capital projects going over budget and over schedule.  We have seen the consequences of the State being beholden to private enterprises.  The Government, for once, needs to learn from its many mistakes in the past and try to do this properly.  One of the major stumbling blocks has been the &quot;clinically appropriate&quot; clause in the contract.  The rent will be &euro;10 per annum if six terms are complied with, including that there can be no change to permitted use without the consent of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Permitted use is subject to the clinically appropriate text which is undefined.  Clinically appropriate can mean different things to different people in different times.  What might be clear and obvious to the current Minister might not be so to a future anti-choice Minister in 50 years' time.</p><p>The safeguard of the golden share might not be worth a grain of salt in this case.  We need stronger safeguards and Sinn F&eacute;in along with others here feel that a public hospital on public land is the best way to achieve that.  The Government has not given any good reason we cannot do this.  Of course, I understand about the need to avoid delays but I do not think we should proceed as things stand.  There are simply too many unknowns.</p><p>I appreciate that clinicians in the field feel that things can proceed as they are, but our job is to ensure the State gets best value for money and that the rights and the healthcare needs of women in Ireland are protected.  It is not just the Opposition and interest groups who can see this.  Some Ministers and Government Deputies clearly have the same concerns we have, but it has taken some convincing to get them on board.  For the umpteenth time we need a public hospital on public land.  That was the original plan and that is the plan we need.  For once we hope the Minister will listen this time and try to get things right from the get-go.</p></speech>

This debate, sadly, relates to the issue of trust.  In the week we are debating the ownership structure of the national maternity hospital, on Tuesday, during the introduction of the Birth and Information Tracing Bill to rectify the issue of illegal birth registrations, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, offered a formal apology on behalf of the State for the deep hurt and anguish experienced by people whose births were illegally registered.  The Minister said "nothing in these measures can undo the past and fully right the wrongs that these people have experienced".</p>  <p>  Herein lies the problem before us.  Many people feel that any link between the new hospital and the church, albeit through a private company, is a grave insult to the many victims of the church with particular emphasis on those impacted by the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes.  In reality, the nuns have passed the ownership to a company established by the church.  This company will have three representatives on the board of the national maternity hospital and people believe this is a very strong link between the nuns and the ownership and governance of the national maternity hospital.  Members of the HSE board expressed the concern that boards can influence the culture, values and ethics.</p>  <p>  To address this, we have a proposed golden share to be held by the Minister.  The golden share allows the Minister to direct the board to allow relevant lawfully permissible services without religious ethos or other distinction.  The difficulty is that the country has a very poor history with the operation and use of golden shares.</p> <p>The Sugar Act 1991 provided for a golden share in Greencore.  That golden share was not worth the paper it was written on when it came to the abolition of the sugar quota.  The golden, class B shares that are held in Aer Lingus to protect connectivity between Ireland and Heathrow will expire in September.  Why will this particular golden share be different?  How will it be enforced when we have such a poor record of enforcement?</p> <p> I asked the Library and Research Service to look at this issue of the golden share for me.  It has provided me with a paper that states that the EU position on golden shares and foreign direct investment has changed as a result of Covid-19 and member states can, in some cases, have rights that would enable the State to block or set limits on certain types of investments in companies.  The paper goes on to say that while the guidance is directed at foreign direct investment, the general principle of the right or duty of an EU member state to safeguard essential assets, such as healthcare assets, could be read far more broadly.  That is the case in terms of assets, but we are not talking about assets in this case.</p> <p> I asked the Library and Research Service if it could find an example anywhere in Europe where a golden share applies to the provision of healthcare services, as is being proposed here.  The Library and Research Service could not find any example of that.  Will the Minister give me an example of where such a legal provision around a golden share is in operation anywhere else and where it has been enforced?</p> <p> The concern in much of this debate relates to the phrase "clinically appropriate".  It is referenced twice in the constitution of the new company.  It is also in the operating licence that will be issued.  However, it is not included in the clause relating to the golden share.  We might replace the phrase "clinically appropriate" with a separate phrase that is in the clause relating to the golden share to the effect that any maternity, gynaecological, obstetrical and-or neonatal service which is lawfully available shall be available in the new national maternity hospital.  The use of that phrase would overcome many of the concerns we have.  If "clinically appropriate" does not include that broad range of maternity services, why is it written in the clause relating to the golden share and why is there a contradiction in terms between what is provided for in the golden share and what is being provided for in the constitution of the company and in the operating licence?  The Minister might address that point for me.</p> <p> The reality is we need a new national maternity hospital as quickly as possible.  The current facilities are completely unacceptable for women.  However, we need to see a review to address the genuine concerns that have been raised.  With small changes, particularly to address the issues around "clinically appropriate", we can provide the clarity and reassurance that is needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200039#QQ00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution and questions.  The golden share is a name attaching to ministerial powers.  The golden share from many years ago was a name attaching to different powers.  They just happen to have been called the same thing.  What matters to us is what the ministerial powers here are.  There are two very significant powers.  The first is that the reserved powers of the new hospital, which are essentially the things the new hospitals does, can only be changed with the unanimous agreement of the board and that of the Minister for Health.  It is those reserved powers that are so important because they are the powers around providing all services and doing so without any religious ethos.  It is important no such change can be made without the unanimous agreement of the board and the agreement of the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  The second power is a power around being able to intervene directly.  That is an important power that resides in clause 9.1.1 of the articles of association.  It refers to the duties of the directors, one of which is to carry out any direction of the Minister, including in writing, at his or her sole direction, including to ensure, and this goes to the heart of the debate, any maternity, gynaecological, obstetrical or neonatal service which is lawfully permissible in the State shall be available.  That is important.  It does not state those services may be available; they shall be available in the hospital without religious ethos, ethnic or other distinction.  It goes on to say, for the avoidance of doubt, that the directors shall be obliged to comply with any such direction.</p>  <p>  The ministerial power here is important.  Even if the board of directors were to agree unanimously, it does not have the ability to change the purpose of the hospital and the obligations on it.  If somehow the board of directors fails in its duties or all of these amazing clinicians in Holles Street stop providing services, the Minister can directly intervene and instruct the hospital to provide all services and to do so without any religious ethos.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200039#QQ00300"><p>It is important we are having this debate today.  Regardless of one's views, the development of a new national maternity hospital is a major milestone in the delivery of women's healthcare in Ireland.  The women of Ireland deserve better, and we are finally getting it.</p>  <p>  I have not spoken on this topic too much to date.  I have previously stated my concerns around how this project was developing and the need for the State to own the land and site.  I have also flagged the potential need for a compulsory purchase order.  However, having listened to the Minister, numerous clinicians and legal experts, my view has changed.  I believe the current proposal is the best way forward to deliver this project for future generations.</p>  <p>  We all agree a maternity hospital is needed and I hear the concerns being raised by the Opposition and stakeholders.  However, I feel some of the information being shared on this issue is misdirecting the key objective, which is to get this hospital built.</p>  <p>  On the central issue of leasing the site, it is important to note that many primary care centres around Ireland are in buildings and on land owned by, and leased from, third parties.  Nobody would reasonably suggest these landowners dictate what services GPs or other clinicians do or do not offer.  As the Minister said earlier, the State does not own the current national maternity hospital or leading hospitals, such as the Rotunda, the Coombe, the Mater, Cappagh, the eye and ear hospital or the Mercy hospital.  They are public, voluntary hospitals funded by the HSE for their day-to-day operations.  The HSE also invests in their buildings and equipment to ensure the delivery of much-needed public health services.  The national maternity hospital will be the same.</p>  <p>  I, too, had concerns about the potential for certain procedures being curtailed, but again I believe that issue has been cleared up sufficiently.  I am confident the documents published last week clearly show that all procedures under the law that are currently provided at the National Maternity Hospital will be provided in the new maternity hospital in Elm Park.  As already mentioned, that includes termination of pregnancy, provision of contraception services, including tubal ligation, fertility services and gender-affirmation procedures.  The legal framework provides assurances that all clinical services permissible will be provided in clinical practice and will not be subject to any Catholic ethos, or indeed any other religious beliefs, but only according to the best national and international clinical guidelines.  This is made clear in the lease, operating licence and constitution of the new national maternity hospital that were published last week.</p> <p>We are finally on the cusp of getting a world-class facility where women and babies will have the best possible care in a secular hospital, free from religious ethos, where all legally permissible services are provided.  The Government's proposal, the contracts and legal framework ensure this is protected, along with the public good, in this proposal.  I recognise and hear the concerns being raised but I also hear the resounding endorsement of clinicians at the existing National Maternity Hospital for the new hospital, as outlined by the Minister.  Like many others in this House today and those watching this debate, I agree that the existing hospital is not fit for purpose.  The women of Ireland deserve better.</p> <p> I know a woman who is currently attending the National Maternity Hospital having suffered multiple miscarriages.  This woman has to walk corridors filled with expectant mothers, pass rooms of pregnant women waiting for scans and walk by doors bearing end-of-life symbols indicating that the woman inside the room is in the process of loss.  She goes on this journey to get to the mental health unit so that a psychologist can help her to process her difficult miscarriage.  The Victorian layout of the hospital at Holles Street is retraumatising women.  The women of Ireland deserve better.  We are on the cusp of better and it is time to move forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.522" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200040#RR00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate and I thank the Minister for the time he is giving to help us to understand this.</p><p>I think it was Shakespeare, in <i>King Lear</i>, who wrote, &quot;Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.&quot;  More of us might say that the best is the enemy of the good.  There is no doubt that this is not a perfect arrangement.  If we were given a blank sheet of paper and were starting to design our health service from scratch, this is not how we would design it.  However, in Dublin the only adult hospitals with the specialisms we would need to have to give a world-class maternity service are both voluntary hospitals, namely St. Vincent's and the Mater.  That is the reality.  I respect those who say that it would be better if that were not the reality, but it is.  Best care is only going to be provided in the new national maternity hospital if we have that integration.  The new national maternity hospital will give women dramatically better care, with single rooms, double the number of theatres and delivery rooms and massively increased access to new specialisms.</p><p>What must be said though, in recognition of the many concerns articulated by the Opposition and by some Government backbenchers, is that it is very understandable that if one puts the Catholic Church and women's health into the same sentence, a red mist descends for an awful lot of people.  They remember the very painful history and that is extremely understandable.  I can understand why this debate generates so much feeling among many people and that feeling is very genuine.  However, our job is to look in detail at the partnership that is to be forged between an adult specialist hospital with a huge range of specialisms and the new national maternity hospital.  That is what we are trying to do in this process.  The first thing to say is that the church will have absolutely no role.  A lot of people outside the House do not appreciate that this is the case - that the nuns have given over all of their interest.  What remaining interest in the land that they held has now been transferred to a secular trust, operated under Irish charity law and with no role whatsoever in relation to the running of the hospital.  </p><p>The second thing that strikes me is that the new hospital is going to be obliged to deliver all lawful abortions, sterilisations and other interventions, not only by its constitution which we have seen published, but also by the licence it operates under from the HSE, by the public interest directors who make up its board and by the golden share operated by the Minister.  This is not just a triple lock, which we know of in other circumstances, but a quadruple lock that is being provided.  It is far, far more than is the case with the current National Maternity Hospital, it has to be said.</p><p>I would have been among those who would have liked to see outright ownership, but ownership under a 300-year lease is ownership.  Anyone who buys an apartment in this State knows that and that is the reality.  We may question why St. Vincent's Hospital Group wants to retain a lease and not surrender full ownership.  It has said that is an absolute requirement of its partnership in this project.  The reasons it is offering are understandable at one level.  These hospitals will have shared corridors and shared staff and are going to be wholly integrated on a site that has many other operations.  One can see from St. Vincent's point of view why it would want to protect its wider operations on the site by having a lease arrangement and not outright ownership.  To be fair, under pressure from Ministers, the group has come a long way in terms of the way the lease has been drawn up.</p><p>It must be borne in mind that the idea of a CPO, involving going to the courts, would be very hostile to any partnership arrangement.  Also, it is very difficult to CPO something that is not going to be a detached hospital on its own grounds.  This is going to be an integrated hospital, with shared corridors and so on.  It would be very difficult to procure this by CPO.  The outcome would be uncertain and it would certainly wreck the concept of partnership that is at the heart of this project.</p><p>I have listened to Deputies and to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith in particular, whose views I might not agree with but I always respect the sincerity with which she expresses them.  Her position is that we should not start out from here.  I do not want to be putting words into her mouth but there are many who hold the view that there should be no private medicine in the Irish public health service, that there should be no non-State ownership and no voluntary trusts of this nature, but that is not the health service that we are trying to adapt to provide care for women who need it urgently and who are currently being treated in unsafe arrangements.  It is really important that we start from what is possible, not from what is the ideal.  As I said at the outset, the best is the enemy of the good.</p><p>I would like to ask the Minister to clarify a couple of things, the first being why it is necessary for the national maternity hospital to be a subsidiary of St. Vincent's Hospital Group.  It is not clear to me why that condition is there.  Like others, I would like the phrase &quot;clinically appropriate&quot; to be clarified.  Reference has been made to the fact that there are limited specialisms going to be available in this particular hospital, which is understandable, that services evolve over time and that we want to protect the maternity and neonatal service but I agree with other Deputies that some clarifying statement around that phrase would be useful.  There is a recognition that the Minister's words, when these arrangements were put in place, would carry considerable weight when anyone is looking at this subsequently, in a legal context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200040#RR00300"><p>I am speaking on behalf of Deputy Mattie McGrath, who sends his apologies.  He cannot be here today because he is having a surgical procedure carried out.</p>  <p>  The plan to move the National Maternity Hospital from Holles Street in central Dublin to the St. Vincent's campus has been in train since 2013, but the project has been mired in controversy for many years.  The Religious Sisters of Charity have even transferred the ownership of the lands at St. Vincent's to an independent entity which is to lease the new maternity hospital site to the State for 299 years.  Unfortunately, critics with fanatical agendas are claiming that a Catholic religious ethos would live on, possibly compromising the hospital's power to carry out different procedures on women.  These claims are false and completely inaccurate as the new hospital will have operational and clinical independence to deliver all services that are permitted in the State.</p>  <p>  In order to progress the delivery of a new national maternity hospital through the leasing of the site, a final sign off at Government level is now required.  Reports indicate that under the proposed lease agreement, the HSE will own the building on a ground lease of 299 years and there will be a change to the board composition.  The ongoing delays and foot-dragging by the Government mean that the construction costs for the new hospital have skyrocketed.  The project will be funded with public moneys.  Conservative estimates put the cost at &euro;1 billion to build and fit out the hospital.  Only incompetent public procurement practices would allow a project that started out with an estimated cost of around &euro;200 million to climb fivefold in just a few years.  </p> <p>In all, everyone should satisfy themselves that a number of factors are fully addressed, including several factual positions.  Will the State own the hospital?  The answer to this question is a clear &quot;Yes&quot;.  The hospital will be the national State-owned hospital, built and funded by the State.  The State will own it on a leasehold basis for the next 299 years.  Will the State own the land on which it is built?  No. There will, however, be a 299-year lease at a rent of &euro;10 per year.  That rent can only be increased if the HSE tries to use the site for purposes other than healthcare.  Who will actually run the hospital?  The hospital will be run by a charity regulated under charities law and it will be managed by board of trustees.  No one will have a controlling interest and nobody will have a beneficial interest, except the Minister for Health who will have a golden share to protect the core values of the hospital.  What role will religion play?  None whatsoever.  The Sisters of Charity have left healthcare in Ireland.  Their shareholding in St. Vincent's has been transferred to another charity, not a private company as some allege.  It is a charity regulated by law.  The constitution of that charity makes no reference whatsoever to religious ethos.  Furthermore, at the moment in Holles Street all of the obstetric, neonatal and general gynaecological care permissible within Irish law is available.  Will all of that continue under the new hospital?  The answer to that question is &quot;Yes&quot;.  With these questions clearly addressed and answered, it is clear that the project must proceed on from the decision in the publicised minutes.  We must respect the views of those who are dissenting but not allow this to derail the building of the maternity hospital.  We must accept that the best protections for a truly national maternity hospital are in place.<br/><br/>Members of this House and some commentators have wrongly attacked the Religious Sisters of Charity and have made all kinds of unfounded accusations against the order.  A letter published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>in November last, from Sr. Patricia Lenihan, the superior general with the Religious Sisters of Charity, outlined in the clearest possible terms the role, or otherwise, played by the order.  Another letter published in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 4 May written by the chair of St. Vincent's University Healthcare Group, Mr. James Menton, addressed the outrageous misinformation and disinformation circulating about the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  The letter also addressed the Religious Sisters of Charity issue.  It confirmed that they have left the group and have no further involvement in it.  The group is an absolutely secular institution.  The contents of these letters paint a very different picture from those being painted by the people who wish to bash the Catholic Church on this issue.  That bashing is all about political point-scoring and is nothing more than trying to use the situation for political gain.<br/><br/>It is also worth stating that the Religious Sisters of Charity have consistently called on the Minister for Health to speed up the transfer of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to facilitate it as soon as possible.  The congregation has continuously insisted that it will have no role in the new national maternity hospital to be constructed on the site.  The congregation withdrew its sisters from the board of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group in 2007.  In 2020, they gifted 29 acres of land of the site of St. Vincent's Hospital to the State, and 3.2 acres of land to St. Michael's Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  In fact, the sisters have done everything in their power to expedite the transfer to the new independent charity which is St. Vincent's Hospital Holdings, so that the new hospital could progress.  The delays to this project are completely due to the other parties involved, including the Minister, failing to take all actions necessary to facilitate the completion of the transfer as soon as possible.  The ownership of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which owns the lands, will be transferred to the new independent charity, St. Vincent's Holdings.  The Religious Sisters of Charity have said that they now own only one building on the St. Vincent's Hospital site, which is and will continue to be leased to the healthcare group, in order to provide income for their continuing work and for the care of their elderly sisters.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, nuns in Ireland have been stereotyped in Irish public debate to the extent that they have been reduced to the role of villains.  Perhaps then it is no coincidence that when the news first emerged that the new national maternity hospital is to be built on a site on the south side of Dublin that is owned by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, and for it to be owned by that trust, all hell broke loose simply because the Sisters of Charity own the trust.  That trust has a 14-person board and two elderly sisters sit on it.  The new maternity hospital will replace the current hospital on Holles Street, which is no longer considered fit for purpose.  After tortuous negotiations between Holles Street and the trust, it was agreed that the new maternity hospital would have full independence although the trust, and therefore the sisters, would own it.  I cannot understand.  We should actually be debating the new children's hospital, including when it will be finished and why it ran over budget, but instead we have spent so much time on something that is quite simply and easily sorted.  I put it to the Minister that we must get on with it and go ahead with it.  The debating is over.  The Sisters of Charity have basically gifted it to the country and we should make use of it.</p></speech>

This is not just confined to the past: it is here and now.  There was a reference to &quot;red mist&quot; in an earlier contribution.  This is a red mist that many thousands of women in the State have experienced.</p><p>To my mind there are very serious issues relating to trust in the context of the establishment of St. Vincent's Holdings.  I want to refer to the so-called &quot;fact sheet&quot; issued last week by the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  On the question of whether St. Vincent's Holdings CLG is an offshore company, it says &quot;No&quot; and suggests that the services of PwC were used to form St. Vincent's Holdings.  They confirm that St. Vincent's Holdings is an Irish incorporated company, that no offshore companies were used in its incorporation, and that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group comprises only Irish incorporated and resident companies.  This is factually incorrect.  Two offshore companies, Porema Limited and Stembridge Limited, were instructed by PwC to set up St. Vincent's Holdings.  The reasons for using offshore companies generally by companies is to mask the real instructions given in setting up a company.  Only those involved in the setting up of St. Vincent's Holdings know what instructions they were given and who gave the instructions.</p><p>We do not know the exact nature of the St. Vincent's Holdings.  Is there a public <i>juridic </i>person under Canon Law, as are the Sisters of Charity as a religious order?  We cannot know the actual facts because we do not have access to the full application made by the sisters to the Vatican.  We do not have access to all correspondence to and from the Vatican, and no access to the shareholder agreement between the Religious Sisters of Charity and the directors and owners of St. Vincent's Holdings.  We do not know what conditions were attached to the transfer of the assets of the Religious Sisters of Charity in the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to the St. Vincent's Holdings.  These assets, including three hospitals, are estimated at above &euro;500 million.  It is inconceivable that the Vatican, having consulted with the archbishop of Dublin, Diarmuid Martin, and the president of the Irish Episcopal Conference and the apostolic nuncio to Ireland, Eamon Martin, would have agreed to transfer such assets to a charitable company without strenuous conditions being attached.  The idea that the Government is prepared to do a deal without knowing who or what they are dealing with is simply wrong.</p><p>The St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's so-called &quot;fact sheet&quot; is a seven-page document and manages not once to mention or refer to the issue of termination of pregnancy.  We need clarification on the issue of what is appropriate medical care.  Everybody has said that we need clarification on that.  It needs to be stated quite simply, in a legal document, that tubal ligation, sterilisation, gender affirmation, abortion and contraception will be part of the services in the national maternity hospital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200041#SS00300"><p>I have three and half minutes and I could make a lot of comments but I will try to be focused.  I have read and struggled through the documents as best I can and what I see before me is that an unholy mess has been created.  I have with me just some of the documents we have tried to download on the computer.  That unholy mess completely suits the entity that is St. Vincent's Holdings, under the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, and under that the new maternity hospital DAC, each of which is a complete subsidiary of the other.  We cannot get away from the trinity.  We have the male trinity at the top and we have the male trinity here.  We simply cannot get away from it, it would seem.</p>  <p>  We are here today because of the outrage, the upset and the lack of trust by the majority of women and men in Ireland on this.  I disagree with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I have the greatest of respect for the Minister of State but there has been little or no debate on this other than what was forced by the Opposition repeatedly.  We used three Private Members' motions, and Sinn F&eacute;in also used time, to force the debate.  There are committed people on the ground who have been demonised for daring to ask a question.  I will now go around in a circle and we will start in 2013, although it all started before that with the accountants report.  In 2013 the male Minister for Health tells us that co-location is wonderful and that we all agree.  I was not in the D&aacute;il at the time but I will take the experts' advice that co-location is the way to go.</p> <p>Fast-forward four Ministers later and there is no co-location anymore but complete integration into the trinity of ownership of private companies - the Minister shook his head earlier - albeit with charity status.  Let us make English mean something here - they are private companies.  The changes that have happened from the Mulvey agreement, which I welcome, are simply that we are now appointing three directors to the new company, which is a welcome change, and there is also a golden share.  I have no idea what that means other than what I have read, but it does not reassure me in any way in this sense.  I do not know how that is going to operate.  What is the process around that?  If somebody is at a disadvantage in the hospital because it is not being run the way it should, will that woman, man or anybody in that family be able to appeal to the Minister?  Does the Minister understand that?  We need guidelines around when and how that lovely golden share will be used.</p> <p> We have a situation where St. Vincent's or whatever it was named absolutely refused to give over ownership.  This Government and previous Governments never come back and said, look, it is not giving us ownership, therefore, we are going for a completely different model.  The Minister never told us when the nuns gifted their share to the new entity and on what basis.  Was Revenue involved in that?  What was the value of it?  I understand that at some point, it was a &euro;600 million value.  What value was it?  What conditions were attached to it, if any?  The Minister might clarify that.  It has never been clarified.  Has anyone seen the correspondence under which they were allowed to divest that very valuable asset to a new entity?  Where is all the correspondence around that?</p> <p> The phrase "clinically appropriate" has meant so many things to different people to whom I have listened.  Sometimes it means all legally permitted procedures, and we are supposed to be reassured by that.  Then, we hear from other experts that it means we are not going to have brain surgery.  Can you imagine?  We are not going to have other services here because it is a maternity hospital.</p> <p> I have no idea really why we cannot have a public hospital on a public site.  I say to Deputy Michael Collins that it is not ownership.</p></speech>

Leasehold is not ownership; it is leasehold of the land.  We do not even own the hospital.  The Minister might say it is technical but there is no ownership here whatsoever.  We finish up by going around in a circle and blame those who dare to ask a question.  Does the Minister know when I despaired the most?  It was when the deputy chair of the National Maternity Hospital went on the national airwaves to reassure us.  I have to say, quite honestly and openly, a Cheann Comhairle, that I thought, sweet Jesus, what have we done as women to allow somebody like this speak in our name and attempt to reassure us that we own this hospital?

I look forward to what I expect will be a constructive and engaging debate this afternoon.</p>  <p>  We are living, working and farming through a hugely historic and turbulent period for our great agricultural sector.  Even before the illegal invasion of Ukraine and the impact that has had on our sector, our farmers, fishers and food producers have been proactively embracing a new reality of food production.  This is a reality in which we are mandated to feed a growing global population with safe, sustainable and healthy food with an even greater emphasis of doing so in harmony with nature.  At primary producer level, this is a challenge that farmers have grasped with both hands and on which they are leading out.  In fact, I firmly believe that our food sector has been to the forefront of playing a leadership role in climate-proofing our economy.  This underlines that our sector is one that has always been innovating, pioneering and facing down any and all challenges as they arise.</p>  <p>  I will begin by reflecting on the impact of the war in Ukraine.  On behalf of the Government, once again, I utterly condemn the illegal invasion by Russia of Ukraine.  We are also mindful of the terrible toll being inflicted on Ukrainian citizens.  At a time when we have our stock to grass, lambs and calves are with their mothers in the fields and the buzz of silage season is soon to be upon us, we see our farming counterparts in Ukraine dealing with the realities of war.  What were cornfields are now, in many instances, battlefields.  While we must be cognisant of the awful reality facing the people of Ukraine, our focus is also on attempting to protect our farm families in Ireland from the worst effects of the impacts of the war.  Supply chains have been disrupted and inputs have been extremely volatile.</p>  <p>  As a Government and as a people, we remain resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine.  We reiterate the call on Russia to cease all hostilities immediately and withdraw from Ukraine unconditionally.  I welcome the strong solidarity shown by Ireland and our people and by the European Union with Ukraine in the face of its illegal invasion.  We will work with EU partners to consider and implement appropriate responses.  This includes ensuring that food security is maintained for EU citizens and the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context.</p>  <p>  While Ireland has recently come out first in the world on the Economist Impact global food security index, and the European Union is largely self-sufficient for food with a massive agrifood trade surplus, it is important that we do not become complacent about food security.  We also need to keep in mind those who are living in countries that are many times less fortunate than ours.  Ireland is providing some &euro;20 million in humanitarian assistance to the UN and the Red Cross to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  My Department also provides flexible funding of &euro;25 million per year to the UN World Food Programme, supporting that organisation to provide a flexible, timely response to humanitarian crises.</p>  <p>  Millions of people have now fled Ukraine to seek refuge in the EU.  We have operated an open-door policy to support any Ukrainians fleeing to here and this will continue to be the case.  In my Department, and through the State agencies that report to me, we have played a leadership role.  More than 50 Ukrainians have been welcomed by Teagasc at Ballyhaise College in County Cavan and a further 35 have been welcomed in Clonakilty Agricultural College in County Cork.  I thank both colleges for their efforts.</p>  <p>  Looking more specifically at both my own and this Government's response to this crisis, as I said earlier, our clear focus is on insulating our farm families as much as possible from the trade shock suffered as a result of the war and on supporting them in being able to continue to produce the food that is so important domestically and internationally at this time.  Since the invasion of Ukraine, I have taken a proactive approach to dealing with the massive challenges facing our agrifood and fish sectors.  Obviously, farming is not alone in dealing with these challenges but our great sector is particularly exposed as a result of the invasion, and we are working hard to support farm families through this situation.</p>  <p>  I have operated a twin-track approach to the crisis with advisory measures and targeted financial supports for farm families.  In early March, shortly after the invasion occurred, I met the main farm organisations and Teagasc to discuss the impact on Irish agriculture and supply chains.  I also met members of the Irish Grain and Feed Association and representatives of the fertiliser industry.  I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee and tasked it with the preparation of a response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs and with developing contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.</p> <p>I will continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on this significant challenge.</p> <p> Within my Department, I have also established a rapid response team, chaired by the Secretary General, to monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains actively and to contribute to the whole-of-government response to the crisis.  Over the past two months, I have announced targeted measures worth in the region of &euro;90 million to support the agriculture sector directly, including a &euro;20 million package in two separate parts for the pig sector.  These two separate supports will see &euro;90,000 paid to farmers.  There will also be &euro;12 million for the growing of new tillage crops as well as multispecies swards and red clover, both of which will help reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser.  Furthermore, there will be &euro;3 million for the horticulture sector, a very important domestic market we need to protect.  I was glad to work with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in delivering this.  These measures will help Irish farmers at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the events in Ukraine.  I thank my Cabinet colleagues, and in particular the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for helping to deliver these important supports.  They are real and tangible examples of the Government's commitment to the agri and farming sectors.</p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, Ireland imports significant volumes of animal feedstuffs, including feed from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.  Russia and Ukraine are significant sources of global cereal exports, so the price and the availability of cereals globally have been significantly impacted.  As of today, there appear to be sufficient supplies of animal feed and Irish importers are actively competing in the global market to ensure the supply will continue uninterrupted.  Fodder availability on farms for next winter depends on several factors, particularly the level of grass growth and silage production this year, but there appears to be a decent bank of silage on farms carried over from the winter.</p> <p> Nevertheless, it is crucial we do not stand still and expect this to be the case over the coming winter and into the spring.  To that end, I am developing a measure to assist cattle and sheep farmers in producing fodder for next winter and I will shortly release further details on a scheme that will pay farmers up to &euro;1,000 to save hay and silage.  It will be paid at a rate of &euro;100 on the first 10 ha, up to &euro;1,000 per farm.  My key message to farmers concerns the absolute importance of growing grass this year, saving fodder and hay and making use of the growing season that is ahead of us to do that, and I have committed strongly to them that they will be supported in the form of up to &euro;1,000.  I am conscious the war in Ukraine has seen issues with both the affordability and the availability of fertiliser and that this could result in challenges for next winter, which is why I have moved to introduce the scheme.  While most cattle and sheep are now out on grass, I am conscious the winter season is just finishing for some.  We must think prudently when it comes to silage and grain to ensure we will have more than enough to cover the level of stock on an individual farm.  In essence, what farmers plan to breed they must also plan to feed.</p> <p> Even before the war in Ukraine, I was conscious of the rising price of fertiliser and of the overall need to reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser.  Accordingly, last October, I tasked Teagasc with developing a roadmap to aid our transition away from using artificial fertilisers.  I subsequently launched the Teagasc soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign, a credible plan farmers are already using that will be good both for the environment and for farmers' pockets and bottom lines.  As we know, Russia accounts for 22% of our fertiliser, so we have to plan in the short and long terms in light of that.  Fertiliser merchants have indicated they are confident they will be able to meet the demand for fertiliser, although there are a number of challenges in sourcing product at the moment.  There may be issues with the availability of certain products at times and importers are active in securing alternative supply lines where necessary.  All farmers are encouraged to review their requirements in order that they can secure fertiliser supply if that is not already in place, and it is important all farms put in place a nutrient management plan to set their farms to grow the grass required for the winter and spring ahead.  Advisers will assist farmers with this plan.  A Teagasc survey found most tillage and dairy farmers have secured their fertiliser requirements for the moment, while dry stock farmers, many of whom plan on spreading less fertiliser on grazing ground, are finding it more difficult to secure their fertiliser requirements.  Almost half of all dry stock farmers who were surveyed two to three weeks ago had yet to spread a chemical fertiliser, a concern that has led me to bring forward the &euro;1,000 scheme to incentivise farmers to save hay and silage.</p> <p> I am also aware of the issues relating to horticulture and have engaged, along with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, with the sector.  Energy is a significant input for many horticultural enterprises, given crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers and mushrooms are grown indoors in glasshouses and protected greenhouse structures.  I am glad to have been able to bring forward a &euro;3 million support package for the sector, working closely with the Minister of State, which will assist high-wire and mushroom growers as well as field-vegetable and apple farmers.  Further details on this support package will be made known shortly.</p> <p> Overall, our sector is one that relies on fuel of various types, from road, agricultural and marine diesel to natural gas.  The year 2020 saw fuel prices at their lowest in a decade, while 2021 and this year have seen fuel prices increase to their highest in a decade.  This is adding a significant additional cost to farmers, processors, road hauliers and the fishing industry.  For many farmers, energy costs have increased by between 80% and 100% in the past year.  While we cannot cover all aspects of the input price increases, we have to take a proactive and rapid step to insulate farm families as best as possible, and that is certainly the approach we have been taking.  I again mention the pig sector and the challenging circumstances it continues to face, which both the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and I are monitoring closely.  Bringing forward that package to the tune of a maximum of &euro;90,000 per farm has been crucial in supporting the sector at this time, and I recognise the work of that Minister of State in sharing the round table on the sector over recent months and working with stakeholders.  We will continue to work to support the sector and to finalise the scheme, which we will launch shortly.</p> <p> The seafood sector has been impacted especially hard by the crisis.  The price of marine fuel remains a matter of concern for our fishing fleet and the broader seafood sector.  This is the most recent crisis to hit our seafood sector in recent years and those crises are having a cumulative impact.  The Government is acutely aware of the impact rising prices are having on businesses throughout the country, but while the European Commission has provided additional flexibility regarding the use of funds under the EU fisheries fund in the context of the fuel crisis, additional funds have not been made available by the EU.  The impacts of Brexit and the trade and co-operation agreement also continue to be a significant concern for our seafood sector and coastal communities.  That is why in recent days, I launched the tie-up scheme, providing for two tie-up opportunities of three months' duration each.  This will mean boats will have an opportunity to tie up for one month in three and will be paid over the course of that month on an equivalent basis to what their income would have been over that time.  As a result, the remaining two thirds of boats that are fishing in a given month will have a 50% higher quota to fish.  Moreover, it will help improve the margins for the boats that fish in those months, while the other one third of boats will be able to avail of the tie-up scheme at the same time.  The scheme will run in two three-month tranches and will be a strong support for fishermen at what is a challenging time for them.</p> <p> Earlier today, I was glad to be able to announce a &euro;45 million investment in our seafood processing sector.  This, too, is a crucial part of our sector, responsible for more than 4,000 jobs nationally.  While I continue to fight at every opportunity at European level to improve our situation with regard to the national quota, it is crucial we maximise the value of the fish we are catching and the quota we have, and that the value of every fish that is landed will be maximised both for fishers and coastal communities and for employment.  The &euro;45 million sum is an unprecedented investment in our processing sector that is targeted at adding value to the fish we catch in order that we will maximise the value of the fish that is landed and extract the maximum value and income.  Of course, alongside that, as has been the case throughout my tenure as Minister, I will fight tooth and nail at European level, not least in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy review, to seek every way to improve our opportunities regarding our overall national quota.</p> <p>Since the publication of the report of the seafood task force, Navigating Change, my Department has been working across the board to examine urgently its recommendations.  We have also brought forward a number of schemes over recent months.  The seafood sector is undoubtedly facing one of the most significant challenges in decades, coming immediately after the challenges posed by the pandemic and Brexit.  I will continue to work very closely with the sector to support it.</p> <p> As I said at the beginning, our great agriculture sector is facing some of its most significant challenges, as is our marine sector.  Many of these are challenges we have not seen before.  In times like these, it is crucial that we take a proactive approach and that we take steps to limit any potential disruption to our feed and supply chains.  I know that farmers, fishers and the agrifood sector will rise to these challenges and meet them head on.  By working collectively and collaboratively, we can ensure that the sector is insulated against the worst of what may come from supply chain disruption but the coming weeks and months will undoubtedly be challenging.  I want the House to know that I stand in full support of our farmers and fishers, their families and their businesses throughout this period of historic upheaval.  The road ahead will be challenging but we will get through it because it is in our DNA to persevere and flourish in times of adversity.  There are businesses and consumers across the globe who rely on our amazing produce as a source of safe, sustainable and healthy food.  These are our calling cards and what makes our agrifood and fisheries sector the world-class industries they are today.</p></speech>

I will take eight and a half minutes.  I thank the Minister for his opening statement and for being here alongside the Minister of State.  I welcome the fact that we are having this debate.  To give credit where it is due, I commend Deputy Mattie McGrath for persistently calling for this debate, which is very timely.  I apologise that I will have to leave before the debate is over.</p>  <p>  The Minister has a tough job at a very difficult time in Irish agriculture.  In fairness, he gets some things right as issues arise, although he also gets some things wrong.  However, what is consistently lacking in all of his deliberations, including in the speech he has just given, is a vision for Irish farming, Irish food and Irish agriculture.  That is concerning.  We need to have an ambitious vision.  We need to recognise the challenges the sector is facing and put in place measures to address those challenges and to provide for that unique and very important aspect of Irish farming, the family farm model.  We know that it is a model worth preserving.  It is good for rural communities.  In fact, many towns and villages would be nothing were it not for the network of family farms.  They are the nearest thing those towns and villages have to an industry.  They are also good for the economy.  The family farm network was our saviour during the financial crash because family farmers do not operate at the whim of shareholders, stock markets or international investors.  They do not up and leave whenever supply chains get disrupted.  They are here for the long haul.  I also argue that our family farm network is good for food security and for the quality of our produce.  There are approximately 135,000 farms in this State.  We have to work together to protect them and to ensure they employ best practices and will be here into the future.</p>  <p>  The truth is that certain hallmarks have become embedded in agricultural policy not just domestically but at EU level that put this model under threat.  Farmers have been encouraged, incentivised and, in some cases, forced to intensify and specialise.  We see the challenges that presents.  As farmers intensify and specialise, they also become more vulnerable.  Certain sectors may sometimes have good years but they are often incredibly vulnerable to international shocks, as we have seen in the current situation where input costs are out of control and prices are dictated by processors and retailers.  Farmers are increasingly being asked to do more with less support.</p>  <p>  The Minister did not say much about the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which will be a crucial aspect of how we move forward.  We welcome some parts of his strategic plan.  Some of the gross inequalities that have formed part of the fabric of successive Common Agricultural Policies have been addressed.  We have seen some movement on upper payment limits, front-loading and convergence but it has been far too slow and these changes are coming at a time when the CAP budget is reducing, which is a fact the Minister has consistently refused to accept.</p>  <p>  We have had a number of discussions on the strategic plan, although they were very limited.  The Minister refused our request to bring the plan before the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate.  The European Commission saw the CAP strategic plan before any farmer or any Opposition Member or member of the Minister's own party in this House did.  That is not the way to do business.  When we are talking about a CAP strategic plan that could have implications for Irish farming for generations, there should be a collective effort on the part of the Irish Parliament so that we have all bought into it.  The European Commission sent the Minister back what can only be described as a scathing communication.  We still do not know whether the Minister is going to come back to this House to engage with us and to address some of the issues.</p>  <p>  The truth is that Irish farmers will not survive unless they get fair prices for their produce.  The Minister referenced significant and unsustainable increases in input costs and some of the supports that have been made available, supports I would describe as minimal and, all too often, too little too late.  He referenced the crisis reserve but has yet to give a commitment that his Government will co-finance that crisis reserve to the maximum permitted, 200%.  I hope he will take the opportunity to do so today.  We still do not know whether Irish farmers will see a benefit from the Brexit adjustment reserve fund or whether important sectors, such as the pig sector and others, will be able to survive into the future.</p>  <p>  The truth is that, if we want the model of Irish farming to be one of premiumisation and for it to be sustainable and in line with our climate obligations and all of the stated objectives of Members of this House, a premium price must be paid for that premium product.  It is absolutely ludicrous that the best model of beef production in the world, that of the Irish suckler beef herd, continues to operate at a loss.  One of the things that needs to happen in that regard is that an enforcement authority needs to be introduced that can monitor the processors and retailers that have strangled the sector for far too long and hold them to account.  I have often said here and elsewhere that there is money to be made in Irish beef.  That is the big secret of Irish agriculture.  The problem is that the people who are making that money are not the people who are doing the work, our primary producers.  The Minister has promised an office for transparency and fairness rather than the meat regulator we would like to see.  I again appeal to him to work with us to ensure that authority becomes a corporate enforcement authority that has full access to the accounts of processors and retailers in respect of the food they sell so that our farmers can finally have a level playing field.</p>  <p>  The Minister's targets in respect of organics are one of the areas where the needs of the environment and those of Irish farming can coincide but those targets are absolutely pathetic, even compared to those of other EU states.  Rather than leading the charge in developing our organic sector, we are following at the rear in every sense of the word.  We know that, quite naturally, farmers will only move to organics if they see it as a secure move to make.  The way to make it a secure move is to guarantee that they will get a premium price for their new premium product.  That means the Government must be committed to ensuring that Irish organic products are marketed in a coherent and long-standing way.  Through the procurement policies of every Government Department, we have to ensure that every cent of taxpayers' money that is spent on the procurement of food prioritises locally-produced home-grown organic food.</p> <p> In respect of climate action, there are dozens of ways in which our farmers want to play their part and rather than supports, this Government is putting in place barriers in regard to low emissions slurry spreading, solar energy, anaerobic digestion and organics, as I have mentioned.  In every one of those areas, the Government is always far too slow to act but always far too quick to implement the provisions that penalise farmers in much the same way as workers and families.  It is time for a sea change.  It is time to have a vision for a family farm network that will last not just a year, not just the lifetime of a Government, but for successive generations.</p></speech>

The Minister was at a public meeting there in recent weeks and he saw at first hand the scale of the anger and frustration.  That is not just today or yesterday as it has been building up for many years.  There has to be a solution to this.  What is being asked of our industry, fishermen and fish producers in Killybegs is not asked of anybody else anywhere in Europe.  I spoke that night and the Minister will have heard my comments, but I want to put them on the D&aacute;il record so anybody with an interest can understand.</p>  <p>  As we speak, in Killybegs, in a fish factory that I have seen with my own eyes, when fish are landed to be weighed, in that one factory alone there are ten CCTV cameras trained on the weighing system that belong to and are fully controlled by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, the regulator.  SFPA staff can keep an eye while not even leaving their office in Killybegs and they can watch the weighing happening in real time.  If they want to be there physically, they can also do that.  If they want to go around to the back end of the factory and check the trolleys, and check there is 20 kg in every box and 60 boxes, which is 1.2 tonnes, it is not hard to do.  They have cameras trained 24 hours a day and it can be recorded for 31 days.</p>  <p>  I ask where in Ireland today is there any industry in the private sector that would accept the regulator having eyes on it 24 hours a day.  That is what they are willing to accept in Killybegs to address the concerns that may be there.  That is what is in place right now.  How on earth can our regulator not tell Europe to look at the scale of the oversight we have, which is unimaginable and would not be tolerated anywhere else in Europe?  However, that is the scale we have and that is what we have achieved, and that is still not good enough for the SFPA or, indeed, the Government and the Minister to put to the European Commission.  The Minister knows in his heart that it is outrageous, even if there was any justification for the concerns, but we have got to the point where even that is not acceptable.</p>  <p>  We are denied quota so we are denying fish to our own fishermen.  These factories would love to be producing fish landed by Irish vessels but they have to keep people at work, so vessels from other countries - from Norway and Denmark &ndash; have been landing in recent weeks.  They land at the pier and no matter what weighing system they use, there is only a 2% allowance for the water.  The Minister can imagine blue whiting that has to be maintained at 30%, 40% or 50% volume of refrigerated water to keep it fresh in order to comply with European food safety regulations.  Yet, there is only a 2% allowance for the water even though it is about 30% or 40% water to keep it fresh and safe.  The Minister can clearly see that that is madness, whereas it can just be taken up to the factory, where there are ten CCTV cameras trained on it.  This is bureaucratic madness and the Minister knows it is wrong, but it is not getting sorted out.</p>  <p>  To make things worse, rather than turn their fish for human consumption into fish meal, two of the vessels landed in Derry and 40 trailers transported the fish to Killybegs just to make a point.  We must remember that the harbour in Derry is designated as a European Union harbour and it is included in the Irish protocol that we are all talking about right now.  Our own Irish State agency is now saying to these factories in Killybegs, which were just making a point that this is bureaucratic madness, that their weighing permits are being removed and it is taking their livelihood away from them in real terms because they landed in a harbour &ldquo;outside of Ireland&rdquo;.  They are suggesting that Derry is outside of Ireland.  They are doing the British Conservative party's job for it.  They are basically enforcing a hard border and ignoring the protocol that we all fought for.  The Minister knows that is the political reality, whatever way they want to phrase it.</p>  <p>  I state again that there are seven designated harbours in the North of Ireland.  My understanding is that 150 landings of fish came through the North to Irish fish producers in the last four months, and some 35% of the seafood that comes into the Twenty-six Counties - the Republic of Ireland - comes through the North.  This is the practice.  I believe that what is happening is vindictive.  I believe the factories that made a stand, stood up for themselves and said they cannot take this anymore, that this is totally unreasonable and would not be seen anywhere in Europe, are being punished for making that stand.</p>  <p>  The Minister cannot let this continue.  I appeal to the Minister and the Taoiseach, who stands over the shared island plan and the shared island unit that is funded and envisioned by him.  How on earth can we talk about a shared island when we say that to land fish in Derry is outside of Ireland?  We know what is happening here.  These factories took a stand.  The community in Killybegs took a stand.  They said they are not going to be criminalised anymore, they are not going to let themselves be misrepresented and they are not going to destroy their industry.  Boats will just turn away if this is the way they are going to be treated and if there is a chance that their catch could be devalued in that way.</p>  <p>  I am taking all of my speaking time today on this issue.  There are so many things I could say about fisheries but I am asking the Minister and the Taoiseach to please intervene with the SFPA to return to common sense and to make sure that the people of the south-west Donegal and Killybegs have a future in the fishing industry.  I ask them to please do that as urgently as they can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.544" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200045#WW00300"><p>In the short time that I have, there are many points that I wish to cover.  I want to start with the BRIDE Project, which will be familiar to many people who are concerned with biodiversity and partnership with the agriculture and farming sector.  This is a project situated in north County Cork.  I had the good fortune to visit the project on Monday last with the Labour Party leader, Deputy Ivana Bacik.  I want to express my gratitude to Donal Sheehan, Sin&eacute;ad Hickey and all of the team there for facilitating us in what was a great learning environment and a wonderful tutorial.</p>  <p>  The model is a very simple one.  It is a results-based demonstration project that is designed to increase the quantity and quality of habitats on intensely managed farmland.  That is the key phrase &ndash; &ldquo;intensely managed farmland&rdquo;.  The project is located in the River Bride valley of north County Cork and it will explore an innovative implementation of a results-based approach for wildlife habitats or intensively managed farmland.  It aims to improve biodiversity and environmental awareness on intensive Irish farmland, reward environmental performance and highlight this nationally.  It is also there to facilitate market rewards for sustainability.</p>  <p>  I raise this because it is part of a European innovation project which is funded by the Department.  It has key partners, which include the local authority, Glanbia, Teagasc, Bord Bia, the National Biodiversity Data Centre, Kepak and Birdwatch Ireland.  I hope it will continue to be funded as its funding line runs out at the end of this year, as I understand it, and I hope the Minister will have the good sense to continue to support it.  I believe the 42 farm holdings that are involved in this, which are of varying sizes and have different offerings in terms of what they produce, form a key model.  When the new CAP comes in, particularly in regard to designing Pillar II instruments under the agri-environment climate measures scheme, I believe this is a key project that would plug into that Pillar II objective.</p> <p>If we can get farmers to devote 10% of their landholdings for nature without losing income and if schemes can be devised, such as the BRIDE Project, which encourage and nudge farmers through a process of inspections to implement more environmental goods, such as riparian goods, grassland margins, hedgerows, increasing biodiversity and so forth, it will have a massive impact.  Farmers are not encouraged in the current CAP to give more to those margins on their landholdings because there is a penalty for that.  That is self-evident, as we all know.  If the Minister can create a scheme using the BRIDE Project as a model, by which he would design an agri-environmental climate measure so that the farmer or landholder does not lose income but, in fact, gains income through a process as devised through this innovation partnership, and that is scaled up, scaled out and translated throughout the country, the Minister would find that many farmers would buy into it.</p> <p> We are increasingly losing biodiversity.  That is self-evident and we all acknowledge it.  The way to get farmers back into managing the countryside is to ensure there is a financial incentive.  The beautiful thing about the BRIDE Project is that it provides financial incentives.  Where somebody implements sustainable or biodiversity measures, there is a marking scheme.  The marking scheme determines the amount of money the person will gain, so income is being generated for the farmer.  I will leave it at that.  I hope the project will continue to be funded and I would love the BRIDE Project to be plugged into the next CAP under the Pillar 2 agri-environment climate measure schemes that will be devised.  That would be a good thing for this country and the Minister would find many farmers would participate in it.</p> <p> On the issue of forestry, there have been many repeated promises in respect of forestry growth in this country.  We know the environmental benefits with regard to sequestration.  However, despite the repeated promises to forest owners, they are still only getting half the licences required to meet the Department's targets.  It is just not enough for the sector.  Are we getting any closer to having licences issued within an acceptable timeframe of 120 days?  The answer currently is "No".  Second, are we going to meet our targets for 2022?  We planted 2,000 ha in 2021, but it appears from looking at the metrics that we will end up with fewer than 2,000 ha for 2022.  I wish there was a greater sense of urgency about the potential of the forestry sector to deliver.  We still do not have what I would call a fit-for-purpose ash dieback scheme.  We talk about the great game of hurling but, and I have raised this in the House previously, there has been no progress that I can see on the ash dieback scheme.  Forestry is one of the sectors that can deliver much for us as an island.  There has to be a greater degree of political imperative put behind the forestry sector to make sure we achieve the growth targets that are necessary to sustain the sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.546" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1510" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200046#XX00200"><p>First, I echo what Deputy Sherlock said, notwithstanding issues that Cork and Kilkenny have had on the pitch in recent weeks.  It is very sad for a rural dweller to watch wild ash trees all over my part of the country dying in hedgerows, not to mention the plantations the Deputy referred to and the failure to introduce an adequate scheme.</p>  <p>  This is a timely discussion on a subject that is rarely discussed in any detail in this House or, indeed, in most national platforms outside it.  That is particularly unusual in the context of our country's history and our capacity for food production.  Last weekend, I was delighted to attend a Fine Gael conference on agriculture and food which really brought home, primarily through the huge attendance and the engagement of people, the significant role agriculture plays in the rural economy and will continue to play into the future.  Since 2009, exports of food and food products have grown by 73% to a value of &euro;13.7 billion annually.  With in excess of 163,000 people employed directly, agriculture is the only aspect of our economy that reaches into every nook and cranny of the country.  It is unique in that regard.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister's comments about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the scandalous human rights abuses that are taking place even as we speak.  There are also the effects it is having on every country in the world in terms of flour production and general grain production, and in agriculture in this country and elsewhere in terms of fertiliser costs, agri-diesel costs and animal feed costs.  I welcome the Government's decision on grant support for silage and tillage production.  If he gets the opportunity in his concluding comments, I ask the Minister to answer a question that was asked of me at the Glenmore Fine Gael annual general meeting last Friday night by a sheep farmer, Mr. Jim Grennan, who comes from many generations involved in sheep farming.  He asked why kale and turnips, which are tillage products that many sheep producers across the country would use for feeding sheep, are not included in the tillage scheme the Minister announced.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the Government's decision to intervene and save the pigmeat sector, a sector that has not had some of the protections and supports other sectors of agriculture have had over my lifetime.  That is in stark contrast to other decisions by other Governments, such as to let the sugar beet sector collapse more than a decade ago.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that I am part of the Government, I want to pose to the Minister the central contradiction that is at the core of the views expressed by many people who outright oppose rural Ireland and the protection of family farms and the agriculture sector.  Some of those sadly reside in the Government.  As the world's population continues to grow exponentially, who is going to feed it?  Will it be the few countries, and Ireland is chief among them, who produce food to the highest standards of environmental protection, sustainability and animal welfare or will it be countries whose systems are unsustainable?  I have never heard any spokesperson from An Taisce or, indeed, the far left, not to mention most members of the Green Party, with the exception perhaps of the Minister of State, answer such questions.  I ask the Minister to stand against the continuous chorus from commentators and others in our national media calling for less production of meat and dairy and to ask them who is going to supply these products into the future if the most sustainable country in the world at producing them is going to cut back on production in those key sectors?  I ask him also to pose this question.  Where do the alternatives come from?</p>  <p>  I am tired of listening to people, principally from An Taisce, on the national airwaves talk about reducing dairy production when they know that demand for dairy products continues to grow and that our system of dairy production is among the most environmentally friendly and sustainable anywhere on the planet.  We are limited by our existing climate and soil type.</p> <p>I am struck by the number of times we hear spokespersons for these organisations on the national airwaves talking about changing from our reliance on meat to products that are grown in the ground.  I do not know what percentage of land in Ireland is arable, but in vast parts of the country the only thing we can grow is grass.  We grow grass very well in Ireland.</p> <p> In my lifetime, I have seen extraordinary changes in agriculture.  I come from a farm.  I am the youngest son, so I got the road.  I have two brothers who are engaged as farmers running family farms.  I see the investment and time they and their families have put in over the past 40 years to change practices and to make them much more animal-friendly, environmentally-friendly and sustainable.  There is a huge capacity and willingness from farm families across the country to change and to improve those practices even further.</p> <p> I do not envy the Minister his job.  What we are continuously faced with is a chorus of commentators who offer no solutions other than to ban things and to cut back on production, who lecture about issues they know very little about and propose the ruin of a way of life.  What is agriculture about in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny other than a means for people to live, support their family and educate them?</p> <p> I am a firm believer in the old quote that is often attributed to Edmund Burke, even though I do not think he ever said it, that nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little.  That is my view on climate change too.  We do have an obligation to act.  I firmly believe that the agricultural sector in Ireland is prepared to do that.  We must ask how we can make the agricultural sector more efficient and more sustainable.  A number of months ago we, in Fine Gael, visited a Teagasc facility in Grange where they are looking at additives to animal feed that would dramatically reduce the emissions from the cattle and dairy herds right across the country.</p> <p> We must also address water quality.  In recent years we have seen specific problem areas in the country where water quality standards have fallen.  We know from targeted investment by the Government and by family farmers in the past 20 years that it is a problem we can address.  Family farms are more than willing to do that.</p> <p> I got a dig there, so I will finish up.  My final point is that there are hard political choices.  I will support the Minister in every way I can to ensure the rural economy and the rural way of life are protected.  I believe the Minister understands that we have to firmly resist &ndash; he has to lead in this regard &ndash; the modern Irish scourge of closing down sectors of the economy or systems we already have that work well, before we develop an alternative or we look at adjusting our current practices to make them more sustainable.  Peat is a classic example of that.  I wish the Minister well in his task.  I welcome this debate.</p></speech>

I attended the Fine Gael conference on agriculture in Tullamore at the weekend.  It was wonderful to see how vibrant it was and how vibrant the participants were about agriculture and agri-food in Ireland.  My constituency in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is not exactly a rural one, but it is dependent, as is every constituency, on the success of the agri-food business in Ireland as a key part of the Irish economy.  I recognise the 160,000 people who work in the industry and the contribution it makes of &euro;13.7 billion to the economy.  It is an extraordinary fact that exports have risen by 73% in such a difficult period for Ireland's recovery.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, for organising the visit to the Teagasc facility in Grange, as outlined by Deputy Phelan.  I learned a huge amount about more efficient farming.  I went in as a sceptic, as somebody who had not understood quite how prominent Ireland is in terms of carbon efficiency in production of dairy and beef and how much more we have done and can do.  I very much appreciated the opportunity to question the scientists and experts there.  I recognise Teagasc's contribution to scientific development in ways that can continue to reduce carbon emissions from this country.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Phelan has said, it is important to acknowledge how much more efficient we are as a food producing country than so many others, and the value of the contribution that Ireland can and does make.  Fine Gael is a party that has always supported rural Ireland.  The party has a track record of supporting and investing in rural Ireland and supporting farmers and we will continue to do that.</p></speech>

It highlighted the importance of farmers and producers and our overdependence on imports.  Policies from successive Governments and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have eroded crop and livestock diversity and left us vulnerable to disruptions in global supply chains.  We have become largely dependent on imported crops that we can grow here.  Ireland is a net importer of potatoes, cabbage and many other vegetables.  This situation is not only a food security risk, it is poor environmental practice.  Importing food from Britain, Spain, the Netherlands and China is ridiculous when we can grow these crops here.</p>  <p>  The Russian invasion of Ukraine has highlighted our shortfalls in grain production in terms of food and feed-grade grain and our utter dependence on imported, manufactured fertiliser.  These weaknesses have long existed in our system; recent crises have merely underscored them.  Irish farmers can produce high-quality products.  Consumers want to buy locally produced food.  We need a radical policy shift to diversify the range of produce that will help to support farmers, especially small family farms, and ensure a more sustainable and secure food system.</p>  <p>  Many farmers that have been forced to go into dairy production just to get by are being subsumed by large-scale industrial farms.  Sheep farming has become increasingly unviable.  Wool prices are so low that it is more economical to dump it.  That is at a time when we should be insulating buildings with this natural and locally sourced product.  The lack of measures to support widespread organic farming means it will remain a niche sector.  Unless there is a major course correction, the small family farm will be a thing of the past in a generation.  Central to this trend is the ridiculously low and unworkable prices farmers and producers get.  Meat factories and larger retailers have a stranglehold on the industry, which this and previous Governments have refused to acknowledge and tackle.  We continue to have a system that benefits a few key players and gouges the pockets of ordinary farmers.</p>  <p>  We need a food regulator, an independent office with statutory powers to oversee and intervene in the sector.  Instead, the programme for Government proposed a food ombudsman, a lesser form of oversight, and now that has been watered down further with the creation of an office for fairness and transparency.  The Minister's press release describes how this new office will conduct analysis and make reports and will act as an advocate for farmers and fishers.  This is not the language of enforcement.  This is not the regulator that producers require.</p>  <p>  Similar structural issues exist in the fishing industry where the system benefits the larger players at the expense of the inshore sector.  I keep having to raise the inequity in the distribution of the mackerel quota, with only 2% going to inshore fishers.  There are very real concerns that like last year, the tiny mackerel portion assigned to the inshore sector will be quickly reached.  It is entirely within the Minister's power to address this glaring imbalance.  The last time we spoke about this the Minister committed to reviewing it.  I wonder if he has an update on it.</p>  <p>  I am particularly concerned for fishers in island communities and those who fish off small piers across west Cork and the Atlantic seaboard.  The relative economic value of line-caught mackerel sold locally is more beneficial to those communities than bulk landings by large pelagic vessels.  When will they get their fair share?  This is their livelihood.  Families and communities need change now.  They need this Government to properly support the inshore sector and to put it on a secure footing.</p>  <p>  Related to this is the lack of investment in small piers and harbours.  While I welcome the recently announced &euro;35 million for marine infrastructure, it is less than half the &euro;80 million identified in the seafood task force report.</p> <p>Also, this funding is from the EU Brexit adjustment reserve rather than from a strategic or ongoing departmental investment.  Coastal and island communities need a guarantee that small piers and harbours will be maintained and developed continually to the necessary level.  Related to this is the slow-moving foreshore licensing system.  Vital work to piers and slipways are being held up because of both the cost and time needed to acquire foreshore licence.  This process needs to be reformed to enable the development of our marine infrastructure to support coastal and island communities.</p> <p> The area of energy microgeneration needs to be progressed.  There is a considerable capacity on farms to harness solar energy to power not only the farm, but to sell energy back to the national grid.  This is a win-win for individual farmers and for addressing Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets.  There are thousands of farm buildings across Ireland that could contribute to our renewable energy production as well as being helped to address rapidly rising energy costs.  I recognise the work the Minister has done in this area but this has to be prioritised further.  Families are facing a cost-of-living crisis now.  This is especially pronounced on farms.</p> <p> The climate crisis compels action as soon as possible.  Farmers can play very key role in this.  The announced 60% grant aid for solar installation under the targeted agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, will greatly help with the high installation costs.  However, because this is a reimbursement model, it would exclude so many family farms.  For this scheme to be a success, it needs to provide funding upfront to help small farmers participate.  The Minister will also be aware there are issues with being able then to connect to the grid to sell back, including the issues of costs and bureaucracy.  We need to make this process as easy and user-friendly as possible.</p> <p> The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications must also progress the clean export guarantee tariff to support micro and small-scale generators.  This is an area where there is very strong consensus and can make significant difference to farms and national climate action.  I encourage the Minister to prioritise making this a reality for family farms.</p> <p> I will address one of the questions that Deputy Phelan asked about who is going to feed the world and how we are going to produce more.  It would be good to put it on the record that we do produce enough food in the world to feed the growing population.  This is a matter of the quantity of food that goes to waste.  One third of the world is starving, more than one third of the food we produce worldwide goes in the bin, and more than one third of the world&rsquo;s population is suffering from obesity-related illnesses.  The problem is the politics and the distribution of food.  Ireland does not need to increase its emissions in food production to feed the growing population.  That is just the reality.</p></speech>

It should go without saying that climate change has significant implications for global food security, especially in developing countries.  For many, floods, drought and disease will cause crops to fail this year.  People will go hungry.  These extreme weathers are increasing in intensity directly as a result of our warming world.  The World Meteorological Organization report, released last week, foresees a tragic future.  We are up against our ecological limits.  We know there is a 50:50 chance that we will breach that critical 1.5&deg; C of global warming in the next five years.  This will cause climate chaos for millions of people.</p><p>Here in Ireland, we need to focus our efforts on supporting farmers to continue to grow healthy, nutritious food to feed our people.  I am afraid we are not doing that.  A healthy environment sustains a healthy agricultural system.  In Ireland, our agricultural practices have intensified to such an extent that we are pushing our environment to the brink in many ways.  Our rivers flow laden with nitrogen pollution.  Insects and pollinator populations are under significant threat.  Wild birds like the curlew and the corncrake, which were once ubiquitous across our land and which had populations in the tens of thousands, are now only barely hanging on.  Populations last year reached a critically low level of 150 breeding pairs throughout the whole country.  On top of all of this, our climate is changing.</p><p>The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan is being negotiated at the moment with the European Commission.  It will bring &euro;9.8 billion over five years to Ireland to support Irish agriculture and rural development, or &euro;2 billion a year.  Reading the draft CAP strategic plan, I see a huge missed opportunity.  We could be using this money to support farmers to future-proof their farms, to switch from high emissions farming and to build resilience into the farming sector so that our farmers can continue to produce healthy, nutritious food that is not at the expense of our natural world.</p><p>The European Commission agrees.  In its response to the draft plan it noted on the dairy sector:</p> <blockquote> 	...the Commission has doubts whether what is proposed goes far enough.  In this context, it particularly has in mind ... substantial implications for agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, for quality of air, water and soil, and for biodiversity. </blockquote>  <p>In relation to the proposed eco-schemes in Pillar 1, the Commission comments:</p> <blockquote> 	the options involved might add only very modest environmental value in comparison to basic good practice in Ireland, with the result that the scheme as a whole brings about too little change. </blockquote>  <p>In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the agriculture sector is a big emitter.  Under the climate law, we have set a budget for emissions and each sector must contribute.  Those sectoral budgets are also being negotiated at the moment between Departments.  For agriculture the cut in emissions will range between 22% and 30%, equating to an absolute reduction of between 5 and 7 megatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>equivalent per annum, based on the 2018 baseline, by the end of the decade.  The &euro;2 billion a year that the CAP strategic plan will give to the agricultural sector is expected to facilitate a reduction of only up to 1.2 megatonnes of carbon by 2027.  That leaves us having to reduce emissions in agriculture to a far greater degree from 2027 through to 2030.</p><p>We are way off with this plan.  Where are the rest of the emissions reductions going to come from if they are not to be supported through the CAP strategic plan?  We are missing a huge opportunity here to have joined-up thinking and joined-up climate action across this State.  We are missing an opportunity to prepare our farmers for the future. </p><p>The Minister recently announced a &euro;55 million silage package.  This is the third such package the State will provide to farmers in response to a fodder crisis.  It is disheartening that the previous two packages have not been used to build resilience into our system to prevent against future crises.  These crises will not go away if we maintain the current system, which is heavily dependent on imports.  I am speaking of importing fodder, importing feed for animals and importing chemical fertiliser, all of which are subject to international price volatility.  This is what we are seeing at the moment and we are not prepared.</p><p>We talk a lot about just transition in the energy sector, but we need to start talking about just transition in agriculture.  We should be using any and all investment in agriculture to ensure our farmers are encouraged to grow the fruit, the vegetables and the grains we humans need to eat.  We need to start thinking about how we are going to compensate farmers for allowing space for nature.  Natural spaces on farms are currently not valued.  Farmers are encouraged and paid to remove trees and hedgerows and to drain wetlands and bogs.  We need to be doing the opposite.  Rewilding land, restoring peatlands and wetlands, and creating spaces for nature to thrive are in all of our interests.</p><p>The eco-schemes proposed in the CAP strategic plan, as noted also by the Commission, are nowhere close to enough.  I will give some examples.  A farmer needs to sign up to two eco-schemes.  Eco-scheme 4 is for the planting of native trees and hedges.  A farmer will qualify by planting three - that is three and not 300 - native trees per ha, or 1 m - not 100 m or 1 km but just 1 m - of hedgerow per ha.  Farmers can sign up to eco-scheme 1, which is for space for nature.  The EU biodiversity strategy and Food Vision 2030 set a goal of achieving 10% of high diversity space for nature on farmland.  The Irish voluntary eco-scheme asks farmers to commit to leaving 7% of the land for biodiversity, habitats or landscape features - just 7%.  Research from Teagasc tells us that most farms already have between 5% and 7% of their land as unproductive.  For many, therefore, this will be a no-change scenario.  </p><p>When it comes to water quality, the most recent EPA report on water quality concludes that, &quot;The most significant pressure causing a decline in our water quality is increased concentrations of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen entering our waterways.&quot;  The main source of water pollution in this country is from nitrogen run-off from farms.  One way we can get around this, as well as around the over-reliance on chemical nitrogen fertiliser, is the planting of multispecies swards.  The voluntary eco-scheme encourages 6% of grassland to be sown in this way - just 6%.  These numbers are so marginal.</p><p>We are overhauling the energy sector, the transport sector and other sectors.  The change that has been undertaken in the agriculture sector is a far cry from the change that is happening in those other sectors and from what is needed.  We are not using the CAP strategic plan to reduce emissions.  We are using it to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  We should be using it for future-proofing our agricultural system, to protect the long-term viability of our farms and the livelihoods of farmers, and to restore our critically damaged environment.</p> <p>I certainly do not agree with everything Deputy Phelan said, but I agree we have to support our farmers and rural Ireland.  We can do this without compromising on the environment and climate.  We can and must do better.</p></speech>

It reads: "Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a livable future."  This was said by Hans-Otto P&ouml;rtner, one of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, working chairs.  We are walking a climate tightrope and every single step we take from here on has to be a step in the right direction because the fall is, frankly, unthinkable.</p>  <p>  We have set out in legislation the overall carbon budgets that must be adhered to in order for us to achieve our climate goals.  Agriculture, as a major source of our national emissions profile, will have to play its part when it comes to setting out sectoral ceilings.  When I look at the draft Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan, I am not sure I see that scale of ambition and step change in how we need to do things from here on.  I struggle to see how this plan will integrate with the EU's nature restoration law, which is coming down the tracks, especially, as Deputy Leddin laid out, when many of the conditions of the Pillar 1 payments are so weak.  I also worry, and Deputy Carthy referred to this, when I see my brother-in-law, neighbour, or fellas I used to play hurling with, encouraged to borrow so heavily to buy into a system that relies on specialisation, intensification and ever-increasing input costs.  Again and again I hear stories of them running to stand still, and working harder and longer hours with nothing to show for it at the end of the week, all the while heaping pressure on our waters and land with all the attendant impacts on biodiversity.</p>  <p>  I strongly believe there is a better way forward that offers a brighter future not just for our farming families but all future generations.  I listened to some criticism of An Taisce earlier.  I want to praise it.  In fact, just yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, launched the legacy for life programme, which was developed by An Taisce to develop community-based supports for Ireland's natural environment with a focus on ecosystem resilience and biodiversity enhancement.  I will draw the Minister's attention to two strands within that project.  The first is a pond biodiversity project that looks to build Irish capacity and expertise in pond creation.  That may sound like a small measure but it takes a small amount of land for a significant biodiversity pay-off, and not just biodiversity but carbon sequestration.  It is something a farmer can create in an hour with a digger and, by the time he is finished, wildlife will already be in that pond.  Probably more critical in the context of this debate is the advancing of farm-to-fork, which will seek to offer alternatives to current intensification-based food production methods.</p>  <p>  These are examples of ways forward for our farming sector that will secure a viable future for farming families.  It is a future that respects our planetary boundaries and nurtures biodiversity and one I strongly believe will also add sustainability and profitability, especially for small farmers and those small farming families that have for so long been the bedrock of our rural communities.  I very much hope they will continue to be so in future. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.556" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1621" speakername="Johnny Mythen" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200049#AAA00300"><p>Farming in County Wexford and throughout the island is a much-valued industry that contributes millions to local economies in employment, commerce and sustainability of rural communities.  The Common Agricultural Policy is the single most important tool we have for securing the future of family farms and food security, yet the CAP budget in the next period represents a substantial cut to farmers' incomes and threatens the viability and sustainability of the small farm.  The Government refused to bring its draft CAP strategy plan before the House for debate, scrutiny and approval, as Sinn F&eacute;in reasonably called for.  We make the same reasonable call to the Minister now and ask if he will bring any revised plan to the House as well as re-engaging with the farming organisations and other stakeholders on the plan.  I would also like the Minister to clarify the definition of the so-called forgotten farmers and whether the cohort of these farmers will be supported under the next CAP.  Where exactly will the funds come from?  Will they have access to the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, through the next CAP rounds?</p>  <p>  I met recently with local Irish Farmers Association, IFA, members in County Wexford.  We had a very healthy and robust discussion.  One of the biggest issues they raised with me is their skyrocketing costs.  They are deeply troubled by the cost of diesel and fertiliser, which is having a detrimental impact on their farms and businesses.  As the Minister knows, fertiliser prices alone had increased by 160% to 228% year-on-year by January.  The price of organic poultry feed has increased 77% as of April this year, while farmers are also facing spiralling energy costs and other costs of living specific to farming.  It is, therefore, understandable that farming organisations described the initial reduction in the cost of agri-diesel by 2% per litre as an insult, especially since this already meagre reduction was cancelled out by the carbon increases at the beginning of this month.</p>  <p>  I will also raise the issue of farming contractors, particularly those involved in silage.  Simply put, if they do not receive some recompense, small farms and small contractors will go to the wall.  For example, it cost &euro;5,000 to fill a 10,000 l tank last year.  Today, it costs &euro;10,000 to fill that same tank.  Contractors will have no choice but to pass this cost on to the family farm or go bust.  Following pressure from Sinn F&eacute;in, the Minister for Finance recently introduced further reductions to offset the carbon tax increases, which was welcome.  However, those increases should have been stalled instead of using this roundabout mechanism that caused a lot of distress and does not go far enough.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the crisis in the forestry licensing system is far from over and is causing continued bureaucratic stalling for a product that is vital to the environment and the construction industry in Wexford and beyond.  This is despite the climate advantage afforestation brings to the reduction of our carbon emissions, in addition to being a much-needed domestic supply of timber, which has now become a very expensive imported commodity and will, as I said, be essential to the building of much-needed homes for our young people.  What plans are in place to address this?</p>  <p>  County Wexford also has a strong maritime tradition and a strong fishing community.  I meet regularly with our fishers and have spoken several times in this House to stand up for them and to protect this industry.  Their contribution to the local and national economy is as important as farming, as it is to the survival of our small fishing communities and villages.  In fact, Irish fishers have borne the biggest financial brunt of the Brexit deal.  The industry has been left behind yet again in European negotiations in order to soften the blow for other industries.  Irish fishermen will take a 15% cut to their pre-Brexit quota, which will cost &euro;43 million per year, as a result of the trade deal.  Only approximately 20% of the fish caught in these waters are landed by Irish fishermen.  This is deeply unfair and a by-product of the failure of every Government policy since the Common Fisheries Policy was put in place.  From talking to fishers and those working in other small coastal businesses in my area of Wexford, they feel completely abandoned, unheard and, forgive the pun, thrown overboard by the Government.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see a revisiting of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The Government must start arguing and negotiating for a fair quota system that reverses the existing disproportionate quotas, sets a fair deal for our fishers and protects our natural resources.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for listening, Deputy Carthy for his Trojan work as Sinn F&eacute;in agriculture spokesperson and Deputy Mac Lochlainn, our fishing spokesperson.</p></speech>

Food production is important for our farmers, our fishers, our rural and coastal communities and wider society.  It is important for me, my political party and the Government.  You might need a doctor, lawyer, garda or priest once in your life, but three times a day every day, you need a farmer.  We cannot take food security for granted or the vital role farmers play in the production of that food.</p>  <p>  If the situation in Ukraine is to teach us anything, it is to highlight the complacency that has settled around Europe regarding what the European project was originally set up for, which is peace on the Continent of Europe.  A key pillar of that peace is food security.  That is the basis of CAP, which has been very successful down through the years in guaranteeing a stable supply of safe, nutrient-dense food that is produced to the highest standards in the world and in generating balanced regional development.  Like any successful sporting dynasty, continued success can breed complacency.  We have seen the recent CAP negotiations in Brussels across other European countries.</p> <p>Following Brexit some countries were not willing to fill the gap left in the overall EU budget which left CAP vulnerable to significant cuts.  However, as a food producing nation, Ireland, led by then Taoiseach Deputy Varadkar, was very keen to state clearly that we were willing to ask our citizens to pay more as an overall contribution to the European project to fund the priorities that other EU countries share such as defence, research and climate provided that we protected the successful programmes such as CAP.  We do not have a food security crisis in Europe.  We did not have one during the pandemic either.  Our food supply chains underpinned by CAP have been severely tested but have proved to be robust.  There are new policy priorities in Europe around the green deal and the farm to fork strategies.</p> <p> They are priorities that Ireland and our agrifood sector are committed to deliver upon.  However that cannot be at the expense of food security because farmers are already on that journey.  Changes are taking place every day on hundreds of farms across the country to make them more sustainable, economically, environmentally and socially.</p> <p> One hundred years ago this State was founded.  Around the same time, farmers began to replace the horse and play with the tractor.  Farms have been evolving ever since.  Now the splash plate is being replaced with the trailing shoe; calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, is being replaced by protected urea and ryegrass swards are being replaced by low-nitrogen clover swards.  This all takes time, but I firmly believe that if we back our farmers and see them as the solution rather than the problem, we will deliver on the ambitious goals we have set ourselves.</p> <p> I have just come from a farm safety event in Fermoy that was called Safe Farm.  There was a live performance about a farmer and daughter working together over the course of a regular farming day.  The conversations and interactions were so real to life.  Everyone saw a little of their own farming set-up.  The performance really reminded me, if we need reminding, of how little value farmers themselves put on their own time.  The worries of the day are the price of the produce, the cost of the input and how every job needs to get done.  Rarely does the farmer stop and consider how they are protecting themselves from all these pressures.</p> <p> I have a very good friend who is milking cows and has been for some years.  He is a dedicated farmer who takes great pride in his work and runs a very good farm.  What I admire most in his whole set-up is the patience of his wife.  In the last few years he has got busier and busier and is running faster to try and stand still.  It is something that has been replicated in many farms across the country.  Recently I visited Vincent Gorman's dairy farm in Kildare.  Vincent first milked a cow 60 years ago on a three legged stool.  He has developed his farm into a profitable farming enterprise that has allowed his son Brendan to return home.  He has enabled the farm to fund both livelihoods and the next generation for Brendan&rsquo;s son who was born last year.  Vincent&rsquo;s focus on making that farm profitable and making that dairy farm a sustainable model that can sustain a number of incomes has also allowed them to invest in its sustainability around fencing off their water courses and improving its sustainability and biodiversity because that is critical.  When Vincent and Brendan think about following generations that will farm that land, they want to protect it.  That is where farmers come from.  The key is underpinning the systemic financial sustainability of those farms to allow farmers to do that as custodians of the land.</p> <p> As a society we must not forget our farmers.  We must never take our farmers, fishers or our wider food production system for granted.  The negative coverage of agriculture in recent times has got in on farmers.  As Minister of State with responsibility for farm safety and farmer mental health and well-being it is something that troubles me.  I can see it.  It comes up in every engagement with farmers that people are against them now and how they might not value the role that they play.  The clear message from here today is that we are backing farmers through the support that we have provided to help assist with the cost of the inputs in the short term, but also in the long term as one that can really continue to deliver for our society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.559" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Senator Pippa Hackett)" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200050#BBB00200"><p>Like the Minister, I will also begin by speaking about Ukraine.  We cannot forget the thousands of people who are suffering there as we speak this evening.  We must also think of their fellow Ukrainians who have been forced to flee to Ireland and across the world to avoid the wanton death and destruction forced on their country by the illegal invasion by Russia.  We as a Government are committed to welcoming people fleeing the war in Ukraine and seeking protection I Ireland.  Work is ongoing across the Government to provide supports to those who have arrived in the last few weeks and my colleagues continue to plan for further large numbers of people who may arrive.  My Department and its agencies are working to welcome Ukrainians here too.  To date Teagasc has welcomed over 50 Ukrainians in Ballyhaise college in Cavan and a further 35 in Clonakilty college in Cork.</p>  <p>  The war has put further pressure on already increasing input costs across many sectors but particularly agriculture.  The Minister has outlined many of the actions taken by the Government to assist farmers across Ireland with the challenges they are facing.  Deputy Phelan spoke about grass and our great ability to grow it and he is right but unfortunately the grass types we largely grow are almost wholly reliant on fossil-fuel based fertiliser and therein lies the problem.  That is why this Government has supported measures like the multi-species sward scheme and the red clover scheme to promote environmentally sustainable methods of farming thereby greatly reducing the nitrogen fertiliser required while maintaining forage yields.  This is an important measure which will help farmers reduce the cost of their fertiliser inputs.  Both these measures, multi-species swards and red clover silage, can save farmers money while maintaining production levels and reducing their farm carbon footprint.  It is a win-win.  This measure is being delivered by my Department in co-operation with participating agri retailers and co-operatives throughout the country.  It will support the establishment of approximately 12,000 ha of multi-species swards and approximately 4,000 ha of the red clover silage mix.</p>  <p>  On organics, &euro;256 million is earmarked for the organic farming sector over the lifetime of the next common agricultural policy.  This compares to &euro;56 million under the current CAP organic farming scheme, which represents a five-fold increase in funding and will help Ireland achieve a 7.5% organic target by 2027.  This is something that the European Commission warmly welcomed in its letter.  Organic farming is less reliant on costly inputs.  Once again, I urge farmers to consider in the coming months how it could benefit not only the farm, but also their farm profitability and their own lifestyle and well-being.  The scheme will open again later this year.</p>  <p>  We have also secured almost &euro;3 million in support for the critically important horticulture sector.  This aid package, as the Minister highlighted, will support high wire protected glasshouse producers of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and field vegetable producers, mushroom producers and commercial apple producers.</p>  <p>  The sector like many others is facing huge increases in input costs.  We must ensure the long-term viability of the sector.  These sectors make valuable contributions to the overall economy as well as playing a key role in producing top-class, safe, nutritious and local food.  It is also critical that retailers similarly support native horticulture producers, providing choice to the consumer and valuing our native production base, which is something our consumers expect, and thereby securing the long term sustainable future for horticulture industry.</p>  <p>  Finally, it would be remiss of me not to mention forestry.  The output of forestry licences was severely impacted from 2019 onwards as a result of a High Court ruling around environmental regulation.  Since this ruling, my Department has invested in significant resources in hiring additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff to work solely on licensing and to deal with the significant additional workload the 2019 rulings resulted in.  I can assure Deputy Sherlock that there is a great sense of urgency around forestry.  Last year licensing increased by 56% and my officials assure me that it will increase afforestation licenses by 100% this year.  Progress has and will continue to be made.  In addition, the passage of legislation recently will enable the development of a scheme to allow up to 1 ha. of native trees to be planted in suitable areas without the need for an afforestation licence.  I hope to have this scheme established before the end of the year.  Engagement with stakeholders on the design of such a scheme will begin shortly.  Alongside this, through the work of Project Woodland, a new forest strategy has been developed which will include attractive financial supports to incentivise afforestation and help meet our climate targets.</p></speech>

We must all reassess the matter and make sure we are prepared and protected into the future.  It is true that during Covid we had adequate food supplies.</p> <p>We all accept that we have had a fabulous farming industry in this State that has been able to deliver for us for generations and that is something we have to maintain into the future.  On the wider issue of food security, we are well aware of these specific issues that will impact dreadfully on many far-flung parts of the world, be it the Middle East or Africa.  The issues people might be dealing with on the basis of this could be up to and including farming.  Any mitigation that can be introduced in that need to be done.  We have to be much more aware of all our interconnectivity from the point of view of protecting all of us into the future.</p> <p> I will go back to one of the major points that Deputy Carthy made, namely the idea of how we have set our society up.  It is about the network of family farms and the fact that most of us who are not directly from one are only a generation or two removed from one.  We have to ensure the sustainability of family farms and we know they are not sustainable right now.  We have specific issues, including inflation and the supply chain issues that have been brought about by Covid, Brexit and the war in Ukraine.  We have other issues also, including the cost of fuel.  While we welcome some of the mitigations that have been introduced, we need to look at that point.  We know that the CAP payments will be reduced in real terms into the future.  The whole idea of CAP was to ensure we would have a steady supply of safe food and that needs to be rethought in any revision of the CAP strategic plan.  We need to know whether the Government has any intentions to do so and if it does, as it should, it should be brought in front of this House.</p> <p> I agree with a lot that has been said on climate change.  I have spoken here about my attendance at IFA meetings previously and I have seen different conversations there to those that are held in the public domain.  There are a huge amount of farmers who are willing and able and who are looking for partners to do what everybody accepts is necessary.  We have failings from a Government point of view and it has not necessarily delivered.  We all know we need to do business in organic farming, forestry, anaerobic digestion and renewable energy schemes.  We have to look at all those matters.</p> <p> I also want to reiterate the issue that was brought up by Deputy Mac Lochlainn.  We need a sensible solution to the issue in Killybegs with the offloading of fish.  We need something that works for the people as what is happening now is ridiculous.</p> <p> Given I only have a short period of time left I want to bring up the issue of a constituent who came to me about the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme.  He accepted that it can only be availed of on the basis of a percentage reduction in stock numbers.  The difficulty for him was that he was dealing with Teagasc on introducing slatted slurry pits and did not have them in at the time when the determinations were made.  That gave him a greater level of capacity and anomalies like that need to be taken into account.  I will bring that issue to the Minister and it is something we need to look at.  That is a specific case but I imagine he is only one of many who have fallen between stools.  We need to deal with that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.562" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200051#CCC00200"><p>The first issue I want to raise, which I am sure has already been raised, is that in the farming section of the <i>Irish Independent</i>a couple of days ago it was highlighted that the methane emissions from dairy cows are probably being overestimated.  Similar reports appeared at the end of 2021 and in the summer of 2021 in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>.  The study quoted in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>in 2021 claimed that methane emissions from dairy cows are approximately 30% less than the estimated figures used by national organisations.  This should be ringing major alarm bells for anyone who is blindly supporting the Government&rsquo;s approach to climate action.  I did not support the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2022 for a number of reasons but this is just another indication to me that the Government&rsquo;s climate action policies are relying on questionable data.  How many other climate-related areas have misleading or false numbers associated with emissions that have not been accepted as true by Government agencies or even by Ministers?</p><p>We are happy to tax people into oblivion supposedly to fund climate action measures, possibly based on incorrect figures.  We have no balanced debate as the State broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, has explicitly committed to being biased on the issue, having signed up as part of the climate change activist group.  The voices of experts who disagree with the approach being taken and the information being provided are routinely ignored in the debate.  There is no real debate at all; it is just constant and one-sided activism.  Only a couple of weeks ago a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator suggested the following in the Seanad:</p> <blockquote> 	If, however, we have a referendum in the future on tough measures to deal with climate change, for example, I do not believe it would be appropriate that our national broadcaster should be giving 50% of the space in such debates to climate sceptics. </blockquote>  <p>Censorship of fair debate seems to be coming a trend within Fianna F&aacute;il.  Such a concerning suggestion just about sums up the Government's approach to climate change; attempting to curtail debate and crush dissent, even within its own ranks.  There seems to be a small bit of dissent, however, within the Government parties at some of the harebrained ideas being proposed and floated around, the turf issue being the most recent example.  It seems to have missed the attention of everybody that the turf ban would not apply to communities of fewer than 500 people.  Therefore we must not have a climate crisis in communities of fewer than 500 people.</p><p>Some nine out of the 12 Green Party Deputies represent urban constituencies.  While the other three rely significantly on urban votes there is no significant demand for the Green Party agenda in rural Ireland.  Yet the policies promoted by the urban-centric Green Party do not seek to address the environmental problems in city areas.  Instead they seem just to target rural areas.  I am blue in the face from highlighting the folly of expanding Dublin Port, for instance, and I have called numerous times for the Port Tunnel barrier to be removed to reduce emissions at what is the most problematic area, according to the EPA, and those issues are ignored.  Instead we have the sacred cow of carbon tax being protected at all costs and increased again at a time when inflation in the cost of living is hurting so many people, particularly in rural Ireland.  Many farmers across the country have different decisions to make.  With the cost of fertiliser continuing to pose major problems for farmers trying to keep their heads above water, there are a number of other issues which are also of great concern to the farming sector.  All types of farmers are under severe pressure with the rise in input and related costs.</p><p>I wish to highlight again that as a nation we are consistently falling way behind on our tree planting targets, as the Minister mentioned himself.  The years 2020 and 2021 were the worst for 70 years in the number of trees planted.  The benefits of planting trees from an environmental point of view would far outweigh the benefits of increasing the carbon tax.  There is great urgency and willingness among Government Members to increase carbon taxes every year up until 2030 but it does not appear there is any great urgency or willingness to achieve meaningful solutions such as planting more trees.  The Minister commented on the problems we had in 2019 and I presume he is referring to the judicial review.  The reason we had that successful judicial review is that the Government acted unlawfully.  I would rather that the Government would concentrate on the cause of the judicial review than attack those who took it.</p></speech>

If there is anything to be taken away from this debate it should be that point.  Food security is also dependent on economically viable fishermen.  There was talk earlier about the need for signs to go up in people's offices.  If that sign was in the Minister's office and he delivered on his job when it comes to that sentence alone, he would have delivered successfully as a Minister.  We need to have viable farms.</p> <p>One third of farmers are economically viable, another one third are only viable because somebody is working off the farm and the final third are going into debt or poverty at the moment.  Those are Teagasc's figures for that.  Farmers are being hit radically by increases in costs.  The cost of fertiliser has increased by 130% and the Government is doing nothing to protect those farmers.  That increase in input costs will lead to increased prices of outputs over the coming year which will then turn into food inflation for families who are already struggling with the cost of living.  We are asking the Minister to subsidise the cost of fertiliser to take the pressure off farmers.</p> <p> The primary component of food security is farmers' ability to earn a living.  This is especially so because between Covid and the war in Ukraine we have learned that international supply chains are not stable.  Food staples are becoming really difficult to find in certain parts of the world.  Britain has started to ration sunflower oil.  Who would have thought two or three years ago that such a staple would be rationed?  In a few years' time, particular staples could become very expensive or very rare.  People who are not able to afford those foods could end up going without those foods or suffer food poverty as a result.</p> <p> The Government and the European Commission must make it very clear that farmers will be supported to allow them to remain viable.  At the moment that has not been the case.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have let farmers down in terms of the price of beef and other foodstuffs over recent years.  The price of beef has increased because of international markets, but for a number of years the Government agreed that farmers should sell below the production cost of beef.  I listened to the Minister state that at the last meeting of the agriculture committee.</p> <p> It is ludicrous that fishermen need to weigh their catches at the ports.  The fishermen coming in from stormy weather have to unload their fish after they have gutted and iced them.  They then have to weigh the catch at the quay, re-box it, bring it 200 yards and weigh it a second time.  Other European countries are not doing this at their quays because it is a stupid rule which needs to be opposed by the Government.  It is unfair on fisherman and leading to the unviability of the fishing industry, which is another threat to our food security in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.565" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200052#DDD00200"><p>It is a real pity that it took a war in Ukraine and the misery that has been inflicted on the citizens of Ukraine to bring food security back onto the agenda.  Unfortunately, people who should have known better forgot about food security and thought that modern economies such as those in Europe had full energy security and food security.  The realisation that food security and energy security are two of the top components of a country's security has been brought home to roost in recent months.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, food poverty will increase dramatically before 2022 expires.  Many people in the poorer countries of the world will experience famine before this year is out.  Thankfully this country has the ability to produce food sustainably.  Under no circumstances can our ability to produce food be sacrificed for anyone's agenda.  We are one of the most sustainable producers of food in the world.  Our cattle are at grass for up to 300 days of the year.  We have an environmental way of producing food which needs to be protected.  Our production base needs to be protected at all times.</p>  <p>  Is the Minister aware that in the past 48 hours one of the largest importers of fertiliser into the country published its results for the first quarter of the year?  In 2021 it made a profit of &euro;303 million.  In the first quarter of 2022, it made &euro;980 million.  Not only has the cost of the fertiliser I spread on my farm trebled, but the profits of the fertiliser company have also trebled.  We need an inquiry into how this happened.  I cannot see what common-sense reason there can be for such an inflation in profits.  The only conclusion I can come to is that it is at the expense of the primary producer.  If the company had stock before the price increases came, surely that should have been passed on to wholesalers at the profit margin it was taking in 2021.  I am extremely worried.  This company is probably the major importer of fertiliser.  That needs to be investigated urgently.</p>  <p>  Tillage farmers feel left out of the supports that have been put in place.  Farmers who are 100% dedicated to tillage feel there is not enough in the welcome measures the Minister has introduced in recent months.  I again ask him to consider some incentives for tillage farmers to overcome the cost squeeze they are experiencing.  AdBlue is an essential ingredient for modern engines on farms.  Last year it cost 35 cent per litre and it is now &euro;1.80.  They are also under enormous cost pressure.  While the Minister gave the incentive for extra tillage ground, many tillage farmers do not have any extra ground for tillage.  As they would already be 100% tillage, that incentive would not work for them.  I ask the Minister to look again at the tillage sector and see what can be done.</p>  <p>  Many farmers have fixed-price milk contracts.  They were pushed into these fixed-price contracts by the banks.  The banks insisted that people who were buying land or doing extensive development would go into fixed-price milk contracts.  Some people in my constituency have more than 50% of their milk in these fixed-price contracts at 32 cent a litre.  Unfortunately, the cost of production is probably in excess of 40 cent a litre at the moment.  In the month of April, most farmers received more than 50 cent a litre for their milk which will all be needed to offset the increased cost of production.  However, this significant group of farmers are caught in this fixed-price contract.  I urge the Minister to bring the stakeholders around the table to try to get this liability shared.  The processors went into these contracts with the primary producers and then we have the end seller and the retailers.  This cost cannot be borne by the primary producer alone and common sense needs to prevail.  The viability of a significant number of farmers in a number of co-ops is under serious pressure and they risk going out of business.</p>  <p>  I wish to talk about the supply of beef for the winter months.  We have built up contracts around the world for beef on the basis of a 12-month supply.  With the concentration on cereals this winter, farmers will be extremely reluctant to feed cattle in sheds and the supply of beef for those hard-won contracts around the world will be under pressure.  I urge the Minister to talk to the meat processors to ensure that farmers can profitably feed cattle next winter.</p></speech>

I welcome the work that has been undertaken in the Department.  As a Deputy for the constituency of Cork East and somebody who lives on a dairy farm, I would like to highlight a number of issues with the three of them today.  It is greatly welcomed that the Minister and both Ministers of State are here in the Chamber.</p>  <p>  I wholeheartedly agree with the point made by the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, about the attitude towards agriculture and towards farmers.  I regularly hear that farmers feel they are under attack and that must stop.  This conflict has shown all of us the importance of the production of agricultural produce in our own country.  The fact that we are world leaders in food security is something we need wholeheartedly to protect.</p> <p>I welcome the comments made by the Minister of State in that regard.</p> <p> A particular point of concern that will arise in the next number of months is that we will see enormous pressure across Europe when it comes to energy supply and fuel supplies for the production of energy.  Here in Ireland, we have a large body of work to do to ensure that there is security of supply for agriculture.  Gas procurement is a considerable concern for major dairy processors in the Republic of Ireland.  It is in the interests of all parts of the dairy sector that the issue be given the utmost consideration by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in communication with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Energy, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I flag here and now that will be a major problem in 2023 and we need to do what we can to guarantee the supply of gas for factories that are processing milk in this country.  That is a concerning issue, according to the information that is available to me.</p> <p> I will make another point that I have made repeatedly.  I would like a photovoltaic, PV, system to be put in place for security of energy supply to dairy farms in Ireland.  That is something that could be rapidly advanced in the summer months.  PV is different to other styles of solar energy in that the exposure to daylight, rather than heat, is the important component.  Exposure to sunlight is obviously important for all solar energy but PV works differently from other systems and is suitable to Ireland.  That is one area in which I think we need to do a lot of work in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We need on-site generation of energy with back-up battery supplies.</p> <p> The electricity bills for Irish dairy farms that milk, for example, 120 to 150 cows could range from &euro;6,000 to &euro;10,000.  I worked in the sector and directly with farmers during the period when I worked on energy in the summers.  The costs involved are staggering.  There could be a lot of positive work done in that area that could have a long-term impact to help reduce costs for farmers if the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would work with the Department of Environment, Climate and Energy.  I ask the Minister to go away and consider that matter.</p> <p> Another matter of concern is the supply of labour.  Farm relief is a major issue.  I am being inundated with calls in my constituency office about the chronic shortage of labour for agriculture in Ireland.  Many farmers are reporting extraordinary difficulty in getting work permits processed.  That is something the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has to hammer home to the T&aacute;naiste and the Department with responsibility for work permits in this country.  Agriculture is different from some other sectors.  That is something we have to take away and do something about.  I am repeatedly told that farmers are waiting in excess of three and four months for a reply.  When there is a mistake in an application, they are often told to reapply and go back into the waiting system.  That is causing a lot of stress and strain.  There is a shortage of available labour at the moment because the economy is doing very well, with only 4.5% unemployment, and that is an area in respect of which we need to do a considerable body of work.</p> <p> I reiterate my request that the Minister comes to visit the Cork East constituency.  I know he is very busy.  We were lucky to have him in the region in the past.  I certainly want to get him back to the area as soon as we can to engage directly with the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the IFA.  Both organisations are doing absolutely fantastic work in representing their members.  The work that has been undertaken there has been helpful for me, as a Deputy, and I would like the Minister to meet and engage with them directly.</p> <p> Turning to fisheries, I thank the Minister for the work he did in respect of Ballycotton.  It has not gone unnoticed.  I welcome the &euro;1.5 million in funding that I had been seeking for the past year and a half.  It is fantastic to see that funding has been put in place.  It is greatly welcome.</p> <p> We need to look ahead to the coming 12 months.  Unfortunately, the position with regard to energy supply is serious.  The impact that could have for agriculture is a level of devastation, quite frankly, that we have not yet thought about properly.  The G7 countries' agriculture ministers are meeting for the first time.  That gives one an idea of what is going on internationally.  We in Ireland need to prepare for a situation that may never happen but that quite possibly could happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200053#EEE00200"><p>We are delighted to have this debate.  Deputy Mattie McGrath has been fighting for the holding of such a debate in the Business Committee for ten weeks.  It has taken ten weeks for us to have a debate on fishing.  That says it all.  The debate has been scheduled for a Thursday evening, when most rural Deputies have to get back to their constituencies.  Anyhow, we will take what we can get, even if we have to wait for ten weeks.</p>  <p>  Many farmers will be forced out of business if nothing changes soon for farmers who are facing an unprecedented input cost crisis.  There are now growing fears that many farm businesses may go under as a result of soaring farm input costs.  Even before the current input cost crisis, farmers were facing a unique set of acute and chronic stressors, including farm bureaucracy, climate conditions, animal and crop disease outbreaks, time pressures, workplace hazards, rural crime, finance, isolation, machinery breakdown and media criticism.</p>  <p>  Farmers across all sectors are being hit by an array of spiralling input costs which are completely eroding margins that were already through the roof.  The Rural Independent Group has been calling on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Government to address this urgent crisis since last summer.  However, so far the Minister has completely failed to address this crisis in any proper manner.  Last week, the Minister announced some money for farmers cutting silage but like everything else this Government announces, the devil is in the detail.  A farmer who has a milking cow will not get a cent.  Most of the suckler farmers who will qualify will only get &euro;200 or &euro;300.  That is the bottom line.  That is what they are telling me in west Cork.  Many farmers will not have the amount of land to qualify for the full amount.</p>  <p>  The Minister may have issued a press release or two to suggest that a new pig scheme may come on stream but so far, that is all that has happened- a press release announcing a scheme that is grossly insufficient to meet the growing needs of even that sector.</p>  <p>  We are here again today, having been calling for this debate for weeks, seeking immediate action from the Government and issuing the strongest possible warning that the farming sector is in deep despair over spiralling costs and many farmers are now saying to us they are unable to take ongoing losses.  I wonder if this is exactly what the Minister wants to hear.  Does he want farmers to go out of business?  That would fit nicely into the green plan for this country.</p>  <p>  Perhaps what is most disappointing is that the Minister and the Ministers of State have completely gone to ground during a crisis that has impacted every farm in the country.  The Minister's response is, quite frankly, completely unacceptable.  The ongoing silence while this crisis has deepened over the past six months demonstrates an arrogant disregard for the entire farming sector for which there is ministerial and State responsibility.  Even data compiled by the State organisation Teagasc highlights that across the board, input prices rose by 30% in the past year with 200% increases in certain fertilisers.  The cost of fuel has risen by 38.5%.  The cost of feed has risen by 20%.  The cost of electricity has increased by 22%.  This situation is simply not sustainable at the current levels.  The Minister and the Government know that but remain silent and take no action.  They are as out of touch and arrogant as a British landlord during the Famine.  The lack of action on the part of the Government to support farm families is bitterly unfair and cruel.  Farmers cannot and certainly should not be treated in this manner.</p>  <p>  I would like to talk about fishing but I do not have time because I am giving time to Deputy Mattie McGrath.  We should have a debate on fishing.  There are tie-up and decommissioning schemes.  We were promised a scheme but the Minister did not announce it.  People are looking for an announcement around the decommissioning scheme so they know what is happening in that regard.  I know the Minister visited Keelbeg pier in Union Hall recently.  The funding to secure that pier has not been forthcoming and parts of it have now been shut down by the council.</p></speech>

This is one of the most phony, disrespectful and dishonest debates we have ever had in this House.  For ten weeks, and with the support of Sinn F&eacute;in and others, whose support I acknowledge, I have been looking for this debate.  The issue of the national maternity hospital arose two weeks ago and a debate was scheduled earlier today.  Debates on anything at all have been scheduled before the debate I requested.  Has the Government completely lost interest in Irish agriculture?  That is the way the Government is treating agriculture.</p>  <p>  The Minister has his head in the sand.  I mean no disrespect to him personally.  The Green Party Minister has him.  Farmers are being blackguarded.  Non-governmental organisations, from An Taisce down, are tormenting and plundering the land and family farms out there.  It is shocking.  We will not know our farming industry.</p>  <p>  Forestry is a complete mess.  The Minister did it deliberately.  I could mention all the other affected sectors one by one.  There is a pig crisis that shows why this debate is dishonest.  There has been a crisis in the pig sector for two years.  The first five minutes or more of the Minister's speech was all about the war.  The war is horrific, but all these problems were here before the war.  I ask the Minister to be honest with himself, us and the people he is supposed to represent.</p>  <p>  I am told the Minister can hardly go back to Donegal to meet the farmers and that is why he is at every mart in the country, from Mizen Head to God knows where; everyplace else.  All these problems existed before the war.  Representatives of the pig sector came to the Minister months ago.  They openly wept.  These are farming men and proud people who gave employment.  They had pig farms and saw them go down the drain.  They thought the Minister understood what to do for them.  They wanted &euro;100 million - &euro;50 million in supports and &euro;50 million to be borrowed.  What other group of people during the pandemic agreed to borrow anything and pay it back?  The Minister gave them a paltry &euro;7 million.  He is out of touch.  I cannot believe the Government's backbenchers are so out of touch.  I cannot believe the Government would abandon our primary industry and allow it to be thrown to the wind at the whim of the Green Party.  Deputy Leddin, who spoke earlier, is delighted about the high price of fertiliser because it meant farmers will not use it.</p> <p>Many towns, villages and cities are pumping out raw sewage.  The Government has closed its eyes to that but is persecuting, demonising and blackguarding the farmers, saying that they are doing this.  False figures are being produced.  This is a phoney debate and the media is 100% behind it.  One cannot criticise it.  If we have a referendum, a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator wants RT&Eacute; not to give one side of the debate the same amount of time as the other.  What next?  The Government is trying to perish our people.  I do not deny climate change but what the Government is doing is going to frighten the people.  It is destroying our industries and is reckless.  </p> <p> The Greens got their answer in Northern Ireland and they will get it here, very soon.  They were banished up there and they were banished here back in 2011 because of all the damage they did.  Now, they have so many NGOs appointed.  Imagine, there are 36,000 NGOs costing &euro;5.5 billion a year and they are destroying our people, our country, our land, our industry and above all, our heritage.  It is a shocking indictment of this Parliament the way power has been abdicated to these NGOs.  The tail is wagging the dog here with the Green Party and their green agenda.  The sooner they are gotten rid of out of this Parliament, the better.  Then we can go back to some kind of normal, decent politics and understand our people.  They can go and quash every other sector like housing and so on but farming must be protected and cannot be under siege the whole time. Deputy Collins said that the British landlords were not as bad at the time of the Famine.  Cromwell was not as bad when he said &ldquo;To hell or to Connaught&rdquo;.  The Greens want "To hell or to nowhere".</p></speech>

It can be hard for people outside the community to understand the significance of this or realise the effect it has had, but this is a community in decline, unfortunately, which is now threatened with the prospect of even further decline. The SFPA&rsquo;s actions have caused incredible uncertainty among the local people of my town who fear for their jobs and their livelihoods.  The sad thing about this is that the decline is because of Government inertia and not because of declining resources.</p>  <p>  The fishing community has taken blow after blow in the last couple of decades, beginning with our negotiations to join the EU and the Common Fisheries Policy. The effects of this have been felt in all our fishing towns, not only by our fishermen, but by our factory workers, our netmakers, yardsmen, truck drivers, boat painters, administration workers, as well as our tourism and hospitality industry. The knock-on effects are endless and although this may seem like a small problem in Dublin, it is having a colossal effect on Killybegs and other towns across the country.  It is very easy for Department officials to make such detrimental decisions without knowing their consequences.  This issue is far from their doorstep but it is right on mine.  My constituents and I are extremely worried about the future of our town.  I had hoped that having a Minister with responsibility for the marine from Donegal would have changed things, even slightly, but sadly we have not seen a positive effect yet.  The feeling of disconnect and the lack of respect for fishing communities remains.  We still do not have enough quota while, at the same time, other nations have more quota in our waters than they can catch and the Department is happy to go along with that.</p>  <p>  Why have we not been given the full rights to catch fish in our own waters when other countries do not use up their quota?  Our industry is dying while other countries thrive off our waters.  We make up 12% of all fishing grounds and waters of the European Union. We contribute hugely but get almost nothing in return.  No other European country would accept this.  Why do we accept this?  I urge the Minister to think of the people on the ground, the community and the local workers, who are feeling the worst effects of SFPA and European decisions as well as bad Government policy. It is high time he listened to his constituents and stood up for the fishing communities in his county.  Developing a policy for a review of the Common Fisheries Policy that benefits all would be a very good start.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200054#FFF00300"><p>In the short time available to me I wish to address a number of issues.  First, the Minister is quoted as having announced that there will not be a ban on below-cost selling in the upcoming Bill.   That, I have to say, comes as a huge disappointment to me.  It is illustrative of the disconnect between what the Department is claiming to want to achieve and what it is actually doing.  I do appreciate that there could potentially be competition issues around a ban on below-cost selling but it is not necessarily so.  The Spanish Government, as I am sure the Minister is aware from attending agriculture meetings at EU level, legislated to ban below-cost selling in the agricultural sector.  That was successful, as far as I am aware.  I am not aware of any infringement proceedings being taken by the EU against the Spanish, so it is possible to do so.</p>  <p>  Many people have been talking about the environment and about the importance of protecting the environment, including the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  I would agree with her on that but one of the worst things we can do is force farmers to produce below the cost of production because inevitably, in a desperate attempt to stay afloat, they are going to use more intensive agriculture methods and then something has to give.  What gives, of course, is the farmers&rsquo; livelihoods, possibly their health, including their mental health and also the environment.  It is possible to objectively determine the cost of production.  Teagasc has a fairly good handle on this.  While I am not saying that Teagasc has a monopoly of knowledge on this matter, it is one State agency that could be tasked with doing this.</p>  <p>  Speaking of State agencies brings me on to my next issue, which is the Protected Geographical Indicator, PGI, that was being advanced to great fanfare by Bord Bia but which seems to be stuck now.  Again, there is a feeling that this is going to benefit farmers but I am afraid it is not because it is going to be just one more tool to say that the whole national herd, effectively, is going to qualify for the PGI because it is so loosely drafted.  The producer&rsquo;s group is Bord Bia.  If one looks at the definition in the European regulation, it is required to be a producer or a representative of producers but Bord Bia is neither.  It is certainly not a group that represents beef producers.  It is a broad entity.</p>  <p>  We all know what Bord Bia is, which is a broad marketing board for all food produce.  It is not a collective of beef producers or a representative body for beef producers.  It is far broader than that.  Even at that very basic level, then, I would question the lawfulness of it.  Notwithstanding that, it is tied up now because of the objection from the United Kingdom.  I can see why people think it will bring a benefit but in reality all it will do is stop that which the PGI is designed to protect, which is small groups coming together to say that they have a unique product like Burren lamb, Connemara lamb, Burren beef and so forth and to be able to market that.  If everybody, including Larry Goodman, Dawn Meats, Kepak and all of the big players, will be able to go out and say that all of their beef has this PGI on it, which is effectively what the Department is hoping to do, then it makes it impossible for the smaller producer groups to actually do that.  It takes away any competitive advantage that they could obtain.</p>  <p>  The last thing I want to discuss is the incentives the Government has brought in around tillage.  The Minister could not foresee the war in Ukraine and I am not expecting that he should have been able to do so.  It is not unreasonable, however, to suggest that the war will be ongoing next year and the difficulties that exist this year will be there next year too.  In Clare there is not a huge amount of tillage typically.  In Donegal, there is more tillage but people cannot just change from beef or dairy to tillage overnight.  The land is not there and the means and knowledge, particularly, is not there.  I would like the Minister to confirm that this will be a scheme into the indefinite future or for at least as long as the current situation in Ukraine and Russia persists so that farmers can plan for the future and avail of this into the future.</p></speech>

The Ministers of State, Deputy Heydon and Senator Hackett, and I are always very willing and open to engaging with Members in the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We are always available and very keen to ensure that there is enough time to discuss all of these issues.  I am happy to come into the House every week, if needs be.  Certainly, if there was any challenge around the organisation of a debate, it would have been around the ordering of the D&aacute;il business.  There was certainly no lack of availability at my end.  Again, where there are any slots available or any potential for debate, I will always be available.  I will come in the following week, happily, and would be only delighted to do so.  The challenge is with the Business Committee and trying to order all of the business of the D&aacute;il and find space, given that there are only three sitting days per week.  I am delighted to be here, as are the Ministers of State, Deputy Heydon and Senator Hackett.</p> <p>We cannot give enough time in this Chamber and the Oireachtas generally to such an important industry.  It is the largest and most important industry in the country, our largest employer and largest source of exports.  It deserves all the time it can get.  I am glad to be here today.</p> <p> I will respond to Deputies in reverse order given that some of those who contributed last are still here.  Deputy McNamara made a point on low-cost selling.  We had low-cost selling in this country until the mid-2000s and it did not really work.  The practice was removed because it was found to add red tape and cost to the consumer, while not necessarily protecting the primary producer, which is our objective.  As I said at a seminar held last week at the Backweston campus attended by many farming representatives and stakeholders, what we would really like to achieve, although it is not really possible, is a ban on below-cost buying.  We want to ensure that when people are buying from the primary producer the latter achieves a margin.  We cannot legislate for that but we must try to put in place a structure and system that respects primary producers and ensures they get a margin.  This will be the key objective of the office.  I am not sure if Deputy McNamara made a submission to the consultation but if not, I am open to any ideas or suggestions he may wish to make in a submission at this stage.</p> <p> On PGI status, we have tremendous product in this country, namely, grass-fed beef.  The idea behind PGI status is to put an identity on it that is recognised internationally and can add value to a product.  That is the approach being taken.</p> <p> On tillage, Deputy McNamara is right that we can only do so much and we cannot change things overnight.  We wanted to do as much as we could to support people to do as much as they can.  This is why we have introduced a payment of &euro;400 per hectare for additional tillage grown this year.  There has been a good response to this measure.  I recognise the work of the chairman of the national fodder and food security committee, Mr. Mike Magan, and the role of Teagasc and Dr. Frank O'Mara, on the committee.  The committee's assessment is that we are potentially looking at an increase of between 5% and 10%.  If that is achieved, it will be a significant increase in one year.  We want to try to continue to increase the area under tillage.  We will have to look at how we do that in future years but it is certainly an objective.</p> <p> Deputy Pringle referred to Killybegs and stated that, as a Minister from Donegal with responsibility for the marine, I had not yet made much of a difference.  He cannot have been paying much attention because he has obviously missed all the investment in piers and harbours in the county, be it at Greencastle, Killybegs or Rathmullan, and elsewhere across the country.</p></speech>

The heartland of the processing sector is Killybegs and all of the companies in the town will be able to avail of that funding, which is very significant.</p>  <p>  At national level, we are battling at all stages for additional quotas.  The biggest single impact on our national quota and fisheries sector over the past generation has been Brexit.  Deputy Pringle, who is from Killybegs, ardently supported and advocated for Brexit.  While the Deputy did not have a vote in Northern Ireland or Britain, he ardently supported Brexit.  Nowhere in Europe has been more impacted by Brexit than Killybegs, which is the centre of the national fishing industry.  No sector of our economy has been more affected by Brexit than fisheries.  If Deputy Pringle wants to wonder about making an impact as a local Deputy backing fisheries, perhaps he should take a look in the mirror and consider the impact of his own policy.  Not many paid attention but the policy he advocated for had that impact.</p>  <p>  On fisheries policy and control issues, this has been a challenging time.  Representatives of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority will attend the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine next week, which will be a good opportunity for discussion of those issues.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of weighing in Derry versus Killybegs and the impact of Brexit on that.  There has not been any change since Brexit.  The situation that pertains post-Brexit as regards weighing control between Derry and Killybegs and Northern Ireland and the Republic is the same as was prior to Brexit.  Brexit has not been a factor in that.  The same control issues and rules apply.</p>  <p>  For a Deputy who was supposedly seeking this debate for ten weeks, Deputy Mattie McGrath did not have a whole lot to say or there was not a whole lot of content in what he said.  The Deputy went around the house pressing lots of buttons but I did not pick up much substance, which is no change from the usual.</p></speech>

The key message for all of us, which I will give again today, is that it is important that people do the best they can this year to grow grass, fodder, silage and tillage.  That has been happening but over the course of this year we need to make a big effort to prepare for next winter and spring to make sure we are fodder secure.  It is about doing that planning.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael Collins stated that I had been silent for the past few months.  I am not sure where he gets that from.  The Government has been closely assessing and monitoring the situation and responding, whether to the real challenges facing the pig sector or the horticulture sector.  I have been working with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on horticulture, and with the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, on the pig sector.  We have also responded by supporting the fodder and tillage sectors.  The Government recognises that it cannot do everything but we have been very much listening to and working with all sectors to try to support them.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy O'Connor for his comments and his advocacy on behalf of Ballycotton pier.  He has been able to deliver &euro;1.5 million for his local community on that.  I take on board his points about work permits.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Cahill for his contribution, which focused on the significant cost inputs in the sector.  We will take that on board.  The Deputy made a very important point about the supply of beef next winter.  It is for this reason we have introduced a fodder support scheme to try to ensure there is good fodder supply.  There will be an important relationship there between processors and farmers in preparing for next winter and making sure farmers are well supported to produce beef next winter.</p>  <p>  I do not have time to respond to many of the other comments.  Overall , this has been a very useful and worthwhile debate.  The vast majority of Deputies approached it from a constructive point of view.  I thank the Oireachtas and the Business Committee for scheduling this debate and the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating it.  We will continue as a team to be available, working with everyone in the Oireachtas to support our farming community, a great sector which it is an honour to represent.</p></speech>

I raised the matter in the House during questions on promised legislation.  The competition to fill places on this course was completed back in 2019.</p> <p>Those selected garda&iacute; have been waiting since 2019 to take part in this armed support unit training.  These garda&iacute; effectively have had to put elements of their personal lives on hold while they wait on standby for their start date.  It now appears that with a click of the fingers, this training course is gone and they have waited in vain.  Garda headquarters said claims that the 2019 competition has been halted are incorrect.  However, Garda membership say the message has been delivered clearly to them that it has been cancelled.</p> <p> There were widespread media reports last week that the armed support unit across Dublin had barely enough resources to be operational and is only at 75% capacity.  Last year alone, there were more than 2,500 weapons and explosive offences across the State.  Ireland has a high rate of gun violence.  Our gun murder rate is six times that of Britain and one of the highest across the EU.</p> <p> Of course, it is not only firearms incidents to which the armed support unit responds.  It is called upon daily to deal with the growing use of knives by gangs.  Over a four-year period, the number of knife seizures in Dublin across most divisions has doubled.  Local residents in City Quay have raised the issue before.  They are still living in dread.  I acknowledge that the Garda has put in place a plan to tackle the random street violence and use of knives in City Quay and in the Creighton Street and Pearse Street areas. That has been very welcome and has made a difference.  Residents still live in dread, however.  Young people are hiding weapons and knives in the bushes of Elizabeth O'Farrell Park in City Quay.  It is still a community in fear.  It is really important that the armed support unit is resourced properly.</p> <p> The increasing use of weapons such as guns and knives is a cause for concern, not just for working-class communities but also the rank-and-file garda&iacute; who patrol the streets.  When a 999 call comes in regarding a possible knife or gun crime, it is the armed support unit that garda&iacute; turn to for backup.  How does it instil confidence in the public when we hear reports of garda&iacute; having to wait up to three hours for support?  The feud that has already claimed one life in Finglas is at boiling point.  Gangland tension is rising across Dublin and spilling over into different parts of the city, including my own constituency of Dublin Bay South.  Recently in Digges Street, shots were fired through a window at a family who were all at home.  It was a case of mistaken identity.  The perpetrators thought it was a different flat.  That family is terrified; they are afraid go back home now.</p> <p> Will the Minister of State comment on the current status of the next round of training for the Dublin region armed support unit?  I understand the Government may be of the view that this an internal matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it is independent in its allocation of resources.  Naturally, it always says that but things have got so bad that it is very important the Government intervenes to ensure resources are in place to allow the armed support unit to make sure our communities right across the inner city are safe.  Currently, that feeling is not there.  The Garda and armed support unit need to be resourced properly.</p></speech>

The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that Garda training is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Under section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business, including the training of Garda members and staff.  The Minister for Justice has no role in these operational policing matters.  I am advised by the Commissioner that the armed support units are regional resources, serving all the Garda districts and divisions in each of the Garda regions.</p>  <p>  The armed support units are an overt armed support service and are deployed on a 24-7 basis, providing a high-visibility, tactical armed response, including enhanced, less lethal capability.  Members of the armed support units are highly trained and equipped with a variety of non-lethal and lethal weapons and perform high-visibility armed checkpoints and patrols throughout their respective regions.</p>  <p>  In the event of an armed incident or similar incident, armed detective members from local district and divisional units will respond, as will the regional armed support unit.  Should the incident be escalated and further armed support be required, the national emergency response unit, which is highly trained and specially equipped to respond to the most serious of incidents, is also available.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the training and deployment of armed support units remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022 in line with best international practices.  Recertification and refresher training continues to be provided for armed support units in both the Dublin metropolitan region and nationwide.  I am further advised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that all armed support unit personnel received the necessary training in 2021 to permit issuance with authority to carry firearms in 2022.</p>  <p>  The Garda has advised that preselection and predeployment training for armed support unit applicants as part of an ongoing competition to fill vacancies in the armed support units nationally has been intermittently impacted and delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic and other competing training demands.  I understand, however, that a number of candidates for the Dublin metropolitan region armed support unit completed their predeployment training requirements in March 2022 and await allocation by Garda human resource management to existing vacancies in the region.</p>  <p>  The Government's commitment to tackle organised crime and the related issue of gangland violence is reflected in the Justice Plan 2022, which contains a number of actions under the objective of strengthening measures to tackle terrorism and other serious and organised crime through domestic action and international co-operation.  The Minister looks forward to updating the Deputy again on these matters in due course.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about the seriousness of knife crime.  It is an issue that needs to be tackled.  I thank him for raising this very important matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1555" speakername="Chris Andrews" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200056#HHH00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for that response.  I did anticipate that he was going to say it was an operational matter and, of course, nobody expects the Government to get involved in the day-today running.  When there is an armed support unit, however, which is vital to the safety of communities throughout the country, and no more so than in Dublin Bay South in the inner city where, like I said, there is serious violence using knives and where guns are being shot, Government must intervene, not in how its personnel are trained or where they are deployed but to ensure it has enough resources.  If it does not have enough resources, the garda&iacute; cannot do their jobs properly and protect the communities they have been requested to protect.</p>  <p>  The competition process for the Dublin region of the armed support unit was launched in 2019 and, of course, it was impacted by the pandemic.  However, the reason for launching that competition has not changed and probably has become more acute and worsened.  It was launched in 2019 due to the low numbers in the armed support unit and, three years on, approximately ten garda&iacute; have left the unit recently due to transfers and promotions.  With a fresh round of promotions to the rank of sergeant issued last Friday, it is safe to say the number of departures will grow.  In effect, the combined resources will probably be down approximately 75% to 80% of what they should be.  That is not acceptable.  Communities are being left exposed.  I accept the Government cannot intervene in day-to-day procedures but it must intervene to ensure the Garda armed support unit and individual garda&iacute; are resourced properly in order that they can protect communities like those in City Quay and Pearse Street that have been left high and dry.  They have been left to try to look after themselves, and that will not suit anyone.</p></speech>

As I outlined, tackling organised criminal activity remains a key priority for the Government.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I are very conscious of the repercussions such criminal behaviour can have on the quality of life for residents in local communities, as the Deputy has outlined.  It is important people feel safe and are safe in their communities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is currently being drafted and will provide, among other matters, for an increase in the penalty for conspiring to commit murder and soliciting to commit murder from a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p> <p> Work is continuing on the drafting of the Bill based on the general scheme and further legal advices.  The 2022 justice plan commits to the publication of these provisions in the second quarter of this year.  This and other initiatives in train, such as the commitment in the justice plan to working to break the link between gangs and the children they seek to recruit, build on the considerable range of legislative measures taken in recent years, such as the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2016, which provides additional Garda power for the immediate seizure of assets suspected of being the proceeds of crime to prevent them from being disposed of; the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, providing for the establishment and operation of the DNA database providing the Garda with links between people and unsolved crimes; and the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, introduced to protect the justice system from being subverted by criminal groups, including the potential intimidation of juries.</p> <p> The Deputy raised some very important issues, which I will bring to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

It is well known that as many as 14 different feuds, involving seven families, are smearing Longford's reputation and propelling us in the media as an area rife for antisocial and violent behaviour.  Longford has been selected as one of the three national pilot schemes for the local community safety partnership.  As part of the engagement process, the Minister sat in on a recent session of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g in Longford town, at which she heard at first hand young people speak of their fear on the streets of Longford.</p>  <p>  Community policing needs resources, and when we do it right, it can be very effective.  We have an excellent drugs unit in the Longford-Roscommon district and one of the top-performing community policing units in Longford town, ably led by Sergeant Darren Conlon, but to maintain that level of visible policing we need personnel.  It takes a minimum of three officers to staff the station, and more if there are prisoners on site. The latest figures suggest the total complement of officers for Longford town is 77 garda&iacute;, with a further 62 throughout the county.  However, as of the end of February, at least 22 of these officers were unavailable for duty, through either secondment to other duties or districts, absence due to injury or illness or being on restricted duty.  At best, Longford Garda station is struggling to operate, with at least one in five of its allotted officers absent, and this is before it makes provision for court duties and other operations.  It is simply impossible to meet the demands now facing this busy station.</p>  <p>  The Minister met Superintendent S&eacute;amus Boyle and other senior officers on her recent visit, and as one they spoke to the urgent need for more garda&iacute; for Longford town.  The population of the town is approximately 12,000, yet in recent weeks an additional six garda&iacute; were allocated to the leafy suburb of Malahide, which has a population of 4,000 and very few of the socioeconomic challenges facing us in Longford.  Garda management is reviewing its options for Longford and, based on the Malahide numbers, one would expect an additional five or six officers for Longford.  That, in turn, presents us with an opportunity to bring in experienced officers, several of whom are currently based in Dublin and are very adept at dealing with the issues and challenges that now confront Longford.  They are willing and eager to relocate to Longford and will bring with them much-needed experience and know-how as we face the malaise that is afflicting our town.</p>  <p>  We hear much criticism of the courts in the context of the challenges facing Longford.  There is sufficient legislation on the Statute Book to tackle these challenges, but what we need is a strict and near-militant interpretation of the bail laws.  Bail is not a get-out-of-jail card but rather a privilege afforded to some while they await a court date.  It comes with strict conditions, which can include the need to sign on daily at the local Garda station or to stay out a given town, non-association with named individuals, curfews, social media bans and, indeed, anything a garda considers necessary in the interests of public safety.  Most judges will approve these terms and others if the case is set out for them.  We need to start fully implementing the terms of the Bail Act.  At any time, 50 to 70 people are on bail in Longford town.  It is a major Garda operation in itself to police the conditions of these bail terms and it demands time and resources, but when done meticulously it can be a very effective deterrent.</p>  <p>  In short, we need more garda&iacute; for Longford town, visible on-street policing and a meticulous governing of the bail conditions in Longford town.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with the disturbing news that has come from Longford in recent months.  As he acknowledged, the allocation of Garda resources is an operational policing matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Section 33 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended, provides for the Commissioner to determine the manner in which members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are distributed and stationed throughout the State, and the Minister has no statutory role in regard to this matter.  She has been advised that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends to ensure their optimum use.  I understand it is a matter for the divisional chief superintendent to determine the optimal distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the division and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 6 May 2022, resourcing in the Longford district comprises one superintendent, three inspectors, 13 sergeants and 79 garda&iacute;, and that the majority of violent crimes occurring in the Longford district in the year to date have related to feuding families.  Local Garda management has responded to the situation between the feuding families by establishing Operation Stola in April 2019 to accurately monitor, record and manage the feud.  I am further advised 6,761 incidents have been associated with this operation and that all resources within the Longford district are actively targeting the issues surrounding the feud, with 206 arrests effected and 454 charges preferred.  A total of 54 of the charges relate to violent crimes, including assaults, violent disorder and knife crimes.</p>  <p>  More generally, I am aware An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Longford is dealing with all reported crimes - antisocial behaviour and otherwise - within Longford district in an expedited manner.  It is working closely with the victims of crime and the public in general to ensure it provides an efficient policing service to Longford.  For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with an unprecedented allocation provided in budget 2022 of more than &euro;2 billion.  This includes funding for the recruitment of up to 800 Garda members and 400 Garda staff this year.  As the Deputy noted, the Minister engaged with community representatives during a visit to County Longford in February and is encouraged by the positive collaborative work emanating from Longford's pilot local community safety partnership.  The partnership represents a significant element of the Government's new community safety policy, which facilitates formal collaboration by community representatives, local business and public service providers to tackle key issues identified by the community itself.  The Longford partnership is subject to independent monitoring and evaluation throughout the life of the pilot, and learnings arising from its operation will inform its work into the future as well as the roll-out of partnerships nationwide.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the allocation of resources and garda&iacute; to a town in north Dublin.  I am sure that will be brought to the attention of the local Garda authorities.  Situations such as the one the Deputy raised should be dealt with and should get the necessary resources, but that is a matter for the Garda authorities.</p></speech>

He set out clearly the specifics of the Garda operation under way in Longford and the fact there have been almost 7,000 incidents related to an operation launched in 2019.</p> <p>The reality is that businesses and retailers are facing into what will arguably be one of the most uncertain times in their trading lives with soaring energy costs and a cost-of-living crisis.  The traders and businesses of Longford town face the additional challenge of violence on the street and the public consciously deciding not to visit the town, not to shop there and not to socialise in their county town.  It is an enormous additional and wholly unreasonable burden to place on a town.  It is a burden that has now plagued Longford for almost a decade.  These acts of violence and public order violations are a stain on the decades of toil, passion and absolute dedication and devotion that are synonymous with Longford and on the selfless sacrifice that helped to make Longford a leading light in provincial Ireland.  An extra five to six officers, boots on the ground and a rigid application of the bail laws would allow us to put the colour and swagger back into Longford.  It is not a big ask but it is one we make with deference and a heartfelt sense of absolute necessity.  </p> <p> I thank the Minister of State and the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue tonight.  At a time when we are starting to see real and significant progress in job creation and investment in Longford, the near incessant linking of the town with violent crime is highly demoralising.  Longford remains one of the best places to live and work and is definitely one of the best places in Ireland to do business.  It gives me no pleasure to paint the picture I have painted here in the House this evening.  I thank my colleague, Councillor Seamus Butler, who instigated this very public appeal for additional garda&iacute;.  I know that Garda allocation remains the domain of the Commissioner but it is important that he hears the concerns I am raising here tonight, which are the heartfelt concerns of the people of Longford.</p></speech>

Tackling organised criminal activity remains a key priority for this Government.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I are very conscious of the repercussions such criminal behaviour can have on the quality of life of residents and local communities.  It is important that people feel safe and are safe in their communities.  Again, I am familiar with this issue.  It is not nice to listen to the bad news emanating from Longford.  These activities are carried out by people who do not have the goodwill of the people of Longford.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</p>  <p>  To look at what has been done, there are currently 6,761 incidents associated with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's operation in the area.  All resources in the Longford district are actively targeting the issues surrounding the feud with 206 arrests effected and 454 charges preferred.  Some 54 of these charges relate to violent crimes including assaults, violent assaults and knife crime.  That is a shocking statistic.  I thank the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the incredible work they do, which sometimes goes unnoticed.  I also want to thank the communities and people of Longford, the Deputy and the other Oireachtas Members from the county, the local representatives and all of the various stakeholders for standing up and raising this issue.  By tackling it together, across the community, with the help of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all of its resources, this situation can be resolved.  I hope it can be resolved quickly.</p></speech>

We are in the midst of a catastrophic crisis in child disability services.  The lack of early intervention is detrimental to our children and will result in teenagers and young adults with extreme and complex medical issues and needs arising from the neglect of this Government and the Department with regard to continuing staffing issues.  Although the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is not here, he did recently meet a mother, Susan Dixon.  She has sent me an email which was cc'd to the Minister and which I have to put on the record:</p> <blockquote> 	My son Leo has an extremely rare form of bethlem myopathy muscular dystrophy, a completely unique variation.  Its a progressive muscle wasting disease with no cure and no treatment.  Therapies are essential to maintain ... his mobility and his independence.<br /><br />[He] has attended hse services since he was 6 weeks old.  He then moved to Enable Ireland services when he was 3.  He needs a multi disciplinary team of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. ... [While we] completely understood that covid halted some of the therapies ... my sons condition did not go away when covid arrived.<br /><br />The issues I'm about to outline are not covid related, they are staffing, management and funding related.<br /><br />Over the past 2 years my sons condition has progressed to a point where he depends on a wheelchair to attend school and manage any distances. We accepted a temporary chair in April 2021 with the promise of his own chair correctly fitted and appropriate for his [personal physical] circumstances. We had a seating assessment in January 2022 and at this appointment we were informed about the extremely long wait for funding from the HSE.  I explained at the time the urgency of this chair as my son is no longer able to self propel in [his] chair, it's too heavy.  The Chair itself was second or third hand by the time it got to us and is in a shocking state.  The brakes don't work, the handles used to push him are broken and taped into position and the wheelrims are so worn that when he does try to self propel he gets metal splinters and cuts on his hands.  It is a health and safety risk and is not fit for purpose. ... My son needs his wheelchair its that simple.  I need someone to make a phone call, write a letter or send an email anything to help my son regain his independence. </blockquote>  <p>She cannot afford to replace it but she wishes she could.  She also wrote:</p> <blockquote> 	We were then informed, when I pushed for answers, that this paperwork was left on a desk for 9 WEEKS before it was finally sent to the HSE for funding approval, due to staffing issues. ... My sons independence is GONE.....he is 9 years old and might as well be in a buggy, he has to be pushed around everywhere he goes.  He can not be left unattended in the chair as the brakes don't work and if he rolls he hasn't got the strength to stop himself. ...<br /><br />I feel my son is just one of thousands of children that have been forgotten about, pushed aside. ... He had [a neck injury] in August 2021 and was in a neck brace for 10 weeks.  His consultant requested he attend intensive physio for the 10 weeks (2 sessions a week) ... .we got 6!!!!!  </blockquote>  <p>:I cannot finish the email but it gets even worse.  I am going to run out of time.  As part of the Department, the Minister of State is fully aware of how shambolic the situation is.  Every week, we get letters telling us that services are following the HSE recruitment process but do not have staff.  For two years, they have had not had staff.  I am reliably informed that we do not even have enough graduates coming out of college this year to take up the slack.  When is this going to improve?  Who is going to get a wheelchair for Leo Dixon?</p></speech>

On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I restate this Government's commitment to children and young people with disabilities, as well as their families.  The Deputy talked about Leo Dixon and the fact that a letter spent nine weeks on a desk.  That is simply unacceptable.  The Deputy was involved in the private sector and ran her own haulage company.  It is very difficult to stand over a letter spending nine weeks on a desk.  That is certainly not the way a Department or service should be run, leaving aside all of the other issues the Deputy outlined with regard to the wheelchair and so on.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, accepts that the HSE has faced considerable challenges in parts of the country in the implementation of the progressing disability services programme.  This has resulted in delays for families in accessing much-needed therapies for their children.  Historically, children's disability services have been provided by a range of statutory and non-statutory service providers and the type and level of service provided varied widely across the country.</p> <p>The progressing disability services, PDS, model seeks to address the previous unacceptable inequity in service provision where there may have been an excellent service for some children and little or no service for others.</p> <p> As the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has stated previously in this House, the reconfiguration of children's disability network teams, CDNTs, across the country has been challenging, particularly in the context of staffing.  To illustrate these challenges, the HSE recently undertook a national children's disability network team staff census, which highlighted that the CHOs are, on average, operating with a 28% vacancy rate.  The unfortunate reality is that there are recruitment challenges due to the significant availability of new posts across the health and social care sector, both public and private.  These staffing issues have resulted in delays for families to access much-needed therapies for their children, delays which have caused untold stress and justifiable anger on the part of these families.  That anger is understandable and, once again, on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I wish to put on record the Government's sincerest apologies to any family experiencing such delays.</p> <p> Such delays are simply unacceptable and need to be overcome to ensure delivery.  In that regard, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is currently engaging in a series of meetings with the heads of disability services across the nine CHOs to hear what is happening on the ground in their respective areas.  It is expected that these discussions will provide the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, with further detail on the challenges being encountered and, it is hoped, will generate potential solutions.</p> <p> The Deputy will also be aware of the recent High Court judgment on the assessment of needs process.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is attending a day-long workshop tomorrow, the aim of which is to develop new interim guidelines to support the assessment of needs process and guide front-line staff.  This workshop will be attended by key stakeholders, including senior HSE officials, Department of Health officials and representatives of professional bodies.  Most importantly, children and young people will also be represented in the form of parents' representatives.  In the interim, the use of the standard operating procedure as part of the assessment of needs process has ceased and practitioners will use their clinical judgment in relation to ongoing assessments.  As we begin this process, we need to reaffirm that the assessment of needs is only the first stage of a journey towards vital therapy supports.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, remains committed to ensuring that the journey is made easier for families throughout the country.</p></speech>

The answer is always just another network or it is a staffing issue, but we never seem to get to grips with the staffing issue in such a way that we would outsource it or consider critical skills permits.  I have been saying this so repetitively on the floor of the House that even the Ceann Comhairle must be sick listening to me.  An apology just does not cut it.  As already stated, I do not doubt the Minister of State's bona fides but the apology will not buy the wheelchair or provide the wheelchair.</p>  <p>  Next Wednesday, I am taking little Leo Dixon up here to the D&aacute;il because he wants to sit in the Minister of State's seat and he wants to sit in the Minister's seat, given he is from Arklow, County Wicklow, in the Minister's constituency.  While he is sitting in their seats, I very much hope that they will sit in his - a wheelchair not fit for purpose - for the eight hours a day that he sits in it, and then see how quickly he will get his wheelchair.  Is it not a disgrace that an eight-year-old boy had surgery on his neck that has to be redone because he did not get the physiotherapy he was entitled to and because they had not provided a wheelchair that he should have had to assist him?  What is wrong in this country that we have this total lack of services?  It is beyond belief at this stage.</p>  <p>  I spoke to families who held a rally outside D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last week.  I met them in Wexford when they held a rally in Enniscorthy.  There were some 30 families with placards stating that the HSE is letting their children down; there were lots of different placards but not one was positive, I can assure the House.  The reality is that much of it is to do with the new CDNTs but this child has been suffering for nine years.  He is going to be here next Wednesday.  The Minister of State can use his two minutes to tell me when Leo will be getting his wheelchair.  That is the question.</p></speech>

As stated, progressing children's disability services is the policy underpinning children's disability services.  All 91 CDNT teams are now established and while I know they are challenged with recruitment and retention issues, they are in place and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is continuing to engage with the HSE to fill the vacant posts and to progress the service provision.</p>  <p>  This has never been a question of a lack of financial commitment.  The Government has provided significant funding to the HSE for new posts in recent years.  Since 2019, almost 500 additional whole-time equivalent posts for children's disability services have been allocated.  However, for various reasons, filling these posts has proven to be incredibly challenging.  I know the various CHOs have prioritised filling these posts as a matter of great urgency.  In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has begun discussions with the Minister for Higher and Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, around improving the disability workforce supply in the longer term.</p>  <p>  I will bring the Deputy&rsquo;s comments back to the Minister of State and inform her that this young man is coming to Leinster House next Wednesday.  The Deputy talked about a new wheelchair.  I will raise this in the Department as quickly as possible in the morning to see if anything can be done.  On behalf of Deputy Rabbitte, I would like to restate her commitment, as Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, to strive for the best services possible for children with disabilities and for their families.  On this occasion, the best service has not been provided.  I will bring that issue and the Deputy's concerns back to the Minister of State.</p></speech>

That is something we need to address.  We cannot continue having these same conversations.</p>  <p>  I want to start with the response to parliamentary question I received in the past while.  It stated that there were no occupational therapists in paediatric services at the HSE primary care centre in Barrack Street, Dundalk, with four vacant posts to be recruited and one maternity leave vacancy.  There had been a failure to fill vacant posts via agency recruitment, but there will be a recruitment competition alongside three other CHOs to fill senior vacancies.  It will be late autumn before any successful applicants are appointed.  What we are talking about is 659 children on the waiting list for primary care, occupational therapy or paediatric assessment.  Some 382 of those children have been on the list more than a year.  The average waiting time is circa three years.</p>  <p>  We can pick multiple issues.  I am dealing with a nine-year-old boy with global development delay, which involves mental and physical issues.  His father has been told recently that for occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, he could be waiting another eight to 12 months for an appointment.  He was initially with the early intervention team in the Boyne Business Park in Drogheda until he was six, and then he was moved to the children's team in Dundalk.  He got access to services until October 2019.  While I accept that Covid created difficulties, he has not got any face-to-face speech and language therapy in the interim.  An occupational therapist has visited since we became involved but, obviously, that is not sufficient to cut the mustard, given the circumstances.  We are also dealing with a man with an autistic four-year-old who is not toilet trained and cannot get a place in a school.  There are major issues involved here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-12a.617" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022051200059#LLL01100"><p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be familiar with the issues in County Meath.</p> <p>She attended a meeting with parents of children with disabilities on 3 May in Pillo Hotel, so she will have heard the case articulated and spelt out clearly far better than I can do now.  Similar to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I have replies to parliamentary questions.  There are four children's disability network teams in the county and every one of them has vacancies.  In some, one in four positions are vacant.  There are vacancies at every grade and across every discipline.  That has a real impact on the services that are available to people.  It has to be addressed, and it does not end there.  One can say the same with regard to paediatric psychiatry and say it ten times over with regard to respite care.</p></speech>

On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I reaffirm the Government's commitment to children with disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Rabbitte is fully committed to the development and enhancement of services for children with disabilities.  She recognises that the changes brought about through the progressing disability services, PDS, programme have been challenging for many stakeholders, including health professionals and referrers, but most importantly for families.  As she has outlined many times when this issue is raised, every Member of the House strives to reduce waiting times for children who require therapy supports.  She welcomes the full reconfiguration of children's disability services in the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, with a total of 91 CDNTs across the nine community healthcare organisations.</p>  <p>  While this is a positive step, it must be acknowledged that there have been significant difficulties in certain parts of the country in the implementation of the PDS by the HSE.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has openly acknowledged this.  Unfortunately, these issues have resulted in long delays for families to access much-needed therapies for their children.  These delays have caused untold stress and justifiable anger on the part of those families.  That anger is understandable and deeply regrettable.  Once again, the Minister of State and I wish to put on the record the Government's sincerest apologies to any family experiencing these delays.  Such delays are unacceptable and we must work together to find innovative and suitable means to overcome the constraints affecting service delivery.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, recently hosted a families' disability services forum in Meath where she listened to a number of concerned families speak about long waiting times for both assessments and therapy supports.  She is aware that some families in the area are waiting four years for an assessment of needs.  Once again, and in particular for the benefit of families who may not be aware of this, it is not necessary for a child to have an assessment of needs to access therapy supports.  The Minister of State is aware that network teams in Kingscourt, Dunshaughlin, Navan and so forth are experiencing challenges, particularly in the area of recruitment, resulting in unacceptably low child-to-therapist staffing ratios which lead to unacceptable delays in accessing supports.  This is reflective of the national picture.  The HSE recently undertook a national children's disability network teams staff census which highlighted that the CHOs are, on average, operating with a 28% vacancy rate.  This is one of a number of issues that require long-term solutions.  I assure Members that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is currently engaging with HSE officials from the national office on this.</p></speech>

There was a family intervention meeting and the mother was told that no therapies would be possible for a couple of months.  This child is not toilet trained and that is creating specific difficulties.  The problem is that the child cannot get a place in a special school or in a regular school until that is resolved.  The only thing the mother is being offered is parenting programmes.  Obviously, this is not fit-for-purpose.</p>  <p>  We must get serious about workforce planning.  We know what numbers we have, but we need an assessment of how many people we need and we must find any means possible to ensure we can employ those people.  Looking down the line, we must ensure there is a throughput of people being trained.  It is also about ensuring we facilitate people with work visas and whatever else is necessary.  As we can see, the cost of not doing this is astronomical.</p></speech>

It is a huge undertaking.  They have clear requests and I will put some of them on the record.  In child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in County Meath there is no specific learning disability team.  There are such teams in other counties and there must be one in Meath.</p>  <p>  On the issue of assessments of needs, the services are not available for children.  There is an acute shortage of residential respite care in County Meath that has to be addressed.  There is insufficient emergency respite in the county and one must go outside the county to Ardee or Balbriggan.  There is a list and I will send it on.  The Minister of State is aware of it.  We must see progress on these matters.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to workforce planning.  That is quite a reasonable suggestion.</p>  <p>  Progressing children's disability services is the policy underpinning children's disability services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, believes in the overarching aim of PDS, which is equitable access to a team of multidisciplinary clinicians.  However, she acknowledges that the HSE's roll-out of PDS has not been smooth, and the Deputies articulated the challenges that exist.  Nonetheless, 91 teams are established and the Minister of State is continuing to engage with the HSE to fill the vacant posts and to bring them towards the levels required.</p>  <p>  The Government has provided funding to the HSE for new posts in recent years.  Since 2019, almost 500 additional whole-time equivalent posts for children's disability services have been allocated.  The Minister of State will continue in her efforts at local and national levels to address the obstacles that exist in recruitment and other important issues.  As I outlined, she has begun discussions with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, about improving the disability workforce supply in the longer term.  I restate on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, her absolute commitment to strive for the best services possible for children and young people with disabilities and for their families.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Rourke raised a few issues.  If he wishes to send the email to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I am sure she will deal with it as urgently as possible.  I hope there will be some improvement in services in the near future.</p></speech>

She could not be here today due to a family bereavement.  All our thoughts are with her on the loss of her sister, Lilian.  I am standing in for her today and, in doing so, I acknowledge the work of her parliamentary assistant, Councillor Jodie Neary, in bringing this Bill together.</p>  <p>  National Biodiversity Week is starting tomorrow.  It is a timely reminder of the importance of our role as politicians to respond to the urgency of biodiversity loss in Ireland and to use the mechanisms available to us to push this agenda further.  Almost exactly one year ago today, Deputy Whitmore did just that by tabling a Bill seeking to give basking sharks additional protection by placing them as a protected species under the Fifth Schedule to the 1976 Wildlife Act.  The basking shark, known as Gaeilge as liamh&aacute;n m&oacute;r gr&eacute;ine, the great fish of the sun, is the world's second largest fish.  They are regular visitors to our shore.  We all remember amazing footage from the west as they meandered up the coast, providing us with a nice respite at the start of lockdown.  Now, once again, we get to enjoy the fish of the sun gracing our coast during their migratory season.  Recent studies have indicated that Ireland could become home to 10% or 20% of the global population of this species.  Of the eight known coastal surface hotspots in the north-east Atlantic, five are located off the coast of Cork, Kerry, Clare, Mayo and Donegal.  We are truly blessed to have this amazing creature come to our shores every year to call Ireland home.  However, basking sharks are endangered and they are at very high risk of extinction in the wild.  They were first classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species in 2018.  They had previously been classified as vulnerable but they are now endangered.</p>  <p>  In recent years Deputy Whitmore has engaged extensively with many wildlife groups, scientists and experts on the basking shark, including the Irish Basking Shark Group, IBSG, Fair Seas and the Irish Wildlife Trust.  We know there is a huge public appetite for the protection of the basking sharks in Irish waters.  The IBSG's save our shark campaign received more than 12,500 public signatures and scientific support from around the world.  Thanks to its hard-working campaign, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, responded to the call to engage with Deputy Whitmore on a Bill after she first introduced it last year.  I understand they have since met on a number of occasions and that the Minister of State agreed to put in place a statutory instrument on adding the basking shark to the protected species list in Ireland.  We are very grateful for his collaborative approach to Deputy Whitmore's Bill and the efforts taken to protect the species.  I understand a statutory instrument is in the pipeline.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, to use the opportunity today to go into more detail about this, including providing a status update and a timeline for its implementation and further actions that will be required if we are serious about protecting this iconic species.</p>  <p>  We are here exactly 12 months from the time Deputy Whitmore first introduced this Bill and we still do not have the regulation in hand.  This shows how slowly the political system responds to urgent situations, including matters of biodiversity loss.  Even with regulations, however, we will still need to go further.  Just putting the basking shark on the protected list is simply not enough.  Once the regulations come into force, how can we ensure the basking shark will survive in the coming years?  Protection, as defined in current legislation, does not include disturbance or harassment, but it does include wilful injury and interference with or destruction of breeding place.  The proposed Bill will strengthen and broaden section 23 to include an additional or wider set of activities such as disturbance or harassment that can affect protected species.  A legal definition of disturbance and harassment would need to accompany this change.  The practicalities of this change would provide the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, or other authorised persons such as fisheries enforcement officers with the legal backing to enforce the cessation of disturbance or harassment behaviour when exhibited by public or commercial operators.  It would also give authorised officers the power to pursue cases if sufficient evidence was supplied, such as video or witnesses, that an offence had been committed under the section.  This would be a powerful deterrent, as it currently is for other activities such as badger baiting, the trapping of songbirds, robbing eggs from raptor nests and other criminal activities against nature.</p>  <p>  The regulations propose to protect basking sharks from the wilful interference of their breeding and resting places, but not their feeding grounds.  If this is the case, there is room for improvement to ensure the feeding grounds of basking sharks are not interfered with.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, to indicate in his contribution if he will include this in the statutory instrument.</p>  <p>  There also needs to be a legally backed code of conduct on the regulation of wildlife tourism and recreation activities.  I have heard that the regulations, based on Deputy Whitmore's Bill, will include a voluntary code instead of a legally backed code, which would provide authorised officers with the tools to pursue rogue operators in the courts and to enforce best practice.  It would be great if the Minister of State could clarify this, the reasons for only including a voluntary code, and how this will be monitored and enforced if necessary.  There are arguments on both sides as to the efficacy of either voluntary or legally backed codes, but having a legal instrument to support a code gives fallback to officials even if it is rarely used or an alternative voluntary code sits on top of it.  There is no reason both cannot be used as incremental tools.</p>  <p>  This is why we believe action plans should be initiated for every species that is added to the protected list.  This should be an automatic process to escalate the response to protect the species that is clearly in danger.  An action plan would include monitoring, implementation and enforcement procedures that include the expertise and resources of those groups working to protect species, in this case, the Irish Basking Shark Group and the Irish Wildlife Trust.  An action plan could implement a task force specific to the species which could carry out analysis to help enhance population.  This is currently taking place with the curlew, for example.  The curlew has experienced a 96% decline in the breeding population in the past 30 years.  In early 2017, the National Parks and Wildlife Service established a curlew task force.  The task force adopted a collaborative approach to identify the policies and supports necessary to support breeding curlews in Ireland.  A wide range of stakeholder groups contributed and a series of 26 agreed recommendations was published in 2019.</p>  <p>  Good progress has been made in terms of some of the recommendations, but as is the case with challenging conservation issues, further progress could be made in other areas.  To establish how many pairs of curlew remain breeding in Ireland and where they are, the NPWS has completed two national surveys in recent years.  Approximately &euro;10 million in funding has been dedicated to on-the-ground measures for curlews in the past five years alone.  The curlew conservation programme that was established in 2017 by the NPWS operates across nine geographical areas.  These combined efforts have supported overall productivity levels that should sustain a stable population of curlew.  However, in some of the nine areas, productivity levels are still below the critical threshold.  Work by the NPWS and UCD is progressing to support the analysis of satellite tracking data for breeding curlew in Ireland under a masters research project to better understand the landscapes the curlew uses.  It is evident that extensive work is needed even just to stabilise a population already at risk.</p>  <p>  Conservation of a species like the basking shark will require huge amounts of collaboration between the State agencies, stakeholder engagement groups, funding and scientific know-how.  Furthermore, when it comes to the enforcement of existing laws, we are underperforming.  It is welcome that the wildlife crime unit has been established.  However, this is taking time to get off the ground and there are issues relating to capacity.  The dedicated unit within the National Parks and Wildlife Service was first announced in October 2020 and established in 2021.  Almost a year later, it is still not yet fully operational.</p>  <p>  Recent replies to parliamentary questions from Deputy Whitmore state that, currently, 110 staff are working across all regions of the country to address wildlife crime.  These include district conservation officers and conservation rangers, supported by regional managers and divisional managers.  Eight-six conservation rangers are stationed throughout the country, with the intention to increase ranger numbers further up to 120.  The work being carried out by the NPWS resulted in 21 successful prosecutions being closed in 2021, with 15 more being successfully closed to date this year and a further 48 cases on hand at present.  However, it has been brought to our attention that some areas in the country are still waiting for the recruitment of rangers.</p>  <p>  I also want to discuss the importance of marine protected areas, MPAs.  Ireland has a substantive role to play in the long-term recovery of the basking shark species.  This is best achieved via a combination of conservation measures such as domestic legal protection and MPAs.  Recently, the summary of responses to Ireland's MPA consultation showed basking sharks were mentioned more than any other animal as being in need of protection.  Furthermore, in the summary of responses to the MPA consultation, an incredible 99% of respondents supported MPAs and there was also strong support for 30% coverage of the marine protected areas by a 2030 target.  Deputy Whitmore has been working very closely with Fair Seas Ireland on basking sharks.  It supports the call to work towards affording legal protection to basking sharks in Irish waters, as well as the need for a marine protected area designed to protect these animals.  Ireland could provide a broad-scale basking shark awareness marine protection area.</p> <p>It would encompass the entire Irish western and northern seaboard nearshore area, which is less than six nautical miles, with more discreet seasonally activated marine protection areas for the species in sensitive coastal and offshore hotspots.</p> <p> Given Ireland&rsquo;s strategic location in the north Atlantic for this species, this combination of soft and hard marine protection area is necessary to protect and support a population level that is in recovery.  The Irish Basking Shark Group has reiterated this vision for effective basking shark marine protective areas in Irish waters based on three key targets.  The first of these is a broad coastal marine protection area encompassing the entire western seaboard, six nautical miles, off Ireland, from Cork to Donegal.  This marine protection area would principally promote awareness of the species and aim to protect public and commercial behaviours that may intentionally harm or disrupt the species.</p> <p> Second is a network of several discrete surface hotspots where elevated levels of protection will be implemented via dedicated legal regulation and existing environmental legislation.</p> <p> Third, there may be a requirement for further complementary designations at the shelf edge and inshore exclusive economic zone, EEZ, waters if sharks are found to aggregate in large numbers in these environments.  A dynamic and ecosystem-based approach to protect these amazing animals is needed.  The Irish Government must act now and use a variety of different conservation tools that it has at its disposal to ensure success, first by amending the Wildlife Act 1976 to include basking shark on the list of protected species and second through the development of a task force and an action plan to designate appropriate marine protection areas.</p> <p> I thank the Minister of State for joining us.</p></speech>

The Government will not oppose this Bill.  The Deputy&rsquo;s passion and concern for protecting basking sharks is very clear and indeed is shared by the Government.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, shares the Deputy&rsquo;s desire for greater protections.  He and the Department are supportive of measures to support and enhance that.</p>  <p>  The basking shark is the largest fish species in the north Atlantic with some exceptional specimens reaching over 12 m in length having been recorded.  This species has a long historical and cultural connection with Irish coastal communities.  The International Union for Conservation of Nature, IUCN, has classified the basking shark as endangered on their red list of globally threatened species.  The species has also been assessed as endangered on Ireland's own red list of sharks and rays.  The species faces a risk of extinction in the wild and monitoring and management is needed to mitigate against this.</p>  <p>  Records suggest that the coast of Ireland is an important habitat for key stages in the basking shark's life cycle, with sharks typically appearing on the surface along the western Irish seaboard during April.  While typically the sharks disperse from Irish coastal waters during late summer, many individuals also winter in Irish offshore waters.</p>  <p>  Research into the population, distribution and life cycle of the basking sharks is ongoing.  The Irish and EU-funded INTERREG VA SeaMonitor project is currently investigating connectivity within and between populations in the north east Atlantic.  This, in conjunction with several other Irish-based studies, will help Ireland to make informed decisions on the conservation of the species into the future.</p>  <p>  While target fishing and the landing of by-caught basking sharks for sale is subject to a memorandum ban under the Common Fisheries Policy and in wider EEA areas, it is recognised that a number of threats in Irish waters do remain.  These include by-catch threats and entanglement in, for example, crab pot ropes.  Basking sharks can be observed around coastal waters, giving a wonderful natural spectacle to those nearby.  While the increase in interest in wildlife tourism is broadly welcomed, this does bring with it some negative behaviours.  Disturbance and harassment by marine ecotours and other recreational boat users, jet skis and divers also appear to be a growing issue.  These are some of the behaviours that the Bill proposed by the Deputy is seeking to address.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and officials from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage have met with Deputy Whitmore, as referenced, on a number of occasions to discuss the Bill and the proposed development of regulations.  Work is underway to make a regulation under section 23(2)(a) of the Wildlife Act 1976 to confer protected wild animal status on the basking shark.</p>  <p>  Once protected wild animal status is conferred and it would be an offence under section 23(5) to hunt these species, unless under permission or licence granted by the Minister under the Act; to injure these species, unless done while hunting in accordance with a licence or exemption cited above; or wilfully to interfere with or destroy their breeding or resting places.  I am glad to say that work to confer section 23 protections on the basking shark are now at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  In addition, a code of conduct for sustainable marine eco-tourism will be developed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  A review of international best practice is currently underway.  Key stakeholders to assist in drafting the code of conduct are being identified.  The code of conduct will also be subject to public consultation in due course.  A wider review of the Wildlife Act is planned and the applicability and degree of protection afforded to the species listed on the fifth schedule will be included in that review process.  These actions will serve as the first step in providing protection for the species in Irish territorial waters.  The code of conduct will help Ireland to further meet its commitments under international treaties.</p>  <p>  I would like to join with Deputy Gannon in offering my sympathies to Deputy Whitmore and to her family.</p></speech>

I intend to be quite brief.  I listened to the Minister of State's comments and I drafted some notes.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s contribution, but it has taken 12 months to get to this point.  The fact that it is still being said that work is underway does not instil a huge amount of confidence in me.</p>  <p>  I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has on a multitude of occasions highlighted the work that Deputy Whitmore has done.  If you are going to celebrate the work, we need to see the action coming from it.  We are being told today that work is still underway and that is not really good enough.</p>  <p>  Simply having the species on the list will not do anything without an action plan or a mandatory code of conduct, where appropriate.  This is because the very definition of that would ensure greater protection to this species.</p>  <p>  I finish by thanking, on behalf of Deputy Whitmore, the various different NGOs that have helped contribute to the Bill that she has designed.  It is very welcome the Minister of State and the Government will not be opposing the Bill, but it needs action to follow up on it.  This cannot be a Bill that simply sits on a shelf.  The International Day for Biological Diversity will be on 22 May.  We need to be able to show the action behind our will.</p></speech>
