As the Minister is aware, this is a source of grave concern to the farming sector both domestically and across Europe.  The current budget proposals would see a reduction in Pillar 1 payments of 4% and in Pillar 2 payments of 21%.  Every effort and political dedication is required to try to address that and to ensure it does not end up hitting farm income and farmers' pockets domestically.  The onus is on the Minister to deliver that at European level.  I look forward to hearing his update on that today.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200003#A00500"><p>By way of introduction I would point out that in discussing the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, we should bear in mind that this funding forms part of a broader EU budget which is negotiated by Finance Ministers and then agreed by the European Council and European Parliament.</p><p>The European Commission has proposed, as part of the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, 2021-2027, that funding for the CAP should be set at &euro;365 billion.  This would equate to a cut of approximately 5% in the next MFF period of 2021-27. </p><p>This MFF proposal must now be negotiated by Finance Ministers and agreed by European Council and the European Parliament.  The intention of the Commission is to reach overall agreement on the MFF before the European Parliament elections in 2019.</p><p>The MFF is a critical matter for all member states and its agreement requires unanimity at the EU Council.  It is clear there are divergent views among member states on the appropriate level for the budget.  While some are prepared to increase contributions, in particular if there are areas of added European value, there are others who equally feel strongly that the current proposals, such as they are, are too costly.  </p><p>We also have to be aware that in the light of the departure of the UK from the EU, some &euro;12 billion per annum in UK contributions will be removed from the budget.  Against this background, agreeing the MFF will be very challenging. </p><p>Nonetheless, the proposal published by the European Commission is an initial position only.  The final outcome will be determined by negotiations at EU level over the coming period.  Achieving Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in these negotiations will be a key issue for the Government.  I believe that European agriculture policies have delivered for Irish farmers and consumers.  I want to see support under these programmes continued and Ireland will approach these negotiations with this in mind. </p><p>The CAP proposals require more from farmers in terms of environmental standards.  I believe that Irish farmers have already made a significant contribution to the environment and are prepared to do more.  However, the high production and environmental standards required of EU producers must be properly supported by policies that are appropriately configured and properly funded. </p><p>Against this background, I have been working to build consensus among my agriculture colleagues in Europe with regard to maintaining the CAP budget.  Recently in Madrid, I agreed a memorandum with five of my European colleagues seeking that CAP funding for 2021-27 would not be subject to cuts and would remain at the current level for the 27 EU member states.  Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland all signed the memorandum.  Support has grown for this proposal and I understand that up to 20 member states have expressed support for this position. </p><p>I have also sought to continue this work as part of ongoing bilateral meetings.  Since May 2018, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and I have met with the EU Agriculture Ministers from Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Hungary, <i>inter alia</i>to support a strong CAP budget after 2020.  I have also met Ministers from the Netherlands, Estonia, Belgium, Poland, Luxembourg, and Austria, and my officials engage regularly with counterparts in other member states on this issue. </p><p>Ireland needs to work closely with its EU colleagues to build a consensus around the need to reverse the proposed cuts in the CAP.  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to do this and to fight for a strong CAP budget in the upcoming negotiations. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200003#A00600"><p>There is no doubt but that the decision by Britain to leave the EU poses challenges and is regularly given as a reason and rationale for the CAP budget being reduced.  What is not highlighted or made clear is that despite the fact Britain is leaving, the overall MFF will be larger this time than the last time.  The MFF proposals show the overall EU budget going from &euro;1,087 billion to &euro;1,279 billion.  That is an increase of almost &euro;200 million in the overall MFF.  The problem within that is the priority that was given to the CAP programme within that proposed MFF structure, in which the overall CAP allocation has dropped from 38% of the overall budget last time around to 28.5% this time.  That represents a political failure to prioritise agriculture as a crucial part of the European budget to ensure it was not reduced.  It also represents a real failure at domestic level in respect of the impact it will have on farm incomes, as 75% of net farm incomes are based on CAP payments.  It is crucial the Minister works with the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, and the Minister's counterparts across other European countries to ensure we grab back our proportion of the overall European budget, and to ensure we do not continue down this slippery slope, which has been presided over in the last number of CAP programmes, where agriculture and its funding have continually been eroded.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200003#A00700"><p>I would like to reassure the Deputy and the House we share the same objective in the context of securing an adequate budget.  That is challenging because, simply put, it requires unanimity across all member states.</p><p>It is not an option for the Commission to spend money it does not have.  It cannot, under the legal terms under which the European Union is constituted, operate a deficit.  It can only spend moneys that member states agree to contribute.  It is very clear where Ireland stands in that context.  The Taoiseach made that very clear in the context of his address to the European Parliament and it has been reiterated on numerous occasions since then by the Taoiseach, myself and, in particular, by the Minister for Finance.</p> <p> In the context of that budget there are competing demands, and the Deputy is aware of those.  They include security, migration, youth unemployment, etc.  These are all legitimate issues, but what our position has been all along is that they should be funded, but not at the expense of the CAP budget.  The only way to square that circle is for member states to increase their contributions, and we are willing to do so, but the requirement for unanimity makes that difficult.  Even in the context of the CAP, some member states, responding to Commissioner Hogan's most recent proposals, have said that those cuts do not go far enough.</p> <p> Our view is that there are increasing challenges in the CAP.  Farmers need to be adequately compensated for that and we are working with member states, particularly in the context of the Madrid declaration, and are creating the political awareness for the need for an adequate budget for the CAP.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200004#B00200"><p>There are no doubt pressures on the budget.  Myself, Deputy Cahill and a delegation from our party were in Brussels this week meeting with the various stakeholders in regard to agricultural issues and the CAP budget.  There are undoubtedly pressures but let us not detract from or avoid the fact that the scenario, as of today, is a very dire one for Irish agriculture, given that we are going to see the  overall CAP envelope for Ireland reduced by 10.5% from what it was the last time around in terms of the funding that will be coming into this country.  That is going to impact to the tune of almost 4% in Pillar 1 and 21% in Pillar 2.  That is a dire and very concerning vista for farm families across the country, considering how dependent they are on CAP payment income.  As I indicated, it comprises 75% of farm incomes overall.  If one takes the sheep sector and the beef sector, 100% of their net income is from CAP payments.  This move has to be addressed and rebuffed.  I understand that it is not easy but there is a significant onus on the Minister, working with Commissioner Hogan, to try to redress the imbalance and the sliding importance being allocated to CAP under the current proposals.</p>  <p>  Despite the fact the overall budget has increased by &euro;200 billion, we are seeing CAP being reduced and diminished in terms of its priority status.  That, at a political level, has to be a priority and an absolute objective of the Minister, working with the Commissioner, to try to ensure the final deal that is delivered for farmers does not reflect the very concerning one that is on the table at the moment.</p></speech>

I am also doing everything that is possible within the confines of the Council of Agriculture Ministers and availing of every opportunity to build alliances with like-minded member states but it is important to acknowledge that there are other member states which take a position that is entirely at variance with that.  Given the requirement for unanimity, that is a significant challenge.</p>  <p>  This is an issue that is substantially played out in the Council of Finance Ministers and at European Council level but I remain optimistic.  Given what Commissioner Hogan said, these are opening proposals, unpalatable though they are and reflecting for us, in the context of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, more than &euro;90 million in cuts, which is a significant challenge.  We continue to work to try to achieve the best possible outcome.</p></speech>

We face a huge problem with this cut.</p>  <p>  My question is on Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 and the environmental schemes.  Under Pillar 1 and the environmental scheme that is proposed, what percentage of the payment the farmer will receive will be for that Pillar?  What types of schemes does the Minister expect to be able to provide under it?  How will they differ from what we have traditionally had under Pillar 2?  What types of schemes will be there under Pillar 2?  Will it be a continuation of GLAS or will it be something different?  Will it focus more on biodiversity?  Where are we going in regard to all of this?  It is important, as we move towards negotiating the new CAP, that we have clarity around those issues for the farming community.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200004#B00600"><p>The new legislative proposals for the Common Agricultural Policy 2021-2027 were launched on Friday, 1 June 2018 by Commissioner Hogan.  The Commission proposals, as drafted, involve significant changes, including in relation to governance, the distribution of direct payments among farmers and the environmental conditionality attaching to such payments.</p>  <p>  They provide for additional discretion for member states in configuring the new measures available, within parameters laid down in the draft proposals.  The new Commission proposals commit to a more significant environmental ambition than the current CAP schemes, including in Pillar 1, where an eco measure, which would be mandatory for member states, but voluntary for farmers, is provided for.  It is too early to say how such a scheme might be configured.</p>  <p>  The proposals also preserve the basic architecture of the current CAP.  It is clear that they envisage measures that support farmers in areas of natural constraint, those who adopt environmental or climate friendly actions, collaborative actions such as farm partnerships, young farmers taking over holdings for the first time, on farm investments, risk management tools and knowledge exchange and information.</p>  <p>  We are now at the beginning of what will be intensive and challenging negotiations on the final shape of these draft regulations.  I intend to work with the Commission and other member states to shape these proposals into an effective new Common Agricultural Policy.  My Department is still analysing the proposals and their potential implications for the Irish agrifood sector.</p>  <p>  I have always sought to have a broad consultation on these proposals.  Earlier in the year, my Department engaged in a national consultation involving six meetings with stakeholders across the country.  In addition, on 4 July,  I hosted a conference on the new CAP legislative proposals for interested stakeholders, including farm bodies, State agencies and the environmental pillar.  The Deputy, along with other members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, were invited to participate in this conference, and I appreciate the fact the Deputy was there for the full day.  This was a timely opportunity to bring all interested stakeholders together for a constructive discussion on the future CAP.  The range of speakers came from the political sphere, from the European Commission and from my Department.  The conference was a very useful opportunity to hear the views of the many stakeholders involved.</p>  <p>  Over the coming months there will be detailed negotiations at all levels across the European Union as we work together to shape the final outcome.  At the centre of all our considerations will be the need to ensure that CAP post-2020, properly funded, will continue to support farm families and the rural economy.  The current draft proposals must be agreed at European Union Council level.  Whenever the agreed final EU Council position on the CAP proposals is reached, the proposals will then be discussed at trilogues involving the EU Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Agricultural Ministers.   </p>  <p>  These processes must all be worked through and concluded before a final text can be agreed.  I will be working with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that the final CAP regulations can support farm families in the many challenges they face.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200004#B00700"><p>I thank the Minister.  I acknowledge much work has been done and consultation has happened with the various groups and farm organisations.  I would hope that would be a measure to build consensus rather than taking on board all the information and doing what the Department intends to do anyway, which is what people believe happened in the past.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated that there will be more significant eco and environmental measures in the next CAP than there were in previous CAPs.  That is something on which farmers would like to get more information.  While I appreciate it is probably early days as regards the public consultation around this, I am quite sure, given the close relationship the Minister and his Department would have with Commissioner Hogan, that there is some sense of where we are going with this.</p>  <p>  On Pillar 1, what percentage of the payment does the Minister expect will be related to the environmental measures under that pillar?  If it is 20%, 25% or 30%, it will be optional for the farmer but mandatory for the Department to put out there.  If it is going to mandatory for the Department to put out there, and some farmers opt in and some opt out, does that mean farmers will not get that 20%, 25% or 30% of the Pillar 1 payment if they opt out?  Is that the situation?  The danger many farmers around the country would see in that is that one would have the more intensive farmers opting out but the farmers who need the money opting in.</p><p>It would mean that we would have a situation where the environmental actions would all be happening on the lands of natural constraint or in the areas where a poorer income is in place for farmers.  It must be the case that every farmer everywhere plays a role in respect of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200005#C00200"><p>The Deputy has raised a number of the key issues that need to be teased out.  It will be mandatory under the current proposals in the context of Pillar 1 payments that the State will offer an environmental element.  It will not be mandatory for farmers but it will be incumbent on the State to offer that option.  That clearly implies that for those who avail of the option there will be a higher level of payment and, by implication, a lesser payment for those who do not.</p>  <p>  The detail of the schemes themselves and how they might be constituted is something for a later date.  That is why listening to all of the stakeholders is important.  It is abundantly clear that the focus is on enhanced measures that deliver on the sustainability and climate change agenda, and having the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, as one of the toolboxes available to the State to meet our targets in that regard.  That is understandable and in many respects helpful to us, but the devil will be in the detail in terms of how we work out that scheme.  What is clearly being said is that there is not money for nothing in the context of the next CAP in Pillar 1.  It will be a high level of conditionality with an environmental condition being a significant element of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200005#C00300"><p>I understand that.  What I am trying to do is tease out what level of commitment the farmer will have to make in respect of it.  I have often said the farmer is not the only one who produces greenhouse gases, but in effect, land use is one of the few ways we have of segregating those gases so there is an obligation and an opportunity there for the farmer in that respect.  These measures are designed to help that agenda.  I expect the battles the Minister will have in Europe will be around what money goes to the agricultural sector and why it needs to go there.  It is to everyone's benefit that land is used to improve the environment for all.</p>  <p>  Could the Minister give me an idea of what percentage of Pillar 1 will be related to environmental obligations?  Will Pillar 2 be an extension of the green low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, or will it be more onerous than GLAS has been in the past?  Will it be open to more farmers?  One of the issues currently is that many farmers have been unable to get into GLAS.</p>  <p>  Reference was made in the climate change document to biodiversity, bees and the interdependence society has on what nature does to provide for us.  How will that issue be incorporated in the CAP?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200005#C00400"><p>The regulation currently states that member states shall provide support for voluntary schemes for the climate and environment in Pillar 1.

In a year when we wanted serious grass and crop growth the first crops are being used to supplement animals.  The tillage sector has said spring barley will be an absolute disaster, with very low yields and the prospect of very little straw being available.  We cannot sleepwalk into the crisis that will come in the winter of 2018 and the spring of 2019.  We must put measures in place now to try to ensure that we have enough fodder in place both from an animal welfare point of view and an economic perspective to get through the six month winter that faces us.</p></reply>

To learn from the lessons of last winter and to plan for the coming winter I convened a representative group chaired by Teagasc and including stakeholders such as co-ops, banks and farm bodies, among others, to co-ordinate advisory messages to farmers this summer around replenishing stocks that have been used up during the current extraordinarily dry weather.  I have asked the group to provide advice and guidance to manage grazing and to ensure fodder is available to all farmers.  This group will remain in place until I am satisfied that the issue of securing adequate fodder supplies for next winter has been fully addressed.</p>  <p>  The group has met on two occasions and I joined the second meeting of this group by phone link to keep informed of its actions in support of livestock farmers affected by the dry conditions.  The group is scheduled to meet again next week.  On 26 June I launched a national fodder census, to be compiled by Teagasc, through its client network as well as clients of the other fodder group stakeholders, with another census planned for 1 September.  The aim of the census is to monitor and measure the levels of fodder in the country and will inform further actions that may be necessary this autumn.</p>  <p>  Detailed agronomic advice is being regularly co-ordinated and communicated to farmers by the bodies represented on the fodder group, including through our own social media account.  In addition, a dedicated helpline to provide advice to farmers affected by the ongoing drought has been set up by Teagasc.  This is being supplemented by a series of local meetings and clinics where farmers can obtain direct support from Teagasc advisers on the spot.  The helpline will operate daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.  It is important to emphasise that this helpline service and local clinics are open to all farmers, including non-Teagasc clients.  Co-ops and feed compounders represented on the group have increased feed output to meet demand while banking institutions, also represented on the group, have announced a series of initiatives and are working closely with farmer customers on effective financial planning to see them through the current difficult spell.</p></speech>

First, I suggest that the closing date for the spreading of chemical fertiliser be extended by two weeks.  Rain will come at some stage and we must exploit the amount of grass that we can grow when the rain comes.  Tillage farmers will be in a crisis.  They have had a number of years of very low income.  Given the late sowing this spring followed by the weather conditions we have experienced, tillage farmers, especially those with spring barley, will be in a very serious financial situation.  Something must be done urgently to remedy that.</p>  <p>  The other issue the Minister must address as a matter of urgency is the exploitation by meat factories of the situation by dropping prices substantially due to farmers trying to offload stock.  Farmers are being exploited to an unbelievable extent.  Factory prices have dropped significantly in recent weeks without any reason whatsoever.  Confidence in targets for Food Wise 2025 and Food Harvest 2020 are being badly shaken.  The way factories are treating farmers at the moment must be examined.  We need practical action.  Bringing forward payment dates for CAP payments, including for GLAS, would be welcome but we need practical solutions.</p></speech>

Farmers would be well advised to engage with the Teagasc advisory service.  In today's <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>there is a full page advertisement by Teagasc on the various sectors and the appropriate measures for them.</p><p>That headline advice, followed by tailored individual advice through the advisory service - provided by either Teagasc or private consultants who are part of the stakeholder group - is important.  I welcome the fact that the financial institutions are indicating an awareness of the issues.  They are part of the stakeholder group and are tailoring products to meet demand.</p> <p> In the context of processors of primary produce, be it in the dairy or meat sectors, we need solidarity across the industry.  Any evidence of a lack of that in the face of the current challenges would be disappointing.  Many co-ops are meeting to discuss, for example, dairy prices and that should be reflected in the context of the solidarity that is required.</p> <p> One of the issues I am particularly concerned about is that September is generally the month when water supplies and private wells are most adversely impacted upon as a result of a dry period.  We are faced with a situation now where water levels are at an unprecedentedly low level.  Groundwater levels are also low.  Farmers need to be conscious of that and perhaps take the appropriate measures at this point because there is nothing more distressing on a farm, particularly a dairy farm, than a lack of water.  Generally speaking, there is solidarity among people.</p></speech>

They are exploiting the situation.  That is a fact.  The way prices have dropped in the past couple of weeks is completely unwarranted.  We need practical solutions.  I suggested moving the date for the spreading of chemical fertiliser and the Minister did not address that.  We have to extend the grazing season and we have to build up a bank of grass when the rain comes.  Stock will need to be kept out well into the autumn and early winter and we have to get that date extended.  This is a practical step that the Minister can take.  I expect that payment dates will be brought forward as in other years.  However, we are going to head into a serious welfare situation on many farms.  The Minister can talk about extra credit but the money involved has to be paid back.  We are coming out of what was an extremely expensive spring for all farms.  Farmers' finances are in a bad way.  The banks will say to the Minister that they are available to talk but the reality is that they are putting farmers with overdrafts pressure and they are forcing them into situations that are untenable.  The Minister needs to find practical solutions.  Live exports and markets for stock will be hugely important in order that we might try to get the maximum number of cattle out of this country before winter arrives.</p></speech>

The information we have is that while some of the later planted spring barley crop is challenged, it is not by any means a uniform situation.  We also understand that this is a regional issue and that the majority of the crop is not affected at this stage.  All options are on the table.  Matters relating to low-yielding cows, cows with high somatic cell counts, animals that are not in calf and disposing of stock - I appreciate that feeds into the point the Deputy makes about prices - are all individual farm management issues that need to be considered.  Teagasc is disseminating advice on these matters at present.  We will look at all of the issues around prompt, early payments, fertiliser application dates, etc.  We face a significant challenge.</p></speech>

I view the first priority for farmers as the need to protect their livestock and fodder crops, ensure access to fresh water for livestock and, once this dry spell concludes, ensure adequate fodder provision for the winter ahead.</p>  <p>  To plan for the coming winter, I formed a representative group chaired by Teagasc and including, among others, stakeholders such as co-ops, banks, and farming bodies to co-ordinate advisory messages to farmers this summer in the context of replenishing stocks that have been used up and also managing grazing and fodder throughout this extended period of extraordinarily dry weather.</p>  <p>  The group has met on two occasions.

We had this fodder crisis in the spring and I could quote to the Minister what was said then.  He mentioned the idea of a census for food.  There is no food because it has stopped growing.  We all enjoy this hot weather but it is having a huge impact on grass, which is not growing.  Second-cut silage has been cut to feed the animals and root crops such as corn, spring cereals, sugar beet, fodder beet and potatoes are in an awful crisis.  The time for censuses and counting is over.  That is only waffle.  We can see that the fields are barren.  They will hardly get much growth back now.  We need real, cohesive action.  Counting the amount of fodder in September is quite plainly an insult to farmers because they have opened the silage pits and are feeding their animals with what they had saved in the first cut.  If the second cut grew, it is wilting.  I saw them cutting it last week because it was melting away.  They had to bring it in earlier than usual and more of them are cutting grass to feed the cows on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  Counting is an insult to farmers; they need support.  The Minister referred to the banks giving them support.  The banks do not support farmers.  The Minister also mentioned Teagasc.  Teagasc is responsible and has to step up to the plate.  It has advised many young farmers to be way overstocked in terms of their cows.  The next question, which is from Deputy Eamon Ryan, is relevant in this regard.  Teagasc advised farmers to overstock and the banks threw the money at them.  However, the banks are not there now to support them in the way the Minister has outlined.  It is action we need, not counting fodder.  It is an insult for a farmer to count what he or she does not have.  Such an obligation belittles farmers.  They are good, decent people who are suffering stress and mental health problems because of what is happening.  This is an unprecedented crisis.  We need action, not counting as if the Minister was playing bingo.</p></speech>

It is not viable.  The time for counting, studies and focus groups is over.  The banks are not our friends.  Some of the co-ops are great and some of them are not.  As Deputy Cahill and others have said, the meat factories are exploiting this.  It is time for action.  The Minister should give over with the census and the counting because there is nothing to count.  People are counting their anguish.  It is traumatic for farmers to watch this.  We are going to have huge issues maintaining water supplies for them come September because of the prolonged drought.  When the Minister comes back here in September we will be in a real crisis.  That is why I thought there would be some cohesive action.  He did not act during the crisis in spring.  I am thankful that we got through that but this is an unprecedented crisis that is recognised worldwide.  It is insulting to use the language of counting and censuses because there is nothing to count apart from stock that are hungry.  We see crops wilting away and melting.  There will be no supplies at all for the winter following last spring, the failure to grow this summer and this real crisis in growth.</p></speech>

We are overstocked.  We hear every farmer around the country saying that because the physical reality is that we cannot feed our cattle, not to mention the issue of emissions.  We have a 50 million tonne overshoot which we have to deal with by 2030.  The agriculture industry has to play its part in that.  We also have to destock because of water pollution.  It is becoming increasingly clear that we cannot feed our cattle and sheep.  They have increased in numbers.  We have added 1 million cattle and an extra 1.5 million sheep in the past five years and we cannot feed them.  Has the Minister done research on the optimal number?

The recently published Teagasc report, "An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030", highlights the potential for greenhouse gas abatement to limit the emissions from the agriculture, forest and land use sectors over the period 2021 to 2030 and outlines the types of abatement options available.  My officials are actively engaged in reviewing these options.</p>  <p>  A 2013 report by Teagasc concluded that there was an excess of grass to feed livestock under present numbers.  Meeting the increasing demand for grass supply, responding to increases in livestock numbers, will require increased levels of soil fertility and grassland management coupled with increased levels of grass utilisation.  One of the key early findings emerging from the analyses of data captured in PastureBase Ireland indicates that many farms have the potential to increase their grass growth.  If soil fertility and grazing management can be improved, farms are capable of increasing grass production. </p>  <p>  My Department and its agencies, Teagasc and Bord Bia, have a strong focus on improving grassland and nutrient management with measures such as Grass10; nutrient management planning, NMP, online; and the pasture profit index in place.  My Department and its agencies also have a strong focus on improving the efficiency and sustainability of farming and have invested heavily in a number of schemes and measures such as the Origin Green initiative, the beef data and genomics programme and the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, known as GLAS.  Our knowledge transfer programmes are key to bringing the latest innovative sustainability research and practices direct to farmers.  We are also actively promoting the adoption of technologies, for example, the funding of low emission slurry spreading equipment under targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, and research findings, for example, soil fertility and other mitigation actions to promote efficiency and sustainability.</p></speech>

He set out the research, which is clear.  The research projected that there would be a 17% increase in winter rainfall and a 25% decrease in summer rainfall, particularly in the south east and on its coast, because of climate change.  It suggested that would have a potential cost of &euro;2 billion for the agriculture industry.  That would dwarf the &euro;1.5 billion gain expected from Harvest 2020, which led into Food Wise 2025.  That is what is happening.  It is not a surprise and it is not unexpected; it is exactly what the scientists said would occur.  We have to react to it for climate emissions reasons, but also for the sake of farming.  We have been whipping farmers towards every greater numbers, ever more intense practices and ever larger herds and then this summer we find, as various Deputies have said, that the livestock are eating the first crop of silage.  Please God there will be a second crop but at the moment one would not bet on it.  What are they going to do in the autumn and winter?  They are the patsies.  They are the guys and women who are at the sharp end in respect of this processing industry.  The likes of Larry Goodman are not going to have a hard winter, but the guys on the front line who lean on this and who are paying for everything are the ones getting caught out in this squeeze.  We should change plan and change strategy for the sake of Irish farmers.</p></speech>

He should bear in mind that the Paris Accord says we should meet our climate change objectives without compromising food production.  What is the point in dismantling a carbon-efficient system of food production only to replace it with production which is not as carbon-efficient in other countries?  The Deputy needs to be aware of how efficient our production is per unit of output relative to our competitors.  People will source protein one place or another and it is best that they source it from the people who are most efficient.  Even the Paris Accord, to which we ascribe and whose targets we are legally obliged to achieve, recognises that.</p>  <p>  In the context of fodder crises, it is important that we do not talk ourselves into a situation in which the current difficulties we face are used against us in the international marketplace.  In the context of the crisis in spring, which we dealt with, we imported the equivalent of eight hours' feed for a bovine population of 7 million.  We have difficulties but they are not issues of national crisis.  We need to be careful not to talk ourselves into a situation in which we impose unnecessary damage on the sector.  I beg the indulgence of the Chair to continue on this matter.  We are spending huge amounts.  I heard the Deputy talking about hedgerows in this Chamber a couple of nights ago.  We are spending huge amounts - hundreds of millions of euro - under GLAS on planting thousands upon thousands of hectares of new hedgerows, thereby increasing biodiversity and improving water quality.  We are improving the genetic merit of our beef herd by investing more than &euro;250 million in ensuring herd fertility and that cattle are slaughtered earlier so they have a lower carbon footprint.  That will yield a dividend over time.  It is offensive to say that Origin Green is fake news, which I heard the Deputy say at our CAP consultation process.  It was a missed opportunity for him to engage in a more detailed way on the issues when he attended the consultation.  We have things that we can take from the Deputy's copybook.  They are things we are obliged to do anyway.</p></speech>

We have to do this.  It is important that we get the environmental and agricultural interests together.  I believe we are allies, as I said at the conference the Minister held in Newbridge last week.  However, there are certain things we stand by and I stand by John Sweeney when he says the 2.5 million additional animals have introduced to the country since Dr. Stephen Flood wrote his report are creating emissions that will be there for generations.</p><p>It is a question of the quantity released.  Every country will face this issue.  It is not as if we will face a challenge while Brazil, Mexico and so on will not.  They will face a similar challenge.  We must achieve net real reductions.</p> <p> As to solutions, I believe in diversification.  We only imported eight hours' worth of fodder in the most recent crisis but we are importing a large volume of soya and other meal.  Our cattle are not completely grass fed.  According to the statistics, we are significantly dependent on food imports to feed ourselves.  One solution for Irish agriculture is to give people in that sector a much better price for meeting some of our food needs by diversifying our agricultural system as opposed to being overdependent on intensive cattle farming in particular, which is damaging our water supplies and is methane intensive.  Nor can we feed our cattle.  This triple whammy should form part of the argument.</p></speech>

The aim of the census is to monitor and measure the levels of fodder in the country and to inform any further action that may be necessary this autumn.</p>  <p>  To address the weather challenges emerging last autumn, I asked Teagasc, the Agriculture and Food Development Authority, to work locally with affected farmers in areas with fodder difficulties, to support them on fodder budgeting and to identify sources of fodder nationally.  I introduced two measures to support the availability of fodder to affected farmers and I expect payments to eligible farmers under the fodder transport support measure to commence this week.</p>  <p>  To learn from the lessons of last winter and to plan for the coming one, I formed a representative group chaired by Teagasc and including stakeholders such as co-operatives, banks, farm bodies and others to co-ordinate advisory messages to farmers this summer around replenishing stocks that have been used up, as well as to manage grazing and fodder through this extended period of extraordinarily dry weather.  The group has met on two separate occasions.  I joined its second meeting by phone link to keep informed of its actions in support of livestock farmers affected by the dry conditions.  The group is scheduled to meet again next week and to continue its work until the issue of securing adequate fodder supplies for next winter has been fully addressed.  In addition, Teagasc has established a dedicated helpline to provide advice to farmers affected by the ongoing drought.  This is being supplemented by a series of local meetings, where farmers can obtain direct support from Teagasc advisers on the spot.</p>  <p>  Co-operatives and feed compounders represented on the group have increased feed output to meet demand and are engaged in accessing feed ingredients to meet current needs and to ensure adequate supplies of feed for the coming autumn and winter.  Banking institutions are working closely with farmer customers on effective financial planning to see them through the current difficult spell.</p>  <p>  I note the timely publication this morning of a report, entitled "Climate Change and Sustainability in the Agriculture and Food Sectors", by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In it, the committee recommends that readily available measures be put in place to assist farmers and rural communities in responding to the impact of extreme weather events.  I agree that farmers should have access to measures that improve their resilience to these events.  I have asked my officials to examine all available risk management tools to determine which may be most appropriate to the farming sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200008#F02600"><p>I thank the Minister.  I understand that the group is meeting, monitoring the situation and measuring current needs.  For most farmers, the solution will lie on their own farms.  That message must get through.  I have examined many cases.  Many farmers around where I live let their stock out onto 20 acres for nine or ten weeks before taking them back in and moving them to another bit of ground.  If they divided and managed their grassland better, though, they would need less pasturage and could put up to 20% into meadow in order that they might get more fodder for the winter.  However, many farmers do not do that because it has not been their practice.  We must try to make that good practice the norm.</p>  <p>  To this end, the message needs to be sent from the high-level group that meets to discuss the matter to the farmyard.  Perhaps through the knowledge transfer scheme, a particular focus could be placed on grassland management and fodder provision over the coming months.  There is no use in doing it once the crisis hits.  It is now we need to do it if we are to have the work done for the future.</p></speech>

A number of livestock farmers are in that position, where stocking density is not as high as it might be on intensive outputs and there is an opportunity for them not to compromise their current production levels but to have a fodder cash crop that could be availed of by others nationally.  Many such farmers are in low-income sectors anyway.  This type of messaging is what we are trying to send through Teagasc and the co-operatives, but those farmers are unfortunately harder to reach than others.  They are not the ones who are participating in, for example, the knowledge transfer scheme, where such advice would have delivered better grassland management and paddock arrangements were it heeded.  The farmers could even close up portions of their pasturage for a light cut.  At this point, every opportunity must be taken.  We are trying to get this important message out through the stakeholder group.</p>  <p>  There are also opportunities for some farmers who have low stocking densities and, with slightly better grassland management, could have a cash crop on their hands that would enable them to meet their own fodder requirements while also helping others.</p></speech>

It relates to something that Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned earlier or which certainly was mentioned at our meeting in Newbridge.  I am referring to Origin Green and the high level of importation of feed.  We need to reach the point of depending less on imported proteins and using more of the meals and grains produced in Ireland.</p>  <p>  This brings me to a connected point.  We are having a hot summer, which will lead to depleted grain yields in many places.  That will have an impact on concentrates next winter and the options that will be available to farmers.  The main point in this discussion, and one that needs to go out in a message, is that farmers need to take more responsibility for trying to manage their own grassland better to get more fodder from it.</p>  <p>  Regarding the feed that farmers have to buy in, there must be public policy measures to ensure that as much of that feed as possible is grown in Ireland.</p><p>If Origin Green should mean anything, it should mean that not only the food produced in Ireland but the feed and inputs going into that food are Irish.  That will help to ensure nobody can attack the product we produce in Ireland, as has happened in the past.</p></speech>

If my figures are correct, it is currently some 3 million tonnes and I do not believe we will ever be in a situation where we can substitute 100% of that volume of imports.  Nonetheless, I take the Deputy's point.  In the context of the winter ahead and the likely requirement given current feeding patterns, it would be prudent for compounders and co-ops to make arrangements in regard to forward purchasing, which is very important.</p>  <p>  On the tillage side, and on a point alluded to earlier by Deputy Cahill in regard to spring barley, it appears likely that some of that crop will be of very low quality.  Our information is that this will apply to a minority of the crop but there may be opportunities for whole-crop silage rather than proceeding to tillage, where the yield in terms of tonnage of grain and straw would be low, whereas the feed value may be of higher benefit.  I believe that needs to be looked at for the winter ahead, as well as the opportunities in regard to other crops like kale or turnips.</p></speech>

Obviously, we are aware a one-year extension was granted last year in order to supply the maps and to introduce the new review system.  We would appreciate hearing the current position and the timeline from here on.</p></reply>

However, as part of legislative amendments at EU level, a proposal was made to extend the 2018 deadline to 2019 on an optional basis.  This proposal has been approved at EU level, along with a number of other regulatory changes in what is referred to as the &ldquo;omnibus proposal&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  My Department has commenced work on this project and relevant technical experts are currently working on analysing the data in regard to the new biophysical criteria.  In addition to the technical work on the biophysical criteria, the regulation allows for two linked processes designed to enable further targeting of support under the scheme.  These processes are called fine-tuning and the identification of areas of specific constraint.  The three processes are under way in parallel to each other and once complete will provide the basis for the identification of eligible areas in the ANC scheme from 2019 onwards.</p>  <p>  In order to progress this work, my Department is in ongoing communication with the European Commission in regard to the accepted parameters and technical aspects of the project.  Any change to the ANC scheme on foot of this process will require formal agreement with the European Commission via an amendment of Ireland's rural development programme 2014-20. </p></speech>

With regard to the where the Department is at, have the maps been fully completed?  I would have thought they would be complete, given we were originally working towards a deadline of the start of the current year.  From the information the Minister currently has to hand, will he give us an update in regard to the impact the new biophysical criteria are having on those areas that are currently designated?</p>  <p>  There are two key concerns coming from the farming community.  First, those who are currently availing of the ANC payment are very concerned that they would continue to avail of it.  Second, those who have particularly high constraints on their land are keen to ensure there is a proper payment that reflects the type of constraint they have to deal with in their farming.  What options is the Minister considering with regard to the fine-tuning of the specific constraints?  Will the idea of output and productivity of land play any role in regard to designation?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether we are looking for an extension.  I am not at this stage contemplating a further extension.  The obligation is to have this finalised so that, when farmers make their application for the 2019 basic payment scheme, this is all concluded.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made a point about payment for constraint, which is very important.  As he will be aware, rather than taking a scatter-gun approach when we had an additional &euro;25 million to allocate in this year's budget, we made a focused application our priority in order that those who have the most constraint will benefit the most from it.</p></speech>

In addition, will the issue of the productivity and output of land be a factor in regard to whether an area qualifies for ANC payments?</p>  <p>  As part of the Fianna F&aacute;il delegation to Brussels this week, Deputy Cahill and I met with members of the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, which is dealing with the overall ANC criteria, for a discussion in this regard.  We expressed some concerns, for example, where drained land has improved in terms of output and productivity as a result of the effort of farmers, that there would be capacity to ensure farmers are not penalised for the efforts they have put in and will continue to put in.  The other issue discussed was what happens in other countries where, for example, poor land is producing grapes and wine and is productive in that sense.  We certainly got the impression that output and productivity will be a factor and may form part of this process.  Obviously, farmers want clarity.  Is it a factor that will be considered here at domestic level?  Will the Minister clarify whether it is under consideration?</p></speech>

That is not an easy objective but it is my opening position.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about areas with specific constraints.  Areas can be designated as eligible for payment under the scheme on the basis of a combination of biophysical criteria, to which we alluded earlier, meeting certain thresholds where one criterion on its own has not lead to the area being designated as eligible, or of a case being made that eligibility for the scheme is necessary to conserve or improve the environment, maintain the countryside, preserve the tourism potential of the area or protect the coastline.  Those are the kinds of specific constraints that can be invoked to retain or include somebody in the refinement process.</p></speech>

The measures adopted will be informed by stakeholder consultation on the needs of the sector to develop in an economically and environmentally sustainable way, as well as the available budget and structure of the new CAP when it is finalised.</p>  <p>  The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector and provides Irish beef farmers with some &euro;300 million in funding over the current rural development programme period.  This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit within the herd.</p>  <p>  My Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion rural development programme up to 2020.</p><p>In addition to the beef data genomics programme, BDGP, other supports available for suckler farmers under Pillar 2 of the CAP include the green low-carbon agri-environment, GLAS, and areas of natural constraint, ANC, schemes and knowledge transfer groups.  Suckler farmers also benefit from the basic payment scheme and greening payments under Pillar 1 of CAP.</p> <p> I am strongly of the view that the current range of supports available to suckler farmers, together with ensuring access to as many markets as possible for live animals and beef exports, are appropriate supports for the continued development of the sector.  National farm survey data suggests that suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average.</p> <p> I will continue to argue for as strong a CAP budget as possible post 2020.  I am committed to ensuring that suckler farmers continue to receive strong support in the next CAP.  It is of note that the current draft proposals make provision for coupled payments under Pillar 1.  However, as envisaged in the current draft and as was the case in the current round, any coupled payment would require a corresponding decrease in the funding available for the basic payment.</p> <p> My view is that payments should support and encourage suckler farmers to make the best decisions possible to improve the profitability and economic and environmental efficiency of their farming system.</p></reply>

Although our farmers are well known for producing some of the best beef in the world, they continue to depend exclusively on CAP direct payments for their livelihood and have an average income of just under &euro;13,000, according to recent figures provided by Teagasc.</p>  <p>  In recent years, Fianna F&aacute;il has campaigned for a &euro;200 payment policy for the suckler cow herd but Fine Gael has continually turned a blind eye to that proposal.  The Government is underestimating the importance of supporting the national suckler herd and the farmers and rural communities who rely on the sector.  The national suckler cow herd, comprising almost 1 million animals, is a vital component of Ireland&rsquo;s rural economy and a wealth enabler, with every &euro;1 of support provided to suckler farmers generating over &euro;4 of economic activity in rural villages, towns and parishes according to research carried out by University College Dublin, UCD, on behalf of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA.  Suckler farm families underpin annual Irish beef exports worth &euro;2.5 billion.  In light of the threats Brexit and a potential Mercosur deal pose to the income of suckler farmers, the Government must immediately seek European Union recognition of the danger for suckler farmers and request the necessary funding supports.</p>  <p>  The Department underspent by &euro;106 million in 2016 and &euro;78 million in 2017.  That substantial amount of money should be used to support the vital suckler cow industry.</p></speech>

I am unsure whether he is a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine which in its report published today addresses continued support for the BGDP as a measure to support the suckler sector and which, interestingly, in the context of climate change, recommends that I promote all schemes and practices orientated toward the goal of carbon neutrality.  In the context of the cross-party support of the committee for the BGDP, I do not agree with the proposal for a coupled payment for one million suckler cows which would cost &euro;200 million per annum and may drive numbers at the expense of the quality being promoted through BGDP.</p>  <p>  The Department has  overspent rather than underspent under the rural development programme.  Unless the Deputy proposes closing a current scheme, I do not see how the proposed coupled payment of &euro;200 per sucker cow would be funded.  That is the missing chapter in the proposals of the Deputy or others who promote that payment.</p>  <p>  The big challenge we are facing is the juggernaut of climate change.  If we promote numbers at the expense of quality, that will be made more difficult.</p></speech>

It is one thing to discuss the cost of the carbon footprint and so on but how does that argument fit into the proposed importation of beef from Brazil, Argentina or elsewhere to Europe to subsidise what could be produced here?  It is nonsense.  The Minister discussed maintaining a viable farming suckler cow scheme.  If we do not support such scheme, the sector will collapse because farmers are not making enough money to survive.  The Minister knows that, as do I.  We must provide support.  Every &euro;1 of support provided to suckler farmers generates over &euro;4 of economic activity in rural villages, towns and parishes.  That makes economic sense.

If the Deputy's case is entirely predicated on the underspend, it is obvious that the case he is promoting is based on foundations of sand.  I acknowledge and share his view and that of most Members that the suckler cow is the backbone of the beef industry and we must find ways to ensure that those who are most challenged within that sector get more supports.  That is a priority in the context of the next round of CAP.</p>  <p>  The Deputy stated that there should be a coupled payment of &euro;200 per suckler cow, at a total cost of &euro;200 million.  He has not stated how he would square that circle in the context of the overspend on the rural development programme.  His calculations do not add up.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to update the House on progress on that loan scheme and to clarify whether the size of the fund has been established and the percentage of it that will go to farmers.

Food Wise 2025 identifies competitiveness as a key theme and includes a recommendation that stakeholders work to &ldquo;improve access to finance for agriculture, forestry and seafood producers and agrifood companies&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  I launched a new Brexit loan scheme on 28 March in cooperation with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, which will provide up to &euro;300 million of affordable, flexible working capital finance to Irish businesses that are or will be impacted by Brexit.  The scheme will be available to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and mid-cap businesses.  In light of the unique exposure of food businesses to the United Kingdom market, my Department&rsquo;s funding ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to them.  The finance will be easier to access, more competitively priced at a proposed interest rate of 4% and on more favourable terms than current offerings.  This will give businesses impacted upon by Brexit businesses time and space to adapt and grow into the future.  The scheme will remain open until 31 March 2020.  It is modelled on the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme which I made available to farmers in 2017.</p>  <p>  I announced in budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of Brexit response loan schemes for farmers and fishermen and longer-term capital financing for food businesses.  Such schemes are developed and delivered in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and take time to develop and put into operation.  Consideration and discussions are ongoing in that regard and I will announce further details as they become available.</p>  <p>  While continuing to explore additional funding mechanisms, I also liaise with the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector.  All of the banks have specialised products available and expressed a commitment to servicing the future financing needs of the sector.  The delivery of the Brexit loan scheme and last year&rsquo;s agriculture cashflow support loan scheme can act as a catalyst to encourage financial institutions to improve and develop new loan products for the sector.   The milk flex loans developed by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, with dairy co-op and private banking participation, are a good example of innovation in this regard.</p></speech>

We are not far away from the point at which we will be a year on from that with the fund yet to be set up and accessible to farmers.  Can the Minister provide the House with a clear outline as to when the funds will be available to be drawn down and accessed and when the fund will be open for applications?  It has been a failure on the part of the Minister that a measure for which there is a great need has not been made available to farmers and small businesses.</p></speech>

We had a &euro;150 million loan scheme for farmers lending at 2.95%, we had the &euro;300 million loan scheme and we are working on the detail of the next scheme which will make funds available to farmers for investment purposes.  It is a significant start.  There are a lot of moving parts in this.  It is not solely an issue of the Department developing the product.  A number of critical partners are involved, including parties with which we are negotiating at EU level.  Those negotiations are complex and protracted and getting all parties to move on the design of the scheme simultaneously is challenging.  In due course, this will also involve the participation of financial institutions in Ireland to deliver the product.  I have always said it would be the second half of 2018 and I am still working to that deadline.  I would like to have it as early as possible but I do not see it happening in the coming weeks.  However, we are working on the detail.</p></speech>

He will have seen how the SBCI clarified in a response to the IFA that it did not see farmers being able to access the loan scheme until March next year at the earliest.  That is the first half of next year.  We know it is complicated to put a loan scheme together, but it pales in significance to the complexity for businesses of meeting the challenge of Brexit.  Surely, it should not have been beyond the Minister to have got everyone together to ensure this tool, which he announced in this year's budget, would be put in place and made available to farmers.  Brexit will have taken place by the time some farmers are able to access this fund.  Can the Minister clarify whether the report in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>is correct that it will be after March 2019 before farmers can access the fund?</p></speech>

However, as part of legislative amendments at EU level, a proposal was made to extend the 2018 deadline to 2019 on an optional basis.  This proposal has been approved at EU level along with a number of other regulatory changes in what is referred to as the &quot;omnibus proposal&quot;.  My Department has commenced work on this project and relevant technical experts are currently working on analysing the data relating to the new biophysical criteria.  In addition to the technical work on the biophysical criteria, the regulation allows for two linked processes designed to enable further targeting of support under the scheme.  These processes are referred to as fine-tuning and the identification of areas of specific constraint.  These three process are under way in parallel with each other and, once complete, will provide the basis for the identification of eligible areas in the ANC scheme from 2019 onwards.  To progress this work, my Department is in ongoing communication with the EU Commission on the accepted parameters and technical aspects of the project.  Any change to the ANC scheme on foot of this process will require formal agreement with the EU Commission via an amendment of Ireland's rural development programme for 2014 to 2020.</p><p>I am aware of the importance of the ANC scheme, which issues annual payments in excess of &euro;200 million to more than 95,000 farmers.  In light of this, I was happy to confirm earlier this year that an addition &euro;25 million has been allocated to the scheme for 2018.  Following careful consideration of the options for allocating this money, it was decided to target a higher proportion of the money at those farmers in the categories which are deemed to face higher levels of constraint.  This is in keeping with the existing logic of the scheme.  Thus the total allocations for each land category being increased as follows:</p><p><i><font color="#2F2F2F">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</font></i></p><p>A sum of &euro;13 million will be allocated to the mountain type land category; &euro;9 million will be allocated to the more severely handicapped category, and &euro;3 million will be allocated to the less severely handicapped category.  This additional allocation delivers on the commitment in the programme for a partnership Government to increase the funding for the scheme.  The required process to amend the rural development programme in agreement with the EU Commission to take account of this new funding is well under way.</p></speech>

The Minister has clarified that it will now be 2019.  Can he clarify if that is 1 January 2019 or if it means it will be completed in the course of next year?  The important point is to ensure the existing areas are retained.  The Minister mentioned the budget, which was cut to &euro;200 million having originally been &euro;250 million.  I acknowledge that he has increased it to &euro;225 million this year, which is welcome.  While the scheme is beneficial, it contains certain anomalies.  It is an important scheme in my constituency of Laois-Offaly.  The criteria at the moment are socio-economic but there are quirks in that which have caused problems.  For example, a townland south of Ballacolla around Woodenbridge is surrounded by a mini-version of the Golden Vale, with which the Minister will be familiar, but there is a pocket of farms in the middle of that on wet land due to the presence of a number of rivers, including the Goul and the Erkina, which flood every year for a number of months.  I ask the Minister to look at parts of that.  Clonterry on the Laois-Offaly border and Garryhinch along the Barrow are other areas which need to be included.  This is a crucial scheme.  The new criteria consider soil, rainfall, mountainous land and stony land, which is welcome because it will be more scientific than the old townland basis for inclusion.  While 60% of a townland may be prosperous, the rest may not be but it will have been left out of the scheme to date.</p></speech>

The January deadline is not the critical one.  The requirement is to conclude this before farmers make their online applications for 2019.  I note the Deputy's point about the budget.  We allocated an additional &euro;25 million in this year's budget and I appreciate that there is still a shortfall to make up for the cuts to ANC payments imposed by the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  Any consideration in that regard is subject to budgetary negotiations.  I note also the Deputy's points about specific parts of his own constituency.  I visited one of the higher profile demonstration farms in the constituency recently and was surprised to find it was in a disadvantaged area.  I appreciate that there are anomalies within the current system and opportunities to address them in the context of the process which is under way.</p></speech>

I hope he will seek to add the &euro;25 million which was cut from the scheme a number of years ago.  It is a good payment because it goes directly to the farmer who has discretion as to how to use it to improve and maintain his or her holding and business.  I am glad to hear the Minister will examine areas such as Clonterry, Garryhinch and the areas south of Ballacolla to iron out some of the anomalies and improve the scheme.  I hope that happens.  It appears from what the Minister said that the change will be made at the point when farmers are putting in their applications later in the year.</p></speech>

For example, &euro;13 million will be allocated to the mountain type category, &euro;9 million to the more severely handicapped category and &euro;3 million to the less severely handicapped category.  That has been welcomed by farm organisations and it is recognised that it is targeting the resources available.  Should additional resources become available, it is my intention that template will be replicated.  I want to be clear on the deadline.  It is for the 2019 basic payment.  That is when this has to be clarified so that when people are submitting their applications the Department will have details of their holding.</p></speech>

A number of members of staff are retiring during the recess.  I wish them health and happiness and thank them for their service.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle, and the acting chairmen, for their infinite patience which is tested everyday.  I wish colleagues a productive recess and hope they all take a little holiday during the recess, and particularly for the benefit of our colleagues - who may not be with us at the moment - in the Press Gallery.</p>  <p>   Back to real business and the housing and homelessness crisis is continuing apace.  There are 6,000 adults and more than 3,500 children in emergency accommodation.  Those figures is not changing.  The cost of rent has never been as high, despite the introduction of rent pressure zones, RPZs.  We all know the problems and challenges this causes people daily.  It is having a particular impact on the provision of student accommodation.  The Government today published a report outlining what it calls "progress" in providing student accommodation.  The report states there are 18,600 bed spaces in various forms of planning and that by the end of this year 5,500 of those will be completed.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, described that as a healthy pipeline of student projects.  </p>  <p>  Once again, the Government is patting itself on the back while wilfully ignorant of the reality on the ground.  Much of this accommodation is being built privately and rented out at exorbitant rates.  Many people are having to make a choice between cancelling their place in college, turning it down or leaving college, because they cannot afford accommodation.  Ms S&iacute;ona Cahill, the president of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, said today that international students are being targeted by colleges, which see them, to use her phrase, as "cash cows".   For students who come from middle or modest class backgrounds, those rents of &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,400 a month are exorbitant and out of reach.  That is the average going rate for student accommodation.  </p>  <p>  Families cannot afford that.  That is not affordable for a working person, never mind a student.  On the northside of Dublin city, students are faced with a 30% increase in rental costs for next year.  We are all aware of the case of Shanowen in Santry where students will be hit with a 50% increase in rent, which follows a 30% increase last year.  The same is happening in C&uacute;irt na Coirbe in the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, and throughout the country.  The Government can act and take measures now which do not need all of us to be sitting.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in have provided a Bill and a pathway for the Government to take those measures and reduce the accommodation and rental burden on students and their families.  </p>  <p>  Why does Government not introduce amendments to the RPZs?  Why does the Government not ensure student accommodation, such as Shanowen and C&uacute;irt na Coirbe, is deemed under licence so that the tenants within them are treated in the same way as regular tenants and leases?  What is the Government's plan to deal with the crisis facing student renters?</p></speech>

This has been a busy political period and politics will continue through the summer months.  It is important though that people take time off with their families to recharge mentally and physically from the pressures of this job.  I also thank everybody working in and linked to this House, and in particular those who are retiring.  The relationship between the Members and those who work here is a good one and that needs to be recognised before we break for the summer.  I expect we will have a particularly busy term when we come back, so recharging is in the country's interest as well as our own.</p>  <p>  On the serious issue of student accommodation, as the Deputy mentioned, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, and the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Damien English, released the end of quarter two progress report on the national student accommodation strategy.  That strategy complements the initiatives being taken by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to increase housing supply under Rebuilding Ireland.  The national student accommodation strategy includes eight key targets and 27 actions to support the delivery of increased levels of supply, which is the key problem.  The target set out in that strategy is the provision of 7,000 bed spaces by the end of next year and a total of 21,000 additional purpose built bed spaces by 2024.  We remain on track to achieve, if not exceed, that number.</p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the pressures many students face, particularly in trying to find accommodation in Dublin.  Some existing student accommodation does come under RPZ legislation but much of the purpose-built student accommodation does not.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and his Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, have made it clear they are looking at ways we can ensure students are not being ripped off.  At the same, however, we need to ensure supply increases because, ultimately, a dramatic increase in the supply of student accommodation provision is what will address this issue in the medium term.  We are focusing on supply increases and it is working.  As of the end of quarter two of 2018, 2,990 purpose-built bed spaces have been completed, more than 7,000 were under construction, more than 7,000 more had planning permission granted and in excess of 1,200 were at a planning application stage.  We are seeing Ireland move from dramatic under provision of purpose-built student accommodation to catching up rapidly.  That is taking place and the figures show it.  </p></speech>

It is still happening.  The same is going to happen with student housing.  The T&aacute;naiste is promising everything but in September and October, students and their families will be faced with a bill every month of &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,500.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2018 was promised this session but it has not been introduced.  He can utter all the words he wants, all the promises he wants, lay out all the action plans he wants and issue all the self-congratulatory reports he wants but come September and October, what will he say to students, their parents and their families who will be faced with paying &euro;1,400 every month for student accommodation?</p><p>There is no sense in telling people to turn down a place at a university or third level institution or to turn down the opportunity of education because an apartment will be available for them next year.  Next year may be too late for them.  The T&aacute;naiste could take action now to recognise the urgency of the situation and to say to those providing student accommodation that students are not cash cows.  The places the T&aacute;naiste has mentioned are being provided by private operators at exorbitant, profitable rates.  They are making profits on the backs of Irish students while the Governments stands back and talks about it.</p></speech>

This was confirmed by the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions yesterday when he said it is not possible to claim for retrospective expenses.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  The T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues in government are well aware that the impact of the cervical check scandal stretches much further back in time than the 11 May cut-off point imposed.  The imposition of a cut-off date means that no account is being taken of the costs incurred by those at the centre of this scandal.  They have been incurring costs for many, many years.  Victims and their families, who incurred considerable medical and other expenses, including loss of earnings, prior to 11 May might have to wait for a final settlement in order to be compensated for these costs.  That means that victims and their families are forced down the legal route, potentially into the courts, in order to recoup expenses incurred.  Any fair minded person will say that is simply unacceptable.  It represents shocking treatment by this State of people it has already failed.  It is not right and the cut-off point should be scrapped.</p>  <p>  Mr. Stephen Teap said yesterday that the cut-off date is unacceptable to the 18 bereaved families still paying off expenses, as well as coming to terms with their battles with cancer.  Other victims are in a similar situation.  I know the T&aacute;naiste has previously met Mr. Teap and that he has acknowledged previously that it was the contribution of that man, in seeking support, that influenced the way in which the package was shaped and support was provided for individuals and their families.  The T&aacute;naiste also told the D&aacute;il on 17 May that no victim should be treated in a way that adds any further to the trauma that he or she has witnessed.  I understand that a meeting of the steering committee is taking place today.  That committee is comprised of officials from the Department of Health and the HSE, and has been established to oversee a range of concerns that have arisen as a result of this scandal.  It strikes me that it might be appropriate to deal with this major issue at the meeting of the steering committee.</p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste agree that the arbitrary cut-off date of 11 May is cold, clinical, callous and unacceptable?  Will he commit to ensuring that it is scrapped and that the families can be adequately compensated for the expenses they have incurred without having to go through the legal process.</p></speech>

I listened to Mr. Stephen Teap on the radio this morning and I understand the points he has made.  I also spoke to the Department of Health this morning on this issue.  There is no definitive cut-off date here.  The scandal effectively broke on 11 May.  The Government response and services offered can be dated from then.  Since then, each victim of this scandal has a dedicated liaison person who is talking to him or her.  There have been many meetings between the liaison people and the families and victims affected by this.  We are now trying to establish the detail of the kind of costs incurred pre-11 May so that the Government can respond appropriately.  The truth is that many people and many families have different stories to tell here.  Some have detailed records in terms of costs incurred and some do not have any records at all.  However, they all have stories that must be listened to.  We are acting through the Department of Health and the HSE.  A political decision will have to be made as to how we respond to pre-11 May costs incurred by families who are victims of the cervical checks scandal, and how that is appropriately addressed.  Do we acknowledge the costs via an <i>ex gratia</i>payment?  Do we meet only those costs that are linked to paper work?  We have to decide how to act.  We are in the process of deciding on that currently.  One of the discussions I expect to happen at the steering group today is on that very particular issue.  I know that Mr. Teap will make a very strong case because he is a very strong individual and he is correct to make such a case because he represents many families who are relying on him.  I assure the Deputy that the Government and the Department want to respond in a way that is generous and appropriate and which does not add to the trauma that people already have had to live through, particularly since 11 May.  There is no strict arbitrary cut-off point.  We are making an effort to try to understand the complexity of the situation.  We are talking to all victims and getting an understanding of the kinds of costs incurred and are considering how the State can reflect that in the supports it will put in place, which will be tailor-made for individual families and victims.</p></speech>

The case of Ms Vicky Phelan came into the public domain on 25 April.  That date has been plucked out of the air.  Yesterday the Taoiseach responded to Mary Lou McDonald and told us that 11 May is the date from which claims can be submitted.  Claims before that, we were told, cannot be dealt with because they are retrospective.  They would have to be dealt with through the court process or the mediation process.  We are now getting a different message.  Stephen Teap said this morning that he was shocked when he heard what the Taoiseach said.  He has made his claim, I understand, for the expenses incurred on behalf of his wife and his family.  Victims want to have certainty.  The T&aacute;naiste said he wanted to be generous and appropriate, but a cold, clinical and callous approach is being taken here.</p></speech>

I am telling the T&aacute;naiste what I believe.  I am also saying that, as Stephen Teap said, it is unacceptable to the 18 bereaved families.  We need certainty here.  Those families who have incurred costs and who have already been failed by the State, need a clear statement that the date of 11 May no longer applies.  They need to be told that they can submit their claims for expenses and that those expenses will be paid by the State.  A different message was given to the victims of this scandal by the Taoiseach.</p><p>I am trying to give the Deputy an update on the position but more importantly, I am trying to give a clear message to those outside of this House who are listening closely because they and their families have been affected by the CervicalCheck scandal.</p> <p> There is nothing cold or callous about the Government's approach.  We are looking to try to support families and individuals in a generous and supportive way.  That is why we have put case officers in place to try to provide the supports that are needed in a personal way, on the basis of individual cases.  I have of course heard Stephen's story.  It is a very tragic one for him and for his family and there are many others like that.  However, we have to ensure that we propose a way of responding to expenses that were incurred prior to May of this year in a way that can apply to everybody, not just to those who have the paperwork necessary to make a claim and so on.  What is needed here is a detailed discussion between the HSE, the Department of Health and Stephen Teap and others who represent the families involved on the steering group, in order that we can put an appropriate support package in place to deal with expenses that have incurred both in recent months and before that as well. </p></speech>

I am going to try to bring a little of the spirit of those picket lines to this D&aacute;il exchange.  In October 2016, Michael O'Leary attended a fundraiser breakfast in the Shelbourne Hotel where he made an attack on trade unionists, making reference, for example, to RT&Eacute; as a "rat-infested North Korean union shop".  Little did Michael realise at the time that within a year, his own company would be turned into a union shop.  Is it not ironic that he made reference to a dictatorship, when the precise reason he is in trouble today is his attempt to run his own company as a dictatorship?  There is no master seniority list for pilots in order that they might know in advance in what country they were going to live and for how long or in order that they might be able to organise their holidays.  There is rule by fear; refusal to recognise unions and then when forced to, refusal to engage seriously.  There is low pay in the era of crazy rents and bogus self-employment on a massive scale, facilitated by successive Irish Governments including the one in which the T&aacute;naiste sits.</p>  <p>  They say that workers cannot stand up to multinational corporations.  Well they can, and Ryanair workers are showing precisely how.  Cabin crews now plan to strike in Italy, Portugal, Spain and Belgium and are joining the union here as well.  International workers' organisation and action can beat the multinationals.  Karl Marx was right: "Workers of all countries, unite!  You have nothing to lose but your chains."</p>  <p>  Another dictatorship, LloydsPharmacy, made nearly &pound;500 million in profit in the UK alone in the last two years.  Does it recognise unions here for its workforce, more than 90% of which is female?  No.  Does it exploit these women with zero-hour contracts?  It does indeed.  Does it operate a proper sick pay scheme?  It does in my neck.  Can the T&aacute;naiste imagine that?  A pharmacy that does not allow its workers a sick pay scheme.  We have seen a one-sided civil war in many workplaces in recent years.  In these two workplaces however, workers are fighting back.  I hope their example inspires others to do the same.  Capitalism, and right-wing Governments like the T&aacute;naiste's that serve its agenda, go hand in hand with low pay, the gender pay gap, zero-hour contracts and attacks on unions.  This race to the bottom should have no place in Irish society.  Can the T&aacute;naiste agree that this race to the bottom should have no place in Irish society, and that workers who fight back against it have right and justice very much on their side? </p></speech>

What is happening here is a dispute between Ryanair and some of its pilots.  Our concern is that this dispute is resolved quickly and the travelling public is not discommoded in a significant way.  As such, it is regrettable that the dispute was not solved yesterday when the two parties and their representatives engaged with each other.  Our perspective on this as a Government is that we want to encourage both sides to find a resolution as quickly as possible.  A lot of people rely on Ryanair to travel, for business, holidays and other needs.  We want to see the travelling public respected by both sides by being informed in time if flights are going to be cancelled, which by and large has happened to date.  We do not want to see a further escalation that discommodes the travelling public.  What we want to see is a fair dispute resolution that is fair to workers and that can be agreed to by a company that is providing a hugely important service to the travelling public.  The same goes for the LloydsPharmacy dispute.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's description of an Ireland of very low pay under some kind of negative capitalist system does not reflect reality.  Pay has actually increased by 2.5% on average over the past 12 months.  We are now down to an unemployment rate of just over 5%. </p></speech>

Who facilitated Ryanair's bogus self-employment practices?  Who stood back while workers in Ryanair uniforms flew Ryanair planes, yet were officially declared to be self-employed?  Who allowed Ryanair to save a fortune in taxes and to cheat their workers on sick pay, holiday pay and pensions?  The Government did - the same Fine Gaelers who hosted that breakfast for Mr. O'Leary in the Shelbourne and who laughed and cheered him as he attacked unions.  I believe the T&aacute;naiste was there himself.  He might remember it.  The weather has been fairly good of late but the class struggle is hotting up now.

It is a company that has recently recognised trade unions and is now in a dispute and in negotiation with trade union representatives, as many large companies sometimes are, thankfully not that regularly.  As a Government, we want to see this dispute resolved quickly.  We certainly do not want to see the kind of approach the Deputy is recommending, which is to turn a dispute into some kind of class warfare and which reflects the kind of politics he brings to this House.</p></speech>

Indeed, I thank all the Oireachtas Members from all sides and all the people around the country who work and strive to keep Ireland ticking over, from the highest-paid executive to the people on the community employment schemes.</p><p>They all deserve credit for the great work they do.  Of the men and women who get up in the morning, 99% of them do so with the notion of doing well for everyone.</p> <p> Yesterday I assisted into the audiovisual room people from all over the country who wanted to highlight the need for tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, and medicinal cannabis to be made available to them to improve their lot and assist them in counteracting the medical conditions they have.  They included Noreen O'Neill from Kilgarvan, whose people's farm is separated from mine by the Roughty river and who has a little boy, Michael, who will be two in August, as well as Rosemary Clough, whose son, Gerard Darlington, is in a wheelchair.  I asked him how he was and he told me he was not good.  Also there were Deirdre Coughlan and her son Stephen O'Mahony and Caroline O'Sullivan and others.</p> <p> I thank all of the Members and their secretaries who attended the presentation on behalf of men, women and children who asked for the availability of THC and medicinal cannabis to minimise pain and increase their chance to live a normal life.  The Minister for Health has stated licences can be granted to allow for prescriptions to be given out but consultants and doctors are reluctant to sign applications to apply for this licence.  Only seven have been granted up to now.  It is clear that doctors and consultants have a difficulty in applying for the licence because they do not have the backing of the HSE and they are not indemnified by the HSE.  They are afraid of liability being attached to them.</p> <p> I ask for the Government to deal with this.  We are all going on holidays and Noreen O'Neill is terribly afraid her little boy will not survive.  She drives to Bantry for THC and pays &euro;180 for a bottle that lasts for 12 days.  She pays for it out of her carer's allowance.  Other countries have dealt with this and legalised it.  Why are we lagging behind?  It has been going on here for a year and a half or almost two years.  Some people have it but it is not available and we need it.</p></speech>

I also thank Opposition Parties in particular who have worked with the Government to bring through a really busy legislative schedule.  The House has been able to do things many people felt we would not be able to do in the context of a minority Government situation.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il in particular for its constructive co-operation.  We do not always agree, in fact we disagree a lot, but we have worked in a professional manner to get a lot of important legislation through.</p>  <p>  This is an important issue and Deputy Gino Kenny has raised it with me also.  The position as it is at present is that in order for a cannabis-based medicinal product to come into the country it needs to come in under licence.  The Minister of Health has not refused any application that has come from consultants on behalf of their patients to import medicinal cannabis or THC.  A total of 13 licences have been issued for the treatment of seven individuals.  This will continue.</p>  <p>  Separately to the ministerial licence scheme, on foot of the Health Products Regulatory Authority report, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, the Minister announced his intention to establish a medicinal cannabis access programme to facilitate access to cannabis-based products that are not authorised as medicines but are of a standardised quality and meet an acceptable level of quality assurance.  What people are asking for and campaigning for, and what some are looking for legislation on, is to be able to bring medicinal cannabis into Ireland without a formal licensing system on which the Minister needs to sign off.  The Minister and the Oireachtas committee were concerned about Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill and the committee recommended it should not proceed.  As the House subsequently voted that would not be the case, this is an ongoing discussion.  The primary issue has to be about the healthcare of patients and the people who are best placed to make those decisions, in terms of the importation of products, are doctors and consultants and not politicians.  That remains the position of the Government.</p></speech>

I agree with him that consultants and doctors have the knowledge but they are prevented from signing the applications because it looks like they are not indemnified by the HSE and that liability will fall to them.  Time is not on the side of many of these patients.  I am asking the Government to do something, by statutory instrument or whatever, to allow the consultants and doctors to sign the applications.  Doctors prescribe medicine.  They will not prescribe an item that remains a Schedule 1 banned substance.  It needs to be rescheduled to Schedule 4, in order that doctors would be prescribing a designated medicine.  The time and effort required to make a single application, let alone a consultant having to apply for multiple patients, is logistically impossible.  In the interim, the Government can bring in all the laws and legislation it wants but it should do something and sign some statutory instrument to allow this medicinal cannabis to be obtained.  I am not looking for cannabis for any reason other than medicinal purposes to be administrated through our chemists and doctors.</p></speech>

An expert reference group has been established by the Minister for Health and it is drawing up clinical guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the access programme.  The guidelines will be published shortly on the Department of Health's website, which will be helpful.  There are certain products that are clearly medicines and there are other products that may have a medicinal purpose and may be cannabis-based.  They are the products the access programme will address.  The key issue is that for many children or families looking for better healthcare treatment and who think they can get better results from medicinal cannabis products, there is an avenue through the recommendation of a consultant or a doctor to be able to import those products to Ireland and get it done reasonably quickly.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is committed to this but he wants to make sure, as I said earlier, that key decisions on healthcare provision and support are being made by doctors and not politicians.</p></speech>

Clearly the Government has utterly failed on this.  In my constituency, Letterkenny University Hospital has experienced some of the highest levels of hospital overcrowding anywhere in the State.  Last year, 4,889 patients were lying on trolleys or chairs in the hospital's accident and emergency department.  That is an average of 19 patients per day every day of 2017.</p><p>What is worse is that within metres of the trolleys on which people lie while many are in pain is a ward that is lying empty.  It has 19 beds and could accommodate every person who was on a trolley last year in Letterkenny University Hospital.  The management of that hospital requested the HSE to open the ward, along with &euro;1.8 million to employ the staff.  The hospital indicates it will not find it a challenge to recruit those staff.</p> <p> Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure the necessary resources are available to bring to an end the scandalous position where thousands of people are on hospital trolleys day in and day out and ensure the short-stay ward in Letterkenny can be opened?</p></speech>

Some progress has been made in the area and there are now 13% fewer people on trolleys than was the case this time last year.  Although there are still too many on trolleys, there are significantly fewer than in 2016.  We are now spending more on healthcare in general than we have ever spent and we have a very significant capital investment programme that was outlined in our ten-year capital strategy for health provision, particularly with respect to hospital infrastructure.  We will see improvements over time with more investment and better management.</p></speech>

Its tremendous success was a great credit to the management, staff and members of Ballyliffin Golf Club, as well as Donegal County Council for its advance preparations.  It was also a credit to the many members of the local community in towns and villages who put such an effort into preparing the Inishowen Peninsula for it.  The Garda also ensured it went so smoothly.  The event showcased Inishowen and Donegal to an audience of up to 500 million people internationally as a tourist product.  Will the Government ensure, in working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the type of investment required to ensure that tourism in Donegal can be built on and that the success of the Irish Open can be used to create a legacy in terms of employment and additional economic investment for years to come?</p></speech>

The weather clearly helped but Donegal looked fantastic during that sporting showcase.  This indicates that by moving big events like this around the country to locations that have much to deliver in tourism, we can use events like the Irish Open to really promote counties like Donegal very successfully.  Next year the competition is moving to Lahinch and I am sure it will be a similar success in Clare.  It was at Fota Island in Cork a number of years ago and it was also a success.  I congratulate everybody involved and we will look to build on it next year.</p></speech>

I also understand there are many potential candidates deeply exercised about the timeframe they have to be nominated.  The D&aacute;il is due to return on 18 September.  Has the Government given any thought to making an order for polling day under the Presidential Elections Act 1993 and an order for the day of close of nominations?  Under section 8 of the same Act, in the event of the D&aacute;il being dissolved after the presidential election order is signed, it is possible to combine both dates.</p></speech>

I was trying to and I got approximately two thirds of the way through.  I do not have a final date that has been signed off by the Government for the presidential election.

It will be towards the end of October, I suspect, but I do not yet have an exact date as it has not been finalised by the Government.</p></speech>

This week Britain's National Health Service, NHS, put a pause on the issuing of the vaginal mesh.  This is a very personal subject for women suffering from urinary incontinence and pelvic organ collapse but it is causing major harm to hundreds of women in this country as it is used on a daily basis.  I will quickly quote Professor Carl Heneghan, of Oxford University&rsquo;s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, who states:</p><blockquote>Many women have been subjected to great harm because regulatory loopholes allowed mesh devices to be made available in large numbers with no evidence in humans.  ... We now know women who received mesh implants have been part of a global experiment that in many cases has gone badly wrong.</blockquote><p>Other Deputies and I personally know of women who are bound to wheelchairs or are going around on crutches because of this practice.  There is no scanning mechanism for these women in this country.  They are paying huge money to get treatment in Britain, where it costs &euro;1,500 for an operation to remove some of the mesh.  This is a complete failure and the mesh has not been tested on humans.  I call on the Government to do what the NHS has done and put a pause on the use of this mesh as soon as possible.</p></speech>

What happened in England has moved things forward, as the NHS is suspending use of this device for urinary incontinence.  It is extremely important we now do the same.  The women have said, as recently as Wednesday this week when I spoke with them, that it is too late for many of them but we may be in a position to prevent further suffering.</p></speech>

It would be a better approach and it is the approach recommended by the Citizens' Assembly.  The T&aacute;naiste is also aware that a Government request to waive the pre-legislative scrutiny of this proposed legislation was refused by the Business Committee this morning.  In light of that, will the Government rethink its approach to this referendum?  Will it consider listening to what we have been saying for some time and allow this opportunity for that public debate, which we all think could be helpful?</p></speech>

The legal advice to the Government is very clear and the recommendation is to simply remove language from the Constitution.  If we are going to go through a process of trying to put new language into the Constitution reflecting the importance of caring, the home and so on to replace that wording, it would certainly take some time.  The Government is proposing to follow the legal advice we have while starting a conversation around the kinds of concerns outlined by the Deputy and others, including how we could deal with that in legislation.  We would not be able to do what we would like to do in October if we must try to find a way to get right new language in the Constitution reflecting the really important role of caring in the home.</p><p>Instead, what we want to focus on is taking something that is inappropriate in terms of language out of the Constitution and keeping that clean and simple.</p></speech>

In the interim, this issue has remained on the front pages of newspapers and in headlines across the globe.  There are examples in others countries where this is a real problem.  We can do take action in respect of this matter in a way that will create a good news story.  It could show standards and precedent in terms of how transparency in online advertising can work well.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that Fianna F&aacute;il has indicated its willingness to support the motion I put forward last weekend.  Similarly, I am pleased that Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party have agreed to support motion.  I am sure it will attract widespread agreement from others in the House.  Has the Government been able to consider that suggestion?  Will the Government join the call from the rest the House for Facebook and Google to provide such analysis as best they can?  By using UCD and the Transparent Referendum Initiative, they could provide it in a safe way that gives us the full story.</p></speech>

It was established earlier in the year and is being led by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The group includes representatives from the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Justice and Equality, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Education and Skills and Defence,  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  We have already an active conversation at quite a high level in government.  The group is expected to report shortly.  It would certainly be helpful if other activity were taking place.  In the case mentioned by the Deputy, such activity is being led by UCD.  It would be helpful if Facebook and Google were to co-operate with studies of this sort.  They are really about informing policymakers in future in order that we might make appropriate decisions.  I would certainly encourage large social media platform companies to supply as much information as they can in order that we might make informed decisions in future.</p></speech>

As a result of these reports, it is crystal clear that the Mercosur countries are failing to meet EU standards on fundamental issues of food safety and traceability.  There is no real prospect of the EU being able to impose these standards in respect of South American beef.  The Government needs to be strong on this to protect the consumer and the producer.  In the interests of food safety, will Ireland take steps to ensure that South American beef is excluded from the Mercosur trade deal?</p></speech>

I want to focus on one sector, namely, that relating to specialised training of dogs for children with severe autism.  That sector is completely devoid of funding.  There is not even a waiting list for families to get on at the moment to try to get a dog for a child who has severe autism.  It is a sector for which funding should be provided.  These dogs are a major help for those children who have severe autism.  It represents a severe slight on us that we have not even got a waiting list for people to get on.</p></speech>

Many people are making decisions on care for their loved ones and then they have to go through the process of getting the applications approved.

I speak from the experience of my town in Newbridge, which has not had a credit union for several years.  Vulnerable people seeking small loans have had to turn to moneylenders, with disastrous financial consequences.  My understanding is that a commitment was made to set up a task force.  Several pilot schemes were carried out involving credit unions, including Portarlington Credit Union, with great success.</p>  <p>  There is a thriving licensed moneylending scheme in this country.  People are being charged up to 189%.  This is completely wrong.  As far as I understand, Ireland is the only country in Europe that allows this.</p><p>We must adopt a policy that prohibits very high interest rates by implementing a restriction on the overall cost of credit.

It can sometimes be difficult to look after everyone.</p>  <p>  On 1 April 2018, the HSE introduced new regulations bypassing Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, for all trauma patients.  While I understand that there is a new national trauma plan, which is the work of the HSE and the Department of Health, to get the best support for patients, it is creating huge difficulties.  It was brought in very quietly and unknown to many people.</p>  <p>  It is not possible for people from Roscommon and parts of east Galway to get to UCHG or now to Tullamore within the golden hour which is so important for patients.  It takes more than an hour to get to UCHG from most parts of County Roscommon.</p>  <p>  We lost a good emergency department in Roscommon when it was closed down by the last Government.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200018#Q01700"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004 and the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 to make provision whereby parents can share their entitlement to maternity leave and to provide for related matters.</blockquote><p>In Ireland mothers are entitled to 26 weeks of paid maternity leave and then a further 16 weeks with no pay.  In the last two years, fathers are entitled to just two weeks.  They can only take up some of the mother's entitlement if she dies.  This Bill will allow both parents of a child to share this 26 week period of paid maternity leave between them.  This also applies to adoptive parents and to same-sex parents.</p><p>This will not create any additional cost to the Exchequer insofar as it simply allows parents to share paid maternity leave that is already in existence and will not affect the two shared weeks of maternity leave that already exist.</p><p>This will be of significant benefit to families.  First, employers of parents have vastly different arrangements in whether and how they support parents beyond the statutory minimum of 26 paid weeks maternity leave and the State support of &euro;240 per week.  In some cases it may be financially beneficial for the second parent to take the leave.  Similarly some jobs may lend themselves better to taking periods of leave.  For instance, people who are self-employed may find it more difficult to take that maternity leave.  Second, facilitating fathers in taking leave facilitates greater involvement by both parents in their children's lives which is of great importance to fathers, mothers and to families.  Research in 2015 found that fathers were just as likely as mothers to say that parenting was extremely important to their own identity.  The same research found that 48% of fathers felt that they were not doing enough caring.  This Bill will facilitate greater equality insofar as it allows both parents to share rearing responsibilities.</p><p>I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.269" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200018#Q02500"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 and the Road Traffic Act 1961 to make provision for the regulation, by the National Transport Authority, of rickshaws in cities, counties and municipal districts and to provide for related matters.</blockquote><p>I am introducing this Bill to address a lacuna in our legislation.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has failed to commence on an amendment that was passed by this House in December 2017.  The Minister has repeatedly promised to introduce regulations but he has failed to do so.  He has failed to keep many of his promises.  He is all talk and no action.  Rickshaws operate in most European cities in a regulated environment.  They can, and do, play a positive role in transporting passengers short distances in an environmentally efficient manner.  Unfortunately, there have been many reports of illegal activity like drug-dealing being facilitated by rickshaw operators.  We can thank RT&Eacute;'s "Prime Time" for uncovering and exposing many of these practices.</p> <p> None of the drivers is vetted; there is no registering or licensing of vehicles; there is no test of the roadworthiness of vehicles; there is no regulation of the fares they charge; and there are no set standards for services.  For all of these reasons, as legislators we can no longer sit on our hands.  Currently, no agency or public body has the authority to regulate rickshaws.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, which regulates small public services vehicles like taxis and hackneys, cannot regulate rickshaws because existing legislation defines a "public service vehicle" as "a mechanically propelled vehicle".  Similarly, Dublin City Council and the other councils do not believe they have the authority to regulate or license rickshaws because they are not always pedal-powered vehicles.  This presents considerable issues as we seek to ensure the rickshaw industry operates fairly and with integrity.</p> <p> The Bill seeks to give the NTA statutory powers to bring about regulations in respect of rickshaws.  It proposes to create a new category of public service vehicle, to be known as the "public service rickshaw", which will cover all rickshaws, including mechanically powered rickshaws, manual rickshaws, cycle rickshaws and battery-powered rickshaws.  This will clear up the current legal lacuna.  The legislation will make the NTA the authorised body for regulating rickshaws throughout the country.  This amending Bill will also oblige the NTA to make certain regulations in respect of rickshaws.  For example, they will have to be licensed, drivers will have to go through a vetting process involving background checks, vehicles will have to be inspected for roadworthiness, fares will have to be regulated and a standard set of services will have to be adhered to.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I am grateful to all Opposition parties and colleagues who ensured this Bill passed the critical Second Stage and engaged seriously and consistently on it throughout the process, leading to today.</p><p>I also acknowledge and welcome the constructive recent engagement by the Government, the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund that has enabled this Bill to proceed with what we hope will be cross-party support today.</p><p>I will briefly outline the provisions contained in the amendment, how they evolved and my understanding of their intent and application if that is agreeable.</p> <p> The first provision is new as compared with the original text of the Bill.  It sets out an obligation on the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, to include reporting on measures taken in implementing the Act through annual reporting by the ISIF to the Minister for Finance.</p> <p> The proposed new section 49A(1) contains all of the definitions.  Key changes in this section relative to the Bill as originally published are that there is now a definition of "fossil fuel" whereas the original text referred simply to "geological deposits".</p> <p> The scope of activities used to define a fossil fuel company in the text - now referred to as an "undertaking" for consistency with the Companies Act - under the Bill have been narrowed from the original Bill text which read, "a company whose business either wholly or partly engages in exploration, extraction, refining, processing or delivery".  It is now narrowed to the definition "exploration, extraction or refinement".  I accepted this narrowing to address concerns raised by a number of parties about avoiding potential unintended consequences, for example, for SMEs, of a very broad definition.  The definition also now provides further precision by setting a numeric threshold for the amount of revenue derived from fossil fuel exploration, extraction or refinement necessary for an undertaking to be defined as a fossil fuel undertaking.  This was requested by the ISIF for legal certainty.  I would like to note that the 20% revenue threshold for a fossil fuel company in the text is welcomed as being at the progressive end of current investment or divestment practice.</p> <p> In agreeing to legislate for divestment, the Oireachtas is seeking to ensure that the ISIF will be at the cutting edge of low-carbon investment in the long term.  In ten or even five years' time, it could well be - we hope this will be the case - that the 20% threshold will be significantly unambitious following anticipated shifts in international practice.  It would be important, therefore, that the ISIF, in the spirit of this Bill, proactively acts in its investment strategy in the years to come to invest under progressively lower thresholds in order to remain at the progressive end of international investment policy and practice.</p> <p> The definitions section includes a definition of "indirect investment".  I have made significant efforts to find consensus with the Department and the ISIF to ensure that indirect investments are included in the Bill while acknowledging the need to ensure that the ISIF retains the ability to use certain indirect investment products in the short term in order to manage risk.  In the dialogue with the Department and the ISIF, I sought means within the legislation to ensure that while certain products will be exempt in order to allow the ISIF to have the certainty of flexibility to allow it to manage risk, it will be obliged to ensure, as far as is practicable, that, when availing of them, these products, where they exist and are appropriate, are fossil fuel-free and as low-carbon as possible where they do not.  It was argued that explicit legal certainty on the ability to avail of these instruments was needed.  In good faith, I have accepted the exclusion of these indirect investment products.  I would like to state on the record, therefore, my expectation that, in equal good faith, notwithstanding this definition, the ISIF will seek to avoid or limit as far as possible and as far as is practicable exposure to fossil fuel investments through these products.</p> <p> The word "company" has been replaced throughout the text with the term "undertaking" for consistency with the Companies Act 2014 and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.</p> <p> In the proposed new subsection (2), the divestment provisions for direct and indirect investments are separated out in the amended text.  In the text of the Bill as drafted, they are dealt with by means of the same provision.  As drafted, the text obliges the ISIF to divest as soon as practicable without incurring contractual penalty.  Our understanding is that this will take place within five years at most, but most likely earlier than that.</p> <p> For indirect investments, in the proposed new subsection (3), a specific numeric threshold for acceptable exposure through indirect investments was requested, recognising that ensuring zero exposure at all times is difficult.  I was cognisant of the need to address this issue but I was not satisfied with the 15% figure put forward.  As fossil fuels typically represent approximately 6% to 7% of funds, exposure higher than this percentage means that a fund is overweight in the context of fossil fuels.  Thus, the Bill could be used to allow the ISIF to be overweight in fossil fuels as compared with international averages through its indirect investments.  I have been assured that the 15% threshold is intended as a limit rather than a goal.  However, it would be important once again that the ISIF operates under the spirit of the Bill and endeavours to be 100% fossil fuel investment free, with zero or as close to zero exposure as possible.  Furthermore, in light of concerns raised, it was accepted to include provision for a statutory instrument to allow the Minister to review this threshold downwards in time, as appropriate.</p> <p> The transition provision in subsection (4) of the amendment is new.  The aim of this new provision is to ensure that the ISIF can invest domestically in activities required for Ireland&rsquo;s transition where these are essential to phasing out fossil fuels.  This was formulated in response to concerns raised on Second Stage and during pre-legislative scrutiny.  For this reason, the provision requires that the ISIF be satisfied in advance of a decision that the proposed investment is in line with the national transition objective, Ireland&rsquo;s climate change targets and national climate policy as it evolves.</p> <p> Finally, the proposed new subsection (6) obliges the ISIF if investing using the transition flexibility set out in the proposed new subsection (4) to explicitly and publicly acknowledge at time of announcing the investment decision that this has been possible only as a result of the transition flexibility provision in the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act.</p> <p> As with any legislation at this stage in the process, compromises have been made but I am satisfied that this amendment represents a solid outcome that will see Ireland make a significant contribution to the global fossil fuel divestment movement.  The movement is highlighting the need to stop investing in the expansion of a global industry which must be brought into managed decline if the limits to warming set out in the Paris Agreement are to be delivered and catastrophic climate change averted.</p></speech>

In domestic terms, the Bill places a significantly increased onus on the ISIF, other State bodies and, importantly, the Oireachtas to seek to achieve significantly higher levels of due diligence, transparency and accountability in the energy policy and investment decisions that will be taken in the coming years.  These are decisions that will determine whether the battle relating to the Paris Agreement goals will be won or lost.</p></speech>

Five years ago when Ireland held the EU Presidency, I attended a conference organised by the Mary Robinson Foundation in association with Irish Aid and the World Food Programme entitled "Hunger, Nutrition and Climate Justice".  It was an innovative conference because as well as bringing key leaders into the conference, more importantly it brought the people who are living in those front-line communities directly affected by climate change and the hunger, poverty and displacement that comes from that.  That relationship was very apparent.  Delegates from approximately 100 developing countries spoke at that conference.  They were farmers, pastoralists and those from fishing communities who outlined what it is like to live with droughts, floods and unpredictable rainfall and how these affect agriculture and food security.  There were stories from all over the world about the impact of climate change on people trying to make a living.</p>  <p>  We know that the burdens of climate change are not distributed proportionately.  Those least responsible are paying the most.  This is causing starvation and malnutrition, which, in turn, affects people&rsquo;s health and their ability to access education and to work - things we take for granted here.  The central message was that hunger, nutrition and climate justice are development challenges that need to be tackled together.</p>  <p>  In all likelihood, this Bill would never have got as far as it has today without new politics in Ireland.  I do not believe that previous D&aacute;ileanna in which there were Government majorities would have entertained the Bill.  However, the new politics has meant that there has been engagement on the Bill and that people have worked through the issues, compromised and built consensus in the context of considering amendments.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work done by Deputy Pringle, who, with the assistance of Tr&oacute;caire, has been the driving force behind the Bill.  I also acknowledge the input of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  There were considerable negotiations and some dilutions, but the principle is the same, namely, that there has to be pressure to keep fossils in the ground.  Unless there is pressure to change, nothing will change.</p>  <p>  Ireland has to move away from making excuses, including with regard to our carbon footprint.  As I have stated previously, the position in this regard is highly ironic, particularly as Ireland played such a dominant role in negotiating and securing agreement on the sustainable development goals.  There is a specific goal relating to climate change which relates to taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.  Climate change has to be tackled before any of the other goals can be realised.  They came into effect in January 2016 and I would have to ask where the progress is.  We will see how Ireland fares in the first voluntary national report.</p><p>The thrust of the Bill reminds me of one of the ways used to tackle drug dealing in Dublin central.  As the late Tony Gregory said, we should follow the money and hit people in their pockets, which led to the setting up of CAB.  Rather than empty rhetoric about targets, this Bill is going after the money and focusing on the money by preventing the NTMA, through its management of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, from investing in fossil fuel companies.  The ISIF, as a result of the Bill, will have to start that divestment process.  The message the Bill is sending in Ireland, Europe and also further in the world is positive because there is a lot of interest in the Bill.  It is an important step.  It is essential, as NGOs such as Tr&oacute;caire and many others tell us, so that the temperature limits agreed by Governments in the Paris agreement remain viable.  The Bill is also an important step in signalling Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to policy coherence.  Irish Aid funds and supports and empowers communities overseas to deal with climate change but we also have to do our part in Ireland.  The central point is that public money should not be invested in areas that are not in the public interest.  It is not in the public interest for fossil fuels to be developed and supported.  They need to be kept in the ground.  We have all seen the extent of the correspondence on this which is a strong testament to the extensive interest in the Bill and its significance.</p> <p> Another positive thing within the Bill is the definition of fossil fuel, which is comprehensive.  Doing this today makes us stand out as a national Parliament.  It is making an example.  It will mean real progress.  It also means we have to make real progress on the renewables.</p> <p> The phasing out of fossil fuels has to be expedited, including the need to keep them in the ground.  Ireland can do more - "do" is the key word - rather than talk about it because we have to uphold the principles of the Paris Agreement.  The negotiations, the discussion and consensus that went on between the Department, Deputy Pringle and Tr&oacute;caire on the Bill are a great testament that we are serious.  I hope this is just the first in a number of other steps that show we are very serious about tackling climate change.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the fact so many Deputies want to speak on this.  I welcome the Bill and commend Deputy Pringle on bringing it forward.  He put a lot of energy and commitment into it over a long period of time.  I know there has been a lot of engagement.  He has engaged with all political parties and none across the House on it.  The outcome is very important legislation.  It is a short and symbolic Bill.  Not only is it symbolic, it is significant.  It is substantial legislation because it sends a very clear message out on climate change and climate justice.  It prevents the fund from investing in fossil fuels in future.  It ensures current investments will be divested over a period of time.  It comes at a time when we know climate change is very important and that we in Ireland are not doing enough on it.  The EPA recently indicated that by 2020 we will have achieved a reduction of 1% in emissions rather than the 20% target we agreed to under the EU agreement.  A recent EU report places Ireland almost last on climate action performance.</p>  <p>  About 10 million Ethiopians are now in need of food aid as a result of the lack of rain.  I visited Ethiopia when my daughter was there doing voluntary work three or four years ago.  It is happening not only in Ethiopia but right across the continent.</p>  <p>  With those few words, I confirm my support for the Bill and the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200024#Z00400"><p>I congratulate Deputy Pringle and welcome the Bill very warmly.  That is probably a bit of a pun in this context but it is a hugely warmly welcomed Bill.  The rationale is to send a clear signal that the phasing out of fossil fuels must be speeded up.  Keeping fossil fuels in the ground is absolutely key.  At this stage there is hardly anybody, apart from Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and Donald Trump, who denies the science on climate change.  I am hearing here that everyone else accepts the absolute science on climate change.  Even the Taoiseach has said it is the greatest challenge facing humanity currently.  If it is the greatest challenge facing humanity, this is the first step in taking that challenge head-on.</p>  <p>  The other thing that is significant about it is the Taoiseach, the same man, has also said that Ireland is a laggard when it comes to dealing with our fossil fuel emissions, our CO2  emissions and our targets under the Paris Agreement.  That is also true.  If we are a laggard, we can now potentially become a leader.  In the few minutes I have, I will ask the Government and the Taoiseach to be absolutely consistent and committed to this agenda because it should be at the heart of the work of every Department and for that we need joined-up thinking.  That means that when a Bill is being considered, for example, the Heritage Bill that was passed the other night, it should be climate change proofed.  I do not think that happened with that Bill.  It was a disaster that the Bill passed.  When we are looking at transport measures, they have to be climate change proofed.  That means a huge investment in public transport and restoring the subvention to public transport not to in full but beyond that to the levels it was at in 2009.  It means really aiming to take cars and trucks off the road.  It would be a massive contribution to dealing with our emissions.  The other obvious thing, which the Government is making some attempt to do but it is not quick enough and it is not sufficient, is to retrofit every home and building in the country so we have no need to burn as much gas and oil as we do to stay warm in the extreme cold of winter or to use other forms of electricity to keep cool in the extreme heat we are experiencing in the summer.</p>  <p>  They are agendas on which we need joined-up thinking throughout Government, Cabinet and every Department and I appeal to the Government and the Taoiseach to change their minds about the approach to the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018, which I have put before the House.  The purpose of that Bill is to try to end the extraction of all fossil fuels at sea and to challenge the oil and gas industry by telling it to leave it in the ground and that there is no need for us to take any more fossil fuels from the ground.  I am not saying to turn off the lights tomorrow but let us take a serious, consistent, deliberate and decisive step in transitioning from our over-dependence on fossil fuels.  We are like addicts.  We are told it is dangerous and it is killing us but we will not give it up.  If we continue to do that we will be on the cusp of losing an opportunity.  Nature does not lie to us.  Physics does not lie to us.  We have to listen to nature and the science and begin to act deliberately and decisively.  I appeal to the Government in the next term to reconsider its position on the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill I have put before the D&aacute;il.  The fossil fuel industry is very powerful.  The oil and gas industry has done a lot of lobbying and has a lot of influence.  We need to challenge it and say enough is enough.  We can use up what has already been extracted as we transition to full renewable energy but it should not take another drop of oil or gas out of our shores.  It would also contribute to what Deputy Pringle has started, which is to put Ireland, along with other countries such as New Zealand, Costa Rica, France and Belize, in a movement that is beginning to wake up, smell the coffee and deal with climate change decisively and immediately.  We do not get a second bite of the cherry.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Pringle for all the work he has done.</p></speech>

Party leaders had an interesting meeting with the Taoiseach recently talking about good and bad legislation and I made the point that the good legislation is coming from this side of the House.  Deputy Lawless has introduced legislation on digital transparency, Sinn F&eacute;in has introduced legislation on the islands, there were emotional scenes in the Seanad last night because Deputy Sherlock, with my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, put forward legislation on microbeads.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said she was fearful that her Bill may not get through.  I say to her be not afraid because Deputy Dooley recognises that what we want to do on the west coast of this country is get investment into the alternative, cleaner future and not into oil and gas.  We do not need that.  It will not benefit our people.  We have to make a decision on where we put our money.  There is a clear majority in this House for putting our money in the clean, green alternative future.  In fairness to the Minister and to Fine Gael, they recognise in this Bill that this makes sense and that is why I am speaking for the amendment.  This is why it is a very good, powerful day because there is unanimity across this House on this issue.</p>  <p>  When we unite we are strong.  We have been strong on the Brexit negotiations because we have been together on it.  We did the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution well because while there was not total unanimity it was handled in a proper democratic way.  I am in favour of this amendment because it does say that politics can work in a better way in this country and it says very clearly that we have to divest.  We have to start playing our part.  That starts, as the great Bill McKibben says, for the environmental movement, in not always putting the onus on the individual but sometimes on the State and the lawmakers who by their laws make it easier for us to do the right thing.  That is what Deputy Pringle's Bill does.  I commend him and Tr&oacute;caire and everyone else who has been campaigning for this.  It is a proud, historic and happy day and this D&aacute;il actually is doing some good stuff.  We should keep at it and we serve our people well when we do.</p></speech>

The amendment reflects the very good debate we had on Committee Stage where we tried to tease out the key issues to make sure the Bill is workable.  It is not just symbolic, or gesture politics, it has real meaning and will make a difference, albeit a modest one, but it is an important step nonetheless.  The changes to the definitions are pragmatic, for example of what a fossil fuel undertaking is, what it is engaged in by way of "exploration for or extraction or refinement of a fossil fuel where such activity accounts for 20 percent or more of the turnover of that undertaking".  That is one issue we went through in some detail on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  Indirect investment is a critically important part of this debate.  That is dealt with in the amendment by setting a threshold of 15% to measure it, which is important too.  The key point for its implementation is that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, the Department and the Government need to embrace this because there is discretion left to ISIF on the application of this, that it "shall endeavour to ensure that the assets of the Fund are not directly invested in a fossil fuel undertaking" and where it has investments as we know it does it "shall divest the assets of the Fund from such investment as soon as practicable".  We need an assurance that ISIF will live up to the spirit of the legislation.  That can be interpreted one way or another but we all know what the driving force and intention are behind this legislation.  It is important that ISIF deals with that and embraces it fully because there is also provision under subsection (4) to make investment in fossil fuel undertakings if it is satisfied that it is consistent with several grounds, including "(a) the achievement of the national transition objective, (b) the implementation of the State's climate change obligations" and so on.  There is discretion for ISIF.  We need to know that this legislation will be embraced fully.  The State needs to lead on this issue and while the impact of this Bill is modest it does make an important statement about the direction in which we wish to see policy going in the country, that is to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, to invest in low carbon footprint technology, to invest in renewable technology and renewable energy.  To be fair to ISIF, it has invested in companies that focus on renewable energy.</p>  <p>  I warmly thank and congratulate Deputy Pringle on a fine piece of work.  He has shown great patience in taking the Bill through the various stages.  I know a great deal of work went on behind the scenes with the Minister and the Department to reach agreement on the substance of the amendment which has been put forward today.  The role of Tr&oacute;caire has been instrumental and in particular I acknowledge the work of Cliona Sharkey and Selina Donnelly.  I thank Deputy Dooley, our spokesperson, who led the debate within our party and who strongly advocated from the very beginning that we adopt a supportive role on this legislation.  I thank Deputy Pringle and all concerned.  We hope that this is a seminal moment in respect of the State's attitude to this challenge for this and future generations.  We are not living up to our responsibility and we know what the consequences are of not doing so.  We have an opportunity to play a leadership role as a small, independent country.  This is an example, in respect of this policy and the legislation, which has been spearheaded by Deputy Pringle, of how we can demonstrate that leadership.  We will continue to play our role on this side of the House and in this party.  I hope this legislation will pass and be enacted.</p></speech>

Even in this era of new politics not many Private Member's Bills get to Report and Final Stages.  This is one of the few I have seen reach those Stages.  I also acknowledge the work of Tr&oacute;caire and the Stop Climate Chaos coalition and other non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and organisations that have been very involved in advocating for this and bringing it forward.  Many of them are in the Public Gallery today and they are welcome.  As Deputy Ryan said, it is great to see a full Gallery for our debate.</p>  <p>  The Bill sends an important signal to the markets and to industry that Ireland is beginning to get serious about climate change.  As well as being the morally right thing to do there is also a very strong emerging economic argument for this.  If we embrace renewables a green energy revolution and an economic revolution, as well as an energy and environmental revolution, can take place, creating thousands of new jobs in the energy sector, renewable energy and supporting technologies.  There is massive opportunity there.  From a financial point of view it makes sense because more and more we see the phenomenon of stranded assets.  The risk profile of fossil fuel funds is slightly different from what it might once have been.  The World Bank recently announced that from 2019 on it will refuse to finance any further fossil fuel development projects, which is highly significant.  It creates the possibility of stranded assets where people have invested and the shareholding becomes less valuable over time.  As well as the moral and environmental imperatives there is a significant economic and financial argument.</p>  <p>  It is an important Bill but it is only one step.  It is very commendable but much more is needed.  Professor John Sweeney of Maynooth University gave a presentation at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communication, Climate Action and the Environment last week.  One of the statistics he quoted from his research is that Ireland ranks 27th out of the 28 EU countries for progress on climate change.  That is second last, very far from where we ought or need to be.  We are only second behind Poland, which has a history of coal plants and fossil fuel.</p><p>Many other measures are needed.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has a Bill, the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018, colloquially known as the "keep it in the ground" Bill, which we support.  Many other steps are also needed.  As Deputy Eamon Ryan said, many of these measures are coming from the Opposition but what is really needed is a seismic shift in Government policy.  It is the Government that has the driving wheel and it needs to move us in a different direction.  From my experience on the Committee on Climate Action and here in the Chamber, there appears to be an approach from the Government sometimes of managing the fines rather than managing the problem.  I asked the Taoiseach last year, on the Order of Business, what provision was being made for the fines that would inevitably accrue from failing to meet our 2020 targets.  </p> <p> The Taoiseach's rather glib response was to say that it would be dealt with next year because it was not a budget provision for this year.  The time has come and it is now.  We must get real and the Government must get serious about climate change.  I do not think there are many remaining climate change sceptics at this stage, either in this House or anywhere else.  The proof is before our own eyes.  We had the biggest snowfall for 50 years in February and March and now we have the greatest heatwave for 50 years.  The proof has been in the pudding, even for the last three months, and we are seeing it before our very eyes.  I doubt many people are left that are sceptical.  The proof is there, the need is there, this is a fantastic Bill and we are delighted to support it.  Many other measures are needed and Government action is needed as well.</p></speech>

I thought it would right from the very outset because of the commitment of Deputy Pringle.  He is owed a great debt of gratitude for the way he introduced this Bill and worked so hard on Committee Stage and with the Department to try to reach a conclusion that works.  That is most important and my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, has already spoken on that aspect of the Bill.  I want to be associated as well with the positive remarks regarding Ms Cliona Sharkey and Ms Selina Donnelly.  They are two of the best advocates acting on behalf the environment in their work with this House.  They are here regularly, always have a good story to tell and back up their assertions with facts and figures.</p>  <p>  That makes our work much easier in attempting to convince colleagues, as it might be on occasion, and ensuring we are doing the right thing.  Tr&oacute;caire stands out but there are numerous other organisations represented here today as well that do fantastic work.  I am singling out Tr&oacute;caire because of the work it does and the attention it pays to the elected Members.  We regularly get critical comments from others in what is often a very direct way.  Tr&oacute;caire does it with a little bit more of the carrot than the stick.  It is proven that its work is well worth it.  At the end of the day, as my colleague Deputy Michael McGrath has also said, this Bill is relatively modest in what it sets out to do but seismic in respect of the shift taking place in this House.  </p>  <p>  It has succeeded, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said earlier, in bringing together people from different and disparate political backgrounds around a particular agenda and showing, notwithstanding our various different backgrounds, ideas, views and visions, that we can come together on the big issues and find an appropriate solution.  This just a start.  I also compliment Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith who also has a Bill on Committee Stage regarding leaving fossil fuels in the ground.  Fianna F&aacute;il has supported, and will continue to support, that Bill.  It will need more refinement and work but that is what the committee process is all about.  </p>  <p>  It is moving the agenda towards ensuring that at long last, we seek to address the climate change we all accept is happening.  There are alternatives and it does not have to be a big negative on our economy.  The green agenda and the green economy present an opportunity to provide employment.  We must recognise there is a resource already blowing off the west and east coasts and it is about harnessing that resource and generating clean energy from it.  We have much more to do to address the targets we are, unfortunately, going to miss for 2020 and, I suspect, for 2030 unless we make significant changes to the way we do our business.  That is now a feature of the work of the Joint Committee on Climate Action and I hope that over the next number of months we will be able to bring forward policy decisions to inform the Government about achieving the targets we have set out.  </p>  <p>  I thank all those involved in making this a success.  I hope that it is just the beginning of a detailed commitment from those of us who are elected and have the burden of responsibility to protect the environment.  I hope we will work assiduously over the coming months and years to bring forward legislation to move us away from our dependence on fossil fuels, to look at harnessing clean energy and to reconfigure the way we live our lives to provide respect for the environment in order that we hand on to future generations that which was provided to us in such a careful way.</p></speech>

We know climate change is having a severe impact on the most vulnerable of people in the world and today, Ireland will take the landmark step of becoming the first country to divest public money away from fossil fuels.  That is quite an achievement and I am proud to be part of this debate today.</p>  <p>   The United Nations has described the humanitarian crisis in east Africa as the worst in that region since the Second World War.  Last summer, 25 million people faced starvation due to severe drought.  That ended in April 2018 and was replaced by devastating floods.  We know the impact that climate change is having right across the world as well as in this country.  This divestment Bill is a great opportunity to put Ireland on the right path towards tackling this issue and supporting the most vulnerable people worldwide.</p>  <p>  The people doing the least to cause climate change are suffering the most, while those with the most power to address it have, so far, utterly failed to do so.  People in Africa feel let down by the damage being done by richer countries and are crying out to us for help, not only through providing aid and resources but also by changing the way we live and reducing our carbon emissions.  Climate change is a global issue and requires a global response.  I hope that from today, with this divestment Bill, that other countries will start taking up the issue and will bring in their own divestment Bills.  Divestment will be an incredibly important moment for climate justice and many eyes in east Africa, and worldwide, will be on Ireland today to see the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill pass through the D&aacute;il.  </p>  <p>  This Bill is the culmination of more than two years work by Deputy Pringle, his team and Tr&oacute;caire.  It seeks to drop coal, oil and gas investment from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  It means Ireland will be leading the way by being the first country in the world to do so.  The industry contributing the most to the climate crisis will now be tackled.  Deputy Thomas Pringle has been like a dog with a bone but he also has been flexible enough to be able to work through the whole divestment Bill to make it possible.  I say well done to him and this Bill will have a major impact here and worldwide.  </p></speech>

It is an important day and I thank Deputy Pringle, Tr&oacute;caire, the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition and many of the people in the Public Gallery who we have met over recent years on this important issue.  I hope this Bill will fulfil its aim, that it is strong enough and the wording is sound enough - I think it is - to ensure investment in fossil fuels by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund ends.</p>  <p>  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund does not have a large exposure at present to fossil fuels but some investments, such as in Dublin Waste To Energy, are not sustainable.  That will need to be looked at in future and the policy addressed.   </p><p>The intention of the Bill is positive and is a clear statement by the State of the direction in which we want to move.  I am glad to see that there is a level of political consensus for it here in the Chamber.</p> <p> When we talk about moving away from fossil fuels and reducing emissions, we must also talk about the alternatives.  There is no morality involved in simply stopping investment in fossil fuel while we continue investing large amounts of money in coal to generate electricity.  Where is that fuel coming from?  What type of companies is it coming from?  There is a carbon footprint incurred in hauling such fuel across thousands of miles.  We must also consider the conditions endured by the workers who extract that fuel in places such as Colombia.  It is important that we do not congratulate ourselves for doing the right thing on our little green sod.  We need to look at the overall picture.</p> <p> This Bill will pass today and we will have a conversation about climate change.  Everyone believes in climate change, except for one or two people from Kilgarvan and one or two in the White House.  The whole conversation must be followed up with action.  We should not see this as a negative thing but rather as an opportunity.  The smart investment and money will now move towards new, sustainable industries that will create sustainable jobs and generate sustainable power for Ireland, and hopefully much of Europe and the world.  The State must build on the diverse energy sources available to Ireland in order to keep the lights on.  We need to stay on track with this.  We have been negligent, as myself and others have highlighted over the last seven or eight years.  This is not a burden.  We need to grab the opportunity it presents.  Ireland has access to many forms of energy, including hydro, bio-mass and bio-gas, on which I brought forward a policy document.  Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward a document on all-Ireland energy, which was passed at a recent Ard-Fheis.  We have access to solar power, which must be used.  We must also focus on offshore wind and onshore wind, as well as wave and tidal energy.  Those sources of power must be developed.</p> <p> There is a real issue in terms of the electrification of public transport and private motor cars.  The network of charging points has to be dealt with.  Currently ESB provides a very limited network of charging points and has been told by the regulator that it must divest itself of that.  That matter must be addressed.  We have to take this seriously and there are a number of actions we can take.  Before I came to the House today I attended a meeting of the new Joint Committee on Climate Action, which will seek to sort out the nuts and bolts of getting through a large amount of work in a three month period and play catch-up.  It is an absolute disgrace that we are where we are, facing a huge carbon cliff that I have warned this House about several times over the past four, five, six or seven years.  I warned the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Phil Hogan, about it.  The cliff is now in front of us and we are not just facing fines but also shame.</p> <p> The contribution we are making to climate change is clear.  There have been four major weather events recently that I have never seen the like of in my lifetime.  We are lobbying for this, that and the other.  We have to get real and look at what is straight in front of us.  The facts are that this is not helping farming, industry or anyone else.  There have been two fodder crises in seven weeks, one caused by a cold spring and another at the moment because it is too hot.  We have to get real about this.  We have to meet our climate change targets.  We are supposed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% at a minimum by 2020.  It is disgraceful that we will only hit 1%.  We should be trying to exceed that 20%.  We must up our game.  No matter where one stands on the political spectrum, this cannot be deferred.  Our children and grandchildren are going to face catastrophic problems unless we deal with this.  The time for action is now.  It cannot be put off until tomorrow or the day after.  We cannot kick the can down the road.  We have a responsibility here.  It is great to see the people in the Public Gallery and that all parties are taking this on board.  We have taken on other issues recently in this Chamber which seemed impossible to deal with in the past.  Everything seems very hard, or impossible even, until it is done, as Nelson Mandela said.  I firmly believe in that.  Things seem impossible until they are done.  When it is done we wonder what the fuss was about.  We have to get on with dealing with this issue, make smart investments and make sure that money is put into the correct industries.</p></speech>

I would have thought that most of us would want the Bill to pass within the two hours.  There are seven or eight more Members who wish to speak and they may speak for seven minutes each, but if they do we are unlikely to be able to pass the Bill.  I am in the hands of the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200027#CC00300"><p>I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy Pringle for his tireless work on this issue.  I also thank Tr&oacute;caire for its advocacy.  It is an organisation that, since its foundation, has been committed to climate justice.  I have witnessed the work that it does first hand in countries such as Ethiopia, where it partners with people on the ground to deliver the productive safety net programmes.  It also helps to ensure sustainable food production.  We have to make the link between what we are doing with this legislation and what happens in countries such as Ethiopia and others in sub-Saharan Africa.  If we are serious about partnering with people in places such as Tigray in Ethiopia, we cannot be paternalistic about it by continuing to produce fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases, both of which are causing major consequences for the very people we are trying to help.  We have closed the loop on that.  We have shown real leadership and through Irish Aid we can send a very positive signal to the eight countries we are working with, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, that Ireland is now taking the lead in terms of a process of divestment of fossil fuels.</p>  <p>  This legislation also sends a very positive signal in terms of the Paris Agreement.  We still have a long way to go to meet the targets that agreement set, as has been said, but today is a positive step forward.  The Third Report and Recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, which is subtitled, "How the State can make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change" should be mentioned.  We will be grappling with that issue soon.  Some of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, composed of citizens of Ireland, are very radical and progressive.  One of the recommendations, endorsed by 100% of the members of the assembly, is that the State should take a leadership role in addressing climate change through mitigation measures.  The report lists a number of suggested measures.  I look forward to this House engaging with that report.  If we are radical and progressive in terms of our approach to this issue I believe we can become global leaders.</p>  <p>  I again congratulate Deputy Pringle and Tr&oacute;caire.  This legislation sends a very positive signal to our partners in sub-Saharan Africa.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200027#CC00400"><p>I will be very brief, because I definitely do not want a situation to arise where we all speak effusively in favour of the Bill and not get around to passing it.  I will do my very best to avoid that situation.  I congratulate Deputy Pringle, Tr&oacute;caire and the other organisations which have campaigned on this issue.  This is one of the most important Bills the House will pass in this D&aacute;il term.  It is testament to the power of campaigning, organisation, mobilisation and the impact those actions have on political parties inside this D&aacute;il and on the Government.  That particularly applies in the context of the minority Government we currently have.  It is a green light for environmental activists to mobilise and apply pressure to ensure that other Bills, such as the Climate Emergency Bill, are treated in a similar way and are ultimately enacted.</p>  <p>  I am glad the Government seems to have dropped its objection on the issue of gas in particular.</p><p> We had a peculiar exchange in the D&aacute;il on Committee Stage, when the Government was trying to maintain that gas was not a fossil fuel but a transition fuel.  It has now accepted that it is included.  </p> <p> My third point is that this is a bright light.  It sends a message around the world and points the way forward for activists all around the world.  In passing this bright light, we should not forget or ignore the darkness that still emanates from this country in respect of our treatment of climate change.  It has been two weeks since the Climate Action Network report, which rated Ireland second last in the EU, only ahead of Poland in terms of action on climate change.  It was utterly damning.  This is a really important step but there are many more actions to take.  </p> <p> The final and key point is that the reason this Bill is so important is that as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan pointed out, it follows the money.  The reason our planet is being destroyed is the interests of big oil.  One hundred companies are responsible for 70% of the emissions since 1988, while 25 companies are responsible for 50% of the emissions since 1988.  That includes companies like Chevron, BP, Exxon Mobil, Shell and other oil and gas corporations.  Their thirst for profit, which is utterly unquenchable, is a driving factor in the destruction of our planet.  Tackling this issue in this way, by putting forward and enacting the idea of divestment, is absolutely essential.  Radical solutions are needed to halt the runaway train of climate change.  That means tackling the interests of these profiteers, going away from a society where their interests and profits come first and where they therefore stand in the way of a rapid and just transition to a low-carbon economy.  Those interests stand in the way of a transition to reliance on public transport.  They stand in the way of energy transition.  This is a very powerful Bill that points in that direction.  </p></speech>

I also wish to thank Tr&oacute;caire, the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition and all those who have championed and supported this Bill.  It is hugely important.  As others have said, while the impact is modest at one level, it is an absolutely clear signal that we have to move rapidly to a fossil-free future.  The public investment in that area must be concentrated in areas that do not further damage our environment or threaten the future of this planet.  It should be invested in areas that will help reverse climate change and stabilise our climate and our environment.  It is a fantastically positive moment that we are about to pass this into law.  It is part of a sea change that is happening, and that sea change is because of the campaigning work of huge and growing numbers of environmental campaigners.  They include young people and others who are determined to push this issue to the top of the agenda where it belongs, and force the political system to respond and address the issue of climate chaos and climate change.</p>  <p>  I want to add one particular point in addition.  I do not want to go over ground that has already been covered by Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith and Paul Murphy, although I should say that I endorse the call for this to be complementary to things like Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018.  We need to move that legislation rapidly through as well.  I hope we can do that early in the autumn and that there will be no attempt to block it.  If we are serious about dealing with climate change and avoiding the climate cliff, the fines etc., we must clearly indicate that there is no justification whatsoever for extracting further fossil fuels in this country, or indeed anywhere else.  </p>  <p>  There is one particular point I want to underline.  If we are going to move away from investment in fossil fuels, we must also dramatically increase investment in areas that will  help reverse climate change and move us towards a sustainable future as far as climate and the environment are concerned.  My particular hobby horse in this regard is the issue of forestry.  As we move away from State investment in fossil fuels, I would really like to see not just Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, money, but National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, money and public investment directed into forestry.  Deforestation is responsible for 15 to 20% of all carbon dioxide emissions in the environment. </p></speech>

Where do we invest ISIF money if we do not invest it in fossil fuels?  We want to invest ISIF money, NTMA money and public money in things that will help to deal with climate change, because this is about dealing with climate change.  I am simply pointing out that one way we could do that is by investing in forestry.  It is uncomplicated and it is win-win-win from the points of view of the economy, the environment and employment.  It is a tragic fact that Ireland has the best conditions for forestry in Europe bar none and has the lowest level of forest cover in Europe bar none.  That is a desperate failure, and we need to do something about it.  Much lipservice has been paid to this and we are not progressing.  In the same way, we have not really progressed in dealing with climate change and we are facing big fines as a result.  We are the laggards, as the Taoiseach has said.  In the same way, we are real laggards in this area, which could be so beneficial.  As the NTMA and the ISIF are obliged to rethink their investment portfolio to move away from things that damage the environment, as this Bill proposes, I really hope they begin to think about areas like that, where investment would be environmentally beneficial.</p></speech>

I think we can no longer ignore the fact that not only is it happening, but people are suffering.  My country, and other countries that are causing this and have the biggest footprint, are not suffering like others are suffering.  We have to take every opportunity to say that and put it on the record.  In my opinion, this is the last D&aacute;il that has the change to tackle climate change before it is too late. </p>  <p>  This Bill signals genuine global leadership in tackling climate change.  I thank Deputy Pringle, the Department and the other parties for co-operating in this regard.  It represents a unique opportunity to ethically invest public money and to send out a strong message about Ireland's intention to meet its international obligations, a point to which I will return.  We are miserably failing to meet our legal obligations.  I have just stepped out of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The NTMA is before the committee today.  Under that agency's remit comes the ISIF and NTMA representatives have just confirmed that since their last appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, it has divested itself of investments in 16 entities.  That is a very positive development.  The NTMA has done that since its last appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts because of this initiative by Deputy Pringle and the Department.  I welcome that. </p><p> We know about the Paris Agreement, to which Ireland eventually signed up on 22 April 2016.  It is the first universal, legally-binding global climate deal.  It is a global action plan to restrict the impact of carbon emissions on global warming.  As we all know, the aim is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2&deg; Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to limit the temperature increase to 1.5&deg; Celsius.  Before signing the agreement, we passed the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act and we passed the mitigation plan afterwards.  However, we are failing absolutely to comply with our very basic obligations.  Our commitment, as part of the collective EU pledge, is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term - that is, by 2020 - by 20% below the 2005 level.  The medium-term target is to reduce emissions by 30% of the 2005 level by 2030 and the long-term target is to reduce them by 80% to 95% by 2050.  Ireland will be one of only two countries to miss out on the short-term 2020 targets. It is pretty clear that we will not meet the mid-term targets either.  According to the Climate Change Advisory Council, which is a good body - that it was established was a positive step but we are simply ignoring it - current climate policy means that Ireland will miss its agreed 2020 emissions reduction target by a substantial margin without a major new policy and measures.  The council has indicated that we will also miss out on the 2030 EU target and the 2050 target by very large margins.  This is the language of the Climate Change Advisory Council, it is not mine.  In addition, last month the EPA projected that Ireland's emissions will decrease by just 1% by 2020 and has called for a decisive move away from fossil fuels.  This is certainly a step in that direction.  In addition, Ireland is the third highest carbon emitter in the EU.  Ireland came second lowest - just ahead of Poland - in recent rankings on where EU countries stand.</p> <p> My time is limited but there are things which must be highlighted.  The Climate Action Network has pointed out that we have failed to join the group of progressive EU member states calling for increased EU climate ambition.  It has also pointed out that we face &euro;500 million in fines.  There has been a dispute about whether it is &euro;500 million or &euro;400 million rather than about why we are failing to meet our targets.  As the UN report notes, the other cost is that the global average cost of climatic disasters - including floods, storms, droughts and heatwaves - is estimated to have risen substantially from $65 billion in the period 1985 to 1994 to $154 billion in the period 2005 to 2014, an increase of 40%.</p> <p> It is interesting that the Department of Finance is sponsoring this legislation and not the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It is also interesting that the Citizens' Assembly set and came up with very practical suggestions.  I have to put on the record the fact that I was one of those who was very sceptical when the Citizens' Assembly was set up.  I have to say that I was wrong.  It has done Trojan work.  The challenge now is to implement the assembly's recommendations, which, of course, we are not doing.  We have set up another committee and we were going to hear all over again what the Citizens' Assembly stated.  We simply do not have time to do so.  I thank Deputy Pringle for bringing forward the Bill.</p></speech>

It is appropriate that it is the final day of the D&aacute;il term and it is interesting that the time in which we are speaking is time the Government gave and swapped with Independents 4 Change in order that we could conclude the debate on the Bill.  That is a good sign.  It is not often that we get the opportunity to acknowledge positive developments in this House.  There are not too many of them.  We need to give credit where it is due.  In that context, credit for this Bill overwhelmingly lies with Deputy Pringle and the staff in his office, particularly Jodie, as well as Tr&oacute;caire and the other organisations.</p><p>When we say Tr&oacute;caire, we do not just mean an organisation, we mean all of the hundreds of citizens who have been mailing all of us over the course of the past week to encourage this Bill over the line.  That encouragement has been good and we have an obligation to those to whom I refer see the Bill through with the level of urgency they demanded of us.  The legislation is largely symbolic, but symbolism is incredibly important.  We have made a stand today, historically and on the world stage, and it is now a case of us being obliged to follow it up.  It is also a reality check.  If we continue to show the apathy that has been shown in this State, we will sleepwalk into an environmental disaster and we will be left to wonder, 20 years from now, why we did not act when it was in our power to do so.</p><p>When we refer to the fines that Ireland will inevitably have to pay because we are so far behind in terms of our carbon emissions targets, it is sadly ironic that the fines are actually the least part of our troubles.  As Deputy Connolly stated, Ireland currently has the third highest rate of emissions <i>per capita</i>in the world, with a very heavy reliance on oil, coal and peat.  In addition, emissions in the key areas of agriculture, energy and transport are increasing.  We are aware that the Climate Change Advisory Council has been highly critical of our progress to date, that Tr&oacute;caire made recommendations a number of years ago and that it has taken a number of years to get to this symbolic Bill.  How many more years is it going to take to deal with the other fundamentals if we do not start delivering on them?</p><p>The Government sent certain mixed messages this week by opposing Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's Bill, which was being scrutinised by the relevant committee this week.  There is an urgency here in that we have to alter our thinking.  Perhaps we can repeat the co-operation that has taken place on the Bill before us and bring it to bear on all of the other measures that are desperately needed in order to address the State's inaction in respect of the key issues relating to climate change.</p><p>I thank everybody involved in bringing forward the Bill.  Like previous speakers, I am of the view that it must be seen as part of a wider suite of measures which are necessary and which must be taken seriously in the coming months and years.</p></speech>

My party's position has been well put by Deputies Michael McGrath, Lawless and Dooley.  I was anxious to have a few minutes in which to contribute because I have received hundreds of emails from concerned young - and not so young - people in my constituency about climate change and what it is doing.  It is past time for us to be doing what we are doing today.  Like other speakers, I applaud the many people who have fought this campaign and I compliment Deputy Pringle on what he has done.  As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on the OPW and flood relief, I the Inishowen Peninsula in the Deputy's county of Donegal.  What I saw was bizarre and unbelievable in terms of the damage caused.  Some of that damage has yet to be rectified because not all of the repairs have been completed.  What I saw was frightening and horrendous.  My county, Roscommon, and parts of Galway, Offaly, Longford, Clare and other counties have been badly hit by severe flooding.  If we do not take action on climate change, the cost to the nation in human terms will continue to grow.  Lives have been lost, property has been destroyed and businesses that closed due to flash floods have not reopened.</p>  <p>  As the representatives of the people, we have to be brave, take steps such as those outlined in the Bill and deal with the issues being brought to our attention by people in Tr&oacute;caire and others who support them.  In the past, my party took brave decisions.  We were not afraid to introduce the levy on plastic bags.  We were not afraid to introduce the smoking ban.  This is why we are here in total support of what Deputy Pringle is doing.  We will have a further opportunity to speak on this.  It is a great day and I am delighted to support the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il will work with Deputy Pringle to ensure that greater progress can be made.  It is absolutely essential that we move very quickly on all of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200029#EE00400"><p>It is absolutely right and proper that Ireland should pursue an ethical investment programme in respect of State investments held on behalf of the people of Ireland.</p><p>Any time people have been consulted, including at the Citizens' Assembly, they have indicated clearly that they want an ethical investment programme.  I thank Deputy Pringle for bringing forward his legislation and Tr&oacute;caire, as well as all the people working for it, for supporting the Bill and contacting our offices.  We have done this before, of course.  As a country we do not invest in guns or military equipment.  As has been mentioned, we divested from investments relating to cigarettes and other products that could cause harm to people around the world.</p> <p> With regard to the harm done to people around the world, there can be no doubt that climate change has done great harm to tens of millions of people in vast areas, particularly in Africa and Asia.  Today an exhibition will be launched by Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann in Kilmainham Gaol celebrating the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's birth.  When Mr. Mandela got out of jail, something he said continuously to young people in supporting education in particular concerned how we treat our planet and hold it in trust.  He indicated we do this not for ourselves but for future generations.  It is important to signal today that we favour decarbonisation of the economy in our own and other interests.  We know about the water shortages we are currently experiencing.</p> <p> I worked on many occasions alongside Tr&oacute;caire in Africa in the 1980s when I was with the Irish development programme in Tanzania for three years.  Climate change was beginning to become evident then and significant parts of the east and west Tanzania were becoming desertified and losing tree cover because of what was happening with the planet's climate.  I went back to Tanzania last year and it broke my heart to see how much climate change had impact negatively on this vast country in east Africa.  Climate change has a particular impact on women and children there.  In Africa, women their children in rural areas must fetch water and bring it home.  They must also procure fuel by cutting trees and making charcoal.  By and large, it is the only way to get fuel for cooking, particularly among poor families.  Again, Tr&oacute;caire is one of the organisations that has done much work worldwide trying to improve the lot of poor women and families in Africa and make their lives a little easier.</p> <p> The burden of climate change falls on the poorest families and people in Africa.  Along with our development aid programme, as a country we should ensure the policies we pursue with institutions like the NTMA are entirely consistent with what people in Ireland would like to see happening for the betterment of families and individual women, children and men in Africa.</p> <p> Ironically, today is also when US President Trump, that great climate change denier, visits our neighbours in the UK.  He is a disruptive force with respect to climate change as he basically argues that it is not happening.  I hope during his presidency he will get the opportunity to visit some of the different areas in Africa where livelihoods are being devastated by the impact of climate change.  I am pleased that currently institutions such as the World Bank and its president, Dr. Jim Yong Kim, are positively pursuing solutions to climate change and education so that people can adapt their own countries as to how best to deal with this enormous difficulty, which has an impact on water and forestry.  There are many species in Ireland suffering the impact of climate change.  This problem also has an enormous effect on household costs, particularly in Africa, where women are responsible for water, fuel and the land.</p> <p> I congratulate Deputy Pringle again on the Bill, which we support.  Former President, Mary Robinson, has worked with people like Nelson Mandela, when he was alive, to try to change the world view on this.  Just as with the industrial revolution there was a shift and, along with revolutions involving information technology and social media, there will be another shift if we can get enough people with goodwill to come together and agree that we should conserve water and our planet, and deal with climate change.  If that happens, we will bequeath a better world to the young people of today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200030#FF00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I do not have a problem with governments not investing in fossil fuels in future but there are few issues of which we should be mindful.  According to reports, it seems that the rate of coal consumption last year was one of the highest ever, so despite what we are trying to do in this country, other countries do not seem to be adhering to such standards.  Germany is constantly opening lignite mines and Vietnam is opening a coal mine every week.  If we do something, other countries must do it as well.</p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na will move away from peat after 2030.  I met the company's representatives in the audiovisual room a few weeks ago when they gave a presentation and, unfortunately, 1,100 or 1,200 workers will be affected.  We must ensure they are protected, as the only plan I could see was that they would be pensioned off bit by bit.  When the hard questions were put to those representatives about where people would work or how families in the midlands would be affected, no answers were forthcoming.  Government plans must take in electricity generation in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge, which may go to biomass, but we must be sure of those solutions.  We cannot just knock off a tap overnight.</p>  <p>  I listened with interest to the comments about where the country is going.  I am not sure we ever had a plan.  I have heard people saying we can have trees but they do not grow overnight.  Unfortunately, growing willow on bogs has not been successful; it is such a bad crop that we would need the whole of County Roscommon to feed Lanesborough, and that will not happen.  We must be realistic.  People give out about farmers in Ireland but they are efficient.  We are the most efficient producers of beef in Europe and Europe is a more efficient producer than the rest of the world because of concentrates used elsewhere.  We must be mindful of that.</p><p> Another aspect that we need to perfect is solar power.  I know things have moved on and have got better, but we need to own up to another thing.  Government aid for peat will finish next year.  I have never been madly in favour of subsidising anything because I believe in the real world we have to produce products  without too many subsidies.  We are subsidising wind.  Wind power needs to start standing on its own, as does solar power and all the rest.  Otherwise the price of electricity will go up.</p> <p> We are a manufacturing and exporting country.  Let us consider the west of Ireland and companies like McHale that is sending machinery throughout the world.  It is a great company that started from a small shed.  It cannot afford rising costs.  We are competing with countries that have nuclear and other types of electricity.  We have discussed interconnectors and so on but we need to be mindful that the price of electricity has to be affordable for householders and businesses.</p> <p> We need to consider the farming community.  People refer to the national herd and so on.  If we are honest about it, a total of 300,000 people are involved, as many as are employed in multinationals in this country.  We have to protect that side of rural Ireland.  We cannot simply turn off the key.  People cannot live on fresh air, although some people might think that is possible.</p> <p> We need to consider where there are alternatives.  People referred to the incinerator in Dublin, to which there were many objections.  Where people live in large built-up areas they have to take the brunt of that as well.  We cannot simply say the west of Ireland will produce every tree and will have every wind turbine and solar farm.  We cannot simply say that everyone else can do whatever they want but they will not have to put up with any problems.  No one is saying they will not take their share of these new systems, but there should be an even distribution throughout the country.</p> <p> While I have no problem with the Bill or with Deputy Pringle, we need to be mindful of what other countries are doing and of how to save jobs.  Bord na M&oacute;na is one company that comes to mind for 2030.  We cannot wish everyone good luck in 2029.  Housing estates were built by Bord na M&oacute;na down through the years.  While people might not like all of this, the reality is that those small economies, for example, the butcher shop and the local grocer in the area, lived off an economy built around that.  We need to ensure that Government investment down the road is appropriate.</p> <p> I hear the view that we will be harvesting trees and that we will have woodchip and so on.  That will not happen in seven or eight years.  We need to be realistic about it.  We need to plan for the future if we are going in different ways.</p> <p> The Government should lead by example.  Let us consider the likes of Galway.  There are no plans for electrification in through the city.  What about the likes of the train system and Dublin Bus?  Whether we like it, for every ten buses we buy today that are diesel-powered, we will be buying eight if they are electric and diesel combined.  We will need more money in the kitty for all of this.  That is the debate that needs to take place; we need to know where we are going.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200031#GG00200"><p>The amendment effectively replaces the full text of the original Bill, as presented by Deputy Pringle.  It is based on an amendment that Deputy Pringle initially proposed on Committee Stage.  It has now been agreed after extensive engagement between Deputy Pringle's office, NGOs, Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and the Department of Finance such that it sets challenging but achievable targets.</p>  <p>  If Deputy Pringle's amendment is accepted, as I hope it will be, it will insert a new provision in Part 6 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014.  This is the part of the 2014 Act that established Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and sets out its statutory remit and investment mandate.  The new section will change the ISIF mandate for the future.  The changes are designed to restrict ISIF making fossil fuel investments while taking appropriate account of the national transition objective.</p>  <p>  The amendment defines what constitutes a fossil fuel undertaking.  It is an undertaking for which exploration for extraction or extraction or refinement of fossil fuels accounts for at least 20% of its turnover.  The National Treasury Management Agency, as custodian of ISIF, would be obliged to endeavour not to directly invest in fossil fuel undertaking.</p>  <p>  Where ISIF is directly invested in a fossil fuel undertaking, the NTMA will be obliged to divest from it as soon as is practicable.  This statutory obligation is strong but it allows a small margin of flexibility to take account of the need to comply with applicable contract terms and the importance of preserving fund value for the State.</p>  <p>  The provision provides a 15% tolerance threshold for indirect investments.  ISIF must ensure it does not maintain investments in an indirect investment that is likely to hold more than 50% of its assets in a fossil fuel undertaking.  I wish to emphasise that this is an upper band against which ISIF can be audited.  This will mean ISIF will have a strong incentive to keep the fund's exposure substantially lower to take account of sectoral volatility.  In addition, provision is made that the Minister may by order prescribe a lower exposure to fossil fuel undertakings in indirect investments.</p>  <p>  The proposed section 49A(4) is particularly important.  It provides an exemption from the general rules set out for investments and indirect investments.  This is to allow ISIF to make certain investments consistent with the State's national transition and climate change objectives.  Where an investment is made in a fossil fuel undertaking using that flexibility, ISIF must specify that fact when it publishes the fact that it has made the investment.  ISIF will be obliged to report on the measures it takes by way of divestment or otherwise to comply with these measures.</p>  <p>  I strongly support this targeted and considered and practical amendment.  It will balance the challenges of reducing exposure of fossil fuel investment while enabling ISIF to earn investment returns for the Irish taxpayer and, most important, support through its investments projects designed to assist in the national transition objective.  I commend Deputy Pringle on his work in advancing this Bill and I commend the amendment to the House.</p>  <p>  I wish to touch upon some other matters briefly.  They relate to the work between Deputy Pringle's office, non-Government agencies and organisations, including Tr&oacute;caire, ISIF and the Department of Finance.  We had a really good strong robust debate on Committee Stage.  If anything, that really helped to focus minds.  Everyone wanted to achieve the objective.  The question was how we got there.  I commend Deputy Pringle on his flexibility in allowing ISIF and the Department of Finance to have that level of flexibility.  Without that, I am unsure whether we would be where we are today.</p>  <p>  I want to touch on some other items quickly, including the 2040 Rebuilding Ireland plan.  The largest level of expenditure between now and 2040 will be in sustainable projects and sustainability with regard to how to de-carbonise Irish society.  This is something to which I am personally committed on the financial services side of my brief.  I believe this is where most investment will occur in future.</p>  <p>  I have used a particular figure in the past.  To decarbonise Europe per annum, the shortfall is &euro;160 billion.  Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President of the European Commission, attended the European Financial Forum and quoted a figure of &euro;180 billion.  That is how much we are short in Europe every year and that is not taking into account the billions of euro currently being invested to decarbonise Europe.  We are trillions of euro short worldwide when it comes to decarbonising to protect the planet.</p><p>In terms of financial services, my objective is to make Ireland the global hub for sustainable green financial services, green bonds and products that can be sold around the world.  If we can do that here in Ireland - and throughout the country, not just in Dublin where most people talk about basing financial services - it will have a huge benefit.  Not only will we administer them from here but we will also spend them here.</p> <p> I am concerned about something that is happening now, which I see in my own county, whereby people are objecting to everything.  It is everywhere.  Wind farms are objected to.  We brought in new controls to keep turbines back from property boundaries, which is appropriate.  There are objections to solar farms.  People are creating fear and doubt and saying the craziest things about renewable energies that are clean and tested and have been for decades.  It has to stop or we will never meet these targets.  </p> <p> Events like what happened with the Apple data centre in Athenry cannot continue.  People who object to a project because it is close to them are wrong in so doing.  </p></speech>

I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for handling the debate and ensuring that we finished in time, as without his stewardship we could have talked ourselves out of it and ended up without passing the Bill.</p>  <p> It is welcome when there is cross-party support for an initiative such as this.  It is a moment to be celebrated by civil society and the members of the public who have got behind this Bill and pushed hard and consistently over the last two years on this issue.  For the global divestment movement that has been shining an essential light on the contradictions of investing in the prolonged expansion of an industry whose business plans are in direct contradiction of the hard-won goals set out in the Paris Agreement, our last chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change, it is also a moment to be celebrated.  </p>  <p>  If passed through the Seanad, this Bill will make Ireland the first country to commit to divest from the global fossil fuel industry.  However, I feel strongly that this is not a moment for celebration in the D&aacute;il.  Rather, it is a moment to stop and seriously consider the role we are playing in the global effort on climate change.  With this Bill, we are leading the way on state-level divestment from fossil fuels but we are lagging seriously behind our most basic national, EU and global level commitments.  </p>  <p>  While the cross-party support for this Bill shows that significant change is possible where there is political will, thus far we have not the political will to take the big and small decisions that are needed to unlock the change.  That must change.  </p>  <p>  In closing, I want to step back and recall how this Bill came to be.  About two years ago, Tr&oacute;caire approached me and shared their deep concerns about the direction climate change was taking globally and particularly in Ireland.  The impacts of climate change today are already at crisis levels, a human tragedy unfolding against a background of continued political inertia.  We must be very clear; people are dying today as a direct result of climate change through the increasingly frequent and intense disasters, through increased hunger, increased water scarcity and significantly more will die or be forced into displacement if there is not a radical change in direction.</p>  <p>  Let this be a moment where we commit to getting serious.  Let us show the Irish public and the international community that we are ready to think and act beyond narrow short-term and vested interests and will take the opportunities that lie ahead of us to bring in real change.</p>  <p>  Finally I wish to thank a number of people who made all this possible.  From Tr&oacute;caire, Cliona Sharkey, Selina Donnelly, Niamh Garvey and their entire team have worked incredibly hard and gave much of their time and expertise to see this project to completion.  I thank them and any others I may have left out.  I thank Stop Climate Chaos for organising the divestment campaign and for the coalition's activism - all the emails and advocacy - which have kept the issue on the agenda.  I thank all the university students across Ireland, and especially in NUI Galway and Trinity College Dublin, who helped campaign for divestment and activated ordinary citizens on the ground to rally behind this.  I thank Gerry Liston of Global Legal Action Network, GLAN, whose expertise in legislative drafting made this project possible.  John Moreland from the UK assisted us with some of the more financial and technical aspects of the Bill, for which I thank him.  I thank the Minister and all the staff for their support and work on this Bill. </p>  <p>  I thank all the Deputies from Independents4Change and other political parties who have supported me.  Lastly, and most importantly, I thank Jodie Neary, my parliamentary assistant, who has done most of the work on this.  I just stand here and make the speeches, which is the nice handy part of it, but Jodie has done all the hard work so I thank her for that and everyone for their support.</p></speech>

I thank the House for making time available to make these statements today.</p>  <p>  Despite the temperatures having fallen back to more normal values this week, Met &Eacute;ireann is forecasting only small amounts of rain for the rest of this week and most of next week as well.  This means that there will be little or no alleviation in the drought conditions we are currently experiencing.  The drought conditions are expected to persist in the medium and longer term.</p>  <p>  However, the main feature of the weather, along with the sunshine, has been the absence of rain, which has given us drought.  The main consequences of this are for our water supplies, for water quality and inland fisheries, for wildlife and fires and for agriculture.</p>  <p>  Probably the single biggest challenge arising from the drought conditions for the coming weeks, if not months, will be maintaining drinking water supply across the country.  Irish Water has been managing a very difficult and evolving situation and is doing everything possible to maintain supplies. The Irish Water crisis management team began work as soon as this warm weather came into view in June and is meeting daily to monitor both demand and water supply production capacity around the country, and is taking steps to supply water where supplies are at risk.  Water production is being maintained at record levels to deal with the increased demand.  Local authority crews are busy identifying and fixing leaks to take pressure off the system and Irish Water has mobilised additional crews at critical locations to support local authority efforts.  Irish Water has extended the ban on the use of hosepipes in domestic settings nationwide with effect from midnight on 5 July and is urging people everywhere to conserve water.</p>  <p>  I have visited its headquarters with the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, to see the work it is doing and we must give credit to its team for the proactive approach it has taken to date.  Of its nearly 1,000 water supply systems, nine schemes are currently experiencing severe drought, 51 are in drought condition and a further 77 are in potential drought situations.  Irish Water is implementing its response plans to provide supplies of water to customers in schemes affected by the current drought conditions.  We have been working to ensure inter-agency collaboration and support for Irish Water in putting in place alternative water supplies and distribution arrangements for those schemes already experiencing severe drought conditions.  The agriculture community and those with their own wells are also affected, as groundwater levels in aquifers are declining.  The National Federation of Group Water Schemes has issued advice on conservation measures and is working to support its members on the ground.  </p>  <p>  The overriding concern will be for the longer term and the supply of drinking water in late summer and autumn.  There appears to be little prospect of getting the levels of rainfall that would alleviate the drought conditions in the short term.  As the drought is likely to persist, and groundwater and lake and river levels come under greater pressure right across the country, it is prudent to introduce restrictions such as reduced water pressure at night on a much wider scale with a view to conserving our water supplies in the longer term.  We need to plan not merely for July or August but also for September and even October.</p>  <p>  It is critically important that everybody - businesses and private individuals - makes every effort to support the responsible use of water.  This means avoiding unnecessary usage, repairing leaks promptly and generally conserving water.</p><p>On Tuesday, 26 June, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine issued a national "condition red" wild land fire danger notice in response to the drought resulting from the warm weather event.  This was extended on 6 July and again yesterday as drought conditions persist and vegetation remains extremely dry and flammable right across the country.  Fire services are making up to 100 responses to wild land fire incidents every day, which represents a decrease since the peak of 160 responses per day on 3 July.  Although fire services are coping with the current level of incidents, the number of incidents to which they normally respond every day has doubled and this is putting pressure on fire services.  I wish to express my appreciation for the Air Corps helicopter personnel who have been called in to assist with wild land fire-fighting for the past two weeks.</p> <p> As the drought continues, flammable conditions for fire will remain.  This underlines the need for care to prevent wild land fires from starting.  Controlled burning of stubble by farmers is banned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Social media is being used to make people aware of the wild land fire risk.  People visiting or hiking in the countryside should not light fires.  Reports indicate that a significant number of recent wild land fires were caused by careless discarding of matches and cigarette ends.  We must sustain our fire prevention efforts.  Smoke from wild land fires can cause issues with air quality.  Our local authority fire services are working with the EPA and the HSE to monitor situations which could cause difficulties for people who are susceptible to breathing difficulties.</p> <p> As the lead Department for co-ordinating the response to severe weather events, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has been active since 21 June and is continuing to work closely with the sectors most affected by the current conditions.  The drought is presenting the biggest challenge at the moment.  Along with the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, I attended the weekly inter-agency review meeting that was held yesterday, at which consideration was given to issues arising from the drought associated with the extended period of warm weather being enjoyed in this country.  Last week, we appealed to the public to use water sparingly and to prevent wild land fires during what looks like being a long period of dry weather.  Our view is that no emerging public safety issues at this time warrant the convening of the national emergency co-ordination group.  The national directorate for fire and emergency management will keep the situation under review.  The current level of co-ordination with relevant sectors will be continued to manage the issues within their remit.</p> <p> As well as being winter-ready, we now have to be summer-ready.  Householders, farmers and businesses of all kinds have to conserve water at every opportunity.  We need to think about resilience and how we will cope if supplies are reduced.  There might be a small amount of rain in the days ahead, but it will not change the overall picture.  We have to conserve our water supplies for the weeks and months ahead.  The evidence we heard at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting indicates that people are heeding the conserve water message and being careful about fires.  Water consumption has stabilised and the number of wild land fires is down.  I thank the public for its response and for the community spirit that has been shown to date.  I encourage all citizens to continue do their part in conserving our water supplies and preventing fires.  This will allow people to enjoy the summer while the drought issues that are arising throughout the county are managed.</p></speech>

We all understand the importance of water.  Citizens are now beginning to realise how important it is.  Night-time restrictions on water pressure have been introduced.  The commercial and industrial sector values water.  The farming sector is being affected by the ongoing water shortages.  The drought is having huge implications.  As a commercial water user, I appreciate the value and importance of water if my business is to survive.  What is happening is something I have not seen before in my lifetime.  The river that runs by our hotel is currently no more than a stream.  One could barely float a stick in it.  We would normally associate such water levels with the middle or end of September, but we are now seeing them in July.  It is an extremely worrying experience.  I acknowledge the work that is being done in the Vartry reservoir.  The Government has committed to the upgrading of the wastewater plant there and the pipe network.  Vartry reservoir was full this year for the first time in three years.  When I pass it each day, I can see the water level dropping.  I think this is driving home what the real message needs to be.</p>  <p>  It is vital for the Government to implement in full the recommendations of the special Oireachtas committee on water charges.</p></speech>

This means that fully funding infrastructure investment and promoting water conservation are key components in addressing the long-term issues that are features of our water crisis.  I suppose addressing the leakages is one of the key parts of that.  When the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government discussed this matter recently, it was worrying to hear that 207 megalitres of water is wasted on a daily basis.  The Government's investment over a 30-year period is supposed to reduce the daily level of wastage to 140 megalitres.  There needs to be a greater emphasis on addressing water leakages.  There is a high level of water availability in Ireland.  Research shows that Ireland has one of the highest rates of water availability in the world.  We have renewable water resources of approximately 13,000 megalitres <i>per capita</i>per annum.  The equivalent figure for France is 3,371 megalitres and for Israel is just 225 megalitres.  This clearly indicates that Ireland needs to investment in infrastructure and in repairing water leakages.  Like everyone else, the councillors in my local area have seen many water leakages over the years.  We have had to wait ten or 15 years for burst pipes to be replaced.  When this eventually happens, we see the significant savings that immediately accrue.  We need to invest more in critical infrastructure and in repairing leakages.  I acknowledge how our citizens have reacted to the recent water shortages.  I thank them for acting responsibly to save water as often as they can.  It is only now that Irish Water is beginning to promote the importance of water conservation on a domestic basis.  In line with the need to implement ways of saving water, soft supports are needed to educate people on an ongoing basis about the best ways to save water at home, in commercial businesses and in agriculture.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200033#JJ00500"><p>I want to start by making a statement that I rarely make in this House.  I fully support the core message we have heard from the Minister and, indeed, from other public authorities in recent weeks as well.  Many of us have had huge concerns about the Government's water policy over the years.  We have significant concerns about the structure and operation of Irish Water.  Leaving all of that aside, anybody who looks at the facts in a reasonable manner, particularly in the context of recent weather events, will acknowledge that we have a supply problem.  While we have political differences on some of the core issues, we all need to emphasise the message of conservation.  It is important to make it clear that the heaviest burden of conservation needs to fall on the shoulders of those responsible for the largest levels of waste in our system.  Domestic users have a role to play and the evidence shows they are playing that role very well.  However, it is crucial for business and for the Government to play their part as well.  It is worth emphasising, as we always do during these debates, that the State - now through the infrastructure managed by Irish Water - is the single biggest waster of water.  This point has already been highlighted by Deputy Casey.  Some 36% of water in the greater Dublin water supply area is lost in the distribution system.  The relevant figures for the Dublin county and Dublin city areas, respectively, are 40% and 50%.  The weather event is not at the core of this problem and nor is excessive use by large numbers of households.  As a consequence of decades of under-investment, we have a system that is leaking phenomenal volumes of expensively treated water.</p><p>Irish Water's figures are startling.  It is probable that approximately 610 million litres are available in the greater Dublin water supply region each day.On the basis of comments made by Irish Water yesterday and today, it appears that the current level of demand is approximately 568 million litres per day.  According to Irish Water's own figures, some 207 million litres are lost in the greater Dublin supply area every day.  Deputies will be aware that Emma Kennedy has been campaigning on water issues for a long time.  She calculates in an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i>today that the level of daily water loss in the greater Dublin supply area is close to 300 million litres.  Regardless of the exact figure, it is clear that there is a phenomenal volume of loss.  While I clearly and unequivocally support the Minister in calling for conservation, we also need to hear from him an outline of what the Government intends to do differently from what is currently in the pipeline to try to reduce the phenomenal level of leakage.  It is significant that Irish Water's capital investment programme will increase by &euro;200 million to &euro;777 million next year.</p><p>It is to increase again to &euro;728 million in 2020 and to &euro;806 million in 2021.</p> <p> One of the conversations we keep having with Irish Water representatives when they appear before the committee concerns why it is not possible to accelerate the water loss reduction programme.  Irish Water is talking about saving approximately 44 million litres per day by 2021.  That is a saving of only 11 million litres per day in the greater Dublin region each year over the next four years.  I just do not understand why it is not possible to accelerate the rate of saving to prioritise, alongside tackling the problem with wastewater treatment plants, having a more aggressive level of leakage reduction.  The housing committee, which is responsible for oversight of this issue, has heard evidence of much more successful rates of leakage reduction elsewhere, for example, in London, which faces many of the problems faced in Dublin owing to high levels of urban infrastructural development complicating the replacement of pipes, etc.  I urge the Minister to re-examine the issue of how to fast-track and take a more aggressive approach to reduction, be it today or at a later stage.</p> <p> Some commentators and Members of this House, although not the Minister, have been claiming that if water charges had been introduced in 2014, the situation would somehow be different today.  That is simply not the case.  Irish Water's capital investment plan is exactly the same today as it was when water charges were first mooted.  The only difference is that money that would have come from charges comes from general taxation.  In fact, the level of investment in capital infrastructure upgrades, including leak reduction, is exactly the same.  Therefore, having raised money through water charges as opposed to general taxation would have made no difference.</p> <p> The crucial issue is whether that level of investment can and should be increased.  If the Minister is in a position today or later in the week to say, in his public commentary, whether there are intentions, particularly in light of budget 2019, to enter into discussions with Irish Water to determine whether some of that capital infrastructure upgrading could be brought forward, it would be useful.</p> <p> Some people will attempt to use the water shortage to accelerate the implementation of the Shannon&ndash;Dublin water supply pipeline proposal.  While my party is clear that it is not against the proposition of piping water to the city in principle, it believes that, with such severe leakage and the unevidenced argument that aquifers in the greater Dublin region are not available, there are still questions to be answered.  I would welcome clarification and further statements from the Minister with respect to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200034#KK00200"><p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I support the Minister's call for ongoing vigilance in the conservation of water.  It is important that this message go out today because people have seen a little drop of rain here and there and they might believe the crisis is over.  It is not and there is still a serious problem producing sufficient water for domestic, business and agricultural use.  We all support the call.</p><p>I too want to address the issue of leaks.  The article in <i>The Irish Times</i>that was just referred to might overestimate slightly the volume of water leaked in Dublin but there is certainly a serious problem.  If the leaked water does not amount to half the 600 million litres used in the greater Dublin area, it probably amounts to at least 40% of that.  That has to be tackled.</p><p>There is serious concern about the proposal to bring water to Dublin from the Parteen Basin, just below Lough Derg, which is close to where I live.  I do not know whether Members have read any local Limerick newspapers in the past week.  There was a photograph of a man in the middle of the River Shannon between Thomond Bridge and Sarsfield Bridge with a picnic table, chair and a sun umbrella.  He was sitting on his chair in the middle of the river with water up to a certain level, but not up to the level of the table.  Therefore, there is a serious water shortage in the river.  This alerts people in the mid-west to the concerns that exist.  I acknowledge the argument made by Irish Water that the water taken will result in only a tiny reduction in the level of the Parteen Basin.  I reiterate the concern that there should be some control from the mid-west if the project is to go ahead.  The local authorities in the mid-west should have the capacity to say Dublin is not getting any more water from the area if it is needed in the region.  I have seen all the technical arguments and I understand the problem in Dublin but the problem of leakage needs to be addressed.</p><p>The context of this debate was described in the debate on fossil fuels, which I just listened to.  It covered the reality of climate change and how it affects us here in addition to people in other parts of the world who are much more vulnerable.  We have seen evidence of climate change ourselves, with both the dry spell and the snow that fell unseasonably earlier in the year.  People in Ireland are beginning to realise this is a reality.  Whatever Mr. Donald Trump and others may say, climate change is an absolute reality.</p><p>A colleague in my constituency, Deputy Michael Noonan, famously said we should get the dead cat off the pitch, the dead cat being the issue of water charges.  There is an element &mdash; maybe it is a little bit of the cat &mdash; that still needs to be addressed, namely, the issue of wastage and overuse of water, be it by domestic or business users.  People have been careful about conserving water and realise there should be some punishment for excessive use.  Businesses, in particular, have been highlighted.  I do not know whether Members read the article by Stephen Kinsella in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>at the weekend.  He wrote an extensive article on the volume of water that is used apart from domestic water.  Therefore, it is a broader issue.  There has to be some kind of cost recovery for the State where there is wastage of water.  There are legitimate uses for water in business, agriculture and the domestic environment.  These uses should be understood as important for people in their homes and for jobs but here has to be some way in which wastage can be addressed, wherever it occurs.</p><p>Now that time has elapsed since the debates at meetings of the water committee and debates prior to those, I hope it will be possible to talk about this issue again in a real way, based on the acknowledgement that there genuinely is wastage.  We now know from experience in the recent past and from the fact that we will still be conserving water in the future, what a precious commodity treated water is.  We must ensure that we look after it and deal with the pipes and wastage, and that we are all careful about how we use this precious resource.</p></speech>

I agree that this definitely concerns domestic users but it also concerns businesses and the State.  That is the immediate answer to the crisis we face in ensuring we do not run out of water.  That immediate answer does not point to the cause of the crisis, however, or to what it is fundamentally about.  As has been referred to in the debate, it is the absence of investment in water infrastructure over many years.  We have a classic example of Noam Chomsky's description of the standard technique of privatisation, which is to defund and make sure something does not work in order that people will get angry and the infrastructure can be handed over to private capital.  He left out an intermediate step that, which is the commodification of water through water charges.</p>  <p>  It has been suggested that if we had water charges, we would not have this crisis.  Thankfully this argument has not featured in the debate.  It is factually incorrect because we would have had the exact same level of investment from Irish Water that we currently have.  Therefore, we would be in the same circumstances.</p>  <p>  The fundamental answer is investment in our water infrastructure.  The Irish Water investment plan is inadequate because it does not deal with the deficit that built up over many years.  There has been an average investment of approximately &euro;500 million since 2000.  We are facing an investment of approximately &euro;680 million per year but that needs to be raised to &euro;1 billion per year.</p>  <p>  The only recommendation of the Oireachtas committee on water charges that the Government seems to be interested in implementing is that on charging for excessive water use.  The referendum does not seem to be coming.  The many conservation measures that were recommended by the committee have not been implemented.</p><p>They included a call for the introduction of a scheme like the building energy rating, BER, but also for water conservation, a proactive retrofitting programme to provide for the maximum level of water conservation, an ambitious amendment to existing building standards and regulations and an education campaign, such as that which exists in Wales.  We need action on these matters now in order that we might deal with conservation.</p></speech>

However, somewhat cynical attempts have been made - not here today but I have heard them in the House in the past week, particularly from Government Deputies - to suggest that if there had been water charges, this would not be happening or we would have the means to deal with it.  That is completely disingenuous, not just because the investment programme of Irish Water would have been the same but also because this problem has existed through the entire history of the State.  I do not know how many Members have read <i>Ulysses</i>by James Joyce but in &quot;Ithaca&quot;, the second last chapter, there is an extensive passage in which he describes the capacity limitations of the Vartry reservoir in Roundwood, the problems with the pipes, the rationing of water during a drought period and the corruption of the municipal guardians of Dublin, who were responsible for imposing the rations, in using excessive amounts of water while the people paid the price for it.  <i>Ulysses </i>was written at the time of the First World War.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have been in government ever since and have not addressed the problem that James Joyce identified in 1914.  That is how long this has been happening.</p><p>Water was the first thing hit when Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party imposed austerity in 2010 by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  The policy of austerity was then continued by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  A &euro;50 million annual reduction in investment was implemented on already historically low levels of investment in water infrastructure.  The people and individual householders are not to blame.  We have lower household use of water than anywhere in Europe.  The problem is a failure to invest in fixing water infrastructure.  I hope this heatwave will be a wake-up call for the Government.  We must dramatically ramp up investment in water infrastructure.  Could we not ask the corporations to pay an extra few bob for the water they use?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200035#LL00300"><p>Is Ireland going to grind to a halt every time there is some snow or a heatwave?  Storm Emma left thousands without water and, during the hottest summer for decades, Irish Water has implemented a hosepipe ban and called on householders to conserve water by taking four-minute showers, using a cup when cleaning teeth and only using their washing machines when full or when necessary.  That is right.  We are in a difficult situation and people should think before they use water.  However, one thing is clear - this is not about a lack of water.  At a press conference last week John Douglas, the general secretary of the Mandate trade union, made the point that there are copious amounts of water in this country over the 52 weeks of the year.  The problem is the infrastructure.  It is a question of fixing pipes, investment in reservoirs, investment in dual water systems, building standards, retrofitting and house insulation.  All of these would make a huge difference in water conservation.  According to Emma Kennedy in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, &quot;No region in Ireland has insufficient water for supply&quot;.  Every day, Irish Water puts twice as much water into the system as is needed because more water is wasted through leaks than is used by all the households and even industry in Ireland.</p><p>Ireland's level of leakage is the highest in western Europe because its pipes have been neglected for decades.  Twelve years ago Dublin City Council said that the mains are so ancient that leaving them alone is not an option.  Unfortunately, they have practically have been left alone.  The pipes are now at breaking point.  The main problem with having such decrepit pipes is that they cannot tolerate cold snaps or long dry spells because when the ground shifts, they burst.  Irish Water agrees that the water infrastructure needs upgrading but a reference to leakage was noticeably absent from its recent statements.  It stated that more than 600 million litres of water are being used in Dublin but there was no acknowledgement that practically 300 million litres are being used in the true sense of the word as the other 300 million litres are being wasted, mainly by Irish Water.</p><p>Far more water is lost through network leakage than is used by households yet the finger is continuously pointed at householders.  The implication is that there is excessive use.  That is not true.  Irish people use considerably less water per head than the European average.  The latest first fix report shows that once households are notified about leaks in their homes their response is outstanding.  Irish Water has repaired 8% of the leaks identified while householders have repaired 36%, despite no financial incentives to do so.  Household leakage was cut by almost 40 million litres in two years.  The target was 11 million in 39 years.  Householders have not just met their leakage targets they have smashed them, which is more than Irish Water has done.  Irish Water is nowhere near meeting its target.  Between 2011 and 2021, it was supposed to reduce the network leakage from 205 million litres to 166 million litres.  Two thirds of the way through that period the network leakage is now higher than it was in the first instance, at 207 million litres.  Irish Water says that the answer is to spend &euro;1.3 billion pumping water 200 km across the country to Dublin.  We might have to do that in the future but, meanwhile, it has set itself a mains replacement target of just 1% per annum.  That means some pipes will not be touched for another 100 years.</p><p>Irish Water claims that reducing leakage will not be enough to safeguard Dublin's water supply.  However, Emma Kennedy's analysis shows that to be wrong.  If Irish Water did nothing more than meet its leakage targets there would be a large surplus of water in Dublin from 2021 to 2050.  When there is leakage of such huge volumes of expensive treated water, recovering even a small fraction is equivalent to an enormous new water source.  Leakage is treated as part of demand so if leakage is reduced, demand is reduced.  Irish Water says Dublin has only 2% spare capacity.  This figure is wrong.  Dublin's spare capacity is at least at 9% based on the latest full year data.  Irish Water has suddenly started to present spare capacity in a way that is neither the international norm nor the method used in its earlier reports, according to Emma Kennedy.</p><p>There are other points I wished to make but my main point is that householders conserve and are conscious of their water.  They have shown that historically.  They should continue to do that, and I will continue to think before I use.  That is the way we should approach it.  However, the Minister should not point the finger at householders or allow that conversation to begin.  The householders are doing their business and it is up to the Government and Irish Water to do their business and put the funding place.</p></speech>

Over the years there has been underinvestment; there is no point in saying otherwise.  I have heard people talking about how the climate has changed.  In 1976, we had about a month of fine weather.  It has not rained now for 19 days and we are short of water in a country that has plenty of water.  The reason is that we do not have enough reservoir space.  Similarly, if one does not have enough fodder for a longer winter one will not survive.  This is our problem.  It requires infrastructure but providing infrastructure, even with the best will in the world, takes three to five years.</p>  <p>  I listened to the talk about bringing water to Dublin.  People are forecasting everything.  I was involved with installing a pipe to a multinational in Dublin.  It was 1 m in size and takes 9 million gallons per day.  Who can forecast how the different companies will grow?  People who say there will be enough water if the leaks are fixed do not know the investment that might take place in the country.  Second, if one were to fix all the pipes in Dublin, and I have done this work, it would cause chaos.  Everybody would be jumping up and down saying that Dublin is at a standstill and businesses are losing billions.  It has to be done in a phased transitional way.  One cannot block every street or put diggers on every street.  It will take time.  That is the opinion of somebody who has worked on this.  I believe in meters, regardless of whether there is charging.  That is how one can know whether there are many leaks.</p>  <p>  The Minister should be collaborating with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Most cattle in the country are drinking chlorinated water these days.</p><p>Previously, they would go around the side of a drain and drink from it, or there was a pump.  We need initiatives such as sub-pumps, which would involve bringing a pipe out from the corner of a river, dropping pea shingles into it and then sending down a sub-pump to pump up the water.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should be working on initiatives like this under TAMS.  In fairness, it does operate a rain water harvesting scheme for slatted sheds.  What I am suggesting could be done.  It would not solve the problem for everyone but it would probably solve the problem for the 50% to 60% of farms close to rivers or streams.</p> <p> People talk about bringing water to Dublin.  This is not just about Dublin.  There are 66 plants in Leinster that are under pressure for water at the best of times.  We need to put in place a mega water storage facility.  That would resolve the issue.  One can have all the plants in the world one wants but without water storage facilities one is in trouble.  I recall that it was once proposed to put in a liner on a bog in Laois.  We need to do something similar to ensure we have back up for ten or 15 days.  We would also need to put a paddle into it to keep it fresh.  That is how to solve the problem.</p> <p> The group water schemes are doing their part in terms of conserving water.  They have decreased the number of leakages on their systems but the Minister needs to keep on them to make sure they are okay.</p> <p> Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about bringing water to Dublin from the Shannon.  In doing that, we will need to put in place a spur that can hit north, south, east and west, so that we can tap into it whenever there is a crisis.  The west will be serviced from Lough Corrib, Lough Conn and Lough Mask.  They will be interconnected and that is a good idea.  Group water schemes are working on putting in place a back-up well in case they run low.</p> <p> In a period of dry weather, we hear about climate change and so on.  We have had no rain for approximately 20 days and so it is not the end of the world.  Water levels in springs, lakes and rivers will drop during periods of dry weather.  Rain falls from the sky and then it goes down through the rocks and then it busts up.  That is the way it operates in most places.  Most of the year we are sound for water but we do not have sufficient storage capacity.  Whether or not we like it, storage costs money.  There has been no investment in this area for many years.  We now need to solve the problem and to invest for the next five, ten or 15 years in the construction of massive water storage facilities, which we will then have to chlorinate and keep fresh and all of this costs money.

If the current high pressure system, the easterly weather system and the absence of our traditional gulf stream continues we face two crises, the first of which is in the area of agriculture.  What is happening on the ground in agriculture is probably the immediate crisis.  There is no grass growth in the vast majority of the country.  Farmers are coming out of an incredibly harsh winter and facing into a perilous autumn when they may not have the necessary fodder stored to keep cattle through the winter.  Cereal farmers, spring barley growers and others have had a very tough few years.  This is a shocking crisis for those people, one that will affect their everyday lives.</p>  <p>  The second crisis is the possibility of our not being able to maintain conventional water supplies.  I understand that we have sufficient water for the coming weeks but if this current weather pattern continues we may face a very serious situation in the autumn in terms of water supply.  There are already people in north Dublin whose water has been cut off owing to reduced water levels and thus low pressure such that water cannot be pumped to their houses.  It is hoped this development will not occur on a widespread basis.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister's figures with interest, including that nine of the treatment plants are in critical drought conditions and 50 are in severe drought conditions.  I presume that if this weather continues for another two or three weeks that drought will spread to the entire system.  As the Minister said, our rivers are at an historic low.  I saw a photograph of the Shannon yesterday.  It appears to be running at such incredibly low levels there is no water running the ESB system.</p>  <p>  We have a crisis.  It is unfortunate that this is the last sitting day of this session and we will not be able to meet to do anything further about it.  The Minister has our support to do what is necessary for conservation.  I was encouraged when the hosepipe ban was implemented.  I understand that prior to the hosepipe ban we were operating at 650 mega litres a day in Dublin and that we are now operating at 570 mega litres.  Temperatures have also dropped which would indicate that the higher figure was due somewhat to the very high temperatures but some of it as due to public response.  We need to work together to manage this crisis and then look to the future and in terms of how we are going to cope with the climate change world.</p></speech>

The conservation message is hitting home and it needs to be reinforced.  It is important that we do that.  There are particular sectors that we will have to be careful about in terms of water supply.  The availability of drinking water is the priority, followed by supply for hospitals, industry and farmers.</p>  <p>  We have experienced summers when the opposite has been the case, including a huge downpour that caused dreadful flooding.  Increased rather than decreased rainfall is more typical of our summers.  This fine weather is welcome but it has shown that we need to plan for climate change in the longer term.</p>  <p>  During the winter we had the fodder shortage crisis and there is now also a summer fodder shortage crisis.  We are also experiencing huge expansion in the national herd, for which there are opportunities in China but all of these crises should be sending us a message as well.  I am sure the farming sector is paying some attention to that crisis.</p>  <p>  I echo that conservation is the priority.  I urge people to conserve water because in overusing they might be denying their neighbour a supply.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200036#MM00600"><p>I thank all Deputies who spoke on this issue for echoing the call for conservation because it is important to make that call.  I do not propose to speak with my political hat on.  Although one or two Deputies did raise political issues, I am coming at this very much from the point of view of my responsibility for co-ordinating crises and emergency events of the type we have experienced from time to time.  In the past 12 months, we have had two national red weather events and we are now into an event that is unprecedented because demand on our water system has changed considerably in the past 40 years since we last experienced a comparable weather event in terms of a prolonged drought.  The crisis is not over.  In fact, it is far from being over.  Although rain is expected to fall in some parts of the country over the weekend there will be nowhere near enough rainfall to replenish our ground water, our rivers, our reservoirs and our lakes.  We need at least three weeks of heavy rainfall to reverse the downward trajectory in our out stocks.</p>  <p>  The core of the problem is the weather.  There is a core supply problem in terms of our raw water supplies before it is treated or passed into the system.  Deputy Paul Murphy likes to believe in conspiracy theories around privatisation.  The Government does not control the weather.  We cannot foresee what is going to happen in August but we can foresee what will happen in the next ten to 15 days and in this regard we foresee no alleviation in terms of significant rainfall.  We have to be resilient and continue with water conservation.  As I said, water levels are at an all time low, having fallen from a significant high in terms of the snowfall during Storm Emma.  Funding is in place and investment is happening in the longer term.  Leakage is being addressed.  Additional crews are being brought in to work on pipes in different parts of the country.  Good work is being done with Irish Water and the local authorities to get those crews in to fix leakages.</p>  <p>  In terms of overall leakage and the failures that we have in our system, it took decades for that to be corrected in other jurisdictions like London, and it still has a 20% leakage problem.</p><p>I return to the initial fact: this is about raw water supplies continuing to run to low levels we have not seen previously in some parts of the country.  The possibility of night-time restrictions is now very much in the fore.  That would be due to a reduction in pressure.  A decision on that in respect of the greater Dublin area will be made very shortly.  As we look to the autumn and to the point Deputy Eamon Ryan was making, we believe we will be able to manage the supply and demand equilibrium between now and the end of August but if we do not see significant rainfall in that period we run the risk of having daytime restrictions in our water services in September and into October.  Other emergency measures are being considered at the moment.  I will keep them under review over the course of next week based on conversations I had at the national emergency co-ordination centre yesterday.</p> <p> I thank people for their efforts and their resilience to date.  As another Deputy said, they need to do the business and they are very much doing the business.  When the hosepipe ban came into place in the greater Dublin area, demand fell by at least 40 Ml to 50 Ml over that period.  We are still monitoring the effect of the national hosepipe ban, which is a bit more difficult to monitor.  We will have figures on that very shortly, which will allow us to see if those conservation efforts are being replicated across the country - I am sure they are.</p> <p> As things get worse - they will get worse - I ask Members to refrain from blaming Irish Water for the legacy problems the country has.  It is managing the situation better than anyone else could to date, as I have seen in its control centre.  We now have information, technology and oversight that we would never had if 31 or 34 local authorities were trying to manage that between themselves.  Irish Water did not break the pipes or underinvest over the decades.  It inherited the system and it is fixing it.  Its workers are working overtime, day and night.  They did so through storms Ophelia and Emma, and they are doing it again through this emergency.</p> <p> I am proud of everyone's effort to date, but I wish to single out the Defence Forces and in particular the Air Corps.  Over 100 different water drops have been conducted in different parts of the country in counties Laois and Wicklow.  When the call came from our neighbours in Northern Ireland, it was able to come to their assistance as well.  I am proud that it has been able to give that assistance.  In the statement I provided to Members, I did not get to make reference to the environmental and serious ecological concerns we have with rivers running so low for our fish in terms of a lack of oxygen but also when we come into the spawning season.  Conversely if we see heavy rain in August, it will run a huge amount of sediment and debris that has been building up over the land in recent weeks including those burnt parts of land, which also will have an environmental impact on our inland fisheries.  As well as our firefighting, water safety and the water conservation efforts, we are concerned about the environmental impact we are already seeing in some parts of the country and conversely we could see even when rainfall comes.</p> <p> I thank Members for making the time available for this debate.  I ask them to use their social media networks to reinforce the conservation message and to remind people that even though they may see some rain in coming weeks, it will not be enough to replenish supplies in the coming months.</p></speech>

I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Business Committee for facilitating this debate.  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Kelly, in particular, and other Members of the House who contributed constructively to the legislation not too long ago.</p>  <p>  I am keen to complete consideration of this short but important Bill this afternoon in order that the Revenue Commissioners may make all necessary arrangements for issuing licences to those who have been granted the relevant court certificate as soon as possible.  The House will recall that Deputy Kelly introduced this Bill as a Private Members' Bill and it received broad support from all sides.  Its principal purpose is to create a new retail licence to allow craft breweries and distilleries, many of which have sprung up in recent years, to sell intoxicating liquor manufactured on the premises to tourists and visitors who have participated in a guided tour of their facilities.  These already hold a brewer&rsquo;s or distiller&rsquo;s excise licence, or a similar manufacturer&rsquo;s licence, which authorises the licenceholder to manufacture intoxicating liquor on the premises.</p>  <p>  We have seen a marked increase in the number of craft breweries and distilleries in recent years and this welcome trend is set to continue.  The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that there are about 165 such licences at present.  This is a dynamic and entrepreneurial sector with real growth potential.  The Government is fully committed to promoting regional and local development and, in that context, to fully support the job-creation potential of artisan food production and local tourism initiatives.  The Bill will make a very positive contribution to the achievement of this goal.</p>  <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 1 is to address a difficulty arising from the wording of the Opposition amendment to section 1(1)(b) that was carried on Report Stage last week.  The background is as follows.  The Bill originally provided for the granting of a retail licence to craft breweries and distilleries that would permit them to sell intoxicating liquor produced on their premises to tourists and visitors who had participated in a guided tour of the premises.  Both on-sales and off-sales would be permitted.  In all cases, sales would be restricted to intoxicating liquor produced on the premises and would only be sold to those who had participated in a guided tour of the brewery or distillery concerned.</p>  <p>  During Committee discussions, Opposition Deputies suggested that licensees should also be permitted to engage in off-sales to persons other than those who had participated in a guided tour of the premises and a Report Stage amendment to that effect was subsequently carried here recently.  This amendment inserted the words &ldquo;for consumption on the premises&rdquo; in section 1(1)(b).  The intention was to restrict the &ldquo;guided tour&rdquo; requirement attaching to the licence and not apply it in the case of off-sales to those who had not participated in a guided tour of the premises.</p>  <p>  While the revised wording appeared to achieve the desired objective of dropping the guided tour requirement in the case of off-sales, the Office of the Attorney General has identified a difficulty arising from the revised text of section 1(1)(b).</p>  <p>  A literal interpretation of the revised text suggests that a craft brewery or distillery intending to apply for an off-licence, which may be obtained from the District Court, must also satisfy the court that a mechanism is in place that permits sales for consumption on the premises to those who have completed a guided tour of the premises.  Clearly, that was not the intention of those who proposed the amendment since it would create an insuperable obstacle to applicants for off-licences.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the words &ldquo;for consumption on the premises&rdquo; be removed from section 1(1)(b) and that is the purposes of this amendment.  Removal of these words will not restrict the possibility of off-sales to those who have not participated in a guided tour of the premises because section 1(6)(c) now makes specific provision for such sales.</p>  <p>  My purpose in tabling this amendment is not to frustrate the objective of the Opposition amendment to permit off-sales to those who have not participated in a guided tour, but rather to remove a potential obstacle to the operation of the licensing mechanism.  I thank Deputy Kelly, in particular, and other Members who may have been involved in assisting the passage in recent days.</p><p>To remove any confusion that may have arisen, I want to clarify that an applicant to the District Court for a certificate under section 1(1) must be in a position to satisfy the District Court that a guided tour of the premises will be available to those wishing to participate in such a tour even if the applicant&rsquo;s intention is to engage mainly in off-sales to those who have not participated in such a tour.  Otherwise, the principal justification and purpose of the Bill would no longer be satisfied.  In this context, I draw attention to the broad margin of flexibility provided by the definition of &ldquo;guided tour&rdquo; in section 1(11).  A tour must include an explanation of or information on the process whereby the intoxicating liquor is manufactured but it does not necessarily require any entry to parts of the premises that may present risks to the health and safety of Individuals.  Moreover, the guided tour may be led by a guide or in some circumstances may be self-guided.</p> <p> I refer to the second amendment.  Section 1(6) of the Bill, as amended on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, would permit off-sales to those who have not participated in a guided tour of the premises between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. on every day of the year except Christmas Day.  This is in conflict with the licensing hours applicable to all other off-licences, including specialist off-licences and mixed trading premises.  Under existing law, public houses and off-licences are not permitted to sell intoxicating liquor before 12.30 p.m. on Sundays or St Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  The Attorney General's office has again advised that allowing craft breweries and distilleries to engage in off-sales to those who have not participated in a guided tour of the premises before 12.30 p.m. on Sundays and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day under this legislation would give rise to an anomaly and create a risk of legal challenge on the basis that it favours craft breweries and distilleries over other categories of off-licence.  For this reason, I have tabled an amendment to section 1(6)(c) to prohibit off-sales in the absence of a guided tour before 12.30 p.m. on Sundays and St Patrick&rsquo;s Day.  Off-sales to those who have participated in a guided tour of the premises will continue to be permitted from 10 a.m.</p> <p> I am happy to say that both amendments were accepted by the Seanad.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister has brought certain clarity to the issue, which I did not feel was there in the Seanad debate.  A couple of days ago this House discussed changing the scenario where everybody had to do a guided tour and the ridiculous scenario where people would call in for a six-pack and have to go again and again.  The Minister has clarified that and it is important.  The wording in the Act could be interpreted one way or another.  The work put in by Mr. Seamus Carroll and the team in the Department has been helpful in getting us to this point.  The tour is only there if somebody asks for it.  A brewery has to provide the possibility of a tour and it is not a requirement for somebody who wants to buy a six-pack or whatever.  It is great and I am glad that the craft brewers can raise a toast to the divestment of fossil fuels and the great co-operation in the House on this final day.</p></speech>

I was about to start last night when we adjourned.</p>  <p>  I share Deputy Willie O'Dea's concerns about bogus self-employment.  I think everybody else in the House does too.  This Bill is not an appropriate vehicle for the amendment that has been tabled on Report Stage.  The amendment would have such an impact and is so detailed and worthy that it should be subject to proper and thorough scrutiny to allow the House and all stakeholders who are at risk of being adversely or positively impacted the opportunity to consider the full implications of what is being proposed.  </p>  <p>  Deputy O'Dea stated a fortnight ago that I did not draw sufficient attention on Committee Stage to how problematic the amendments were to the penalisation provisions.  I beg to differ because if one checks the Official Report, one will see I drew attention to them at that stage.  We fixed those last night and I am genuinely grateful.  None of us was aware that such a detailed amendment would be tabled on Report Stage.  I accept that the amendment is well intentioned.  I am particularly concerned about some of its consequences.  The amendment could fundamentally change many aspects of employment law and social welfare and revenue law without any consideration of the negative consequences for employees, employers or even consumers.  I am worried that the Bill, which we have all worked on for an awfully long time, which we all want passed and which has gone through a comprehensive drafting and scrutiny process, could have inserted into it a new provision that is not in line with the purpose of the Bill but would have far-reaching and unintended consequences.  The risk is not just that we would have bad law but that it would not meet the objectives of the Bill and would have adverse impacts on other legal codes that are very much relied upon particularly by employees.  </p>  <p>  The Bill has been more than three years in the making.  It has been through an extensive process of consultation and scrutiny prior to, and during, its consideration in the Oireachtas, including a public consultation carried out by the University of Limerick study and detailed discussions with IBEC and ICTU over six months or more which helped me focus on the drafts and the heads of the Bill which have been subject to detailed analysis and debate since then.  It has gone through a regulatory impact analysis, RIA, which was conducted and submitted to Government along with the drafts of the heads of the Bill.  The RIA was published at the same time as the heads of the Bill so everybody could have a look at it.  The draft heads were referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and the office, as normal, worked closely with the Attorney General, the advisory council and my officials in that process.  </p>  <p>  The heads of the Bill were also referred to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for pre-legislative scrutiny and, in May 2017, the Minister of State with responsibility for employment and small business addressed the joint committee on the draft Government legislation during an appearance before that committee for pre-legislative scrutiny on the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 which was offered to us by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Subsequently, Department officials briefed the joint committee on the draft legislation in June 2017.  The Bill was published in December 2017, completed Second Stage in February and Committee Stage in May.</p><p>That is only a brief overview of the process and scrutiny that this Bill has undergone.</p> <p> It is only right that the Bill should be subject to this comprehensive scrutiny but my difficulty is that the amendment has not been subjected to any scrutiny, consultation or debate with the broad range of stakeholders who are likely to be affected if it is carried, with the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection or with the Members of this House.</p></speech>

The Minister of State should imagine getting a letter last week saying that it was his last day on the council housing list and that, after ten years, he was being removed for being a few hundred euro over the limit.  That is happening and it is an absolute scandal.  I will give an example.  The following was stated in a letter received by one of my constituents this week, "Having assessed your income details provided I regret to inform you that you are no longer eligible to be considered for social housing support by Fingal County Council as your income exceeds the limits set out in the council's allocation scheme for social housing support."  This woman has been on the housing list for 12 years.  The family has six children.  My calculation is that they are &euro;1,662 over the income limit for a family of that size, which is &euro;40,250.  Of their income, which is assessed to be over the limit, &euro;3,300 is a family income supplement, FIS, payment which recognises that this family does not have enough money to live on yet the State is also saying that it is no longer eligible to be considered for social housing.  That is just mad.  How could that be?  I know the Minister of State would not want to stand over this kind of policy yet he must fix it.</p>  <p>  As it stands, the income threshold level for which an applicant may qualify for social housing in Fingal is set at &euro;35,000 per annum, for a single person.  Beyond this, depending on family sizes, the threshold varies.  For an average family of two adults and two children, however, the level sits at &euro;38,500 per annum.  In cases where a household contains three adults and four children, the threshold stands at its highest, &euro;42,000.  These limits were established in 2011 and have not been reviewed by the Government since, or at least they have not changed . The income threshold as it stands is simply too low and has led to more problems being created than solved.</p>  <p>  Many families in Fingal who have been on the housing list for in excess of seven years now find themselves being removed from that same list, due to being a couple of hundred euro over the existing threshold.  This is simply an unacceptable situation which is causing great distress for families who have been patiently waiting to be offered housing for many years.  They are waiting to get an offer and they are being taken off the list.</p>  <p>  A situation whereby a person may have to refuse a promotion in order to ensure that they do not rise slightly above the threshold is in complete contrast to the kind of employment innovation that the Government should be promoting, which I know the Minister of State is seriously interested in facilitating.  My Labour Party colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, recently urged the Minister of State to highlight the Government's proposals regarding the existing thresholds.  The Minister of State said that the Government intended to conduct a review of the thresholds which should have been made available by mid-2018 yet no such review has been published.</p>  <p>  There appears to be no sense of urgency regarding this matter, despite the fact that many families have reached a point of utter desperation and fear becoming homeless.  The Government continues to delay reviewing the existing thresholds, meanwhile housing prices rose by 12% in the past year.  This has led to a situation whereby households may be slightly over the existing thresholds but are nowhere near the income levels required to actually purchase homes.  This situation has reached crisis point.  The Government's lack of urgency and the total absence of a strategy is simply unacceptable.  Ultimately, a complete review of and subsequent increase in the income limits for qualification for social housing is urgently required.  As matters stand, the limits are simply too low and have resulted in families being removed from housing lists.  The level of distress this causes is shocking and none of us wants it to happen.  We know intuitively that this is wrong and that it must be changed.</p>  <p>  We simply cannot have situations where low income earners are refusing promotions in order to ensure that they remain on the housing list.  Increasing house prices have made it impossible for many families to purchase homes, meanwhile there is no real affordable housing scheme in place.  This situation is simply unsustainable and a complete review - alongside an increase in the income limits - must be carried out immediately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200039#PP01700"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position.  On 1 April 2011, the Social Housing Assessment Regulations introduced a new standard procedure for assessing applicants for social housing in every housing authority.  The regulations include maximum net income limits for each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard household means policy.  Before the new system was put in place, there was considerable inconsistency in the approach taken by various local authorities.  This was neither efficient nor fair and I imagine that is why the former Minister of State in this role, Deputy Penrose, made the change because it was not fair across the board and there were discrepancies in it.</p>  <p>  The income bands, and the authority area assigned to each band, were based on an assessment of income needed to provide for a household's basic need plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation around the country.  As a result, higher limits generally apply in the larger urban areas compared with other areas.  This is the case in the Fingal County Council area, which has an income threshold of &euro;35,000 for a single adult household.  The &euro;35,000 limit would correspond to a gross salary of more than &euro;48,000 - which is some 30% above the average industrial wage.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.  I agree with the Deputy that people should not be refusing jobs and that these limits should not be a deterrent to improving career or employment prospects.  That is why the blanket increase was introduced.</p>  <p>  Under the household means policy, which applies in all housing authority areas, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, pay-related social insurance, PRSI, and the universal social charge.  Most payments received from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are assessable.  The policy provides for a range of income disregards and housing authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.  I am not familiar with the individual case the Deputy outlined but I will check to see is there any scope there.  FIS may not be a permanent payment for the family, it depends on how long they have had it.  In general, it is not often a permanent payment.  Perhaps it could be considered on appeal as a temporary or once-off income.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support.  I am conscious that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is in the House and that she has also been raising this issue.  For the past two years, much of the funding and resources available were directed towards social housing and the emergency accommodation for people who are homeless.  We are trying to move this approach into the area of affordable housing and to concentrate efforts there also.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports has commenced.  The Housing Agency is carrying out the detailed statistical work on behalf of the Department and I expect the results of this review to be available for publication later in the summer.  I share the Deputy's frustration because I would like to have had this review completed before now.  The matter has been raised by several Members, including Deputies Brendan Ryan and Br&iacute;d Smith and others.  I committed to having this done.  We should have that report with us before the end of the summer.  One matter that will be examined as part of the review is the possibility of structuring social housing support in a way that improves the overall efficiency and equity of the system and does not discourage people from improving their circumstances when it comes to employment or career prospects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1301" speakername="Brendan  Ryan" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200040#QQ00100"><p>Families in my constituency have been on the list for ten years and have now been removed for being a few hundred euro over the limit.  Why is that?  In one case, a mother returned to part-time work to help the family meet the increased rent of &euro;1,100 a month.  On one level, as the family is under pressure for rent the mother went back to work but then the family becomes ineligible for social housing.  They have been told they have been removed from the list but they have not been told how much they are over the limit, making appealing the decision even more difficult.  By their own calculations they are no more than a few hundred euro over the very modest limits and those limits were set in 2011.</p>  <p>  Perversely, people who found themselves threatened by homelessness in recent times have managed to be on the housing assistance payment, HAP.  People who may have been on the list at the same time as others have now gone into HAP and are in the system for ever.  Due to the inefficiency of the system and the lack of housing and housing offers, that family has reached a point 12 years on where their income has increased slightly and now they are off the list.  If they had been accepted onto HAP, and been lucky enough to get HAP, they would still be in the system.  It is a case of either being under a limit and getting everything or being over a limit and getting nothing.  We have to restructure that.</p>  <p>  We need to increase the base levels and make them adequate for the current market.  The cap of 2.5% per child up to four children, with a maximum of 10%, needs to be removed.  If a family has six or eight kids, they need to get the benefit of that 2.5% of base level per child.  We talked about FIS already and I refer to the list in item No. 7 on page 3 in respect of incomes which are not assessable.  One thing the Minster of State can do straight away is to make FIS non-assessable.  That is a no-brainer. </p>  <p>  There needs to be a complete review of social housing eligibility because we are probably the only country in Europe which has assessment of income as the model.  Many countries do not.  We need to assess people's ability to provide housing for themselves rather than have an income point that decides if someone is either in or out.  That is completely wrong.  On clarifying what we need to do, while we are waiting for the review, the Minister of State needs to issue a directive to all local authorities that nobody should be taken off the list while the review is continuing.  That is a simple measure that can be done.</p></speech>

I will bring them back to our officials when the review comes back from the agency and we will look at what is assessable or not.  He has raised a few issues that are worth looking at.  I am satisfied that the current income limits and the current scheme are generally fair and equitable.  I think people will agree that it is across the board and that it deals with most cases.  I accept that in some cases, it leaves households outside the income brackets but generally, it does identify those households unable to provide accommodation from their own resources.  The review is about seeing whether the limits need to be changed.  It also gives us a timely way to look at all of the different income limits and income sources that are assessable.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the challenges faced by households in meeting their housing costs.  It is the subject to debate here week in and week out for the past couple of years.  Dealing with this is the Government's number one priority.  We accept that the supply of housing will help all of this but it also is quite clear that the property and employment markets have changed dramatically over the last couple of years.  The limits were set in 2011 and we recognise the importance of having them reviewed to reflect that reality as well.  We have acted to support those households a little above the income eligibility thresholds for social housing supports.  </p>  <p>  In February this year, a new loan offering known as the Rebuilding Ireland home loan was launched.  The new fixed interest rate loan will help middle-income households, earning up to &euro;50,000 as a single person or &euro;75,000 as a couple, to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  Over 50% of the applicants for that are qualifying and are being approved for a loan to help them get a house.  My colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has also recently placed a new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  My Department is working with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites that would see a significant quantity of affordable homes being delivered on local authority owned land.  We have been working with them for the past year to bring forward the plans on public lands to be able to deliver affordable houses as well.  It all beginning to align and the focus in this part - now that we have got the social housing system changed - is to move on to adapt affordable housing and looking at the income limits. </p></speech>

I declare my interest in this subject as Bawnboy is my home village.  I do not live there any more but that was where I was born and reared and I still have strong family connections there.  In 2013 Bawnboy Garda station was one of a number of small rural stations closed in Cavan-Monaghan and throughout the country.  Over the years, the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Bawnboy station gave a great policing service to the local community.  There was, and still is, a great community spirit in that area and the work of the Garda was always very strongly supported by the local community.</p>  <p>  As the Minister is aware, that area is part of the Border region.  If one goes west of Belturbet and Ballyconnell to Bawnboy, Corlough, Swanlinbar, Glangevlin, Dowra and Blacklion, it is a large rural area all along the Border.  As we know and as we discussed in this House previously, there are particular policing demands on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Border area.  I was pleased that the Minister some time ago announced that six Garda stations would reopen as a result of the commitment given in the programme for Government.  Bawnboy Garda station is in good order and is a relatively new building and I am anxious that it should be reopened and Garda personnel assigned to it at an early date.  </p>  <p>  One of the most striking comments I heard came from the last Garda who served in Bawnboy station, Garda Imelda Gallagher.  She stated at her retirement function that she regretted the closure of small rural Garda stations.  One sentence she uttered that night has stuck with me.  She said that she got to know the local people and the people got to know the local garda on the ground.  No means of communications can ever equal that knowledge between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the members of the public.  I implore the Minister to ask the Garda authorities to have this station reopened as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  He is well aware, and we discussed this previously in this House, of the anxieties and concerns in Border communities in respect of crime levels.  We know that not all of the criminality emanates from outside of our jurisdiction and plenty of it is from people residing here.  The added dimension to criminality in the Border area, however, is that some of the culprits, criminals and thugs can get away very quickly out of our jurisdiction when they commit a crime along that corridor, as they can elsewhere along the Border as well.  I emphasise again the particular additional policing demands on the Garda in the Border region.  We need the station reopened in Bawnboy and we need garda&iacute; assigned to it as soon as possible.  I hope the Minster will convey to the Garda Commissioner and the senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the need for this station to be reopened quickly.  From a layperson's point of view, the Garda station is modern, in good condition and it would cost very little to have it reopened.  </p></speech>

He has raised it with me on a number of occasions.  The Deputy will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The OPW has the responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  This includes identifying and progressing any necessary remedial or refurbishment works required at individual stations.  As Minister, I do not have a direct role in these matters.  The Programme for a Partnership Government, however, commits to a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner's final report, which is available on the Department of Justice and Equality's website, recommends that Bawnboy Garda station be reopened, along with stations in Ballinspittle, County Cork, Donard, County Wicklow, Leighlinbridge, County Carlow, Rush in north County Dublin and Stepaside in south County Dublin.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a brief of requirements was provided to the OPW in respect of the reopening of these stations, including Bawnboy Garda station. </p><p>The Garda authorities requested the OPW to undertake technical surveys to determine the works required to enable the stations to reopen and the estimated costings involved.  I am further informed that this key stage is complete.  The OPW has conducted the necessary technical surveys of all stations involved and has written to the Commissioner advising him of the works involved accordingly.  I understand that based on those reports, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the OPW continue to liaise closely to progress the pilot reopening.  </p> <p> I understand that at this stage it is not possible to provide a detailed timeframe for reopening of the station concerned, which is dependent on a number of factors, including, for example, the extent of the required refurbishment, based on current building regulations. There are also agreed standards and specifications for Garda cell areas and custody suites which would have to be incorporated into the refurbishment.  The works required vary across the stations, including at Bawnboy.  After the specification has been agreed, the works will commence once the appropriate procurement process has been finalised.  I assure the Deputy that the OPW and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to work closely to progress the pilot project.  My officials are engaging with them on an ongoing basis, and I am keen that this issue is resolved at the earliest opportunity, having regard to the strong representations made to me by the Deputy.</p></speech>

It would be a great message for rural communities if a Garda station was to open up again in a small village.  There has been a serious increase in crime levels and criminality in rural areas, including that part of west Cavan and, therefore, a message from the Minister that a Garda station will open shortly would be positive and would be well received.</p>  <p>  I did not think, after 1998, that I would be talking about Border crossings in this House again, but unfortunately it is very much a part of the political narrative again, with Brexit on the way.  In the west Cavan area there are a huge number of Border crossings.  We know the implications of Brexit and the difficulties that may arise for communities on both sides of the Border.  Garda&iacute; with local knowledge will be important to ensure that the best service continues to be provided to the public.  I again ask the Minister to ask that the Garda authorities to speed up the reopening of this station.  I appreciate his assistance to date in this matter.</p></speech>

I look forward to ensuring that progress on the Garda workforce is reported on a regular basis.  The stated aim of the Government is to ensure that we have 21,000 Garda personnel by 2021, and we are moving progressively towards that objective.  In terms of numbers in the Border area, Bawnboy Garda station will be reopened on a pilot basis.  The timeframe for the reopening of Bawnboy, as with the other five stations, is dependent on a number of factors, but I am keen to ensure these factors are dealt with efficiently and speedily.  I confirm to the Deputy that there has been considerable progress in the assessment and agreement on the building works required in respect of Bawnboy.  I am not at this stage able to provide a definitive timeframe, but I am happy to keep him informed over the summer months while the House is not sitting.  I can confirm that the detailed work on this issue is very much ongoing.  The OPW has completed the technical surveys based on the briefing requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is an important step.  It has written to the Garda Commissioner outlining the works involved, and based on those reports, the Garda and the OPW are working steadily to ensure the reopening of the stations can take place as soon as possible.</p></speech>

He did so because it is a time sensitive issue.  With regard to health advice on cataract care, the HSE's website states:</p><blockquote>[A] cataract will continue to develop, and the only way to restore vision is by having surgery to remove the cataract.  Cataract surgery is one of the most common and quickest forms of surgery.  </blockquote><p>According to the Association of Optometrists Ireland, at the end of 2017 some 40,000 people were on the outpatient list waiting for that surgery.  Its statistics show that the problem has deteriorated since; the number of people on the waiting list has increased by 21%.  The largest proportion of the waiting list for eye surgery relates to cataracts, with 8,500 people waiting for surgery at the end of 2017, including some who have been waiting for up to four years in certain parts of the country.  </p><p>I want to talk about a man in my area.  He is housed by the council in a nice apartment, but he is a poor man.  He lives on the carer's allowance.  His wife has MS, and he is her carer.  She is on disability allowance.  Patrick Foley is 42 and is the carer for his wife, Carmel.  He has been on the waiting list for cataract surgery for three years now.  He is suffering from blinding headaches while waiting for this surgery and he is starting to go blind.  His eyesight has started to deteriorate more rapidly recently, and his GP has written several referral letters to the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital.  He was advised to look at the cross-Border healthcare scheme.  To do this he needs to find someone to care for his wife.  His eyesight is so bad that he will do anything to get surgery.  He does not have the financial means to save up or bring the money forward or to go to a credit union for a loan.  My office has continually asked the HSE to make an exception in this case, where this man cannot get the funding upfront.  I have asked that an allowance be made in these circumstances and the HSE's answer has been &quot;No&quot;.  However, considering that this man is a carer and has been on the list for some time, and the fact that he may go blind and that his wife may be taken into care, the State is cutting off its nose to spite its face by not paying upfront for Patrick to have this cross-Border treatment, or, preferably, to have the surgery carried out here. </p><p>People who can afford to pay wait for three months.  People like Patrick have to wait for three years.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection told Patrick that the emergency needs payment would not cover him when the responsibility lies with another Department, which in this case is the Department of Health.  I wrote to the HSE to highlight the urgency of this case, but to date I have received no reply.  He is going to go blind unnecessarily, and is suffering terribly in the meantime.  This is happening as a result of our failed health system.  If Patrick had money he would be sorted out, but because he is poor and does not have the money, he is suffering unnecessarily and will go blind.  That is why we needed to bring this matter to the urgent attention of the Minister of State.  His needs have to be met.  Judging by the state of our home help care, I do not believe the needs of his wife will be met urgently.  </p><p>It is startling that the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, has been pushing hard for the State to invest more money in this area.  Some additional funding was provided this year to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, but it does not cater for people who cannot pay upfront.  I am quite sure that the case of Patrick Foley is not an isolated one.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has come across Patrick - she is a local Deputy in his constituency - but I have witnessed how rapidly his eyesight is disappearing and how desperately his life his changing.  We need to do something.  We must find a way for some Department to pay for the surgery he needs upfront to allow him to live his life with full eyesight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200041#RR00600"><p>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and I thank the Deputy for raising it.  Improving waiting times for hospital procedures is a key commitment in the programme for Government and a number of waiting list initiatives are currently under way to improve access this year.  In particular, I refer to the inpatient and day case action plan which was launched in April 2018, and the allocation of &euro;50 million to the NTPF in budget 2018 to secure treatment for patients and reduce waiting times.  The action plan targets a reduction in the waiting list for inpatient and day case treatment to less than 70,000 by the end of 2018.  Under the plan, the HSE will deliver 1.14 million hospital procedures.</p><p>The NTPF will deliver additionality to the health system with the provision of 22,000 inpatient day case treatments, including 5,000 cataract procedures and 1,200 tonsillectomies.  The action plan has been developed to ensure an appropriate balance between high-volume activities and offering treatment to complex long-waiting patients, as well as maximising the number of patients treated in both public and private capacities.  </p> <p> Over the past year the Department of Health has worked with the HSE and the NTPF to identify sustainable initiatives to improve waiting times.  Last year, funding was allocated to provide additional capacity at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, which has augmented capacity to increase clinics focused on paediatric and adult ear, nose and throat, ENT, procedures.  The NTPF funding has also allowed the hospital's cataract theatre to be operational three days per week.  The impact of these initiatives is clear.  To date this year, the hospital has seen significant reductions in waiting lists for cataracts and waiting times reduced to six months.  It is expected that the hospital and the NTPF will continue to work together to maintain and even improve on these waiting times.  Overall, the inpatient and day case waiting lists for the end of June show that waiting times at the hospital have fallen by almost one quarter in the past year.</p> <p> The Children's Hospital Group is also working with Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital to determine the feasibility of the hospital providing additional services across both outpatient and surgical services over the next year in order to reduce waiting times for children.  </p> <p> The Minister for Health has long said that the outpatient waiting list is a challenge which must be addressed.  The HSE is working with the NTPF and the Department to finalise a joint plan focused on improving overall use of resources to tackle long patient waiting times and ensure timely access to treatment care for patients.  The Minister hopes to publish this plan shortly.  As part of this process, the NTPF and the HSE are currently reviewing proposals from hospitals for outpatient initiatives.  I am aware that the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital is developing a proposal to address the new patients' ENT outpatient department waiting list.  The Minister encourages all hospitals to submit proposals as soon as possible.  </p> <p> I will deal with some of the issues that were raised by Deputy Smith in my supplementary remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200042#SS00200"><p>I will just reiterate that the HSE website states: "Cataract surgery is one of the most common and quickest forms of surgery".  It also says that this surgery will help to save sight.  The NCBI has said that waiting lists are out of control.  That is much more shocking when we consider that 75% of sight loss is avoidable.  That organisation has called on the Minister for Health to publish the implementation of the primary eye case services report, which was expected in the summer of 2015 and still has not been published.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the Minister of State will not know the detail of the individual case I have brought before her, but with all due respect, nothing in her answer shows that any consideration is given to those who cannot afford to pay up front for the NTPF.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will not pay it and the HSE will not answer.  Meanwhile this man, who is a carer for his wife, is going blind.  If I have one example of this, a man in the Minister of State's constituency, there must be dozens of others.</p>  <p>  The NCBI and Dr. David Keegan, a consultant ophthalmic surgeon, have been campaigning for this national vision strategy for the past six years.  Dr. Keegan has warned us that we have a national scandal on our hands.  Medics have also warned that the long waiting lists are particularly harsh on patients whose deterioration in sight could be reversed.  That is the case for Mr. Patrick Foley.  His problem is that he is poor.  He does not have the money to pay for the surgery up front, and no matter what Department we turn to, everybody is ignoring him as though he was not a human being, not to mention his wife, whom he looks after.  This is shocking in the 21st century and the fastest-growing economy in Europe.  I recognise that the NTPF is trying to deal with the backlog, but there are some people who fall through the cracks.  They are the people who are the most vulnerable, the weakest and the least represented.  I am asking the Minister of State to intervene on behalf of her constituent, Patrick Foley, and ensure that he is looked after by the NTPF, or preferably gets the eye surgery he needs in this State before the man goes blind.  </p></speech>

Such collaboration can only have a real effect on waiting lists, and, ultimately, benefit all the patients that are receiving treatment.  However, if the Deputy will give me the details of the particular case she has raised, I will certainly bring them to the attention of the Minister and see what can be done.</p>  <p>  Some 37,863 people attended the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital according to the outpatient attendance list.  Out of that, 3,494 patients did not show up for appointments.  That shows how difficult it sometimes is to reach patients and get them in for appointments.  That is a clear indication that we do have high numbers, and nobody is disagreeing with the Deputy on that.  I will now read a note I was handed in the past few minutes.  Last year, there were 34 patients in the hospital who had been waiting between 24 and 36 months.  That number is down to five this year.  Those are the latest figures.  Last year, 290 patients had been waiting between 18 and 24 months and that figure has decreased to nine.  </p>  <p>  I will bring all of the Deputy's concerns back to the Minister.  I assure her that representing the same constituency, I, like her, am very concerned about the number of people who come to our clinics and have difficulty in having cataracts removed.  It is surgery that is now regarded as a much more simple procedure than it was in the past.  I will certainly bring the Deputy's concerns, which I have written down, to the attention of the Minister.  Again, I ask her to forward this man's details to me.  I did not get his second name.</p></speech>

I have made numerous attempts to table questions, and they have been refused.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle again for accepting this Topical Issue matter.  I have submitted this matter because I was disturbed when I found out that large volumes of coal supplying the largest power plant in the State, Moneypoint power station, are coming from the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in Colombia.  This mine is infamous for the destruction of the environment, forcible displacement of indigenous people and Afro-Colombians living in the area and workers' rights abuses.  During the past 32 years, more than 20,000 Afro-Colombian and indigenous people have been forced from their traditional homes to make way for this ever-growing mine.  Land grabs and evictions have been carried out by Cerrej&oacute;n's agents using intimidation, forcing the communities to hand over their land for laughable prices using their dominant position and relying on the complicity of the state authorities.</p>  <p>  Figures from the ESB show that Moneypoint has used 12,568,717 tonnes of imported coal since 2011.  Some 11,264,239 tonnes of this coal, just under 90%, has come from Colombia, and the vast majority of that has come from this mine in the north east of Colombia.  The mine is operated by multinational companies such as Glencore, which is currently under investigation in the US for massive corruption and money laundering in its mining operations throughout the world, and Coal Marketing Company, CMC, which has offices here in Dublin.  I have seen documents which show that this is the company from which we are buying coal.</p>  <p>  This mine is located in one of the poorest regions in Colombia.  Indigenous communities that have lived on this land since long before the mine was opened in 1985 have seen this area's precious ecosystem destroyed and their health damaged by this coal mining operation.  Air pollution from the mine has caused serious and fatal respiratory problems for these communities.  Noise pollution from machinery is also damaging the health and quality of life.  In 2016, a legal ruling obliged the mine owners to implement an environment action plan and to attend to the health needs of these indigenous communities, but nothing has been done.  In fact, just eight months after this ruling, it expanded its operation.  Work began to extract minerals from the bed of a river tributary near the plant, which has run dry following three years of intense drought, decades of overuse and a lifetime of public corruption in the region.  Another river tributary which is an important source of water for these indigenous communities has also been diverted to serve the mine and its relentless expansion.  </p>  <p>  The mine is slowly exterminating the indigenous people in this land.  The communities do not want this mine.  They want access to water and other natural resources in the area so that they can produce agricultural products and live their lives in harmony, free from the environmental degradation this mine brings.</p><p>The community and human rights defenders standing up for their rights are being harassed and threatened, and the police and army have attacked these protests on the mine's operation.  The mine and the community cannot survive side by side.  One of them has to go and it should be the mine.  We are part of the problem by importing the coal.  It is not for someone else to worry about.  As the main shareholder in the ESB will the Government direct it to stop importing coal from this mine immediately and end the use of coal, which is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels in Ireland?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade cannot be present and I was asked, just in the past 15 minutes, to take this matter and I ask the Deputy to bear with me.</p>  <p>  The question of where the Moneypoint plant sources its coal is a matter for the ESB and the Deputy may wish to pursue this matter further with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We understand that there have been complaints from non-governmental organisations, NGOs, regarding private sector activities in the Cerrej&oacute;n mine and we are aware of the negative publicity that has surrounded the mine for some time.</p>  <p>  We would certainly be concerned at reports of mining activities having a negative impact on local populations or on the environment, as well as reported abuse of workers.  Ireland does not yet have an embassy in Colombia although we will open one there shortly, but the EU delegation in Bogot&aacute; has been active on behalf of member states in this area.  The EU delegation has been monitoring the situation closely and the EU head of delegation has visited the Cerrej&oacute;n mine to hear stakeholders' views on the allegations and to assess the situation on the ground.  Several follow-up meetings took place with representatives of trade unions and other civil society organisations.</p>  <p>  In addition to the continuous monitoring of Colombia's mining sector, the EU has been carrying out a number of activities in the framework of the implementation of the trade agreement between the EU and Colombia.  The EU has been actively promoting a dialogue between Colombia's civil society organisations in the environmental and labour sectors and the Government.  Several meetings were organised in which the EU delegation to Colombia facilitated contacts between civil society organisations and the Colombian Government.</p>  <p>  More specifically on mining and the allegations around the Cerrej&oacute;n mine, the EU has been maintaining contacts with the sectoral trade union and is in contact with environmental organisations.  As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has explained previously in response to parliamentary questions on the matter, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has an ongoing commitment to support peace and human rights in Colombia and the transition to a post-conflict society.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade engages with the Colombian authorities at governmental level and with human rights defenders and civil society leaders in Colombia, including those working in communities most impacted by the recent conflict.  The Department provides funding directly to the Office of the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights in Colombia to support its work in promoting and protecting human rights, including in some of Colombia&rsquo;s most isolated and challenging regions, as well as to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which provides protection measures to community leaders and activists operating in Colombia and elsewhere in South America.</p>  <p>  While Ireland does not yet have an embassy in Colombia, officials from the embassy of Ireland in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia, frequently visit the country and maintain regular contact with partners there, including to receive updates on the issues affecting communities.  Pending the opening of an Irish embassy in Colombia, we will continue to monitor developments in the country as closely as possible.</p></speech>

By buying coal from the mine, the ESB is undermining the work of Irish Aid and our commitment to sustainable development goals.  The mine does not bring any benefits to the local communities and the Government facilitates the huge tax avoidance in which these mining companies partake.  Colombian taxpayers are, therefore, actively subsidising the mines which are destroying their environment, health and livelihoods, while the perpetrators avoid tax.  This is clearly an issue.</p>  <p>  The people of Ireland do not know where this coal comes from and what price is paid for it.  I have outlined that to the Minister of State and I will not let this issue go.  What happens to the coal before we burn it is not someone else's problem; it is our problem.  We are paying for it and it is our problem.  The Government is the main shareholder, sitting on the board of the ESB.  We are buying coal from this company.  It is well past time that the mine owners respected the rights of communities and were held to account for their actions.  We need to send a clear message that we will not support human rights abuses or the destruction of the environment by buying this coal.  We have responsibilities as legislators to stop this and the Government has a moral and ethical responsibility with regard to how the ESB operates.</p>  <p>  Today we passed the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill.  Here is a prime example of what we should not be doing but are doing.  We need to divest ourselves from buying coal from this notorious mine.  What we are doing does not make sense.  On the one hand, we are trying to bring peace to the region, but, on the other, we are propping up those who are undermining the peace process in the region.</p></speech>

I know that is probably not what he wants to hear but I will say it anyway.</p>  <p>  In October 2017 the T&aacute;naiste announced Ireland's intention to open an embassy in Bogot&aacute; and the ambassador designate, Alison Milton, will arrive in Bogot&aacute; in early 2019 to establish the embassy.  This significant step demonstrates the Government's commitment to developing Ireland's relationship with Colombia, particularly our commitment to support Colombia's transition to a peaceful post-conflict society, including the vindication and protection of human and social rights.  Colombia has also announced it will open an embassy here in Ireland later this year.  These developments will elevate our relationship with the Colombia to a new level.</p>  <p>  While the embassy's focus will be on developing political and economic relationships and continuing to support Colombia's transition to a post-conflict society, having a permanent presence in Bogot&aacute; means we will be in a much better position to monitor issues such as the impact of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine on the local community and the environment.  Historical strides have been made in Colombia in recent years in the transition to a post-conflict society, and addressing social and environmental issues is part of this process.  Significant challenges remain, including in the area of rural development, but Ireland also remains committed to supporting the full implementation of the peace arrangement, which will ensure a peaceful, stable and prosperous future for all Colombians, including the indigenous communities.</p>  <p>  With a new president being inaugurated next month, it is hoped and expected that the progress being made will continue for the betterment of the people of Colombia.  Nobody wants to see people who have lived in a country all their lives undergoing any kind of disturbance to their work, or see them being used and not properly paid for the work they do.  I have noted a number of the issues raised by the Deputy and I will certainly bring them back to the Minister.</p></speech>

It has been asked for by a number of other parties.  We are all aware that Brexit creates additional challenges in many areas, not least for Northern Ireland.  I am glad to update the House on the Government's engagement, as we work at all times to protect and advance the Good Friday Agreement in all contexts.</p><p>I will first address the latest development in the Brexit negotiations.  There have been two notable developments in recent weeks.  First, at the June European Council, EU leaders took stock of the state of play.  Their conclusions were forthright and robust, as they needed to be, and they set out in clear terms what must be achieved in the coming months.  Concern was expressed that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland and Northern Ireland and it was reiterated that the UK must respect in full the commitments made in December and again in March.  Importantly, EU leaders made it clear that in the absence of agreement on a backstop, it would not be possible to finalise the withdrawal agreement as a whole, including transition arrangements.</p> <p> This reflects the Government's and the EU's position that, while our preference is still for an overall EU-UK relationship that would resolve all issues, it remains essential that a backstop be agreed which provides certainty that in any circumstances, and no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the EU-UK future relationship, a hard border would be avoided.  We retain the full support and understanding of our EU partners in this regard.  EU leaders also urged the UK to come forward with workable and realistic proposals on the framework for the future relationship, noting the EU's willingness to revisit its approach should the UK's position evolve.</p> <p> This brings me to the second development.  Last week, at its meeting at Chequers, the UK Government reached internal agreement on its approach to the future EU-UK relationship.  The detail of this position has been elaborated upon in the UK White Paper published earlier today and which my officials are now studying closely.  Today's White Paper is clearly primarily focused on the future relationship but it also includes a welcome confirmation that the UK will agree to a legally operable backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement.  We look forward to considering today's proposals together with our EU partners, guided by the mandate provided by the European Council in March.  Taking account of an assessment of the proposals by Mr. Michel Barnier and his team, we will have an opportunity to exchange views with our EU 27 counterparts at the forthcoming meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels on 20 July.  My officials and I remain in intensive contact with Mr. Barnier and his team, as Deputies might expect.  I will, of course, continue to keep this House informed of developments as we approach the final stages of the negotiations.  The Government has placed the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process at the heart of our response to Brexit and this will continue to be the case.</p> <p> In turning to consider the political position in Northern Ireland, I acknowledge that today, 12 July, is a sensitive and difficult day for many and I take this opportunity to commend the important work that is undertaken each year by the Parades Commission, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and by leaders in both communities to see that issues around parades are anticipated and addressed in a constructive way for the benefit of everyone.  I call for calm and respect on all sides this evening.  The majority of bonfires in Northern Ireland last night passed without serious incident, although there were a number of disturbances in east Belfast, which the PSNI have indicated were orchestrated.  I acknowledge the leadership shown by unionist political representatives and representatives of the Orange Order in condemning the violent actions seen in east Belfast last night and calling for respect for identity and religion.  Although it concerns the actions of a small number of individuals, I put on record the Government's condemnation of the sectarian attacks and the violence against the PSNI that we have seen in Derry - in the Bogside and at the interface with the Fountain - in recent days.</p> <p> I strongly welcome the statement from the leaders of all of the main political parties in Northern Ireland that called for communities to stand together to protect the rule of law.  The people of Derry are rightly proud of their work in building bridges between communities and in sustaining peace and reconciliation in the city.  It was heartening to see that the Bogside community took a stand on Monday evening, showing their support for their neighbours on the Fountain Estate, as did church leaders on Tuesday.  The determination that we see in Derry to uphold our shared peace serves as an inspiration to all of us in government and in politics to continue to do all that we can to see that the Good Friday Agreement can operate to its full potential through its political institutions.</p> <p> The devolved power-sharing institutions are at the heart of the Agreement and they are the best means for achieving accountable, representative decision making for all the people of Northern Ireland.  This is a critical time for Northern Ireland.  There are many challenges and questions raised by Brexit that should be considered and addressed by elected representatives in Northern Ireland through the devolved institutions.  There are also now many important decisions that have an impact on public services and people's lives that are waiting to be taken by a new Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly.  The leadership at community level by the political parties in Northern Ireland that we have seen in recent days should also be represented in the Assembly and delivered on by a power-sharing Executive.  It is of fundamental importance - most directly for all of the people of Northern Ireland - that the devolved institutions can operate again, and this needs to happen as soon as possible.</p> <p> I remain in regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Karen Bradley, as we seek a way beyond the current impasse.  We met in Cork on 11 June and again in London last week, on 4 July.  The Secretary of State and I have each conducted contacts with the parties to hear their views on how, at this stage, the two governments can support the political process in accordance with the Agreement.  In light of these consultations, the Secretary of State and I are considering how best the two governments can chart a way forward that will give the best prospects for getting the devolved institutions operating again without delay.  As an important part of that engagement, a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC, will take place on 25 July in London.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and I will participate for the Government in this meeting of the conference with our British counterparts.  The meeting will be co-chaired by Mr. David Lidington and me.  The BIIGC will discuss the effective operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, North-South security co-operation and bilateral cooperation between the British and Irish Governments.  Both governments, as co-guarantors of the agreement, are fully committed to working together to achieve the earliest operation of the devolved institutions and to working together for the mutual benefit of all of the peoples of these islands.</p> <p> I will conclude with a brief word on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles.  I had a good meeting with the family of the late Mr. Pat Finucane on Tuesday and reassured them of the Government's continued and complete support for the holding of a public enquiry consistent with the Weston Park Agreement.  The Government remains determined to see that there is definitive progress in the period ahead on the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework and other outstanding legacy issues, including the three all-party motions adopted by this House on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The Government welcomed the launch of the UK Government's consultation on addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland's past on 11 May, which is an important step forward.  We are also working on drafting the proposals for the legislation required in this jurisdiction to provide for co-operation with the Stormont House legacy bodies.  This work is being led by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I have met families, considered unionist or nationalist, which believe equally strongly in the need for truth and reconciliation through legacy structures.</p> <p> The Government will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties to seek continued progress on legacy issues and we will also continue to prioritise reconciliation in Northern Ireland in our ongoing work.  To underline the Government's commitment in this area, I was pleased to announce in May that from 2019, an additional &euro;1 million will be made available through my Department's reconciliation fund.  My officials will also undertake a study to identify the challenges facing reconciliation in Border communities, paying particular attention to the needs of minorities in Border counties.  I look forward to hearing the views of colleagues.</p></speech>

Nobody can doubt the immense progress in Northern Ireland arising from the victory of democratic politics and the new beginning offered by the inclusive and brave agreement reached 20 years ago.</p><p>The problems that confront Northern Ireland and this island as a whole today are nowhere near those experienced at the height of the violence and sectarianism of the previous decades.  We should acknowledge the tremendous steps that have been taken to try to overcome entrenched sectarianism and the spiral of conflict that it fed.</p> <p> On 12 July we should note the importance of the day to much of the unionist community and the value they place on it.  It is fitting that our Presidents have for some years made sure that they have used the office to show the respect owed to this distinctly Irish tradition and the extraordinary good faith shown by many of its leaders in helping that tradition to evolve.  This was once a day on which Catholic communities lived in real fear and it defined aggressive sectarianism.  This has overwhelmingly changed but, unfortunately, not completely.  Recent days have shown again how a small minority can terrorise communities.  Building dangerous bonfires in built-up areas, attacking workers, burning flags and political posters as well as abusive sloganeering have nothing to do with celebration of a culture; it is nothing less than sectarian thuggery.  The apparent activity of the east Belfast UVF is a major concern, as is the activity of dissidents in Derry.  The attempted murder of a police officer in Derry, the throwing of 20 petrol bombs and the attacks on the small Protestant community in the Fountain area of the city show a deliberate escalation of sectarian violence.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il strongly welcomes and supports the joint statement signed by six Assembly parties yesterday condemning the violence of recent days and the call for full co-operation with the police.  It showed that there is cross-community opposition to the tiny minority trying to destabilise Northern Ireland and undermine progress.  I hope those parties, especially the largest two parties, understand the obvious fact that these concerning developments are being enabled by the ongoing political vacuum in Northern Ireland.  Today marks 549 days since the agreed institutions for governing Northern Ireland in an inclusive way were collapsed.  During this time there has been no voice for the people of Northern Ireland in their mounting health crisis, rising homelessness, tackling of sectarianism or, of course, in the debate on Brexit.  Leaving a community without a voice at a time of great uncertainty and historic challenges is dangerous in any circumstance.  It is potentially destructive in a community with Northern Ireland's history.</p> <p> In two weeks' time the two governments will finally hold a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  While the significance of the conference has occasionally been exaggerated, it remains the only route available to the governments to be true to the expressed will of the people in supporting the Good Friday Agreement.  We welcome the holding of the conference but we are highly disappointed that neither the Prime Minister nor the Taoiseach will attend given the scale and importance of the issues at hand.  It is a disgrace that it took so long for the conference to be called.  This delay has simply confirmed that no matter how often the key players talk, they have so far failed to find a way of moving ahead in a co-ordinated or urgent manner.</p> <p> The first priority at the moment should remain the restoration of the institutions.  The current blockage is the exact mirror image of the difficulties over the welfare negotiations some years ago.  This even goes as far as each of the parties claiming the other backed out of a deal and each party claiming that the other is 100% to blame for everything.  The calling of the conference should not be a replacement for trying to return to meaningful negotiations, including the direct and active involvement of the leaders of government.</p> <p> While the calling of the conference is welcome it is singularly disappointing how limited the agenda is.  In particular, there appears to be, on the face of it, an entirely unacceptable attempt to keep Brexit-related issues off the agenda.  The conference is entitled to discuss all non-devolved issues.  This includes the overall operation of the devolution settlement, which is on the agenda.  However, given the number of areas where the British Government has recently denied the role of devolved administrations, the list of areas that can and should be discussed is dramatically longer than the last time the conference met in 2007.  The British Government should be confronted with the fact that it recently passed legislation and fought a UK Supreme Court case based on the principle that the devolved administrations did not control a vast range of policy areas.  In fact, it has gone as far as to assert that the Sewel convention on the devolution of powers is voluntary and all powers are held by Westminster.  The British Government cannot make this naked power grab and then claim these issues are outside of the competence of the conference.</p> <p> This is, of course, crucial to the basic position of Northern Ireland with regard to the European Union.  Under the UK European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 passed in London, all competencies currently held by the European Union will automatically be held by London until some later point when they may be devolved.  The Government should also remember that the British Government accepted in its pleading in the Agnew High Court case that co-operation on European Union matters and the role of the European Union is assumed in the Good Friday Agreement.  As such, Ireland should simply insist that practical matters relating to Brexit and Northern Ireland be included in the discussions as well as the requirement on the British Government to be open in sharing information.</p> <p> Businesses and communities in Northern Ireland have been abandoned by a political class which has either opted out of institutions that might give them a voice on Brexit or is involved in trying to subvert the will of the majority which voted to remain.</p> <p> We are calling on the T&aacute;naiste to use this meeting to push for the publication of whatever material has been prepared in London and Belfast concerning the implications of different options for Northern Ireland and details of what contingency planning is under way.</p> <p> While matters of education and health do fall within the remit of devolved authority, intentions about how to proceed with urgently needed action fall within the realm of the overall operation of the Agreement.  Therefore, we believe that our Government should push for an unambiguous commitment for the British Government to publish a statement of its plans and budgets for schools and hospitals.  Northern Ireland's schools and hospitals are being squeezed relentlessly and the vital services they provide for communities across the North are being undermined.  This is becoming a critical issue for many of the people involved on the front-line of services and those in receipt of vital public services.  We know from various legal cases that the capacity of administrators to take decisions and so on is severely curtailed and the issue of governance is severely undermined by the current lack of the institutions in operation.</p> <p> Some clarity is urgently required; it is needed now.  I hope the BIIGC can bring some clarity to that situation.  The holding of the IGC is unfortunately necessary because of a lack of political leadership and bravery in more than one party.  It is unlikely to mark a major breakthrough but hopefully it will lead to some progress in terms of restoring the institutions.  After 549 days in which there has been a sense of drift and a failure to turn contact into action, a return of a sense of hope that some progress is possible would be a major achievement indeed.</p></speech>

However, recent events demonstrate that we cannot be complacent or take the progress or the peace for granted.  The Good Friday Agreement was an agreement in the first instance to protect citizens and accommodate change.  Ireland is changing.  A new Ireland is emerging and the North can no longer be viewed through the prism of orange and green.  It is now a rainbow of identities and aspirations.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in stands for a new united inclusive and equal Ireland, an Ireland for all, whether British, Irish, both or neither.  However, there are those who want to drag us back into conflict, those who want to maintain community division.  They can be seen on the streets of Derry and on the streets of east Belfast.  They cannot and will not prevail.</p>  <p>  I know Derry.  The actions of the antisocial criminal elements that have roved the streets of the maiden city do not represent Derry.</p><p>I know many unionists.  The actions of the bonfire builders who decorate their pyres with sectarian graffiti do not represent the unionist community.  </p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in elected representatives are on the ground and stand with communities at this time.  In Derry we have marched in support and in solidarity with the community of the Fountain.  Throughout the North, Sinn F&eacute;in representatives have stood with unionist and nationalist communities.  We have challenged, and will continue to challenge, sectarianism wherever and whenever it raises its ugly head.  We continue to support and work with the PSNI to challenge criminality and hate crime.  There is an onus on all of us not only to condemn but to challenge those involved in these activities, to safeguard communities and hold those responsible to account.  We must demonstrate that equal rights of citizens are fundamental and inalienable.  We must demonstrate that grievances, whether real or perceived, can only be resolved through dialogue.  </p> <p> The Good Friday Agreement is as relevant today as it was 20 years ago.  It must be respected, embraced and implemented.  A functioning executive operating for all in the community is the way forward.  That is why we negotiated with the DUP to the point of agreement in February.  What we agreed at that time was not perfect but it was progress.  It was sufficient to allow for the re-establishment of the institutions.  I note with regret that unfortunately the DUP walked away from this agreement and hence the opportunity for genuine power-sharing to be re-established was lost, for then but not forever.</p> <p> The issues of contention remain.  These are marriage equality, language rights and the right to a coroners inquest, rights that are recognised and honoured in Britain and this jurisdiction.  The denial of these rights is a breach of the Good Friday Agreement and the full implementation of the Agreement is the solution to these issues.  The institution to resolve these issues is also found in the Agreement.  The BIIGC brings together the two governments to deal with non-devolved matters of mutual concern, including rights.  In the absence of devolved institutions, this conference is the opportunity for the two governments to deal with all of the matters outstanding, within the framework of the Agreement. </p> <p> I welcome that the intergovernmental conference will meet on 25 July but it must be more than a talking shop.  It is the opportunity for the two governments to assert the primacy of the agreements, to make clear that the rights available here and across in our neighbouring island of Britain will be delivered in the North, that the Irish language Act agreed at St. Andrews will be delivered and that progress will be made on all-Ireland working and co-operation.  The conference is the opportunity to vindicate the rights of Gaelgeoir&iacute;, of our LGBT+ community and those of the victims of the conflict.  They are rights that are not a matter of negotiation but of implementation.  This would provide a pathway back to the institutions.  </p> <p> However, there are those in unionism and the British Government who may use the conference to play for time and to continue to stall on these rights.  It will be for the Government to set the pace and to ensure, as the Taoiseach has said, that the people of the North are never again left behind. </p> <p> We are not naive.  Even with the Executive and Assembly up and working, we still face considerable challenges on women's health, for example, and looming over all this is Brexit, which my colleague, Deputy David Cullinane Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on Brexit, will now deal with.</p></speech>

We also welcome the commitment to there being no hard border on the island of Ireland, a commitment to the letter and spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and a commitment to a legally operable backstop for the island of Ireland.  The T&aacute;naiste will accept that we have been here before.  We had a political agreement last December which was to be built upon; we have a White Paper today and more political promises have been made.  We must move beyond political agreements and promises and see the legal text, legal certainty and legal clarity that is necessary to ensure there is no hardening of the Border but also to ensure that we protect citizens' rights in the North and that we protect the Agreement in all its parts.  We must move beyond the sound bite and aspiration and move to real detail so that we can see exactly what it being put on the table.</p>  <p>  It is time for the British Government to live up to its responsibility to safeguard the letter and spirit of the Agreement and avoid a hard border.  The Border in Ireland is not simply about trade nor was the Good Friday Agreement a trade agreement.  It was about citizens rights, identity, social and legal rights and these have protection in the European Courts, including the European Court of Justice.  Even in the White Paper published today, the British Government is still intent on taking the North of Ireland out of the purview of the European Court of Justice.  We have concerns, which I have raised with the T&aacute;naiste several times, that Irish citizens who live in the North, who are also European citizens, want to be able to vindicate their rights post-Brexit but there remains huge uncertainty as to how that will happen.</p>  <p>  I welcome the commitment to a backstop but we still do not know what that will mean.  There seems to be a difference between the December agreement, which was political in nature, supported by most, if not all, Members of this House, and the Government and what the British Government is now saying.  Today, Theresa May reiterated that Britain and the North will come out of the customs union and Single Market.  There has been progress on some issues, but not enough.</p>  <p>  We need certainty on these issues as we move into the October summit.  It was this Government, the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach, who promised the Irish people that the Irish issues would be sorted before we moved on to the phase two negotiations; that did not happen.  They also promised that we would have an agreement by June and that we would see real and substantial progress as we moved towards the June summit; that did not happen.  There has been some movement today but we are clear that it is unacceptable that we would stumble into the October Council meeting without any legal guarantees or text on the Irish issues.  They must be dealt with and if that means a summit in September, so be it, because this is our insurance policy.</p>  <p>  The future arrangements including the future trading relationship between Britain and the EU is of interest to the people of Ireland.  We want the closest possible relationship.  I would prefer if Britain remained as close as possible to the Single market and the customs union.  In the event that does not happen, we need that backstop, and that insurance policy, and to see it well in advance of October so that Irish people and businesses have the certainty they need.</p></speech>

It has taken more than two years to get to this stage and only months remain before March 2019 when the UK leaves the EU.  I also welcome that Theresa May refers to commitments to Northern Ireland and to Ireland in her foreword to the White Paper.</p>  <p>  There are two sides to the story when it comes to Northern Ireland and Brexit - the economic side and the political side.  The White Paper is ambitious in the type of economic partnership it outlines.  It remains to be seen whether a deal can be struck, not least in respect of UK payments to the EU, the role of the European Court of Justice and the four fundamental freedoms.  Not only is there a risk of the UK cherry-picking what it wants from the Single Market but there is an explicit plan to allow employers to cherry-pick the so-called talented workers and allow them free movement but not other workers.</p><p>This is not something to which we could agree.</p> <p> I would like to focus on three British proposals that are worth emphasising.  They involve the maintenance of the all-island energy market; the suggestion of a common rule book for goods, including agrifood, which accounts for the greatest bulk of our exports to Northern Ireland; and the UK's participation in certain EU agencies, such as the European Chemicals Agency and the European Aviation Safety Agency.  Ireland exports animals and food worth &euro;3.9 billion to Britain each year, as well as chemicals worth a further &euro;3.9 billion.  Nearly &euro;600 million in animals and food, as well as a further &euro;200 million in chemicals, crosses from Ireland to Northern Ireland each year.  In turn, we import food worth nearly &euro;500 million and chemicals worth &euro;64 million from Northern Ireland.  Many people are unaware that we import so much food into the Republic from the UK.  Behind all of these figures are jobs, farms and businesses.  Without prejudice to the negotiations that are yet to come, I welcome the fact that the UK is clearly seeking an agreement that would maintain the open Border that is fundamental to the maintenance of so many livelihoods on this island.</p> <p> Inevitably, there is a political dimension to the agreement of standards and regulations for trade.  The proposal in the UK White Paper for biannual meetings between UK Ministers and their EU counterparts to agree the evolution of standards is a recognition of that.  It is a way for the UK to participate as a rule-maker and not exclusively as a rule-taker.  While this is a radical proposal, I believe it merits careful consideration.  The proposed model is not unlike the European Free Trade Association, EFTA, which the UK co-founded in 1960.  It envisages a relationship that is less one-sided than the current relationship between the EU and EFTA.  From Ireland's perspective, a permanent association agreement between the EU and the UK would help to secure the permanent openness of the Border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It would reduce the risk that a future UK Government might tear up any agreement that might be perceived as locking the UK into some kind of second-class relationship with the EU.</p> <p> Everything I am saying about the proposed model is predicated on an association agreement being negotiated and being deemed to be workable.  I concede that this is a long path away because there are many negotiations to be had.  I believe it could be a model for the EU's relations with other countries on its periphery, including Norway, Ukraine and Turkey.  Before I touch on the political dimension to Brexit and Northern Ireland, I want to emphasise that the fundamental point I am making is that the model which has been proposed could be of value to the EU in the future.  A number of countries that will seek membership of the Union in the years to come might not fully qualify for such membership.  If a model of this type is negotiated with the UK, such countries might see it as an acceptable alternative to full membership of the EU.  We should be bold and courageous enough to develop that and to think about whether it might work.</p> <p> This House used to have a much greater focus on Northern Ireland affairs.  In recent years, there has been a significant diminution in the number of debates, the quality of debates and the number of hours we devote to this issue.  That has been my experience.  Obviously, Brexit has brought the Border back into our debates.  It is now a central part of our agenda.  We need to look beyond the economic and social aspects of the Border.  Northern Ireland's political system, as set up under the Good Friday Agreement, is in a precarious position.  The political stalemate that has existed in Northern Ireland for more than 18 months has its origins in the so-called "cash for ash scandal" which, quite frankly, is not referenced too often nowadays.</p></speech>

Having listened carefully to the Sinn F&eacute;in leader's speech, I know this issue was not mentioned, even as the precursor of the collapse of the institutions.  I do not say that as a criticism.  I am pointing out the reality that a range of new issues, including marriage equality and the Irish language Act, are being referenced even though they were not referenced when the institutions collapsed.  That is fine.  The Labour Party supports marriage equality and has done for decades.  It was at our insistence that the 2011 programme for Government included a commitment to hold the referendum that was ultimately held in 2015.</p>  <p>  Ba mhaith liom Acht na Gaeilge a fheice&aacute;il sa Tuaisceart.  The nature of politics is that it involves addressing issues and resolving problems through participation in the democratic institutions that are in place.  There was a majority in favour of marriage equality in the Northern Ireland Assembly but, as Deputies will be aware, it was blocked by a petition of concern from the DUP.  The DUP no longer has the numbers to block legislation on its own.  Likewise, the Irish language Act will happen - it is only a matter of time.  I ask all the parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in, to stop seeing reasons to avoid doing their democratic business and taking on democratic politics.  They should stop looking to the Parliament in London to impose or block legislation that politicians in Northern Ireland are quite capable of delivering through the hard-won institutions that currently exist.  It is essential for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive to be back up and running as soon as possible.  There is no issue preventing this that cannot be resolved in those institutions and through those institutions.</p>  <p>  In the past 48 hours, we have seen what happens when there is a political void.  Northern Ireland has been moving forward for the past 20 years, but now there is a risk of societal movement in the opposite direction.  Catholic youths have thrown petrol bombs at the homes of Protestant pensioners.  Others have been lying in wait to throw stones and petrol bombs at the PSNI.  Shots were fired.  In Belfast, the UVF threatened to organise disorder.  I will give some examples of the serious disorder we have seen.  There have been illegal bonfires in addition to those that were permitted.  Vehicles have been set alight.  Fire crews have been placed in peril.  While I agree strongly with the joint statement from six of the political parties in Northern Ireland concerning the violence and the intimidation that followed, it would be more effective if it had emanated from a functioning Assembly in Northern Ireland.  Policies must be implemented to improve the lives of young people from disadvantaged areas.  Such people can be easy prey for the extremists who still exist in Northern Ireland and who seek to push others towards the path of violence.</p>  <p>  The planned meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 25 July next is an important opportunity for the Government to push for the restoration of Northern Ireland's democratic institutions.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister have met recently, but I join others in saying it is a pity they will not be attending next month's meeting.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will be able to impress on his counterparts the urgency of getting democratic politics back up and running in Northern Ireland.  If that means some of the parties proceeding in the absence of others, so be it.  If it means the rules have to change to some degree to provide for an Assembly with a more typical government-opposition divide, so be it too.  This shameful avoidance of responsibility at such a crucial juncture in Northern Ireland's history - the current Brexit negotiations will have serious long-term ramifications for the people of this island as a whole - has led to Northern Ireland having no functioning Assembly and no Executive.</p></speech>

Our fantastic movement for abortion rights has brought this issue to the centre of the stage for women.  Following our repeal referendum, there is a concern that anyone who can become pregnant in the North is getting left behind.  Northern Ireland and Malta are the only two parts of Europe which have such a strict ban on abortion that it is not permitted other than in the most exceptional circumstances.</p><p>While there is a political impasse and the sectarian parties are not in the Assembly, there is growing impatience, particularly among young people, for action on abortion rights and other progressive social issues.</p> <p> Over 50 years ago, abortion was introduced in Britain via the Abortion Act 1967.  The Act was never extended to Northern Ireland.  Politicians united across the sectarian divide to see to it that abortion rights would never be provided to women in the North.  The hypocrisy here has been part and parcel of the Northern Ireland state, with people travelling outside that the latter and, more recently, taking abortion pills.  Now there is growing demand for action.  There is a multitude of campaign groups.  One of the groups in Northern Ireland with which I have a connection, ROSA, uses the slogan, "We won't be left behind".  That is how people felt in the North when they saw the results of the referendum on repeal and the referendum on marriage equality three years ago.</p> <p> Once again, the people are ahead of the politicians in the context of social attitudes.  In all recent surveys, there has been a clear majority in favour of reform of abortion laws.  In all the polls that have been produced, this has been the case.  It is mainly the political parties that are left wanting.  I refer to the SDLP and the DUP.  There may be individual politicians who hold a pro-choice position.  Until a few weeks ago, Sinn F&eacute;in did not have a position on this, except that of opposing any reform. I caution and condemn any party or organisation that tries to use this issue or any other for sectarian reasons or in a sectarian way.  I took part in the Pride march in Dublin.  I saw an official poster that stated something along the lines of "End Partition - Introduce Marriage Equality".  It immediately linked a progressive social demand with partition or the national question rather than trying to unite Catholic and Protestant people to win social reforms.</p> <p> Marriage equality was part of the negotiations in recent times.  Abortion rights were never mentioned.  It is absolutely necessary for a movement to be built in the North to force this onto the politicians' agenda in the same way as with repeal.  All the surveys I have seen that were carried out in Protestant-dominated constituencies show Protestants are more in favour of abortion rights.  It is not a case, therefore, of one section of the community being more progressive than the other.  There is, according to the polls, a serious disconnect between the DUP leadership and the people who vote for the party.  It is necessary to build a united movement of young people and women, of all religions and none, to force the issue of abortion rights onto the political agenda and make it irresistible for politicians, particularly the two big parties, to make it happen.</p> <p> In the context of developments relating to this issue, Stella Creasy, MP, introduced a Bill recently that bought it centre stage.  It is expected that an amendment will be introduced in the autumn to decriminalise abortion in the North.  The Government of Ms Theresa May could fall before that but it is essential that the legislation be supported and that we support the demand for the decriminalisation of abortion.  This would allow abortion to be provided through the National Health Service in the North, and it would create huge demand among people.</p> <p> As we speak, at least two women from the North are using abortion pills.  Others are travelling.  The same hypocrisy pertains 100 miles up the road as pertained here.  This has to be made a huge issue.  A placard stating "The North is Next" was seen in Dublin Castle.  We have to assist women and young people to see that this cannot be ignored any longer by the sectarian politicians and parties.</p></speech>

In the South, we got the Catholic Church-dominated, anti-woman regime that held sway and persisted until relatively recently and that has been challenged forcefully by the Repeal and marriage equality movements.  In the North, people got the sectarian state, sectarian violence and conflict of the orange and green varieties.  For that reason, removing partition is vital in order to eliminate the divisions and the conservative and sectarian states with which people, North and South, have had to live.</p>  <p>  I agree very strongly with Deputy Coppinger that the alarming eruptions of sectarian violence we have seen in recent days are a stark reminder that sectarianism remains alive and well in the North.  That said, we glimpse the possibility for a different type of Ireland and for unity that emerges from below through struggles for things that unite ordinary people, working people and young people in a fight for a better and more progressive Ireland.  After the Together for Yes victory, it was very inspiring for me to go to the North to participate in a march at which there was a huge contingent calling for abortion rights to be extended to the North.  Both Catholics and Protestants were demanding that, cutting across the sectarian division.  Similarly, there is a big movement erupting for marriage equality in the North.  Again, it involves Catholic and Protestant people, but young people in particular.</p>  <p>  Perhaps slightly more worryingly, although there is a positive side, Catholic and Protestant young people who are anti-racist had to take to the streets in the past week to protest against far-right demonstrations in the North, echoing the very worrying rise of far-right mobilisation in Britain, which, terrifyingly, saw 15,000 out-and-out fascists marching in London in recent weeks.  It was great to see young, progressive, left-wing Catholic and Protestant young people mobilising against the far right in Belfast.  The two possible futures are the sectarian violence we see erupting and a progressive and different type of Ireland based on Catholic and Protestant working people and young people coming together to fight for a shared, better and progressive future.</p>  <p>  The political establishment, in the North, the South and Britain, has to take some responsibility for the violence that is erupting.  The political structures in the North are not about eliminating sectarianism; they are about policing apart two communities.  Suggesting that Orange marches and bonfires with sectarian slogans are part of some legitimate culture that we can manage is a mistake.  This culture is used to stoke up violence.  It has no purpose other than violence and it produces a reaction from people who are right to be angry about the sectarianism but who are completely wrong in that reaction and manipulated by elements who want to return to a futile armed struggle that will only divide the community again and lead absolutely nowhere.</p>  <p>  We need a different type of politics that breaks from orange and green.  People Before Profit is trying, North and South, to build a politics that will oppose austerity and fight for a socially progressive Ireland, not under a flag of green or orange but under the flag James Connolly would have flown, that of working-class, progressive and internationalist politics.  We could do with a dose of that in Britain and in Europe also.</p></speech>

There was also a more recent report compiled by Dr. Katy Hayward on behalf of the central Border region.  The reason I refer specifically to those two reports is that the people who are spoken to in the reports are the public and community representatives who are at the coalface of not only the problems in Northern Ireland but also those relating to Brexit.  There is clear agreement that Ireland and Northern Ireland will be the region of the EU that will be worst affected by Brexit.  In fact, one report refers to a potential fall in GDP of between 0.8% and 2.6% below baseline by 2030 due to the disruption of Ireland's close trade, investment, energy, migration and integration links with the UK.</p>  <p>  At a time when the Border region and the North of Ireland are set to suffer most, we are all aware of the stalemate that still exists in the North while the North-South Ministerial Council and other intergovernmental bodies remain in limbo.  In the same way that the Minister created a voice for people in the South, a proper voice for the North is needed now more than ever.  The people of Northern Ireland need Members of this House and others to articulate and express their concerns.  In fact, the voices of Scotland and Wales also need to be heard collectively to demonstrate the potential disaster for all of us on the periphery of Europe.  Even if there are no physical tariffs or customs, there is still the alignment with EU regulations relating to fresh food produce to contend with.</p>  <p>  The White Paper issued today by the British Government outlines what Mrs. Theresa May agreed to at the recent Chequers meeting.  That agreement is a soft Brexit path through the creation of a common rule book that will keep the UK in line with the EU Single Market standards on goods.  It also includes the establishment of a free trade area for goods, which would avoid friction on the Border.  The soft Brexit outlined in the White Paper is not what the hard-line Brexiteers wanted as it would seriously limit the UK's ability to trade with countries that have different or, indeed, substandard rules and regulations.  The agrifood sector in particular will be affected, as the UK will not be able to trade with huge markets outside of these regulations.  This is the reason for the recent resignation of three senior Ministers from the British Cabinet.  It is good news, however, in that it avoids a hard border in Ireland.  I cautiously welcome it.  This is the first positive step by Britain in the two years of discussion and is a start on a final journey, which I have often referred to as fairy-tale economics.</p>  <p>  In the recent report by the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, which included an online survey of people living in the Border region, people responded that they still were not assured that a hard border could be avoided.  Respondents felt that the hard border would mean a step back in the peace process and interference with the Good Friday Agreement, and would be like going back, as they describe it, to the old days of the Troubles.  Respect and tolerance of all views is needed now more than ever.  Much as I have indicated a desire for a united Ireland, talk of that is not helpful.  What we need is a unity of people, not land.  We need an agreed Ireland, not an imposed Ireland.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer to the paramilitary activity we have seen during this week of 12 July.  Not only have we seen the reports other Members have mentioned, but in my county Uzi submachine guns can be obtained and used by dissidents.  There were also the pipe bombings last night in Drogheda and more recent issues relating to the drugs trade.  In this context, we need to be reminded that while the levels of violence after the Good Friday Agreement have disappeared from our media and televisions, in the past 20 years over 150 people have died as a result of paramilitary violence.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, will outline further the views of people in the Border region.  We must protect the Good Friday Agreement and uphold our beliefs and the beliefs of people in the North who are waiting for us to deliver for them.</p></speech>

It is most regrettable that a small minority is still involved in thuggery and violence.  It is sectarian violence and it must be stopped.  Like previous speakers, I welcome the fact that the six political parties represented in Stormont signed a strong agreement denouncing that violence.  It is good that there is cross-community opposition to this thuggery and violence.</p>  <p>  In the second half of 2018 - 20 years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement - the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland are not functioning.  It is most regrettable that at a time when there are huge political issues such as housing, welfare and health, as there are here, those day-to-day issues are not being dealt with because there is no executive in Northern Ireland, nor is there an assembly where the people's voice can be heard.  I welcome that the Intergovernmental Conference is being convened before the end of the month.  It is an important aspect of strand three of the Good Friday Agreement.  The convening of the conference is belated but welcome.</p>  <p>  I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade earlier this week regarding some of the issues that might be raised at the Intergovernmental Conference and I am glad that the legacy issues are part of the business of the conference.  Progress must be made on the legacy issues.  The Stormont House Agreement has to be implemented.  Some of us have taken the time to meet the victims of violence from both traditions.  Many of the victims and their families have been waiting for justice and hoping that at least the truth will be found about the murder, mayhem and the taking of life by paramilitaries, as well as by some state forces.  However, as time goes by memories fade as people get older.  Unfortunately, people who lost family members and never got the truth about it are passing away.  I appeal to the T&aacute;naiste to ensure that this forms a central part of the negotiations with the British Government.  It should be part of the Department's daily work.  I am glad the T&aacute;naiste referred to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974 and the fact that the British Government has ignored the unanimous request of this House on three different occasions.  The least the British Government can do is give access to those papers and files to an international eminent independent legal person.</p>  <p>  On Brexit, I was discussing Border policing with the Minister for Justice and Equality earlier.  I told him that, after 1998, I did not think I would be back in the House talking about Border crossings.  Unfortunately, that is a big part of the political narrative in the two counties I represent and along the central Border area.  Deputy Breathnach referred to work done by ICBAN.  Dr. Katy Hayward of Queen's University Belfast carried out further survey work on behalf of ICBAN in regard to people's awareness of and concern about Brexit.  Some of the findings are quite stark with regard to the concerns about the negative aspects of Brexit already.  Almost 600 people from the Border area took part in the study.  Three quarters of them stated that Brexit has already impacted negatively on their daily lives, in terms of their living standards, their planning for education and planning to access services across the Border.  Brexit is a huge issue and we must ensure there is no return to the Border of the past on our island.  The uncertainty since the British referendum is causing economic hardship.</p><p>It is having a negative economic impact on the Border region.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware from his time as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of the interdependence of the economy North and South.  Thankfully, over the past 20 years there has been huge growth in business on an all-Ireland basis but these are the businesses that will be most impacted, unfortunately, by Brexit.</p></speech>

The past week, however, may prove to have been somewhat of a catalyst for the future of the negotiations.</p>  <p>  The White Paper which was published this afternoon lays the foundation for the UK's position going forward and the most strident dissenters have been sidelined.  Despite this, there remain a number of potential pitfalls that will need to be addressed as soon as possible.  From a first reading of the White Paper there are elements that are not perfect or realistic, but crucially for Ireland it points towards a realisation that a soft Brexit is not only desirable for the UK but in many ways it is inevitable.  The UK policy now seems to have re-orientated towards seeking a free trade area for goods, which would require synchronisation with EU rules - a so-called common rule book or harmonisation by another name.  This would in effect mean that existing customs and regulatory arrangements for manufacturing and agricultural products would continue after Brexit but services would diverge.</p>  <p>  A facilitated customs arrangement is proposed.  This would see the UK and EU become what is referred to as a combined customs territory in which the UK would apply the EU's tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the bloc with domestic tariffs imposed for goods heading to the UK.  This proposal, regrettably, harkens back to similar UK proposals that the EU has already rejected.  Most alarmingly, the White Paper seeks to end the free movement of people to the UK from EU member states.  Aside from contravening the principle of no access to the free market without free movement this section is very problematic from an Irish perspective.  The section of the White Paper dealing with immigration is laid out, "without prejudice to the common travel area."  If I am correct in my reading this means that the UK wishes to limit EU migration to skilled workers and simultaneously keep an open border between Northern Ireland the Republic.  It is not clear how this circle can be squared.  Also, and with complete disregard to the Good Friday Agreement and Irish citizens in Northern Ireland, the White Paper states bluntly that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, ECJ, in the UK will end, except in relation to the interpretation of those EU rules to which the UK has agreed to adhere as a matter of international law.  We urgently need clarity on whether the Good Friday Agreement falls into this category.</p>  <p>  As we all know Theresa May's majority in the House of Commons relies on the support of the DUP which, despite the wishes of the majority in Northern Ireland, has been one of the most vociferous voices in its support for a hard Brexit.  We have not seen its reaction to the contents of the White Paper as of yet but if Theresa May is to re-establish fully her authority as Prime Minister, she must demand that the EU produce workable alternatives to what is in the document or fall into line behind her.  I echo the calls of others that Sinn F&eacute;in reconsider its abstentionist policy, even temporarily, for the purposes of securing the best deal for its constituents in Northern Ireland.  This is particularly pressing given the elements of the White Paper, which I have already referred to, that will affect Northern Ireland, specifically the free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the ECJ.  These two issues, along with the customs proposals, should set alarm bells ringing for the Government, particularly in light of the comment by Michel Barnier on Tuesday that a Brexit deal was 80% done.  We can only conclude from this that the substance of the White Paper was seen by the European Commission prior to publication.  If the remaining 20% concerns the inconsistencies that I have already referred to, I urge the T&aacute;naiste to seek assurances from the European Commission and EU leaders that these will be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

It was about time she stood up to her former Foreign Secretary, made the call and showed some leadership.  It stands well to her that she did so.  The fact sky has not fallen and a vote of confidence has not been called shows it was bluff, and it was good to call it.</p><p>My assessment is that we are still in high very risk territory of a no deal outcome to the whole process.  I say that not to be in any way critical of the Irish Government because I think that by and large it has approached the negotiations in the right way.  I think our public service and the general approach has been right but we are unfortunate to be in a particularly difficult situation.  Earlier in the week I read an article in either <i>The Spectator or </i>the <i>New Statesman</i>which quoted Lyndon B. Johnson who said the first rule in politics is that you have got to be good at maths and counting numbers.  That is where I see a problem, because no matter what way I look at this, the numbers do not stack up for whatever deal is agreed between the European Union and the UK Government in terms of it getting through the UK Parliament.  It will get through the European Parliament handy enough because Europe, by and large, has moved on.  We will have a particular decision to make.  If we are not happy with it, we may be in a very tricky position.  The real problem exists in the UK Parliament.  It is about <i>realpolitik</i>.  One cannot imagine that there are not up to 70 hardline Brexiteers waiting in the long grass for their opportunity to say that a soft deal Brexit is not what they want.  From their perspective, it is probably the greatest giveaway of sovereignty that we have seen in my lifetime in terms of it not having an influence on European rules and regulations and at the same time committing to it.  It is hard to believe that anything could change in their minds.  For Theresa May to get it through her Parliament, she would then be reliant on the Labour Party or the Scottish National Party, SNP, to get it over the line.  I do not see that the Labour Party would make the political call of keeping the Tory Party in government and allowing the Brexit deal to go through while it remains in opposition for the next while.  Why would the Labour Party do that?  Some of its members might agree to it, but not the numbers that would be needed to get it over the line.  Similarly, why would the Scottish National Party support a Tory Government that has not been gracious to it?  Given Scotland voted against Brexit how could the SNP have the mandate to provide the support that would be needed to get it over the line?  In those circumstances, my prognosis is that even though it has been a good week in the negotiations in that at last there is a position, it is softer and all of the red line issues which Theresa May set out over the last year have evaporated we are heading towards a crash-out Brexit and no deal is a real prospect.  This would do real damage to relations on this island and east-west.</p><p>My final assessment is a personal one - we are all following this trying to work our what way it will go while we cannot control it.  I have a sense from listening to Mr. Barnier, and to President Juncker when he was here, that while the European Union will agree pretty much to most anything on our island in terms of keeping the frictionless free border, I am not so sure it is going to give this have-cake-and-eat-it option to the UK Government in terms of bits and parts of the Single Market rules applying or not.</p><p>My instinct is that it will put the foot down over a border in the Irish Sea.  If there is to be a deal, that is a real risk for the European Union.  It is not a risk; to my mind it is a very likely prospect and one the European Union is entitled to pursue as a negotiating position, although we might want it to be more flexible because we want to keep good relations with the UK.  Again on that side I see risk.  No matter what way I look I see risk in the whole deal not going through and real risk to what happens in Northern Ireland.  We need to prepare for that.  We need to batten down the hatches and prepare for the worst eventuality.  Please God, it will not arise, but based on my political analysis and doing the numbers based on my simple junior certificate maths, it is not easy to see how it will get through.</p></speech>

The Fianna F&aacute;il leader said that he did not specifically ask for statements on Northern Ireland and Brexit at the same time; the debate was to be split.  There was a misunderstanding on that, but I do not want to cast aspersions on anybody.</p><p>I will respond on Northern Ireland first.  I repeat what has been said by many.  All political leaders need to stand together in condemning the violence we have seen in east Belfast and Derry in recent days.  We do not want to get used to hearing news of pipe bombs and automatic weapons in Northern Ireland again.  I thank the emergency services, the PSNI and the Northern Ireland fire service.  They have come under significant pressure in recent days.  That there has been no loss of life and no serious injury to date is testament to their professionalism.</p><p>I also thank the political and community leaders who have shown courage and bravery in the face of some intimidation, particularly in the Bogside interface area and the Fountain estate.  I recognise and thank those in this House who have played a role in that.  I hope to be able to visit Derry in the next ten days or so to express solidarity with those who are continuing to work and have achieved great things in community relations in recent years to ensure that Derry can fulfil its full potential as a vibrant and safe city in which communities interact with each other with maturity and a sense of honesty and togetherness.  We need to be firm, clear and totally unambiguous on the need to support non-sectarian co-operation to ensure that those who are small in number but are causing mayhem get a very clear message that they do not have the support of broader communities within which they are living.</p><p>While the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC, is important, we should not expect miracles from it.  We have agreed that David Lidington and I will chair the BIIGC.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, will also attend.  People will want to discuss some east-west issues of interest.  While we recognise this is not a decision-making body in terms of devolved issues for Northern Ireland, it is certainly a body where both Governments need to come together in consultation and discussion to ensure an agreement of which we are co-guarantors can be protected and implemented in the future.</p><p>Northern Ireland without devolved government simply does not function.  It would be wrong to blame what we are seeing at the moment entirely on the absence of an Executive.  Those who think that the absence of government and the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>in Northern Ireland is a safe strategy and that it will not result in an absence of certainty, momentum and progress on many issues, from legacy and reconciliation to basic decision making for Northern Ireland on healthcare, education, housing, homelessness and many other areas, are very mistaken.  Those of us who have got to know Northern Ireland well are right to be concerned at the political stagnation that has taken place in Stormont resulting in the lack of a functioning Executive and therefore the lack of leadership coming from the top to match the kind of community leadership we are now seeing on the ground to try to keep communities safe.</p><p>We - the Irish and UK Governments - will work together to do all we can to help the political parties find a way of accommodating each other.  I encourage people to think about the language they use in order to create an atmosphere that manages the tensions we are currently seeing through the summer months so that we can create a context in early September where we can get back to a proper political negotiation that can result in an Executive being formed again.</p></speech>

Every time we have a debate on Brexit in this House, the latest development in Brexit is being judged as if it is the final outcome.  Of course, there are problems with it, just as there are inconsistencies and concerns that the EU and Ireland would have about the White Paper published today.  This is a negotiation.  I have said this and people have questioned it, but in my view this has been a good week for the Brexit negotiations.  There was always going to be a moment in time where the British Prime Minister would have to exert her authority and she has done so in the last week.  We no longer have a divided British Cabinet.  We now have a British position that is the basis, I hope, for a serious negotiation to commence next Monday in Brussels.</p>  <p>  The EU also has a pretty clear position.  The points of difference will now have to be the focus of an intensification of negotiation so that we can move beyond that.  However, we are in a better place than we were a week ago.  We should recognise that and we should shift from political commentary in parliaments to an intensification of negotiation in the negotiation rooms of Brussels through the summer months to allow us, hopefully by the time we come back here in September, to focus on progress that has been achieved and perhaps compromise that has been achieved between the two negotiating teams.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.470" nospeaker="true" time="18:40:00" ><p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 15:</p><p>&ldquo;PART 7

MISCELLANEOUS</p><p>- (Deputy Willie O'Dea).</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.471" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200052#CCC00300"><p>Earlier in the debate, I gave a brief overview of the process the scrutiny of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has undergone to date.  It is only right the Bill should be subject to comprehensive scrutiny.  What I have difficulty with is that the amendment has not been subject to any scrutiny or consultation with a broad range of stakeholders who are likely to be affected by it.  Deputy O'Dea's proposal will certainly benefit from a regulatory impact analysis and pre-legislative scrutiny the same as the Bill or any other significant policy or legislative proposal.  It would be unwise for the Oireachtas to pass this amendment into law without the necessary scrutiny the proposal requires.</p>  <p>  There are many aspects of the amendment that cause me concern.  The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, appears to be the only body that would be responsible for making determinations under this amendment.  The WRC may decide that someone is an employee under the appropriate employment legislation but the scope section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners may also decide the same individual is not an employee for PRSI or tax purposes and therefore three State organisations would be at cross purposes.</p>  <p>  The definitions of "employee" vary in employment legislation depending on the purpose of the statute.  The definition of employee for the purpose of this Bill are the definition of employee contained in the two Acts the Bill seeks to amend, namely the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The provisions of these Acts do not extend to self-employed individuals.  However, one of the possible consequences of this amendment would be to broaden the definition of an employee in this legislation to include genuinely self-employed people.  That may not be what is intended but we fear it will be an unintended consequence.  It could mean a household engaging a tradesperson for a once-off job would have to provide the person with a statement of terms of employment within the first five days of the person doing the job or leave themselves open to a criminal prosecution if they fail to do so.  For example, if I or Deputy O'Dea were to hire a painter to decorate our house where we provided the paint and paintbrushes while the painter supplied the labour only, would we be deemed to be the employer of the painter or decorator?  Would we be required to ensure the painter is getting his or her daily or weekly rest breaks under the Organisation of Working Time Act?  Am I to instruct the painter to take his 15-minute rest break when he has worked for four and a half hours?  I am being flippant but it is just one example of what could arise as a result of the amendment.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware of the code of practice for determining self-employment status for individuals.  The reason the code of practice is not statutory is that every case is fact specific.  The WRC, the Labour Court, the scope section of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners are all capable of deciding whether an individual is an employee or not an employee for their purposes.  Different circumstances need different prescriptions.  When it comes to legislation dealing with employees, one size does not fit all.  The code of practice is a guide to the relevant authorities to assist them in determining employment status.  However, in the recent Henry Denny case, the Supreme Court noted that each case must be determined in the light of its particular facts and circumstances and it should be left to the statutory bodies that are more than capable of doing this, rather than trying to do the impossible by committing evolving case law into legislation.  This is evidenced by the recent case of an adjudicating officer of the WRC when designating six plasterers as employees within the meaning of both Acts that this Bill will amend.  They were awarded &euro;18,000 between them.  This is just one example of how the existing legislation provisions for determining employment status are working and seem to be working.</p>  <p>  Social welfare inspectors inspect a wide range of businesses as part of their ongoing compliance operations.  Inspections are also undertaken jointly with other agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the WRC and when evidence of non-compliance is detected, we pursue it and we will continue to do so.  Where misclassifications of workers as self-employed is detected, the correct class is determined and social insurance arrears are collected as required.</p>  <p>  I totally understand what the Deputy is trying to do.  I totally support it.  I respectfully ask him to consider withdrawing the amendment, publishing the very detailed and comprehensive work as a Private Members' Bill and I will wholeheartedly support it.  I will add anti-penalisation measures to it.  We could add a definition of what could potentially be called freelance contractors.  I know Deputy Penrose and all other Members have ideas about how we can tackle a very concerning and growing problem.  I do not believe we have given enough time, enough conversation, enough thought and enough consideration for me to accept the amendment.</p>  <p>  I apologise for the length of that diatribe but I had to say what I needed to say.</p></speech>

I and others have raised many times in the D&aacute;il the issue of the building sector, where this practice has become cancerous and widespread.  Self-employment is forced on bricklayers and many others leading to massive tax and welfare evasion.  Contrary to the rosy picture the Minister has painted of inspections taking place, none of these things have been followed up.  These contractors are continually re-engaged by the Government.</p>  <p>  The Minister has given a commitment that she will support a Bill.  We have a Bill which, I would wager, is quite similar.  I am not accusing Deputy O'Dea of plagiarism because ours is much stronger in some of the definitions included in it.  The Bill in question is waiting around.  I have been in regular contact with building workers for a number of years and they are waiting for this issue to be dealt with.  It is not just them.  The idea the Government has not been complicit in allowing this to spread is not the case because it happens in building in the education sphere, in particular it is rampant in schools and colleges.  There was a strike about four years ago.  It has been going on for a long time.  It leads to a very dangerous undermining of workers' conditions as well as a loss to Revenue.  It has spread.  Fair play to "Drivetime", which has done an excellent documentary about the growing practice even in RT&Eacute;.</p>  <p>  It is all very well to say this has not been thought about enough.  What will the Minister do about it?  She has produced nothing in the Bill when she knows it is a key area of exploitation of workers.  I can only conclude the Government has an interest in allowing this because these contractors are undercutting others.  We all know they have been driving down from Northern Ireland bringing workers down here who we assume are not paying into the system.  All of this has been reported by many workers who have been exposed to it.  That to which I refer is still going on.</p>  <p>  The amendment should be put.  It is obviously a very bad time because it is late, it is the final day of the D&aacute;il term and many people may not be around but it should be supported.  It is a step in the right direction.  The Minister has not said what she will come up with herself.  She is saying what she will do if someone produces a Bill but she is the Minister.</p></speech>

The Minister knows quite well, because her Department compiled a report that was published in January 2018, the implications, not only in terms of workers' rights and entitlements to redundancy and holiday pay but all the other things affected as a result of bogus self-employment.</p><p>The Minister is also acutely aware that it is costing this State up to &euro;80 million a year in lost pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions.  For her to appeal to the Opposition to bring forward legislation that she will support sets off alarm bells that no work has been done by her Department on bringing forward legislation to stop this horrendous practice that is rampant, predominantly in the construction sector, but which is also widespread in other areas.  Unfortunately, what we have got from the Minister and the Department are public relations, PR, exercises.  That is the extent of their response to bogus self-employment, namely, to launch a PR campaign.  There is a role for it in pointing out to people who may have ended up in bogus self-employment what they are entitled to and their rights but that is only one small part of it.</p> <p> I agree with the Minister that it is unfortunate there has been no pre-legislative scrutiny of Deputy O'Dea's amendment.  That is why we have Committee Stage, to go through issues like this in detail.  This amendment was brought to the table very late in the day and we have not been able to do that.  I have concerns about it.  This should be a stand-alone Bill, as opposed to being tacked on to the tail end of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017, which seeks to address serious issues facing many workers in precarious employment, on zero-hours contracts, if-and-when contracts and banded-hour contracts and goes some way to addressing those.  Some parties have brought forward Bills and I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say on them.  My party and I are working on a Bill which we hope to bring forward just after the summer recess.  There will be a multitude of Bills to choose from, with the glaring omission of one from the Minister and the Department.  It is up to Deputy O'Dea to decide what he wants to do on this and whether he wants to press it.  I will not be able to support because it has not received the scrutiny it needs and deserves. </p></speech>

How many times have we heard on the media today, and we heard it earlier from the T&aacute;naiste that some of the pilots have joined the picket lines today, the implication being that they do not have the support of their colleagues?  The reason their colleagues did not come out is that they are not directly employed, they are bogusly self-employed.  They wear Ryanair uniforms and fly Ryanair planes but they are forced to sign contracts which say they are officially self-employed.  Therefore they are in a vulnerable position and were not able to take a stand today but supported their colleagues who did do so.  It would be fitting and appropriate to pass an amendment which promotes the rights of workers who are in bogus self-employment.  This does not just apply to construction or the airline industry.  This is a growing trend in Irish society.</p>  <p>  There is a remarkable similarity between Deputy O'Dea's amendment and the Bill that we put forward late last year-----</p></speech>

Bogus self-employment is one of the biggest issues facing workers across the board, from English language teachers, to RT&Eacute;, Ryanair and the construction industry.  I recall meeting a guy, whose name I cannot recall, who wrote a book about bogus self-employment.  He was a courier in the late 1990s.  I think he met the Minister at one stage and explained exactly what bogus self-employment is.  It is a very important issue and should have been addressed before now.  Deputy O'Dea will decide what way he will go with this but if it is defeated, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection should consider pulling together the legislation on this issue with the Department speedily in the new term.  We could get it through the committee quite quickly, with the support of the Department.</p></speech>

Leaving aside the politics of the issue, the essence of the amendment is desirable.  We know there is a major problem in this country in bogus self-employment, most predominantly in the construction industry where it is estimated that in excess of 100,000 workers are in that category.  It is an issue in other areas such as, for example, haulage and pilots have been mentioned.  I also refer to the trend towards the gig economy, where employers refuse to take on the responsibilities of employing staff.  They are leaving to swing people who are desperate to get employment and to earn an income but who can only do that under the terms set out for them by their employer.  Increasingly, they are precarious terms.  That leaves the State at the loss of many hundreds of millions of euro in tax income and leaves workers in precarious positions in respect of job security, entitlement to sick pay and social security generally, as well as taking huge risks when it comes to workplace accidents and so on, not having any sick or injury cover.</p>  <p>  There is nothing to recommend allowing many people continue in the category of bogus self-employment.  It needs to be called out for what it is, a scam, and it needs to be ended.  Everybody has been aware of this growing problem for a long time in certain industries.  It is time to call a halt to it and to legislate against it.  People have spoken about Private Member's Bills, legislation or amendments they are in the process of bringing forward or have brought forward.  Be that as it may, there are principles involved here.  We should all be united on outlawing this practice.  The Minister spoke very strongly about the need to tackle the problem yet, as Minister, has brought forward no proposal whatsoever in this area.  We can all say that we could do a better job or will do something else in six months' time but there is an opportunity to do something now. </p><p>We know how hard it is to complete a Private Member's Bill, get time for it and see it through to its conclusion without the Government trying to stymie it along the way.  </p></speech>

I have raised this issue with the Minister on numerous occasions at every opportunity.  I have spoken extensively and comprehensively on it and probably more than anybody else in this House.  My colleague, Senator Nash, also brought forward a Bill on controlling bogus self-employment.  It is a long time out there and he was working on it for a long time.  It  is out there in the pot.  The only concern I have is this is focusing on only one aspect of the designation and all that goes with it.  A wider panoply of issues has to be addressed in respect of bogus self-employment.  We should not lose sight of that because it could be left there then.</p><p>Deputy O'Dea has put a significant level of work has gone into this Bill.  I acknowledge that because as someone who drafts Bill I know it is not easy work.  All the <i>indicia</i>of what constitutes self-employment and could lead to a person being classified as self-employed are derived from a huge corpus of case law, traversing as it does straight employment cases and Revenue cases.  I recognise some of them.  One of the problems of being self-employed, and I have spent my life being self-employed, is that sometimes people do not even know they are self-employed.  That is the worst of all worlds.  </p><p>The problem is that if a person does not have public liability insurance or employer's liability and an accident happens, he or she is written off.  That is apart from all the other issues that are so important in being an employee.  An employee knows that his or her proper PRSI contributions are being paid and are building toward proper pension entitlements when he or she reaches retirement age.  The same applies to illness benefits etc.  There is also a major loss of tax and PRSI contributions to the Social Insurance Fund.  That is extremely important and is there to assist people when they are in the gravest of difficulties.  The misclassifications process in designating a person or a group as self-employed is clearly to the benefit of the employer while the employee loses a whole raft and host of various benefits.  The one I always remember is the old wet time payment.  That was wiped out.  If my father, Lord have mercy on him, got wet time, it was reduced money but it was money.  If he was self-employed, he would have cycled 15 miles to work and then would have come back with nothing.  </p><p>The thrust of this amendment is in the right place.  I am broadly supportive but I remind Deputy O'Dea that this Bill is going into the Seanad and perhaps we could all put our heads together to widen it a little.  Notwithstanding our best efforts, we are not going to have this on the Statute Book until October.  Let us be clear about that.  There is going to be no magic wand because it has to go to the Seanad.  It will wend its way slowly through there because the Senators are entitled, as is their statutory obligation and duty, to ensure they scrutinise this legislation and contribute their tuppenny-ha'penny worth.  We have seen the Seanad work to good effect on other legislation and I applaud it for that.</p><p>As it then must go to the President, this is not going to happen overnight, as we said last night in respect of other matters.  That is notwithstanding our strong desire for this long-awaited legislation to deal with the small minority of employers who abuse their employees.  If this goes to the Seanad, whatever Deputy O'Dea is going to do with it, it will be important that we get an opportunity to have some input to strengthen it.  It is well drafted.  I am referring, however, to trying to identify who is self-employed, which is the biggest problem.  There are all sorts of ways of glossing over this and the courts have struggled at times to identify who is self-employed.  That may seem strange but they do, as do tribunals sometimes as well.  I am familiar with the Henry Denny case mentioned by the Minister and that is a case in point.  </p><p>Nevertheless, if a legislative tramline is laid down in legislation, it will be of great assistance to the courts.  The courts do not just look at the literal interpretation.  They also look at the schematic and teleological interpretations and often as well at what is said here in the D&aacute;il.  That can be introduced in the arguments in respect of a case.  It is useful from that perspective and perhaps in years to come I will use some of those things myself.  This issue of self-employment and bogus self-employment has been one of the greatest bugbears in recent years for trade unions and their members but is even a greater bugbear for those who are not members of a trade union and have no protection at all.  Trade unions at least get down in the trenches and fight, notwithstanding that they often have been defeated in this area as well.  They believe some legislation should be coming forward to deal with this issue.  </p><p>My support is unequivocal insofar as I want this dealt with but we could do much work in the next three to four months - it will be three to four months regardless of what people say - to get this right.  We have one opportunity to get it right and we should do so.  Last night we worked hard on this Bill to eradicate anomalies to ensure the objectives we are trying to achieve for workers would not be diluted by us putting in provisions that would lead to a dual interpretation or dual standards of proof.  That would mitigate the impact and objective of the Bill and quickly eradicate the benefits.  I am not saying that will happen but we could strengthen some of the points.  Deputy Brady had a point when he said the definition of bogus self-employment is worthy of primary legislation on its own.</p><p>It has been asked why we have not done that.  We have bogus self-employment Bills hanging around but it is very hard to get into that lottery.  I spent three years trying to get into the lottery when I was dealing with wind turbines and trying to stop them wrecking our communities in the midlands.  Lo and behold, I could not.  I know I am very unlucky because if I was the only person doing the lottery tonight and I had all of the numbers, something would go wrong so that I would not win.  My viewpoint about my luck was vindicated in the lottery - I was never selected from the lottery for Bills once in three years.  That is why people are sceptical of hanging around waiting for a Bill to come through.  There should be a hierarchy of Bills, particularly on employment rights and issues which should be promoted.  I await what Deputy O'Dea will say with interest.  He has also been on the floor of this House on various issues.  Whatever we do, I hope we achieve the ultimate objective of this Bill, which is ending the scourge of bogus self-employment.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.496" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200054#EEE00500"><p>I thank everybody who contributed to this amendment.  I listened carefully to what has been said.  I put forward the amendment because there is a cancer called bogus self-employment.  It was originally confined to one or two sectors of the economy, namely, construction etc.  It has spread, however, and is spreading.  If, as the Minister indicated, the Government is doing this, that and the other about it, whatever it is doing is not working because the problem is growing.  People are coming to me regularly who have been forced to designate themselves as self-employed, even when it was blatantly obvious that they were employees.  People working on construction sites in Limerick, and still working as we speak - some of them doing work for the Government - have been forced by subcontractors to designate themselves as self-employed.  I know people in the retail sector who also have been forced to designate themselves as self-employed, as well as in several other sectors.  I will come back to one or two of those in a moment.</p><p>It is a growing problem, and there has been no legislative response from the Government on it to date.  There has been no hint of a legislative response.  Being forced to designate oneself as self-employed when in fact one is just a worker, an ordinary employee, has very serious consequences.  Under the influence of the EU, successive governments have introduced a raft of legislation to protect employees, including legislation dealing with unfair dismissal and notice requirements.  It is wrong that any employer, no matter who he or she may be, can get rid of those protections at the stroke of a pen, or force the employee to give up his or her right to those protections, which have been hard won over a long time.  The question of the considerable loss of revenue also arises.  I will not go into it.  We know the implications this practice has for PRSI.  The Government is losing a very considerable amount of money as a result of this.</p> <p> The Minister said in response that this amendment had not received proper scrutiny, and Deputy Brady agreed with her.  I made an attempt to deal with this on Committee Stage.  Everybody, including Deputy Brady, to the best of my recollection, said that what I was proposing was not strong enough, that I was trying to deal with the issue by way of a code of practice and that what was needed was legislation and definitions.  I have now produced legislation and definitions.  It certainly has come very late in the night, but it will, as Deputy Penrose has rightly said, be scrutinised.  The Seanad will have plenty of opportunity to scrutinise this.  It will have the opportunity on Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage.  The Minister and her officials will have the whole summer now to scrutinise it.  If any amendments are required, or any amendments from the Seanad are accepted, they will come back to this House for further scrutiny.</p> <p> Deputy Penrose says that this probably requires separate legislation, and the Minister has said something similar.  That is no reason to vote against this amendment.  This amendment could be passed, and separate legislation could be produced by the Department which would strengthen or deal with any defects the Minister sees in this legislation.  She can strengthen the provisions or change the definitions.  I am not proud.  I do not mind if this is seen as merely a holding operation.  Incidentally, I genuinely did not read the Bill tabled by Deputy Barry.  It must have been an oversight on my part.  There is a phrase that great minds think alike.  We must have independently reached the same conclusion.  That this might warrant a second piece of legislation, that this might not be the appropriate place for this provision, or that the Bill could be strengthened or improved is a classic argument against accepting any proposal from the Opposition that the Government does not want to accept.</p> <p> Since the amendments were published I have come under considerable pressure to withdraw this amendment.  I have been accused of all sorts of things, including criminalising the flexibility that exists between employers and employees.  That is not true.  Employees and employers can make whatever arrangements they wish, and I do not want to interfere with those in any way, shape or form.  I am seeking to correct a situation in which a person is told that, because it suits the employer for several reasons, his or her job depends on changing his or her status.  That person is asked to sign a piece of paper stating that he or she is self-employed and told to contact the tax office or his or her accountant.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have proven totally passive in this situation.</p> <p> I have received a number of emails on this matter in recent weeks, and I want to read one.</p></speech>

I am the proposer of the amendment and I am looking for a bit of indulgence.</p>  <p>  I received an email from a person who is indirectly employed by the State.  He says that he is in bogus self-employment and that he has no rights or protections.  As far as he knows, companies do this to avoid paying tax, insurance and holiday pay.  He looked for help but the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection let him down.  He took his case to the scope section, which followed the same trend.  He says that he is not the only person facing these issues and believes that it will become a very big headache for the Government very soon.  I suggest that it is already a big headache for the Government.  I suggest to the Minister, in view of the fact that the Seanad will debate this matter and that she has ample time over the summer to make whatever changes she wishes to make, and the fact that nothing is preventing her from bringing in her own legislation at any stage, that nothing will be lost by including this amendment in the Bill.  It will send out a signal that this House is serious about the problem of bogus self-employment and that we intend to deal with it, not just in word but in deed.  I am proposing the amendment.</p></speech>

I stayed for this because it is a big issue. I should probably have tabled an amendment.  We have drafted a Bill on this issue that we would like to table.  The word will go out from this Chamber that this issue was debated and voted down.  I do not believe that workers will be standing on parliamentary cretinism or ceremony.  The Minister obviously has an interest in eradicating this practice.  We should vote for this amendment.  It can be worked on and amended.  I am surprised that reason might be used.  We have all used these Bills to table amendments, but it would be wrong if it was voted against due to a lack of scrutiny.</p></speech>

Something has to be done about bogus self-employment.  The Minister has acknowledged that, even though no legislation has been brought forward to that end.  This legislation will go to the Seanad, with or without this amendment.  A number of amendments will be made in the Seanad by Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties on different areas of this legislation.  Is the Minister sincere about addressing the area of bogus self-employment?  There is an opportunity for her, as Minister, to amend this amendment in the Seanad to address the areas where she feels issues might arise, such as any possible impact on the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I ask her, over the summer months, to have a look at this amendment, if it is agreed, and to bring forward her own amendments.</p>  <p>  If the Minister is sincere, and I have no reason to believe she is not, will she look at possible amendments over the summer to ensure that the Bill does what it says on the tin and addresses the area of bogus self-employment?  The practice is rampant, as numerous studies have shown, and is spreading across many areas.  I want to see an end to it.  The idea of bringing an end to this horrendous blight on our workforce has cross-party support.  Not only does it cause the loss of a large amount of money to the State in terms of PRSI, but more importantly, it is having a serious impact on the rights of workers.</p><p>That includes their holiday pay and terms and conditions which have been fought for long and hard.  I ask that of the Minister. </p></speech>

That actually does not matter at all.  The fact is that we are debating legislation that is going to become law over the next few months.  There is now an opportunity to do something to address the issue of bogus self-employment.  We are all aware that it is a widespread problem.  It is absolutely wrong.  It should be tackled and ended.  There is now an opportunity for us to do that.  I think for Deputy Brady to say that it can be done in the Seanad, or to appeal to the Minister to do it, is just passing the buck and playing politics.  The fact of the matter is that there is an opportunity to do something about it now.  It can be scrutinised or tweaked in the Seanad if there are any difficulties with it.  It is really important that this House makes a very clear statement to say that we are opposed to the whole practice of bogus self-employment.  It is the desire of this House to bring an end to that, and we should make that clear statement tonight.  As we go on our summer holidays, there is probably nothing more worthwhile that we can do than to vote to end that practice.  If there are any minor difficulties that need to be ironed out, that can be done in the Seanad.  Let us stop playing politics with it.</p></speech>

Whether we think we are winning each other over or peeving each other off, it is quite interesting to watch.</p>  <p>  I want to say again for the record that I totally appreciate what Deputy O'Dea is trying to do.  I genuinely do, and I hope he believes me.  To answer Deputy Brady's question, we had Second Stage of a Bill brought forward by the Labour Party in the Seanad a number of months ago.  The debate was extensive, and we could not agree to accept the Bill that day on the basis that a lot needed to be done with it.  Senator Nash agreed that day that we would take it offside.  We have been working on it extensively since then, and we hope to come back with that Bill.  It is not accurate to say that we have done nothing, although I take the compliment implied in saying that I can juggle seven balls in the air at the same time.  I take that compliment for what it is worth.</p>  <p>  We are working.  We have had numerous conversations during oral questions about the penalisation measures that I want to bring in.  The example that people have given here this evening is the construction industry.  I wish there were 100,000 people working in the construction industry because then maybe we would get more houses built.  However, there are not.  That issue is still prevalent in that sector, but it is actually far more prevalent in very highly paid jobs, which nobody seems to have mentioned here today.  Our pharmaceutical industry, our IT industry and our gaming industry-----</p></speech>

While those arrangements might have been engaged in co-operatively between the employer and the employee, the State is losing money.  It is not the Government that is losing out.  People have said on a number of occasions today that the Government is losing money.  It is not the Government; it is the State.  When we sit down to deal with a social welfare Bill and try to fight over where this fiver or that fiver is going, it is those resources that are diminished.</p>  <p>  There are things we genuinely want to do.  I want to bring in penalisation measures and a new status and classification, perhaps called a "third worker".  They might be a contractor or a freelancer, but they will have all the rights under employment legislation that an employee has today.  Members already know that the track record of the last Government was to extend social insurance benefits to people who are genuinely self-employed, or not genuinely self-employed.  Our record on this is earnest, albeit that Members might criticise it as too slow.  We are going to get there.  </p>  <p>  I would love to be able to tell Deputy Brady that during the summer we will sit down and try to fix this and come back to the Seanad to amend it, but I will not be dishonest.  If I do that, then this Bill is not going to see the Seanad this side of Christmas.  I would like to remind all Members that what we have been doing for the past year, very thoroughly, as lots of the Members in this Chamber have pointed out, is that we have been trying to get the people who are working far more hours on a consistent basis, week in, week out, to be put on a banded hours contract that actually reflects the reality of how they are working so that they can go about living their financial lives in a more secure measure.  We have actually been trying to ban if-and-when contracts for the past year and bring in penalisation measures so that people who are in those situations have the guts and self-confidence to take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and know that they will win.</p>  <p>  This Bill has been delayed long enough, partly because of me and partly because of filibustering.  I will not make a commitment that will ensure that it will be delayed further.  I was not trying to pass the buck earlier when I asked Deputy O'Dea to take out his amendment and put it as a stand-alone Bill.  I said a million times in this House that there is no monopoly on wisdom.  I have no problem supporting a Private Members' Bill from any part of the Opposition, whether it is from the smallest party like Solidarity-People Before Profit or the biggest party like Fianna F&aacute;il.  We all collectively want the same thing.  I encourage Members to acknowledge that this Bill needs to get in and out of the Seanad and back here as quickly as possible, so that the people in Dunnes Stores, who we have been talking about for weeks, can actually get onto the banded hours contracts that they deserve to be on and get the employment rights that we have all been working on over the past year enshrined in legislation.  On that basis, I will be voting against the amendment.</p></speech>

Will the Minister of State clarify why he is going for an additional new fund, as opposed to extra contributions going into the existing insurance compensation fund, ICF?  We are setting up a motor insurers insolvency compensation fund but will the Minister of State explain the logic behind that given the ICF is designed to deal with the fallout from the failure of an insurance company?  There is the question of the need for an extra fund and why it is not being dealt with in the existing structure of the ICF.</p>  <p>  A new levy will be put in place on insurance policies.  My understanding is that once the amount accumulates to &euro;150 million, the rate will reduce to 1% from 2%.  Will the Minister of State clarify how quickly he expects the levy to be applied?  I am sure he will say it is a matter for insurance companies how it is collected but in reality this will be passed to policyholders.  At a rate of 2%, it should collect in the region of approximately &euro;70 million per year.  After two years or so will the 2% become 1%, and after a further year will that become zero?  Is it correct that in total there will be approximately three years where the levy is applied to reach the &euro;200 million or so, meaning the levy will no longer be collected?  It would be helpful if the Minister of State could clear up some of those matters.</p></speech>

They seem to be getting screwed the whole time.  As Deputy McGrath has pointed out, when the threshold is reached, is there something to ensure it will be dropped from 2% to 1% or zero?  Is there a forecast from the Department?  If the insurance companies are taking the brunt, will it be dropped?  I have a fear as insurers currently love trying to saddle these things on motorists.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.527" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200058#JJJ01600"><p>Insurers are private businesses and therefore the Minister for Finance cannot direct them to absorb these particular costs.  It is a matter for the insurance company whether to absorb them or not.  If they are seeking market share and pricing accordingly, they can absorb them.  If the Minister interfered in the pricing of insurance products, he would, in effect, be requiring insurers to sell products at a lower price than they consider appropriate.  That would certainly run into difficulty from a solvency perspective and it would be viewed as weakening their balance sheet.  It is not a matter for the Minister.</p>  <p>  On the basis that there would be no call on the fund prior to it building to its target level of &euro;200 million, it is anticipated the process would take approximately seven years.  At the 2% level, the contribution is expected to collect approximately &euro;34 million to &euro;40 million per annum for approximately four years.</p></speech>

The rate will revert to zero at that point because &euro;200 million is the appropriate figure for the fund.</p><p>In the review of the framework for motor insurance in Ireland, it was recommended that the 35% payment from industry be made via the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, MIBI.  The industry opposed this approach, as in its view it created an open-ended exposure, and the industry would never know what is its obligations.  In other words, it could be 35% of a very small amount or a very large amount, depending on the size of the insurer going into liquidation.  Industry argues this would create uncertainty and unpredictability, leading to higher capital charges.  It also made the case that the proposal would make Ireland unattractive to new entrants.  Instead, the industry proposed the establishment of an <i>ex ante</i>fund into which it would make a contribution equivalent to 2% of gross motor insurance premiums.  Such a fund, once built, would allow the industry to meet its obligations.  It would also create certainty as to what an insurer's exposure would be in any year to an insolvency, and it was indicated that a similar level of certainty is found in the UK and French models.</p><p>The option for the State to advance the necessary funds to the ICF to cover the full 100% compensation for third party motor insurance and recover the money by the existing 2% levy over time was one of the options considered in the regulatory impact analysis carried out in preparing the general scheme of the Bill, which was rejected in favour of the current proposal.  In adopting the approach I have outlined, the Minister is seeking to strike a balance between protecting third party claimants affected by an insolvency and minimising the exposure to the Exchequer, particularly in the event of an insolvency of a larger insurer.  At the same time, the Minister is seeking to ensure that industry shares the burden of the increased coverage of the ICF while creating predictability and certainty for industry with respect to the exposure in the case of financial insolvency and maintaining attractiveness for new entrants.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the new levy applies to gross written motor premiums.  Therefore, the insurance compensation fund, ICF, levy is for all non-life policies.  In effect, the Minister of State is saying, broadly speaking, that the amount to be applied to motor premiums accounts for approximately half of the non-life insurance book.  According to the research we have, the ICF contribution is approximately &euro;70 million per annum.  The Minister of State is saying that the new fund, with a levy of 2%, will collect between &euro;34 million and &euro;40 million per annum.  It would take approximately four years to get to the &euro;150 million target.  The Government will then reduce the rate to 1% and it will be in place for a further three years.  For the next seven years people are looking at 3% stamp duty, which is permanent because it is taxation.  Then, they are looking at the 2% insurance compensation fund levy, which will apply to all non-life insurance policies for the next three or four years.  That will go towards the new motor insurance insolvency compensation fund.  Then, for the following three or four years the rate will be 1%.</p>  <p>  Am I right in saying that, provided there is no further drawdown from the insurance compensation fund to clear out the legacy liability from Quinn Insurance, we are looking at probably another 12 years?  Is the intention then that the levy will remain in place to build up the fund?  It is in deficit currently to the tune of &euro;800 million.  Would it remain in place in future to build up a fund?</p></speech>

It is the same fund or structure that was used for PMPA and that process concluded in 1991.  The opportunity is still there to use the legislation to build up a fund in future.  I do not know the answer to the question.  It is undecided.  The logical approach would be to continue it to have an amount of money for an insolvency in future, but that would depend on the circumstances with the industry.  Certainly, it would have run for a long period by then.  It would be a matter, perhaps, for some other Minister for Finance a decade from now.</p></speech>

At the moment there are areas where a person may buy a house that never flooded but because the company has that property on a map, it will refuse the new owner insurance.  At the same time, insurance companies from other countries have gone into liquidation or gone bust and we are trying to ensure we protect the people affected.  I agree with that 100%.  To put it bluntly, the taxpayer has come to the aid almost every time there has been a problem with these companies.  Yet, the companies pick and choose what they will do in the line of the people affected.  Does the Minister of State believe there is anything we in the D&aacute;il can do about this?  Deputy Michael McGrath introduced a Bill to try to solve some of these issues.  Is there something we can do to ensure there is give and take?  The insurers must take some of the punishment when something happens.  Can we put in clauses to the effect that insurers have to adhere to strict terms and conditions to help people who are in a vulnerable position?</p></speech>

They are structured and established to pay out in the event of a winter storm, for example, or an accident.  The companies will calculate on the basis of the information available and the more information they have, the better.</p>  <p>  I know what Deputy Fitzmaurice is talking about.  It may be a desktop exercise to evaluate whether an area will flood.  My experience is that if people get correctly qualified hydrologists, people who can show that the event will not happen, then the desktop exercise can be questioned.  At that stage the potential exists for the insurance company to proceed differently on the basis of a proper flooding report rather than simply a desktop exercise, and that report would have more credence.</p></speech>

Its scope has widened because the analysts have looked at one in 100 year events and one in 1,000 year events.  I imagine the Minister of State has, like every other Deputy, encountered cases such as those I have encountered in Roscommon.  A person may be selling a house on a hill, but the CFRAM report will have that house in the category of a one in every 1,000 year event, even though water never came near it.  In one case, the bank would not give a mortgage to the buyers for the simple reason that they could not get insurance, even though the house was already insured.  If the people who owned the house kept it, they would continue to get insurance but a new person buying the house would be refused insurance.  This is causing problems because people are left with houses they have to stay in or else someone needs raw cash to buy them because the banks will not give a loan and the prospective buyer will not get insurance cover.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State envisage a remedy for such cases?  When insurance companies go bust, the State covers the people the companies claim to have insured.  They are looked after and there is no liability on the person who had the insurance policy.  Does the Minister of State envisage that something will be done to ensure people who are vulnerable are able to get some cover, perhaps by applying 1% levy on insurance premiums to deal with such cases?</p></speech>

Deputy McGrath outlined the 3% stamp duty and the 2% levy to pay for the Quinn Insurance debacle.  That fund is still in deficit to the tune of &euro;770 million.  Now we have another 2% to pay for Setanta Insurance and Enterprise Insurance.  I do not envisage that would be the case.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State is aware, more than 1,500 active claims remain arising from the collapse of that company four years ago.  Will the Minister of State provide some clarity for the people who were caught up in that and who are involved in those outstanding claims?  When does he envisage that this welcome provision will be made?  When will the 65% cap be removed and when will the people in question have their outstanding claims paid in full?  They keep asking me - and I keep asking the Minister of State - when this will happen.  A later section, section 12, provides for more frequent payouts from the insurance compensation fund.  The period will change from every six months to every three months.  Will the Minister of State deal with that central question on Setanta?</p>  <p>  The limits are being removed in respect of third-party claims.  This section sets out the detail.  Up to &euro;1.22 million is set out for injury to property in the case of third-party insurance claims and any person injury claims will be met in full.  That is the position for third-party claims.</p><p>I understand, however, that a limit will remain for first-party claims.  Will the Minister of State explain why a distinction is being drawn between first-party claims and third-party claims?  The reforms in the Bill are welcome, but we will be left with a situation where one category of claimant is being treated differently from another.</p></speech>

I refer specifically to customers of Setanta.  Third-party claims will be paid.  If someone had comprehensive insurance on a vehicle and was involved in an accident, would the customer be paid for his or her car if that customer had comprehensive insurance?  Up to now, that was being paid at 65%.  People have gone to the courts.  I understand that litigation has been brought in some cases where the car driver was sued and had insurance in good faith.  Are cases that have been adjudicated already at 65% or at the threshold of &euro;825,000 paid or will it be sorted with this new Bill?</p>  <p>  For people who had insurance with Setanta, where there were individuals or there might have been households which had paid out a considerable amount of money on insuring cars and vans and lost that money because they were told to get insurance somewhere else immediately, will they be in any way reimbursed for what they lost?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200060#LLL02600"><p>No, this will not cover that.  If a customer had insurance, say they had paid a full year's premium a couple of days before the company went into liquidation, unfortunately, they are not covered by this.</p>  <p>  On a person who was involved in an accident where the 65% was paid, there were circumstances where individuals took the other person who was liable for the accident to court for the remaining 35%.  This concludes that.  The 35% will then be paid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200060#LLL02700"><p>This gets back to the kernel of the issue for Setanta.  It is the question of when.  Will the Minister of State clarify that there is no limit as to the number of claims and the financial quantum of such claims that can be dealt with fully in the next cycle of ICF payouts, which under this legislation will be every three months?  Therefore, provided the terms of the claim are agreed and settled, is there any restriction on administering the 100% payout?  In some cases 65% has been paid out and 35% is outstanding, but there are 750 claims where zero has been paid out so far.  Will the whole lot be paid out and washed through, as it were, ideally in one go, in claims where a settlement figure is agreed?  I need to clarify this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.571" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200060#LLL02800"><p>I will read from the briefing note and answer that for the Deputy.  It says that under the new regime, the State Claims Agency will make an application to the High Court in accordance with the amended legislation no more than once in any three-month period.  Therefore, the twice yearly, or six-month, period will now be four times a year.  The State Claims Agency will make that application.  Therefore, from a practical perspective it is hoped that within three months of the Bill being signed into law, any claim which has been settled and 65% paid will receive the balance owing of 35%.  Within three months of this being finished, the approximately 50% of claims that have been settled, that is, paid at 65%, will receive the outstanding 35%.</p></speech>

That will conclude the first half, approximately, of the claims at 65% plus the 35%.</p>  <p>  Any claims recently settled will receive their full payment.  If any claims are concluded in the period from when the last lodgement was with the High Court, they will be paid in a single payment of 100%.  It is important, therefore, that any application is made at the optimum time to ensure that as many claimants as possible receive the compensation due to them in this first application post enactment of the Bill.</p>  <p>  In this regard the liquidator for Setanta has informed the Department that a further 117 claims have settled since the last tranche was submitted to the State Claims Agency for verification.  These claims will be included in the next application to the High Court and are of the value of &euro;5.1 million, being 100% of the total value of the settled claims.  That leaves about 750, about half, the claims plus another 117, so a total of around 870 claims which will have been concluded.</p>  <p>  The other aspect is that unless people choose to finalise the settlement, whether it is 65% as it was in the past with a question mark over the 35%, it is somewhat irrelevant.  If people choose not to settle and they want to go to court, that is a matter for the individuals.</p></speech>

A further 223 claimants have not yet had their damage-only claims settled.  Is the Minister of State aware of any reason so many claims remain unsettled?  Is there any reason that is particular to the collapse of Setanta?  Obviously, there is always a tail effect in dealing with claims.  Under normal circumstances, claims can continue for years.  Has any issue related to the collapse of Setanta resulted in figures not yet being agreed in so many claims?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, under the Irish insurance structure, some claims continue for a very long period.  There is a belief the longer they take to conclude, the more money that can accrue.  That is often said to be the case, but I do not know whether it is.  We are dealing with what is in front of us.  We are trying to conclude the 65% of the half that are settled, adding to it the 35%, plus 117.  That concludes that number of claims, minus the 900.  The remaining 645 have not been concluded.  I do not have any information on whether the percentage among that tranche of claims is higher or lower than among any other.</p></speech>

They are relevant to this section.  The message for claimants involved in the Setanta issue is to try to reach a settlement and agree on what the amount of compensation for a personal injury or damage to property is to be.  If agreement is reached, it will have to go through a process involving the State Claims Agency for verification before the process can be executed in the High Court.</p></speech>

It is to be administered by the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI.  It has been described as an <i>ex ante</i>fund.  It is intended that it will be built up in advance of a failure of an insurance firm, something we hope will never affect Irish consumers again.  Will the Minister of State clarify that the fund will have full statutory effect?  Is its administration entirely a matter for the MIBI?  As I understand it, the MIBI is a collaborative arrangement between the insurance industry and the Department.  Will the Minister of State clarify how the fund will be administered?  What oversight or controls will there be to ensure it will be administered to the highest standards?  Will there be an audit trail?  What level of accountability will there be for this fund?  Will the Minister of State clarify these matters?</p></speech>

It will be a private industry, rather than a State, fund.  Therefore, how the fund is held and managed will be a matter for the MIBI and the insurance industry.  In terms of accountability, the Bill provides for the MIBI to advise the Minister for Finance of the amount held in the fund annually, or on request.  The annual amount of contributions payable by individual insurers will be certified by an auditor.</p></speech>

The Minister of the day will be able to look for information on the balance within the fund at any point and the MIBI will be compelled to provide that information on request.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with the oversight provisions from the perspective of the State?  It will be important for the administration of the fund to be subject to adequate oversight and accountability provisions, given that it will be the ultimate backstop in the case of the balance of 35%.</p></speech>

Does he intend to complete the passage of the Bill through both Houses next week in order that it can be signed into law by the President without further delay?  I thank the Minister of State for his personal interest in this issue.  I have been on his case about Setanta and the need to put in place a structure to protect Irish consumers if another such collapse happens.  We must bear in mind that the people caught up in the nightmare had taken out valid insurance policies and paid for them in Ireland.  They had bought those policies from an insurance company that was regulated principally in Malta but was also regulated here for conduct of business purposes.  When it failed, they were left in the lurch in a very bad way for a long period.  Like the Minister of State, I personally know of many cases in which great trauma and distress have been caused to individuals and families by the significant delays in having the issue dealt with.  I recognise that it was groundbreaking in some ways because the exact responsibilities of the insurance compensation fund and tje MIBI in this scenario had to be clarified.</p><p>That went all the way through the court system.  We eventually got that clarity.  I would have liked to have seen the issue finalised and provided for much earlier but I welcome the fact we are now on the brink of a really important breakthrough for the people who were caught up in the collapse.</p> <p> The legislation also provides certainty for those other consumers in Ireland who are buying insurance policies.  It gives them a safeguard and knowledge that, in the event of another company getting into financial difficulty and ultimately failing, we are giving legislative backing to the full honouring of any outstanding claims caught up in any such collapse.  That is right and proper.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure the Bill completes its passage next week in the Senate and, I hope, gets signed into law.  I hope that, in the autumn, the next tranche of payments can be administered and that as many of the individual outstanding claims as possible will be settled in full so people can move on with their lives.</p></speech>

Many who took out policies were very uneasy because they were afraid for their houses and properties.  They were very afraid of being bothered after doing things right.  Senanta Insurance came in here.  Under European legislation, is there anything that will ensure what happened will not happen again on a Europe-wide basis?  Does the Union not have a set of rules or guidelines to prevent a recurrence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-07-12a.608" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018071200062#NNN00300"><p>I will deal with the last point first.  There is not such a set of rules.  Insurance, being the business it is, has capital amounts underwriting business and cash coming in to try to ensure there are sufficient cash reserves to settle claims.  As sure as there are insurance companies, there will be insurance company failures.  I would not say we have been quarrelling over how exactly to put in place the best structure but there was a pretty substantial court procedure - involving the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court.  Until that was concluded, it was very difficult for the State to intervene.  In the short period from December 2017 until January of this year, we moved as quickly as we could after the actuarial analysis was concluded to try to ensure those people who adhered to the law correctly and appropriately and found themselves facing a potential claim through no fault of their own would be facilitated in the way we have facilitated them, bringing the level up to a level similar to the one in question, maybe involving the ICF.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Michael McGrath.  I am aware of his determination to try to bring this to a conclusion.  I appreciate that on all occasions he was just pursuing the matter on behalf of his constituents.  This applies to all the Deputies who questioned me and my predecessors.  It is absolutely my intention to have no amendments in the Seanad.  With no amendments there, we will be able to conclude this legislation next week, in this term.  It will then go to the President for his signature.  The matter will be finished and then it will be a matter of the administrative process for the next tranche, which will be three months from the enactment of the legislation.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Bill 2018 was published today.  This is an important Bill because, when enacted, it will enable the Central Bank of Ireland to publish a range of information on an annual basis to increase transparency on the relationship between insurance premiums and related costs, identify current and emergency trends within the market, identify the factors that drive movements in the price of insurance in the State, and provide information on the number of claims, as well as providing statistical analyses of the costs associated with settling those claims and, importantly, understanding the settlement channels used by the insurance companies.  It is essential that we get the Bill through both Houses in the next term so it can be operational in 2019.  The Central Bank is currently trying to establish how we will deal with the national claims information database for motor insurance first.  We feel it is appropriate to establish it in the motor sector first, and then we will move to the employer liability and public liability sectors.</p></speech>
