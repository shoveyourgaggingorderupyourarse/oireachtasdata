I do not attribute blame to any particular individual, including the Minister or anybody else.  Everything that could be done has been done and I acknowledge that there were difficulties during the past year due to Covid.  However, needs must, and the emerging is situation very serious, first, from the point of view of parents of a child with severe sensory and emotional difficulties who cannot find a safe location where their child can receive in-house care and therapy.  Many parents continually approach us who are at the end of their tether trying to deal with this on their own.</p>  <p>  The next group is adolescents who have difficulties of a serious nature and it is again impossible to find a place for them.  They may have eating disorders and be affected in various ways, and suffer from sporadic attacks over which they have no control.  These unfortunate adolescents do not understand what is happening.  This is happening around them and it is the life they live.  It is their little world and, as it unfolds in front of them, it is not great.  The problem is the services are not available to address the issues on time.</p>  <p>  I refer to the next group of the older adolescents and young adults.  They have mental health issues, but they do not have any experience of life.  They do not know whether this is normal.  They are where they are and they know it is not a happy place to be.  Their parents stay with and try to help them in every way.  Sadly, many of them end up in prison and are detained while awaiting a court hearing.  I dealt with such a case in recent weeks.  This is an appalling situation.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that this is not the fault of the Minister of State.  This goes back 20 years during which time there has been growing demand and a failure to address the issue on an ongoing basis because of other competing demands, which we all accept that.  I ask the Minister of State to make a special effort to identify this cohort of people who are desperate, as are their parents and siblings, and unable to cope.  The stress on the families and the individuals is significant and increasing.  We have dealt with many cases where, due to the stress, the individuals harm themselves seriously or, worse, find an ultimate way out that does not solve any problem, but creates more.</p>  <p>  We need to make a salutary move on this problem now.  This cannot wait.  We need to address the issues.  I have only given a small number of examples but every Member will have multiple examples of the same experiences.  Let us do whatever must be done to put in place the measures required to accommodate the needs of such patients and to recognise their difficulties for what they are, and to address the issues in a meaningful way.  Let us do this now and give them hope for the future.  Let us give them an indication that society cares for them and is prepared to help them in a meaningful way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900003#A00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue today.  I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.</p>  <p>  We care, society cares and the Government cares.  The continued development of specialist services for eating disorders, including improved access and shorter waiting lists, remain a key priority for the Government, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Butler, the Department and the HSE.  In response to the growth in the number of cases presenting to mental health services, the HSE developed a national clinical programme for eating disorders in partnership with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and Bodywhys, the national support group for people with eating disorders.</p>  <p>  The eating disorder model of care was launched in 2018 and &euro;5.7 million was allocated to date for the implementation of this programme.  The clinical programme will establish an eating disorder network, including eight adult teams and eight child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams in total.  Some &euro;1.77 million has been invested to date in eating disorder specialist posts with 21.8 whole-time equivalent posts in place.  It is of critical importance that the Minister of State secured the balance of &euro;3.94 million to be made available to the programme, which will enable further investment in specialist posts throughout this year.  This comprises the completion of the three existing specialist eating disorder teams and the establishment of three new teams.  The three existing specialist eating disorder teams are located in CHO 4 CAMHS, CHO 7 CAMHS and CHO 6 adults.  The three new teams in development include the adult teams in CHO 9, CHO 4 and the CAMHS team in CHO 2.  Recruitment for all teams is progressing well and each CHO is fully committed to this process and is on target to have staff recruited by year end.</p>  <p>  While there is much to be done, the progress made to date with existing teams has had a significant impact.  In 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of eating disorder assessments compared to 2019, with twice as many people starting treatment.  This trend continued in 2021.  Specialist outpatient treatment has been found to be the most effective and fastest way for most people with eating disorders to recover.</p> <p>More than 90% of people with eating disorders can be supported in the community, avoiding more serious inpatient treatment.  However, a small number of people may require inpatient care for short periods for structured refeeding and stabilisation.  Inpatient care is currently provided in the four regional CAMHS units across the country.  Linn Dara and Merlin Park have dedicated six and eight beds respectively, and while there are no dedicated beds in the remaining two CAMHS units, all beds are available to eating disorder admissions.  A further eight beds are planned for an eating disorder unit in the national children's hospital.</p> <p> I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, recently visited the CAMHS eating disorder teams in Dublin and Cork to get an understanding of how the service operates on the ground.  Adults who require inpatient care are admitted to local general adult approved centres.  CHO 6 has three dedicated beds for eating disorders based in St. Vincent's University Hospital.  The number of adult beds will increase, including an additional three beds in St. Vincent's, five in north Dublin, five in Galway and five in Cork.  These beds will be linked to eating disorder hubs.  Significant enhancements have also been achieved in the area of digital supports for people with eating disorders.</p> <p> In March 2020, the free national clinical programme for eating disorders and Bodywhys application was launched.  Telehealth has rapidly been enhanced and existing service users can access specialist eating disorder teams, who are providing ongoing care throughout the pandemic.  More than 500 therapy sessions have been delivered to date.  The development of all aspects of mental health services, including specialist services for eating disorders, continues to be a priority for Government, the Minister of State, the Department and the HSE.  This is reflected in the current programme for Government and our national mental health policy.</p></speech>

I accept that the Minister of State is doing everything possible and is very active on the ground.  As we all know in this House, no matter how active someone is, some things get away from him or her.  Often, if things are supposed to work a certain way, it does not necessarily follow that they work that way.  Another complication for young adults and adults is if they have an addiction.  If they have an addiction, they will not be taken by most places.  They have to seek treatment for that.  People have to take time out to get treatment first, otherwise they will not get accommodation at all.  This is crazy.  I do not blame the Minister of State.  The exigencies within which we work are ridiculous and they do not address the significant challenges in front of us.</p>  <p>  I know of one case where an individual is in prison because he has a mental problem.  He got into a situation where he broke the law, as has happened many times in the past and will happen in the future.  The sad part of it is that he will probably receive a prison sentence, having done nothing else wrong but being unable to access treatment for his condition.  That is a recent issue and there are numerous other such incidents.  We all have to join parents at night, sometimes as late as midnight, where they have been waiting all day, or for two or three days, to gain access.  It is challenging all the way.  I compliment the Minister of State on the work that has been done but there is a need to poke the bear more, identify the snags, and ensure, whatever is being done now, that efforts are redoubled in a way that brings the necessary treatment within the reach of parents, siblings and all of the families of those affected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900004#B00300"><p>The continued development of a special service for eating disorders, including improved access and shorter waiting lists, remains a key priority for the Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, the Department of Health and the HSE.  As stated, &euro;3.94 million is available to the national clinical programme for eating disorders and will enable further investment in specialist posts throughout the year.  Only last night, the Minister of State acknowledged in the House that there is a fundamental flaw with regard to waiting lists, which is the recruitment process.  It takes 50 weeks to recruit a person into a post.  She was successful in securing the funding but the funding is only as good as the people when they arrive through the doors of their units.  I have announced a lot and re-announced what the Minister of State has committed to, but until the people arrive in the posts, we will not see that service delivered or any relief whatsoever for those families, no matter what age they are presenting at, whether they are looking for support at local hospitals or from CAMHS teams.  I listed a number of CHOs but I notice that Deputy Durkan's CHO was not included.  It needs to be addressed at a local level.</p>  <p>  There is not a Deputy in this Parliament who has not been impacted by dual diagnosis.  We all know that when people have mental health issues, there is always something else coupled with it and there is usually an underlying condition.  It breaks out in other formats, whether drinking, drugs or antisocial behaviour.  There needs to be understanding and empathy but we need to look at dual diagnosis.  When the Deputy talks about poking the bear, I think that we have the right Minister of State in the right role to do that.</p></speech>

I thank the staff for ensuring that everybody got out safely and the emergency services for the quick response and the manner in which they dealt with the issue.  I met with Vincent Cleary and other staff at the site yesterday.  They are shaken but resolute and resilient, as they have proven previously.  It is a popular company and family.  It is professional in the way in which it has grown the business to be world-renowned.  It is a leader in its own field in the promotion of dairy and organics.  It was in that field long before many others could even spell the word.  It has acted as a mentor to many other people in my constituency and beyond.  It is now time for that to be reciprocated in this hour of need for Glenisk and the Clearys.  I was initially very proud of the reaction that I have seen in the community, locality and constituency, being the faithful people that we are, and even beyond that, nationally and internationally, and heard in the floods of support across the divide in the business sector.</p>  <p>  I spoke with the Taoiseach's office yesterday.  I know he has made contact with the company and managing director, ensuring them that the State will make every effort to assist in their hour of need.  I use this opportunity to ask the Minister of State to assure me, the company and, by extension, our constituents, that the Government through its State authorities, the relevant Departments, whether the Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which deals with planning, will ensure that arms of the State immediately come to the assistance of this company and provide it with every sort of help, assistance and expertise that is necessary for it to rebound and regain its place as a world-renowned company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900004#B00500"><p>I concur with what has been said by the previous speaker.  This is a significant blow in the local area.  The Deputy referred to County Offaly.  There will also be a significant effect in County Laois, since there is an effect on the workforce.  Almost 90 people were working in that business.  It is a sustainable business, with long-serving staff, some of them with up to three decades of service, on the Laois-Offaly border.  Glenisk is a strong brand.  Anybody who likes yoghurt will know that.  It is a sustainable brand.  It is an organic, quality product.  It has been built up over a long time.  In fairness to the company, it is still taking milk supplies but 50 farmers are dependent on this plant as well.  It is important to the local economy.  Unfortunately, that business which has been built up over three decades is a burnt-out shell now and there is not even a phone line going into it.  I spoke to somebody from the company yesterday.  To say that they are shocked would be an understatement.  The loss of 90 jobs in this area is the equivalent of 900 in Dublin.  The Minister of State will be aware of that.  I would have thought this was a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, whom I acknowledge is out of the country.</p> <p>I welcome that the Minister of State is present because he represents the constituency and he knows what myself and Deputy Cowen are talking about and how important it is.  The company wants to rebuild and that will take time.  I contacted the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment yesterday, like the previous speaker, urging it to engage with the company and the managing director, Mr. Vincent Cleary.  I heard him on the radio early yesterday morning when I was coming here and he said he hoped to have a preliminary plan in place by mid-morning.  That shows the kind of energy that they have put into the company over the years to drive it and build it.  We need to provide each and every support we can to this company and to the work force.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900005#C00200"><p>I have been asked to take this on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who cannot be here this morning.  I thank Deputy Cowen for raising this important issue in the Tullamore-Killeigh area of County Offaly, as it relates to a long-standing business there.  I also acknowledge Deputy Stanley for raising the matter, which affects the Laois side of the constituency because Killeigh is quite close to the county boundary.</p>  <p>  It was a shock to all of us to learn of the fire at the Glenisk yogurt factory in Killeigh on Monday, 27 September.  Thankfully, there was no loss of life and the company and its staff must be commended on their swift action and adherence to their fire safety protocols in achieving this.  Glenisk is a long-established business in the midlands and Offaly.  It was started in 1987 by Jack and Mary Cleary and has been continued by the family.  Vincent Cleary is now a very active managing director of the business. It has approximately 90 loyal staff, many of whom have been there for more than 20 years, and it has 50 suppliers of organic milk and it is also important that be maintained. </p>  <p>  Glenisk is a long-established client of Enterprise Ireland, an agency of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.  I am informed by officials in the Department that Enterprise Ireland have been in contact with the company following the fire.  The company is assessing the damage at present, and Enterprise Ireland has indicated that the company will have the full support of the agency as its rebuilds and recovers.  That is the most important thing that I can say today, namely that State agencies will assist in every way because Glenisk is a brand leader, not only locally but internationally, including across the EU.  Deputy Cowen mentioned other State agencies that could play a role.  He also mentioned planning issues and I will come back on that.  My Department is clear on what has to be done and the Government will do that through Enterprise Ireland and the Department.  </p>  <p>  Job losses were mentioned.  I hope there are no job losses at the end of this.  It was a shock but the Cleary family is determined to get business up and running in Glenisk as soon as possible.  I was very encouraged by their early remarks, after they recovered from the shock, about regrouping and rebuilding.  That is the spirit that has brought them this far and I know it will continue into the future.  </p>  <p>   For those not familiar with the business, the company operates in the competitive landscape of high-end, premium organic yogurt, competing with Danone brands, Activia and Libert&eacute;, and with Yeo Valley but possess a powerful brand image within Ireland and the UK.  The company is recognised for their premium, clean label, organic cow's milk yogurt and goat's milk dairy.  The company have taken action in respect to their climate footprint and has a strong focus on sustainability.  In the past 12 months it has removed close to 90 tonnes of plastic from its packaging and can now describe its packaging as carbon neutral.</p>  <p>  I am informed that Glenisk is currently Ireland's largest manufacturer of branded yogurt with a turnover of in excess of &euro;27.5 million, an Irish market share of 15% and employs in the region of 90 people.  The company has also taken positive action in light of the uncertainties relating to Brexit and the EU UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA.  Glenisk has refocused its company's market diversification strategy towards continental Europe to mitigate the significant risk associated with over-reliance on the Irish market.  It has a high market share and I encourage the company to continue its work to increase its market share throughout Europe.</p></speech>

When I talk about other Departments and authorities responsibility, I am mindful of the professional commitment made as early as yesterday by the company.  Its commitment to its community and excellence will be maintained.  I am sure it will be done at a facility that is commensurate to the company and will be rebuilt as soon as is practicably possible.  To that end I hope that the local authority will work hand in glove with the company to ensure that every pathway is cleared to ensure that happens efficiently and quickly according to the wishes of the Cleary family.  To do that, they may have to go through a planning process.  I had hoped the planning reform Bill this year might include something for families who find themselves in such a bind and that a pathway for planning might be more readily available than the one they have to travel.  For example, this might meet with the disapproval of the likes of An Taisce, which has held up the Glanbia plant in Belview for the past five years.  This are my thoughts, fears and concerns.</p></speech>

That is essential.  I also urge that the Department of Social Protection provide a liaison because there are 90 households without an income today and this week.  Everything is destroyed, including offices.  Those people will need every assistance in the short term and hopefully the company can get back up and running again.</p>  <p>  Glenisk is exactly the kind of company that we want in Ireland.  It is a local company providing a service locally, providing jobs using local products.  We talk a lot about the green economy but this is the green economy in action: organic yogurt, sourced locally, with low carbon miles.  The Minister of State outlined the work that it has done in waste reduction.  It ticks all the boxes.  We spend a lot of time attracting companies.  That is good, we should continue doing that and I am all for foreign direct investment where we can get it but here is a company on our doorstep.  The will is there as is the workforce.  We must move heaven and earth.  We in this House have an obligation to provide our support for that and to encourage the Government, its Departments and their officials to leave no stone unturned to get this company back up and running.  I want to emphasise and encourage the role of the Department of Social Protection.  These workers need help in the short term and I encourage that if it can be given.</p></speech>

I am quite sure there will be absolute determination in all Departments, including that my Department and Enterprise Ireland will assist.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Stanley's comments, as I mentioned earlier, it is hoped there will be no job losses as a result of this occurrence but there may be some short- or medium-term issues to be dealt with.  The employment services and State agencies, including Intreo, will give top priority as soon as necessary.  </p>  <p>  Glenisk has been to the forefront in sustainable reduction, green energy and carbon offsetting and assisted by various supports from Enterprise Ireland over the past decade.  It has won many awards for its environmental efforts and activities, including for recycling and heat recovery.  As part of the Origin Green programme, Glenisk has also implemented a mandatory emissions reduction target throughout its supply chain, not just in its own plant.  That includes right down to farm level and we mentioned the milk suppliers earlier.</p> <p>I understand that the key priority for the company and the family in the past few days has been to get the milk processing unit back up and running, so that the organic cow&rsquo;s milk and organic goat&rsquo;s milk can be packaged and back on the shop shelves as soon as possible.  However, the yoghurt processing plant will involve a more difficult process to get up and running, because they have to talk to the suppliers of the machinery and their materials suppliers.  There is, therefore, a possibility that some of it can move immediately to the supermarket and the shop shelves.  However, the yoghurt processing plant is the difficult part of the process.  At least the milk will continue to be collected.  It may have to be processed temporarily somewhere else in the short term.  However, I assure the Deputies that I will continue to work with all stakeholders to examine any potential future appropriate assistance.  They should keep in contact directly with the Office of the Taoiseach to make sure every arm of the State provides all necessary support.  </p></speech>

Sustainability of communities on the islands is a fundamental objective of the Government, as set out in its Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025.  Inherent in the support for sustainability is the requirement for the provision of safe access to the islands for ferry passengers, fishermen and women and other recreational users of the harbours.  As the Deputy will be aware, the relevant local authorities are responsible authorities for maintenance and development of infrastructure on the islands.  To that end, the Department of Rural and Community Development provides financial support to the local authorities for priority projects.  To address safety issues affecting piers on Inis O&iacute;rr and Inis Me&aacute;in, the Government included development of these two harbours among capital projects identified in the Project Ireland 2040 plan.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is now progressing these, in conjunction with Galway County Council.  A development committee comprising representatives from the Department, Galway County Council and PUNCH consulting engineers was established and it has been meeting regularly to monitor progress.</p>  <p>  With regard to Inis O&iacute;rr pier, the Department has approved the business case and Galway County Council is in the process of resolving a number of pre-construction issues prior to issuing a draft tender for their development.  These issues include application for a foreshore licence for the works on the island, completion of environmental reports for an appropriate assessment and preparing the compulsory purchase order, CPO, applications.  The timetable has been discussed by the development committee providing for a tendering process of approximately nine months, after which construction will advance in stages.  The finalised plan is likely to take several years to complete, taking account of the weather and sea conditions.</p>  <p>  With regard to Inis Me&aacute;in, the business case is still in development with Galway County Council.  The Department has provided advice to the council in this regard.  The proposed design of Inis Me&aacute;in harbour and pier will be informed by modelling work being carried out by the National Maritime College of Ireland in Cork.  The Department has funded this work and, at a meeting in July, skippers had an opportunity to test the initial release of the model.  This proved very informative for both skippers and the council engineers.  A further iteration of the model is being developed.  Once the modelling has been completed and its impact on design of the pier fully understood, the business case can proceed for approval.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="09:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900006#D01300"><p>We need to stress that planning permission was given.  It is the same operable planning permission for Inis O&iacute;rr in 2008.  This is 2021 and I have to stress that this pier is incredibly dangerous, because of overtopping and because boats cannot tie up safely in the severe winter weather.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether after getting the foreshore licence it will take nine months to do the tendering.  Has he a timeline for when he expects contractors on site?  The fastest thing in construction nowadays is the building.  Even though that might take two years, at least one can go down every week and see the progress.  Can the Minister of State give a timeline to the people of Inis O&iacute;rr as to when it is expected construction will commence on the pier?</p>  <p>  Regarding Inis Me&aacute;in, the Minister of State mentioned the skippers.  The skippers are hugely important because they bring in the boats.  However, another group seems to be getting overlooked here and they are important for two reasons.</p> <p>I refer to the islanders themselves.  The first reason is that they live there.  The second is that fishing in those waters has given them an incredible wealth of knowledge of the seas around their island.  The islanders have made and keep making one point.  They have made it to the Minister of State's colleague, the senior Minister in the Department, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  The islanders believe it is vital that some indication is given to everybody regarding the funding available.  Are we talking about &euro;50 million or &euro;100 million?  There is no point in just saying funding is available, because that would be like telling someone to design a house without giving any indication of the budget.  It is as foolish as that, and anybody who did that would be very foolish indeed.  The issue, then, is whether the Department can give everybody concerned some indication of the potential budget for them to work off.  That would allow for the maximum impact, because whether the project involves digging in or working out into the sea will depend on how much money there is to spend.  </p></speech>

We do talk about it and she is aware of the urgency to move on this project.  I acknowledge as well the long history of this issue and how long it has been going on for, as outlined by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  Funding has been needed for some time.  The Deputy has been a long-time advocate in this regard and he has raised this matter many times.  I wish I could give him tighter and clearer timelines.  The tender is being prepared.  The best I can do is to tell the Deputy we want to get the tender issued and to see it out as soon as possible.  The only decent timeline I can provide for the Deputy is that the tendering process will take approximately nine months.  I know that is not what the Deputy is looking for.</p></speech>

the data centre sector in Ireland is undergoing a surge in development, with approximately 70 data centres constructed, representing a 25 per cent increase on last year, a further eight under construction and between 25-30 more in the planning stages;<br /><br />&mdash; a substantial amount of public funding has been spent on construction-related investment for data centre and large energy user growth and the sector expects &euro;6.7 billion in investment between 2020 and 2025, adding to the &euro;6.2 billion that has been invested in the sector to date;<br /><br />&mdash; data centres are energy and resource-hungry projects, requiring the same amount of energy as a large town or a small city like Kilkenny, using between 500,000 and 5 million litres of water a day;<br /><br />&mdash; according to EirGrid, data centres and large energy users are expected to use 27 per cent of all electricity demand by 2028, up from its current 11 per cent share of the national grid, and energy use by data centres is expected to double over the next five years;<br /><br />&mdash; electricity prices rose by almost 19 per cent in the year to the end of August as indicated by the latest Central Statistics Office Consumer Price Index;<br /><br />&mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to 70 per cent renewable energy by 2030 is in line with our decarbonisation goals;<br /><br />&mdash; the contribution of data centres to job creation is unclear, as the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment currently does not collect this information and estimates that between 30-50 permanent jobs are created per centre;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government is committed to developing energy efficiency standards for equipment and processes, particularly those set to grow rapidly such as data centres;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government&rsquo;s Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy (2018) is the only Government policy on the development of the sector and pre-dates global and national energy security concerns, and also notes the updated climate legislation and targets, and the recent surge in data centre development in the country;<br /><br />&mdash; there are forecasts of an impending energy crisis this winter, with two separate amber alerts already issued by the Single Electricity Market Operator this month due to temporary electricity supply shortfalls, and seven such alerts have been issued in the past 15 months, compared with just 11 alerts over the previous ten years;<br /><br />&mdash; the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has warned of 'rolling blackouts' if action is not taken to deal with the power demand from data centres, recommending either a moratorium on the construction of data centres, or new conditions on construction; and<br /><br />&mdash; the Industrial Development Agency has warned that the energy crisis has the potential to inflict 'considerable reputational damage' and negatively affect the country&rsquo;s ability to attract foreign direct investment; acknowledges that:  	&mdash; in the context of a climate crisis, post-Covid economic recovery and ongoing energy security concerns, data centres must be managed sustainably through appropriate planning conditions, sustainable energy sources and all necessary economic risk impact analysis carried out on the development of data centres in Ireland;<br /><br />&mdash; the Government has not carried out an environmental, economic and energy demand impact analysis on the development of data centres to date;<br /><br />&mdash; there is little to no transparency as to how the Government is managing data centre growth in Ireland, and no single Government Department has taken ownership of the sector&rsquo;s development or the collection of data in relation to data centres;<br /><br />&mdash; Ireland is at risk of not meeting its renewable energy targets as a result of increased energy demand from data centres;<br /><br />&mdash; there are concerns of higher energy prices as a result of data centres&rsquo; increasing share of energy demand, not only curbing post-Covid economic growth but leading to higher rates of fuel poverty, an outcome in direct conflict with just transition principles;<br /><br />&mdash; there could be a potential negative impact on attracting foreign direct investment, which creates much larger numbers of jobs than data centres, if energy demand is not properly managed; and<br /><br />&mdash; concerns have been raised that construction of data centres could take away necessary labour for the construction of much-needed homes during the current housing crisis; and calls on the Government to:  	&mdash; enforce higher standards as set out in the European Union Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centres, removing the voluntary nature of the code and putting in place obligations to prevent the industry from self-regulating during this rapid state of development of data centres;<br /><br />&mdash; request that the CRU publish its findings on data centres from the recent public consultation and to outline a proposed direction on data centre connection to the electricity grid system, and publish its decision as soon as possible;<br /><br />&mdash; consider the CRU proposals that EirGrid and ESB Networks would be required to prioritise connection applications from data centres in accordance with a series of factors, including whether data centres: <blockquote> 	&mdash; generate enough energy on site themselves to support their demand for electricity;<br /><br />&mdash; can be flexible in reducing their consumption at times of system constraint;<br /><br />&mdash; have chosen a location relative to grid constraints;<br /><br />&mdash; have the ability to provide onsite dispatchable generation and/or storage; and<br /><br />&mdash; have the ability to reduce consumption when requested by the system operator; and </blockquote>&mdash; enact a moratorium on the development of data centres and the issuing of planning decisions as an interim measure until an economic, environmental and energy impact risk analysis has been carried out.  </blockquote>  <p>The Social Democrats are calling for a moratorium on the development of data centres in Ireland.  We are calling for it because the sector has experienced unprecedented growth unlike anything Ireland has seen before.  Instead of being confident and intentional about the growth and management of data centres and facilitating them to be part of our energy future in a sustainable way, the Government is blindly supporting the rapid expansion of the sector without placing any demands or responsibilities on them and allowing them to grow based on the shiny promise of the branding opportunities the Government believes this technology will bring.</p><p>Currently there are 70 data centres in operation, with eight under construction and between 25 and 30 in the planning stages.  This sector is growing so quickly it is projected that more than 100 centres will be in operation by 2025, hosting Amazon, Microsoft and many others.  This expansion does not come without a financial cost to the taxpayer.  Much public money has been spent on data centre and large energy user infrastructure, totalling approximately &euro;7 billion to date, with a further &euro;7 billion expected in the next five years.  The Engineering Academy of Ireland projects this cost could go up to &euro;9 billion.</p><p>Data centres are water- and energy-hungry projects, requiring the same amount of energy as a large town or small city like Kilkenny.  They use between 500,000 and 5 million litres of water a day.  According to EirGrid, data centres are the largest demand driver out of all the demand-connected customer groups.  This contrasts starkly with demand growth in other sectors outside the data centre industry, which have remained largely flat in recent years, and it has meant the rate at which data centres are seeking to grow is unprecedented in Ireland.  It is reported that EirGrid&rsquo;s latest generation capacity statement, to be released today, warns that the electricity system is being stretched beyond its capacity, due mainly to the increasing number of data centres, and that to maintain energy supply to these facilities it will be necessary to delay the retirement of oil- and coal-fired electricity generation plants.  This goes completely against our climate ambitions.  It is also predicted we will need to rent emergency power generation at a cost of hundreds of millions of euro.</p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s Government has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to management of data centres.  In other countries, such as the Netherlands and Singapore, growth of data centres has caused so much concern that they have halted the issuance of building permits for them.  A similar moratorium here would be good practice.  A moratorium is needed until we are very clear about the implications of a dramatically expanding sector, until the security of our energy supply can be guaranteed and until people across Ireland can be certain they will not pay the economic and environmental costs associated with these energy-hungry projects of scale.  However, the response from Government parties continues to be that data centres need to be protected at all costs, regardless of what the evidence and the experts are saying.  In fact, the T&aacute;naiste said data is like &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;diamonds&quot; and that the data centre industry is pivotal to growth strategies for economic and regional development in Ireland.  However, let me be very clear that if this is done incorrectly, data centre depth development could also be our downfall.  If our security of energy supply decreases, if prices rise for customers, if power outages become the norm and larger employers choose not to invest in this country, we could lose jobs as well as the race to reach our renewable energy targets by 2030, and all for the sake of the sacred data.</p><p>This is why it is very important we know what we are getting ourselves into.  We must acknowledge how this will impact on the individual in Ireland.  Is it about asking people to make sacrifices to reduce their own carbon footprints while data centre growth unravels all the hard work done in a blink of an eye?  People are doing their best to tackle climate change in their own way.  Where people can, they are buying electric vehicles and they are encouraged to do so.  Others are retrofitting their homes or buying more sustainable products.  As we ramp up our response to climate change our choices will get even harder and tougher, but more impactful.  That said, people need to know the choices they are making are amounting to something, to some change that will benefit our atmosphere and our global fight against climate change.  They need to know it is a fair and just transition to a zero-carbon economy.</p><p>We are now facing a perfect storm when it comes to our energy supply.  Rocketing international prices for natural gas have seen wholesale prices jump by 250% already this year, meaning consumer bills will be up by as much as &euro;500 this winter.  Given Ireland is nowhere near meeting our target of generating 70% of our electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030, we are still highly vulnerable to these price shocks.  We need to ask ourselves whether it is fair that ordinary people will pay the cost as Ireland struggles to reach its 2030 renewable energy goals because of rising energy demand from data centres?  Is it fair that an imminent energy crisis is forming and people will be faced with higher energy prices and potential blackouts?  Is it fair that fuel poverty is increasing and more and more people are choosing to self-disconnect to save on their own fuel costs?  People are already asking why, in an energy crisis, our Government is still committed to data centres.  They already know this current situation is not fair.</p><p>The Government says it has this under control but there has been little to no transparency on how the Government is managing and forecasting the development of this sector. To date, the Government has not carried out an environmental, economic and energy-demand impact analysis on the development of data centres.  I have sent countless parliamentary questions to all the relevant Ministers and not one can tell me what analysis has been carried out to determine the impact these centres will have on our energy economy and our carbon footprint.  It is also unclear the contribution data centres will make to job creation as even the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not collect this information.  The Department estimates between 30 and 50 permanent jobs are created per centre.  Thus we do not have a clear understanding as to why the Government is so insistent on the growth of this sector.</p><p>There is little to no transparency as to how this Government is managing data centre growth in Ireland and no single Department has taken ownership of the sector&rsquo;s development or is collecting data about them.  This is a sign of a self-regulating market and growth which is now unsustainable.  Even the EU code of conduct for data centres is a voluntary measure which does not publish energy data of individual data centres.  The only strategy we can work off is a 17-page 2018 document entitled Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy.  It is the closest thing the Government has to a policy platform.</p> <p>At best, it is flimsy, short-sighted and overwhelmingly optimistic of the benefits of data centres, including job creation.  A new one is required in the context of updated climate action legislation, our energy crisis and the unprecedented growth of the sector since this document was published.</p> <p> Even amid the warnings from the Commissioner for the Regulation of Utilities of rolling blackouts if action is not taken to deal with the power demand from data centres, the Government does not seem too concerned.  The Industrial Development Authority, IDA, has warned that the energy crisis has the potential to inflict considerable reputational damage and negatively affect the country's ability to attract foreign direct investment, but this warning does not seem to be filtering into Government circles either.  The Government made a commitment in the programme for Government to develop energy efficiency standards for equipment and processes, especially those set to grow rapidly, such as data centres, but we are still waiting for this.  These are essential if we are sustainably to develop the data centre sector.</p> <p> It is important the Government has time to develop policy to make sure data centres are as efficient as possible and can in fact contribute to our renewable energy targets by generating their own electricity, creating district heating and other innovative green energy solutions.  Tomorrow, we have statements on the upcoming climate action plan.  Ideally, we should be in a place knowing full well the role data centres will play in our energy demand and meeting our climate action targets, but we do not and so we will continue to fly blind on this course.</p> <p> In the context of a climate crisis, post-Covid economy recovery and ongoing energy security concerns, data centres must be managed sustainably through appropriate planning conditions, sustainable energy sources and all necessary economic risk impact analysis being carried out on the development of them in Ireland.  The Government has failed to do that to date.  The Social Democrats are not opposed to data centres, but we want a pause in their development until the Government can tell us some pretty basic information.  What are the implications of their continued growth?  How can our energy infrastructure cope with the increased demand necessitated by data centres, and how can we reach our climate action targets, given the huge surge in energy demand?</p> <p> For that reason, it is imperative a moratorium is put in place, as an interim measure, until an impact analysis has taken place, a proper whole-of-government strategy is established, and any energy and environmental concerns are addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="10:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900009#G00200"><p>I appreciate that data centres and their impact might be abstract.  They are out of sight and the industry and Government might hope that keeps them out of the public mind and out of this Chamber for debate, but it is an urgent issue and one that can illuminate where this Government stands on climate action and just transition and whether it stands in opposition to vested interests.  It is an urgent conversation that needs to be had, and I thank my colleague, Deputy Whitmore, for her work in bringing this Private Members' motion forward.</p>  <p>  When we talk about the digital economy, the cloud and big data, we are often not thinking of the physical world, and that is purposeful to keep it as abstract as possible, but what is not abstract is the feeling the Government is prioritising the needs of multinationals over everyday citizens.  This is an all too familiar feeling.  Data centres, though out of public view, are not invisible and they are not benign or neutral entities.  They are unapologetically energy intensive creatures and the business model of the companies that record these data centres is based on people consuming more and more data, meaning the need for more and more data centres.</p>  <p>  It would be remiss if I did not acknowledge just what data are being stored in these centres.  It is our data and our information, what we google, our old Facebook posts, and what we decide to remove from our online shopping baskets before checkout - the millions of pieces of data we unknowingly give away but are highly valued and profiteered from.  It is energy sapping on a human level.  Many centres are dedicated to this and it seems wholly undemocratic that profit from data is being valued more than our citizens and our communities.</p>  <p>  We have heard of the massive amounts of energy required by data centres to function.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, believes it may not be possible for Ireland to meet the demands of such goals due to the exponential growth in the data centres and the lack of intervention from Government.  There are more than 70 data centres in Ireland, with approximately 25% of all centres in Europe now based in Dublin.  EirGrid warned earlier this year that data centres have the potential to take up to 70% of national power by 2030, based on the current connection requests.</p>  <p>  Over the past four years, EirGrid has seen an annual increase in usage by data centres of approximately 600 GW, which is equivalent to the addition of 140,000 houses, and over the next ten years total electricity demand is to increase between 19% and 50%.  This is just the energy requirements and ignores the massive amount of land and water also required by data centres to function.  The cooling systems required for data centres to operate require between 500,000 and 5 million litres of water per day; 2.6 million litres per day are used in Athlone.</p>  <p>  The allure and shine of the magic of large multinational companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google has gone without question, interrogation or analysis.  Science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke famously said "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".  It is a quote that often accompanies the latest tech product or new Apple release, but it is also the Government's policy here.  How can we sustain the inevitable growth of data centres?  What are the effects of this growth?  How will the energy required by data centres be balanced against our climate action targets?  These are the questions that require robust and detailed answers, and until we have these and the Government starts to see there is no magic here, we need this moratorium.</p>  <p>  This week, it was announced that due to energy shortfall in meeting the demands for energy, Ireland will extend the use of older, high-emissions coal and oil electricity plants, which will have dire consequences for our climate action targets.  We should not have to tell the Green Party this.  Our Government is ignoring these data centres take and is willfully failing to interrogate the true cost of policy, despite the warnings and the current evidence.  The IDA has cautioned that our energy supply crisis could result in reputational damage, because you can be sure that once it is evident our grid cannot cope with demand, people will be left in the dark - not the companies, but people.  We have already heard about Intel potentially passing on Ireland due to the energy crisis.  It will be people who are left in the dark when rolling blackouts hit because of the failure of this Government to act, and that is an all-too-familiar feeling.</p>  <p>  This is a pro-people motion.  We do not want the scenario in which lights cannot be turned on, kettles cannot be turned on, food cannot be cooked and people are left feeling cold.  This is a pro-business motion.  We cannot have a scenario, come Christmas or January, in which businesses are once again asked to close their doors because we do not have the energy to keep them open.  When the blackouts happen, it will be once again felt that this Government and governments are on the side of big business as opposed to the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="10:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900009#G00300"><p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Whitmore, for the work she has done on this issue and for bringing forward this motion.  Both my colleagues, Deputies Whitmore and Gannon, have already put forward a very strong case for this moratorium.  It is with a sense of disbelief that we are bringing this forward and having to make these arguments to a Green Party Minister who should know well why the interests of climate change and the people demand a moratorium be put in place on data centres and is put in place now.</p>  <p>  I want to focus on one aspect of the cost of the supine facilitation of data centres by the State and I want to talk about its impact on housing and retrofitting of our existing housing stock.  As the Government and the Minister are well aware, we have a massive deficit in skilled construction workers, which will put us under huge pressure in building new homes and retrofitting our existing stock.  Professor John FitzGerald recently issued a stark warning on this and said that, as a country, we will have to choose between building the new homes we need or retrofitting our existing stock.  It is a very stark warning, and it does not come from nowhere.  It comes from a situation in which we have massive neglect of apprenticeships for skilled workers in construction.  We are at about 10% of apprenticeship levels compared with 2004 in key construction and wet trades.  The Government projects we need 27,000 additional skilled construction workers just to meet our existing needs.</p>  <p>  What has this got to do with data centres?  Data centres are pulling skilled construction workers away from retrofitting our existing housing stock to meet our climate change targets and from building new homes.  We need those skilled construction workers for those key tasks of retrofitting and building new homes.  That is the choice the Government is making here.  Let us be clear: the Government has chosen data centres.  Think about what a data centre is.  It is where you holds content from social media and websites, such as photos of buildings and homes.  The Government is prioritising the electronic storage of photos of homes and buildings across the world over and above meeting our needs for skilled construction workers to build actual homes in Ireland and retrofit our existing stock to meet our climate change targets.</p> <p>That is absurd.  It is ludicrous.  We should not have to tell a Green Party Minister about the Government's prioritisation.  It makes no sense at all.  Let us meet our housing needs first and the need to retrofit existing housing stock, and then we can look at data centres.  We already have far more than our fair share of data centres in Ireland and it is not the case we need to do more in that regard.</p> <p> I do not think the electorate will thank the Government for its prioritisation of this issue and for ignoring the big deficit we have, for example, in skilled construction workers.  A 2019 study by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland showed that the biggest obstacle to the construction output is skills shortages and that is before we expand the retrofitting programme that needs to be done.  A 2020 survey of skills showed that 80% of surveyors reported an undersupply of skills across most construction trades and professions.  That is before we increase the building of new homes or ramp up retrofitting.  We must ask what the priority of the Government is.  Is it to meet the needs in terms of our climate change targets, housing and retrofitting or is it to continue the supine facilitation of data centres for global corporations and putting those needs ahead of the needs we have as a people?  That is not acceptable.  It is not too late for the Government to change course, to accept our motion and to agree a moratorium and then to do the detailed analysis my colleague, Deputy Whitmore, has so strongly put forward and that needs to be done.</p></speech>

and substitute the following:  	&quot;notes: <blockquote> 	&mdash;that in June 2021, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a proposed Direction to the System Operators related to Data Centre grid connection,for consultation, setting out a number of options for managing data centre connection demand, and EirGrid has issued advice to data centres on new requirements to connect to the grid in advance of this proposed Direction;<br /><br />&mdash;that earlier this year, EirGrid carried out a nationwide public consultation on 'Shaping our Electricity Future', setting out options for strengthening the grid so that it can carry significantly more renewable generation as well as meet increasing demand from high volume energy users;<br /><br />&mdash;the fundamental importance of security of energy supply which is vital for the proper functioning of society and the economy, with over two million customers relying on the electricity grid and 700,000 customers on the natural gas grid to heat and power their homes and businesses;<br /><br />&mdash;that the CRU has statutory responsibility to ensure security of electricity supply;<br /><br />&mdash;that all sectors of the economy will have sectoral emissions ceilings under the climate law, and that all data centres, whether using electricity or backup fuels, will need to be within that sectoral ceiling, and that electricity has the clearest and shortest path to decarbonise and will be a key advantage over other industries that use fossil fuels;<br /><br />&mdash;that a range of actions is being taken by the CRU and EirGrid in relation to security of electricity supply over the coming winter and years ahead, which include maximising the availability of existing generators, developing new generation capacity, changing grid connection rules for data centres, and working with large energy consumers to,where possible, reduce their electricity demand during peak period, and the current unpredicted cause for concern is related to the lack of availability of a number of power plants; and<br /><br />&mdash;that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems for the period out to 2030 in the context of net-zero emissions by 2050; </blockquote>further notes: <blockquote> 	&mdash;that management of the impact of electricity demand on the grid is more appropriately dealt with through regulatory measures in the electricity sector;<br /><br />&mdash;the important role of the ICT sector and data centres as part of the digital and communications infrastructure for many sectors of our economy, and data centres are core infrastructure for the digital economy and act as a hook for further investment and job creation, and more than 20,000 direct jobs in the Irish economy are supported by those operating large data centre infrastructure here, with the technology sector in Ireland employing over 150,000 people;<br /><br />&mdash;that the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future commits to developing efficiency standards for equipment and processes, particularly those set to grow rapidly, such as data centres;<br /><br />&mdash;that energy price rises in the marketplace are predominantly related to current international gas price increases and are unrelated to data centre development; and<br /><br />&mdash;that in 2020, data centres accounted for approximately 11 per cent of the total electricity used in Ireland, demonstrating that the impact of data centres on Ireland&rsquo;s energy demand, and the related electricity emissions, is significant, and EirGrid project that demand from large energy users, including data centres, could account for 27 per cent of all demand by 2030; and </blockquote>affirms that: <blockquote> 	&mdash;the Government will set out, in the forthcoming Climate Action Plan, a suite of actions that will address rising energy demand, while facilitating sustainable growth in the digital and ICT sectors;<br /><br />&mdash;the electricity demand growth from large energy users, including data centres,requires careful management of the grid in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s significant decarbonisation and climate ambitions;<br /><br />&mdash;the Government&rsquo;s Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy policy will ensure a role for data centres in enterprise policy and alignment with electricity emission reductions; and<br /><br />&mdash;the CRU intends to publish, as a matter of urgency, its final direction to EirGrid and ESB Networks in relation to data centre connection policy that will prioritise data centre connections based on location, the availability of on-site generation and flexibility in reducing demand when required.&quot; </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>I wish to share time with Deputy Fergus O'Dowd.</p></speech>

Clearly, the current security of electricity supply situation, together with high international price increases in natural gas, are a matter of serious concern to all.  The Government will continue to help vulnerable customers by providing extensive supports for household energy costs via energy efficiency and welfare schemes.  I expect to see further progress in that regard in the budget next week.</p>  <p>  Energy and climate policy is rapidly changing, driven by the urgent need to tackle climate change.  In Ireland, this means rapidly decarbonising our electricity grid to act as the linchpin for emissions reductions in other sectors.  Under our new climate legislative framework, all sectors of the economy will have sectoral emissions ceilings and data centres must be within these sectoral ceilings.  It is clear to me that these digital industries also wish to transfer to zero-carbon power and I am confident that working collaboratively with them, we can enable this transition.</p>  <p>  The expansion of data centres in Ireland, particularly in the Dublin region, is projected to lead to a large increase in electricity demand, which gives rise to challenges for the energy system.  Data centres accounted for 11% of electricity in 2020, and this morning EirGrid published its latest generation capacity statement, which projects that demand from data centres could account for 25% of all electricity demand in Ireland by 2030.</p>  <p>  We are facing real short-term challenges to electricity security of supply, primarily driven by unplanned technical failures on two of our largest gas plants, both of which are expected to be back online shortly.  To suggest it is solely down to increased demand from data centres is not borne out by the facts.  The increase in data centre demand was forecasted and is increasing in line with forecasts.</p>  <p>  In the medium term, to back up the additional 11 GW of new renewable power supplies we will bring online, we must replace our ageing high-carbon power sources with a mixture of batteries and a flexible gas power plant that can help us transition to zero carbon while also using gases like hydrogen.  This has been challenged by a failure to bring capacity through recent market auctions.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, which has statutory responsibility in this area, has outlined its plan this morning on how to address this system adequacy issue.</p>  <p>  I have moved an amendment to the motion, which acknowledges there is increasing electricity demand from large energy users, including data centres, and that a range of actions are being taken by the CRU and EirGrid in relation to security of electricity supply over the coming winter and years ahead.  It is acknowledged that the growth in the needs of large energy users must be managed within the electricity system regulation and sectoral emissions ceilings.  Increasing electricity demand from industry, from electrification of both heat and transport, will be defining features of our future energy system.  Increased electricity demand will drive the need for more onshore wind, more offshore wind, and more solar power as well as storage and grid infrastructure.  We also need large users to provide demand-side response and flexibility services.</p>  <p>  EirGrid has undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the future needs of the power system as part of its comprehensive consultation, Shaping our Electricity Future.  That analysis would suggest that where there is existing grid capacity in areas with high levels of renewables, the location of large energy users there, including data centres, can provide stability and help balance the grid.  The simple equation here is bringing the demand closer to where renewables are located, thus reducing the need for additional electricity grid development.</p>  <p>  The ICT sector and data centres are part of the digital and communications infrastructure for many sectors of the economy and act as a hook for further investment and job creation.  The technology sector in Ireland is a major employer and is also playing a key role in driving digitalisation of the Irish economy, which is core to increasing productivity, competitiveness, and innovation.  Data centres enable remote working, which cuts transport carbon emissions, as has been evident in recent months.  It is also worth iterating there is no direct State subvention of data centres, as the Private Members' motion alleges.  All large energy users pay for their infrastructure through network charges.  There is no subvention of data centres from either the State or household electricity bills.</p>  <p>  Calls for a moratorium on data centre connections would be a blunt policy response.  We are better served to enable the transition to a zero-carbon electricity system through policy and regulation.  A secure, low-carbon and flexible energy supply enables Ireland to use our comparative competitive advantage in offshore clean energy to locate clean digital industries close to the power and to provide employment and livelihoods for citizens.</p>  <p>  Working with the relevant State agencies, the Government wants to ensure there is a plan-led, regionally balanced approach to such developments.  An example is the recent announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na of the 200 MW energy park near Rhode, County Offaly.  It combines 200 MW of clean power, hydrogen generation and utilisation, battery storage and flexibility from large demand users.  This maximises the value to society and minimises the costs.  This is the fundamental underpinning of the just transition whereby we create clean jobs from clean power.</p>  <p>  Finally, and importantly, the amendment affirms D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann's support for a number of measures that will help manage data centre development and strengthen the policy and regulatory framework.  I will shortly bring a revised climate action plan to the Government, which will set out a suite of actions that will address rising energy demand while facilitating sustainable growth in the digital and ICT sectors.</p>  <p>  The amendment affirms the Government's intention that the policy statement on the role of data centres in enterprise policy will be reviewed shortly.  The wider policy and regulatory context has shifted since 2018 and we now need to ensure better alignment with electricity emissions reduction and security of supply challenges.  Most important to my mind, the amendment also affirms that the independent regulator, the CRU, also intends to publish its data centre connection policy later next month.  That is the key response.</p>  <p>  I heard Deputy Whitmore on the radio this morning.  She is correct that we need to plan.  We have been doing exactly that.  We have tasked EirGrid to come up with the Shaping our Electricity Future plan, which it will publish next month.  We have worked with the CRU to get the new policy regulations on how we connect data centres.  That too will be published next month.  Far from ignoring this issue, it has been centre stage in our plans to manage our energy system.  The CRU and EirGrid have been developing the plans in the past year and they will be published next month.  That is the best policy approach.</p></speech>

By its nature it wants to stop the clock and stop development in the country.  I accept there is clearly an issue with energy supply in the future.</p> <p>The research the Social Democrats allege they have done has been very poor and needs to be informed far more constructively.  For over 30 years, technology successes in Ireland have made our country the destination of choice for leading technology companies.  The IT sector accounts for &euro;52 billion, which is 16% of the gross added value in our economy.  Over 140,000 people are employed in the business.  In data centres specifically, over 20,000 people are employed in different parts of the country.  It is not just that but the contribution they make in taxes, exports, capital expenditure and so on.  It is quite clear from the IDA document that they are a critical part of the infrastructure in our country and it states specifically that large data centre companies are fully committed to powering their data centres renewably.</p> <p> If the Social Democrats did further analysis they might find that Amazon announced two renewable energy projects in 2019, in Donegal and Cork, and a third one in 2020.  These three projects together will bring renewable energy to the Irish grid which would be the equivalent of powering 180,000 Irish homes.  These three Amazon projects mean they will be using 100% renewable energy by 2025.</p> <p> On the question of water use, there are old cars and new cars, gas-guzzlers and modern cars being produced every day.  The same is true of data centres.  The Deputies spoke about water use.  Here is a figure they should have found out.  I found it out because Amazon applied to build a data centre in our town.  The Amazon data centre in Drogheda will use the equivalent of eight households per annum water use.  There are huge differences between old technology and new technology and there are huge changes coming about.  Companies like Amazon that have invested in Drogheda are also attracting other industry.  We recently had new jobs for Drogheda.  It is a very attractive location for inward investment as a global leader in the circular cloud and sustainable data centre infrastructure is now based in our town.  One data centre is attracting new recyclable circular economy industries into our economy.  The Deputies should take their heads out of the sand and look at the facts.</p></speech>

This is partly because we have become so accustomed to the idea of the cloud where our data are said to exist.  However, this metaphor fails to reflect the reality of brick-and-mortar data centres and their huge carbon footprint.  Ireland has become a cheerleader for these digital factories with 70 operational data centres, 54 of which are in Dublin, making Dublin the largest data centre hub in Europe.  This proliferation of data centres has occurred with seemingly little consideration for our climate targets or ill-equipped infrastructure, unless we consider a 17-page document entitled "Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy" to be any kind of robust scrutiny or planning assessment.</p>  <p>  We all accept that the colossal amount of digital information produced every day needs to be stored somewhere.  That is why data centres have become a critical feature of modern life, but if we do not stop to assess the impact of data centres, blackouts and widespread fuel poverty could also become features of modern life.  We are repeatedly fed assurances that data centres will be fully powered by renewables and future technological advances in time.  However, the specific technology needed to achieve this and the timeline for market adoption remains unknown.  In the meantime, we are expected to accept that data centres could amount to 70% of our energy consumption by 2030, if all proposed data centres are connected to the grid.  This is an utterly untenable situation.  Either the Government is burying its head in the sand or it has fallen for the industry's greenwashing of data centres.  Given the State's overriding devotion to foreign capital, one would be forgiven for assuming it has put the interests of tech companies ahead of the public interest and the planet.</p>  <p>  While I do not agree with Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il's long-standing approach to foreign direct investment, FDI, whereby they have offered a scarcely equalled environment to avoid tax liabilities, it certainly aligns with their ideology.  Low corporation tax, light-touch regulation and special tax arrangements are attractive to multinationals engaged in a race to the bottom.  However, I fail to see how this Government's approach to data centres is consistent with its FDI policy.  Regular power cuts would hardly complement any strategy to attract and retain multinationals.  Even the IDA has conceded that the growing instability of our electricity network is "causing disquiet in the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) community".  It is clear that continuing with no real strategy on data centres would not bolster our reputation as a favoured destination for FDI, a reputation the State is always at pains to protect.  More important, it would show a complete disregard for Irish households, jeopardise our energy supply and inflame the single biggest threat to our country and our planet, that is, the climate crisis.</p>  <p>  Even if we were to accept such a scenario, what would be the benefit?  Is there anything to be gained from housing a disproportionate amount of the world's data?  Are a relatively small number of jobs worth it?  This moratorium would allow time to answer these questions and analyse the true impact of data centres.  Without it, the burden of tackling the climate crisis will once again fall disproportionately on the shoulders of those least responsible for it.  If this Government is really serious about climate action and a just transition, it must press pause on data centres now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="10:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900011#J02000"><p>Last year, data centres took approximately 11% of the total electricity used in Ireland, and it is projected that they could account for over 30% of all demand by 2030.  This is unbelievable.  A sector which most people have only recently become aware of is using over one tenth of our electricity, and this is likely to rise to over one third in nine years.  Does this industry employ a corresponding number of people to justify this massive power usage?  Does it pay a similar amount in taxes to the State?  Is it a sector that has been allowed to balloon, use a disproportionate amount of power and keep on growing?  Where was the national discussion on this?  Why has this industry, which has not been identified by the Government until recently as a priority, been given this powerful position?  Listening to Fine Gael Deputies you would swear that we are asking for something outlandish but our motion today simply calls for a moratorium until a proper risk analysis of their economic, environmental and energy impact is carried out.  This is a basic requirement for good governance and sound policy making.  It is irresponsible of the Government to allow data centres to gain such a position without full and proper risk analysis, but it is absolutely reckless that this would now happen in the context of a climate crisis and warnings of winter power shortages.</p> <p>We know data centres are resource-hungry projects, using the same amount of energy as a large town or a small city like Kilkenny, and consuming between 500,000 and 5 million litres of water a day.  This is deeply worrying and deeply unfair.  Data centres are being quietly promoted by Government Departments, with little understanding of their impact.  We are facing the very real prospect of blackouts where families and communities will be without power.  At the same time, there are known risks to water supply in many areas of the country, including towns in west Cork, due to insufficient infrastructure.  On one hand, we have data centres consuming massive amounts of electricity and water, and, on the other, we have ordinary people at risk of power cuts and water shortages.  This is a very revealing insight into Government priorities.</p> <p> The 2018 Government statement on data centres in Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise strategy notes that "data centres pose considerable challenges to the future planning and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s power system" but is short on solutions to this major issue.  It vaguely mentions that the Government can take steps to mitigate this and that data centres' desire for green electricity could stimulate supply and technology innovation in renewable energy.  Against the very real risk to energy supply, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment offers hopes and possibilities but this is of little reassurance to worried SMEs and communities.</p> <p> Reading over the Government statement and listening to Ministers' speeches at the opening of data centres, it seems clear that they have fully bought into the demands of large ICT companies.  Data centres bring in foreign direct investment and create construction jobs, but at what cost?  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan spoke about the cost in regard to the construction sector and housing.  Is this sustainable in the long run?  We do not know, and this is the issue.  We are being asked to support this industry based on the assertions of large corporations.  Where is the holistic analysis?  Where are the environmental impact discussions?  Where will the energy come from?</p> <p> In response to a parliamentary question on data centre energy use, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications informed me that the forthcoming climate action plan will set out the actions required to deliver on Ireland's emissions reduction targets, including in the electricity sector.  However, it is reported that data centres made up 1.85% of our total carbon emissions last year.  This industry is increasing our emissions.  How can the Government reconcile this with the climate action plan?  Each sector will have to do its part to reduce emissions but this will be made harder on households, farmers and small businesses if they have to counterbalance the increasing emissions from data centres.  Our motion is asking the Government to assess properly the impact of this sector before even more resource-hungry centres are built.  It only seeks that we make fully informed decisions, considering the economic, environmental and energy effects of these massive developments.  The Government and the public should know what is involved before committing us to a course of action that could result in blackouts and make reaching our emissions targets harder than it already is.  There is no valid argument against pausing to assess properly this industry, its role in our economy and the trade-offs we will have to make.  I urge all Deputies to support the Social Democrats' motion.</p></speech>

What we have unfolding before us, particularly in recent months, is a picture of abject failure on behalf of successive Governments to prepare and manage energy and electricity policy, and supply and demand, adequately.  Amber alerts are now a common feature, electricity outages are increasingly common and avoiding blackouts cannot be guaranteed.  At the same time, this Government will bend over backwards to facilitate the entry of energy-sapping data centres into the market.  As we now have about 70 of them, we think it is a good idea to get the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to have a look at their impact &ndash; now, not before we started granting permissions.</p><p>It is not as if the Minister has not been warned.  My party has for years warned about this high-wire act.  In our Powering Ireland 2030 document, published in 2018, we pointed to the need to manage demand, to curtail the expansion of data centres and to take control.  These warnings, and the warnings from EirGrid and the CRU, appear to be falling on deaf ears in Government Buildings, so I think it is right that the D&aacute;il now calls for an emergency brake on the future development of data centres.</p><p>We appreciate the need for data centres.  They provide a vital service that keeps many of the digital aspects of our lives running but it is clear the uncontrolled and ill-conceived Government policy, which has encouraged the rampant expansion of data centres here, is now threatening the electricity supply to Irish households and businesses, which is simply unacceptable.</p><p>The last Fine Gael Government set a target of making Ireland the data centre capital of the world, with absolutely no thought about the impact this would have on our carbon emissions or on electricity supply.  The current Government has not changed approach.  On the one hand, it rolls out the red carpet for data centres while, on the other, it postpones renewable electricity support scheme, RESS auctions, it dithers with the roll-out of offshore wind - just listen to Wind Energy Ireland - and it dithers with microgeneration, which is always just around the corner but still not here.</p><p>EirGrid and the CRU have warned that rolling blackouts are possible if action is not taken on the unprecedented growth of electricity demand from data centres.  The Minister added to these concerns on the national airwaves this morning.  Make no mistake about it: this crisis, and it is a crisis, is a direct result of incoherent Government policies pursued by Fine Gael in recent years and continued by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.</p><p>In the last four years, data centre demand has grown by 2,400 GW hours, the equivalent of 560,000 homes.  If allowed to continue, current and planned data centres could consume anywhere between 25% and 70% of peak electricity demand by 2030.  This simply is not feasible or sustainable.  It is reckless and dangerous.  Based on the track record of the three Government parties, it risks the lights going out and widespread social unrest, not to mention the irreparable damage it will do to the climate and the climate movement.  The growth of data centres is already jeopardising the State&rsquo;s 2030 target of reducing emissions by 51%, a commitment that is less than three months old.  Research carried out by <i>The Business Post</i>in conjunction with the MaREI Institute shows this.  There has been a rapid expansion of data centres in recent years but the truth is we do not know at what cost or to what benefit.  For example, we do not know how many jobs or what economic benefit they deliver.  There are no concrete figures on the energy demand that current and planned data centres will consume, with figures ranging from 25% to 70% of peak demand by 2030.  In terms of demand on water, the Oireachtas climate committee yesterday heard evidence that this can be anywhere between 500,000 litres and 5 million litres per day per data centre during a heatwave.  That is a lot of houses, not eight houses in Drogheda.</p><p>In the meantime, we roll out the red carpet.  Data centres benefit from our PSO, among other things.  They do not pay their fair share.  PSO is levied at peak demand but, of course, data centres have a gigantic but steady demand so they do better, while little old women in my constituency are forced to do their washing in the middle of the night to save a few cent.  Then, there are the tax reliefs that this Government knows nothing about.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party: it is almost like hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.  Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, highlighted that the Minister for Finance does not know the total value of tax reliefs that have been gifted to companies through capital allowances claimed against their data centre investment.  The Minister for Finance does not know.  It is literally unbelievable.  From listening to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, today, it sounds like he does not know either.  At the root of this motion, in my opinion, is an absolute lack of confidence that this Government has this real energy challenge in hand or that it is in control.  I share that concern.  I look at the Government amendment, I hear the Minister on the national airwaves, I hear him speak this morning, and I am not inspired.  In fact, it is the opposite.  Deputy Ryan is the Minister responsible.  This is the Government responsible, but it points to EirGrid and the CRU, stating that management of the impact of electricity demand on the grid is more appropriately dealt with through regulatory measures in the electricity sector.  That is not good enough.  Make no mistake about it: if the lights go out, the Minister and the Government will be the ones held accountable.</p><p>The threat now posed to the electricity system will not just have negative consequences for households and businesses; it will also have a massively damaging effect on Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation.  The prospect of the CRU&rsquo;s final direction to EirGrid and ESB Networks, as the Minister points out in his amendment, is not enough.  The truth is that it is an absolute indictment of the Government that we have ever got to this point, in 2021, in Ireland.</p> <p>The Government would do well to heed the warnings and act without delay.</p></speech>

Today we are the European capital of data centres.  In reality, that is a badge of climate dishonour for this State.  We are playing host to more than 70 of these centres, with many more under construction or at advanced stages of the planning process.  The Taoiseach's recent comments were to the effect that we would look at escalating the planning of these new centres.</p>  <p>   EirGrid first estimated these data centres would be using 29% of our energy by 2028 but less than a year later the estimation jumped to 31% by one year earlier in 2027.  Clearly, reaching climate targets would be fanciful, meaning the cost to our society would be large and we would incur fines.  We have already seen increases in our fossil fuel imports to offset the increased energy demand.  The CRU has even suggested imposing a moratorium on them because of the risk of blackouts this winter.  That seems like the sensible thing to do.  Instead, what do we do?  We give them capital allowances.  In terms of how much tax is foregone, who knows?  I asked the Minister for Finance how much tax is foregone in this regard last week and how much this is costing this State.  The reply I got was that we do not have that figure.  Revenue does not collect that figure.  That badly needs to be rectified for environmental reasons and in the interests of transparency and fiscal prudence, to borrow the Government's favourite buzz term.</p>  <p>  What I find most frustrating about all of this is how the Government continues to talk out of both sides of its mouth.  At the start of August the Taoiseach lectured us on how climate change will have increasingly devastating consequences unless we address it.  On that, he is right.  Then two weeks later, what did he do?  He told us he will streamline the planning application process for data centres.  Again, he has been talking out of two sides of his mouth.  Then, this month he thought he would lecture world leaders on climate change.  His apparent lack of self-awareness is frightening.  The Taoiseach may as well have been spraying aerosol cans while burning leaves in front of other world leaders because that is how ridiculous this was.</p>  <p>  We need to take climate action seriously.  We need to examine the issue of data centres.  We have a sensible motion before us.  We would not be the first state to do this.  Let us do this.  Let us back this motion and start taking the climate crisis seriously.</p></speech>

In the past week we heard from Dr. Patrick Bresnihan of NUI Maynooth who warned that if all the proposed data centres go ahead, they will account for up to 70% of our grid capacity by the end of the decade.  In the same week the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, sounded like a spokesperson for big tech when he was quoted in the newspapers announcing plans to update our data centre policy, having been directed to do so by Google, Amazon and Microsoft.  If it was not so farcical it would be so damaging to our country.</p>  <p>  The Government is throwing our emissions targets out the window and handing our precious water and energy resources over to big tech companies and all under the eyes of the Minister present who has responsibility for climate change.  What is the Government's response to this and the climate emergency generally?  It is to slap a higher carbon tax on domestic users - normal people - and to turn a blind eye as energy costs skyrocket while we prepare for the possibility of blackouts this winter and water shortages down the line.  It looks like it is not only developers who are writing housing policy for this Government.  Big tech is writing our climate and energy policy too.</p>  <p>  There are two data centres planned for the IDA Business and Technology Park in Drogheda.  This is a business park that was supposed to provide 5,000 jobs for Drogheda.  These two data centres will provide anywhere between 60 and 100 jobs, but they will use as much water as Kilkenny city and have one and a half times the energy use of Kilkenny.  A third data centre is in the planning process for our town.  </p>  <p>  The Staleen water plant outside Drogheda is already struggling.  We have had water shortages.  The Minister will remember them.  They were covered on the news every night.  There are significant problems with water infrastructure in the Drogheda area.  Irish Water representatives told me on site at the Staleen water plant several years ago that the capacity is not there.  That was long before three data centres were in the planning process.  The applications for these centres are not providing solutions for what will happen during periods of low rainfall or periods of hot weather when data centres need more water for cooling, and all of this at a time when water is already scarce.</p></speech>

We do not seem to have a coherent strategy on the development of this industry and its impact on our current electricity and water infrastructure.  It seems planning applications are made and decided at local level in local authorities.  How are we planning to reduce the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity at a time when we will have 1 million extra electric cars, hundreds of data centres and an increase in population of more than 1 million people, as projected for the coming decades?</p>  <p>  Seventy data centres have been built and at least 30 more have been planned, which will put immense pressure on the grid at a major cost to the taxpayer.  We will spend &euro;9 billion on the grid to allow Amazon, Microsoft and their peers to set up data centres.  As has been said, Dr. Patrick Bresnihan of NUI Maynooth told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Climate Action this week that while data centres currently represent 11% of the grid capacity, the energy used by those existing connections will rise to almost 30% of overall capacity by the end of this decade.  This compares with the worldwide situation where only 2% of electricity is consumed by data centres.  My constituency of Dublin West has seen a significant number of these data centres and a massive data centre is currently under construction just across the border in Clonee, County Meath.  The Amazon data centre in Mulhuddart will use the same amount of electricity as Galway.  That is astonishing.  The people of Ireland are not stupid and can appreciate the problems that will arise with the vast number of data centres planned.  They hear about rolling blackouts nearly every week which are covered in the media and discussed on radio and television.</p>  <p>  Some 59% of people polled by RED C want data centre development to be controlled to reduce rolling electricity blackouts.  They want a restriction of data centres to avoid these blackouts and help the country to achieve its climate targets.  Does the Minister have the authority to demand these data centres would switch to auxiliary powers in the event that we have rolling blackouts and do not have the capacity to provide electricity for people in their homes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="10:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900013#L01400"><p>We are having this discussion in the context of a broader discussion on fuel poverty.  I heard one of the Minister's colleagues, a junior Minister, last night, on a show I do not often watch, advise people who cannot afford to heat or light their homes that they can access an exceptional needs payment.  Heating your house is not an exceptional need.  It should be a basic right.  If that is the advice coming from the Government, we will do nothing to control the cost of energy.  If people find themselves this winter in a situation where they cannot heat their homes, and they will, the best advice the Government is giving them is to apply for an exceptional needs payment.  To say that is not good enough is an understatement.  When people say the Minister and his Government are out of touch, this is what they mean.  Heating your home should be a basic right, not an exceptional need.  The Minister should have a word with those with whom he shares government because if that is the best advice they have, it is incredibly disappointing but not surprising.</p> <p> I want to thank Deputies for bringing forward this motion today.  We have a simple problem - there are too many data centres.  They are a drain on our national energy grid and water infrastructure.  The nature of the development and servicing of them is unsustainable.  The companies to whom the data centres belong know they are a problem.  They are on the offensive.  They are out lobbying and advertising all over the place.  They are telling us all about the benefits.  One cannot listen to a podcast without being told about the benefits of data centres.  That advertising and lobbying is working.  It is getting to the Minister and Government.  They are very aware of and are listening to this message.</p> <p> The situation is unsustainable for energy and water.  It cannot continue, yet the Government is quite happy to see that it does.  Data centres are energy-hungry and resource-hungry projects.  They require the same amount of energy as a large town.  As has been alluded to already, Dr. Patrick Bresnihan from NUI Maynooth told us that in terms of environment and climate change while data centres currently represent 11% of energy use that will rise to 30%.  The Minister and the Government seem prepared to do nothing about it.  That is a shame.</p></speech>

The issue of data centres has to be dealt with urgently.  Yesterday, as has been said, Dr. Patrick Bresnihan of the geography department in NUI Maynooth, in my home town, was one of the experts who came to talk to us at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  He made a good impression.  It was a serious and sobering expos&eacute; of where we are with regard to balancing the energy needs of an increasing number of data centres and the energy needs of those in the community, namely the people we serve.</p>  <p>  We are trying to achieve this balance, but thankfully globally there is growing awareness of the existential crisis humans face on this planet.  We are long past the point where it is reasonable to say that we should massively increase our energy from renewables and then we would have plenty of capacity for running data centres.  To paraphrase the Government mantra, we cannot build renewable energy overnight. </p>  <p>  This month alone, we have had two amber alerts and it is not even winter yet.  Data centres will become a critical issue and I worry about the impact that will have on social cohesion as we face the climate crisis.  People will be hit by carbon taxes and will pay more for fuel and energy, yet face shortages of that same fuel and energy while the Government lavishes finite resources on entities that arguably do little economically for communities beyond the building of them.</p>  <p>  Social cohesion and a just transition are critical if we are to survive this looming climate crisis.  How does the Minister think people will react if they are facing power outages in their homes and villages while data centres still have the lights on?  I do not think it will be pretty.  I do not think the Government needs a crystal ball to envisage the feet on the street and images that will make the water protests look like a walk in the park.  I support the motion and commend Deputy Whitmore on putting it forward.  We need a moratorium on data centres and an emergency break.  The Minister has no idea how unsettling it feels to be asking a Green Party Minister to support a green-intentioned motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900014#M00300"><p>I am glad to speak for the Labour Party in support of this motion and commend Deputy Whitmore and her colleagues on bringing it forward.  I am glad to have the opportunity to debate the important and pressing issue of data centres in a measured, thoughtful and rational way.  The wording of the motion is careful.  It simply calls for a pause on the development of data centres and sets out very clearly and persuasively the reasons for doing so.</p><p>When I took up the brief for the Labour Party on climate very recently and started looking into the question of data centres, what surprised me most was the absence of an updated national plan or Government strategy.  To me this is particularly surprising given the projections of massively increased demand arising from data centres which others have spoken about.  We have seen from EirGrid's analysis that demand from data centres could account for 27% of all demand in Ireland by 2029.  Others have spoken about that.  It is a staggering figure.  Given that data centres' demand is predictable, and that we can project demand and demand is steady, it seems even more surprising that the most up-to-date Government statement on the role of data centres is from June 2018.  We need a clarity of approach from government at a national level as to how the demand for energy from data centres will be managed.</p><p>  Having listened carefully to what the proposers of the motion have said, I note they have not said they are not opposed to data centres.  That is a sensible point.  That ship has sailed.  We are all utterly reliant on data centres and global connectivity.  We all accept how crucial the tech sector is for Ireland.  In Dublin Bay South, my constituency and that of the Minister, we are all very conscious of the enormous contribution the tech sector has made.  Taking a measured and rational approach, I would agree with the Minister that we need a plan-led regionally balanced approach.  Policy and regulation are required to enable the transition to a zero carbon electricity system.</p><p>What is currently lacking from the Government, both in the speech from the Minister and the Government's amendment to the motion, is clarity and a sense of how the growth of data centres is to be managed over the short and medium term.  In his speech the Minister mentioned the publication of plans in the next month, but in the meantime we do not know what the position is.  The wording of the Government's amendment states that it will set out &quot;a suite of actions&quot; and that the Government's statement on the role of data centres will ensure an &quot;alignment with electricity emission reductions&quot;.  We need to know how this is to be managed now.</p><p>The motion calls for a pause in further development as an interim measure until the sort of crucial assessments that we need into the environmental, economic and energy impacts have been carried out.  That sort of risk analysis seems a sensible and measured approach.</p><p>There are two reasons that we need to support the motion and that the Labour Party will be voting for it.  First, the motion recognises the demand on energy and, as we have said, the projected increased demand in energy demand as a result of the development of data centres.  Second, the motion recognises the climate emergency within which we are all struggling with these issues.</p><p>In terms of the demand on energy, others have pointed out that there are 70 operational data centres in Ireland.  Most are concentrated around Dublin.  It is the largest data centre hub in Europe.  That is not something to be dismayed about because if they are not here they will be elsewhere.  The climate emergency is a global one.  We have to bear that in mind when we are speaking about data centres.  As the Minister said, many multinationals have stated their commitment to transition to zero carbon power and carbon emission neutrality.</p><p>That is all welcome, but we know, given what EirGrid has said today, that even where the energy that fuels data centres comes from predominantly renewable sources, as we hope it will, the demand still adds pressure to the grid.  We are still reliant on non-renewable sources of energy, and demand becomes unsustainable without clear policy interventions and clear and urgent action being taken by the Government.  The absence of an indication from the Government as to what that intervention will be is what the motion speaks to.</p><p>It is also important to note that, as I said, demand from data centres will be steady.  We can project what it will be, but that is all the more reason to have a coherent national strategy in place.  It is not just about energy and energy demand; it is also about the demand on our water supply.  We know that most data centres use a huge amount of water to cool their servers.</p><p>In terms of the climate emergency, all present are very conscious of the fact that we are at a crucial juncture in the international movement to fight climate change.  We are conscious of the IPCC report published last month.  Tomorrow the D&aacute;il will debate the upcoming climate action plan in anticipation of the COP26 conference in Glasgow at the end of October.  There is a huge mobilisation of young people, in particular, many of whom were outside Leinster House last Friday.  </p>  <p>Many are anxious to see us take urgent action to address climate change.  It is because of this and the Government's commitments that commit us to reducing our emissions and reach a 51% target by 2030 with a net zero-carbon emissions target for 2050 and to reaching 70% renewable electricity by 2030, that we know this is simply not compatible with the projected increased demand in data centres unless there is a radical and urgent intervention by the Government and a clear and coherent plan as to how this demand is going to be met while aligning us with those ambitious but vital targets on climate emissions reduction.</p> <p> To conclude, this motion simply calls for a pause.  It is an essential interim measure to ensure that we meet climate targets and develop a sustainable policy on the location of data centres.  It is crucial that we do this.  We owe it to future generations, and to our young people who are out protesting every week, to do this.  We are lacking currently from Government a clear strategy as to how this will be managed into the future.  That is why the Labour Party is proud to support the motion. </p></speech>

The international context is also driving this, but Moody's predictions are coming to pass.  The consequence will be fuel poverty for many people in this country.  A Green Party Minister is presiding over keeping fossil fuel driven electricity generation open to fuel data centres.  He is also presiding over the prospect of blackouts in order for the data centres to continue to operate and expand while ordinary people are hit with higher electricity prices that many will be unable to afford.</p><p>I will given Members a picture of a data centre because sometimes people cannot picture what a data centre is if they do not live beside one like I do.  In a way what is happening is proves the point made in the leaked mitigation strategy report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, which states that the growth model of capitalism is incompatible with avoiding climate catastrophe.  We are talking about the supposedly green sectors of capitalism, including Facebook, Google, Apple, etc.  The truth is what exists, supposedly, in the cloud has a massive physical footprint.  There is massive water usage of between 500,000 and 5 million litres of water a day and massive electricity usage.</p><p>Just around the corner from me in what used to be the Jacob's biscuit factory, which employed approximately 1,000 people, there is a behemoth of an Amazon data centre, which probably employs between 30 and 50 people because that is the truth of what data centres employ in general.  What is all the activity that is going on that uses the water and electricity?  They like to give people the impression that all this is the stuff that makes life better but a large part of it is not.  We do not know the exact figure because it is all supposedly commercially sensitive but a significant volume of energy is spent on advertising and, in particular, on algorithms to target people with advertising and create wants that did not exist previously.  These do not add to people's quality of life.  They do not contribute to a good life for ordinary people.  Instead, they are part of a system of surveillance capitalism.</p><p>We have to ban data centres.  I welcome the motion tabled by the Social Democrats.  It would be good to have a moratorium.  What has been hinted at is that it would be more sustainable to locate data centres outside Dublin and in the west or midlands.  That would not work.  Professor Barry McMullin has made the fundamental point that expanding energy usage, which is what data centres will do, at a time we do not have 100% renewable energy is similar to trying to go down an upward moving escalator.  We have 11% usage currently that will rise to 30% and we have significant water usage and so on.  It is incompatible with the Green Party's climate targets, and with the Government's own climate targets, inadequate as they are, to continue with further data centres.  We have to shout &quot;Stop&quot; and, therefore, we have to pass our Bill to ban future fossil fuel infrastructure and future data centres.</p></speech>

The Minister of State's party leader told RT&Eacute; this morning that using oil and coal power stations for longer than expected will not jeopardise Ireland's emissions reduction targets.  Greta Thunberg had establishment politicians precisely like his leader in mind when she talked yesterday about how they open their mouths and go, "Blah, blah, blah."</p>  <p>  If Tarbert and Moneypoint power stations are not closed by the agreed dates, the climate movement might usefully have a debate about trying to do so by way of a direct action people power campaign.  Such a move would put the Minister of State and his Green Party colleagues in a difficult position.  Either back down and shut down fossil fuel power generation, as the climate movement demands, or stay in government as his party's leader last did while the cops move in to crack the heads of climate campaigners standing up for a just cause the way that they did at Rossport the last time the Green Party was in government holding the Ministry.  Only this time it will be a far more difficult sell-out for the Green Party.  The issues will be coming to a head precisely as the clock ticks down to 2030, and this time with the eyes of a generation of young people upon them.  No doubt, the Minister of State will say that the alternative is power cuts, but I do not agree.  Data centres use up between 2% to 3% of electricity output worldwide.  In Ireland, the equivalent figure is 11% and this could treble before the end of the decade.  Uncontrolled development of data centres is incompatible with our climate goals.  As has been mentioned, it is like trying to run up the down escalator.  Placing carbon limits on data centres is not the answer.  That will only lead to data centres switching to green energy and eating up a hugely disproportionate volume of our much-needed green energy supplies.  I urge the Minister of State to act like his house is on fire.  It is time for action and not for more "Blah, blah, blah".</p></speech>

As Deputy Murphy explained, much of what they do is highly questionable in respect of their contribution to the betterment of society.  People also need to understand that there is a connection between the significant energy price hikes that they have experienced over the past year and data centres.  Energy prices are going up and people&rsquo;s bills are increasing because there is a major surge in demand for energy globally, with data centres in this country and throughout the world contributing significantly to that surge.  People need to understand that this issue is, in the first instance, about the climate emergency and the damage such centres do to our environment, but it is also hitting people in their pockets as we speak with hikes of between 20% and 40% in their energy bills.  People in this country have been subject two, three or four energy price hikes, amounting to hundreds of euro annually.</p>  <p>  As well as saying we should stop the construction of data centres, we should insist that carbon tax increases be set aside in the next budget.  Any increase on top of those price hikes for ordinary people would be grossly unjust.  Carbon tax increases are aggressive and unfair.  They should be set aside and energy price caps should be imposed to stop the hikes, which are robbing ordinary people because of issues that are not their fault.</p></speech>

I have a lot of time for many of the Green Party activists who are elected representatives.  I believe that many of them have approached their time in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with the best of objectives and sincere values in trying to fix the climate crisis in the State.  I am stunned, however, at the level of capture that I have seen among Green Party Members in this D&aacute;il.  Many people voted for the party first and foremost because they believed they were going to be an ethical watchdog in government with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Obviously, that has not happened.  We have seen the number of scandals that have occurred during the Government's term while the Green Party has stood idly by on that.   Many people figured that the Green Party was taking a strategic view and giving a blank cheque to typical Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael behaviour because they were so focused on the green agenda and on making sure that their agenda is achieved.  How come we then see the Green Party get captured with regard to what is happening around data centres at the same time?  It is really hard to understand how on one level they can renege on their objective of being a watchdog in respect of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael wrongdoings, and, on the other, sell out so quickly on their core objectives of achieving CO2 reduction and climate policy that will fix the environment on this planet.</p> <p> Instead of seeing the green flag being flown by the party at the moment, the white flag has been raised on many issues so far in government.  The landscape the Green Party is in charge of at the moment is turning into a landscape of chaos.  Energy security is the first responsibility of any government.  Being able to keep the lights on is the first responsibility of every government.  There is no better way to unite all sectors of society in anger against the Government than introducing energy instability.  It affects everybody.  It affects people in being able to just put the kettle on or to make a bottle for their child, it affects businesses ability to function, and it affects hospitals and other services that we depend to be delivered.  Yet, the energy situation in the State is now in chaos.  It is entering a period of significant instability.  It will be a fatal blow to the credibility of the Government if it does not ensure energy stability in this country.</p> <p> I was shocked to listen to the interview of the Minister of State's leader on "Morning Ireland" earlier.  I heard him make an argument for the extension of the lifespan of the coal-fired station in Moneypoint and the oil-fired power station in Tarbert.  I asked myself the question: was this argument any different from the argument that would have been made by Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael in previous years?  These two parties have covered themselves in green wash and have stood in every green photo opportunity but have never delivered on anything over the past ten years.  I asked myself if the leader of the Green Party was delivering a message in any different way from how those two political parties have delivered.  The answer is very clearly "No".</p> <p> The idea that the greens are making an argument currently for a entire sector to be given free rein in the delivery of increased output of CO2 is incredible.  Other countries have decided to put a cap on it and if those sectors want to increase in size in the future, they have to do so on the basis of sustainable energy alone.  Other countries have the cart the right way around with regard to the horse, but unfortunately the Green Party in Ireland has not.  I cannot understand why the Green Party wants to undermine the entire green project for the sake of data centres.  Many people are learning that the mobile phone is now becoming a weapon of environmental destruction in many ways.  It is important for environmentalists to start to reappraise the use we make of mobile phones and of data in this country.  I cannot understand why the Green Party is putting all of its political capital in data centres.  It significantly undermines our message to the rest of society.  Data centres are not employment rich; in fact they are employment poor.  They have a low impact on the improvement of society, income levels, and general business within society.  It undermines the Green Party's message to everybody else in society.  How can the Minister of State and his party tell working-class families to take the burden of a carbon tax in the future when the party is giving a free rein to data centres in the State?  How can they tell farmers to reduce the size of the national herd, reduce their ability to make a living in this country, and radically alter the business model they operate?  How can the Green Party ask farmers to accept the low wages they are experiencing at the moment and accept that thousands of them will leave the agricultural sector on an annual basis, while at the same time giving free rein to data centres?  It radically reduces the party's ability to be taken seriously when it is selling its other messages to other sectors of society.</p> <p> I will talk about water now.  Many of these data centres are located on the east coast.  Due to climate change the east coast is has far less water at the moment.  In my county of Meath for example, Enfield was without water for 17 days in August.  In a first world country in the 21st century, for the majority of the days in the month of August people were turning on the taps with no water coming out.  I know of 100 people living in the centre of Meath whose wells are running dry at the moment.  That may be because of the new extraction involved at Tara mines, but all of these watercourses are linked to each other.  The River Boyne is lower than it ever has been because of the pressure that water is under.  Yet, the Government is proceeding with an industry that is extremely harsh on water in an area that is already in big trouble.</p> <p> I will point to the other elements of the Green Party's impact so far in Government.  Ireland is, I believe, the only country in Europe at the moment where no solar farm is plugged into the national grid.  Ireland is the only country in Europe where there is no feed-in tariff yet for microgeneration.  The North has been festooned with solar panels for nearly a decade, which are on top of homes.  Energy is generated by families, plugged into the electricity grid, and they get some money in return.  We are still not in the position where there is an auction in this country for microgeneration using a feed-in tariff.  The Green Party is not delivering.  The party has raised the white flag and is ceding ground to Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael on its core values, and that needs to change.</p></speech>

Electricity costs are up 19%.  Has the Minister of State ever heard the phrase "You cannot get blood out of a turnip"?  People will not be able to pay for electricity or energy to keep themselves warm this winter.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will be aware that two weeks ago his party colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, said there was no problem with energy supply.  He came out yesterday to say that we will be in trouble for the next four or five years and that we may have outages.  This does not inspire confidence in him, the leader of the Green Party, or in the Government.</p>  <p>  Everything is supposed to be electric, such as electric cars, but we have no charging points and we do not even have enough electricity.  The Government reinstated Moneypoint workers to whom they had given redundancy.  The Government has been caught with its trousers down because it did not realise we would run out of electricity when it closed Bord na M&oacute;na and closed Moneypoint.</p> <p>I am asking the Government to bring back the workers to Bord na M&oacute;na to ensure the people of this country do not have to suffer power outages.  Many people do not know what a data centre is, but if the lights go out in this country, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and the Government will know what they are.</p></speech>

Data centres are popping up all over the place.  There are 17 of them in this country, which places a significant demand on energy supply.  Most of them are in Dublin.  The huge demand on energy concerns me.  Does it mean we will face further amber alerts or are we drifting towards blackouts, as has been stated for some time now by the Minister, Deputy Ryan?  Regarding climate action to date, the focus of the Green Party has been on rural Ireland, with families paying massive carbon tax, penalties on fuel, including at petrol stations, increases in electricity costs and home heating oil and so much more.  Families are suffering and businesses in west Cork are telling me that they are running into serious problems and cannot afford to keep going.</p>  <p>  We were promised in this House by politicians who were in favour of the carbon tax and climate action that it would not affect the national herd.  We now know different.  Several farmers from west Cork who have 75 cows on their farms see no other way out but to reduce their herd to 50 cows.  That will result in an astonishing drop in income for them.  It is also an astonishing attack on Irish agriculture.  At the same time, there are data centres all over Dublin sucking up energy beyond belief but there is concern about that.  If there is ground to be made up in this country, it appears it is to be made up in rural Ireland.  I have put forward solutions to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in regard to the energy crisis.  There is potential to have a floating LNG terminal, which would bring so many benefits for this country, but he has rejected it.  With the Green Party in government we have data centres all over Dublin creating energy instability in our country while in this House, the party, along with Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and a few nod and wink politicians, supports the destruction of rural Ireland, with the culling of cattle and fuel and energy bills rising out of control all affecting rural people and families.</p></speech>

Dublin has developed into a major data hub, but at what cost to our electricity supply?  Ireland wants to reduce its emissions by slowing down energy use.  Data centres put massive pressure on an existing system that is broken.  Why is the Green Party in government turning a blind eye to this issue while farming groups are being pressurised to reduce the national herd by 50%?  Household electricity costs have gone through the roof.  The running costs for SMEs have also gone through the roof.  The system is under pressure.  There is much talk about a move to electric vehicles.  We do not have the energy supply to support it.</p>  <p>  The planning system was changed several years ago to allow for strategic infrastructure for data centres.  What does Government expect people to do?  Every action being taken by Government is costing rural areas the most.  Carbon emissions is a big issue in rural Ireland because of the lack of infrastructure.  Electricity costs are going through the roof because we have no other way of doing things.  The Green Party is a city-based party.  All of its Deputies are from the city.  They know nothing; they are spoiled rotten.  The Green Party thinks all it needs to do is throw some fairy dust up into the air and everything will be perfect.  The leader of the Green Party and its elected members are away with the fairies.  They need to wake up and look at what they are doing outside of Dublin.  The are punishing rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland will punish them at the next election.  God help them all when they come to the doors.</p></speech>

He should have remained here and listened to what Deputies have to say on this issue.  It was he who on one of the few times he left Dublin, went to Kildare to announce the closure of Bord na M&oacute;na, one of his proudest moments.  It was a shameful moment, one that he, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, and all in the other parties and none who supported that decision will regret for a long time.  One of the aims of the programme for Government 2016 was an LNG project for the Shannon Estuary.  In the infinite wisdom of Government, we now do not need an LNG project.  Of course, we do.  I accept that it should not use fracked gas, but there are other ways of having LNG in this country.  We need surety of supply for energy.  We should not be here today saying we do not want any more data centres here because they are using up our energy; we should be discussing how we can bring about surety of supply.  The response from Government is a proposal to increase the number of generators, which are to be operated on diesel or gas.  That is a very inefficient way of dealing with the situation.  It has also mentioned purchasing energy form the UK and France, which will be nuclear energy.  That is not a smart move.  We should focus our efforts on surety of supply.  It is important to make the point that not only the Government parties, but Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party and others are in a race to the bottom regarding the need to protect the climate and the future and not the here and now.  I am worried about the elderly people who this winter and next might not have energy in their homes.</p>  <p>  This debate is about data centres.  I remind the Government that older people require heat and electricity to cook their breakfast and dinner.  Many of them have no alternative to electricity because the chimneys in their houses are closed off.  The Government parties need to watch what they are doing because it will come back to bite them in the bottoms, as it is doing so already.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Whitmore and her colleagues for bringing forth this motion.  As far back as 2019, I tabled a question on this issue having read the Government's statement on the role of data centres in Ireland's enterprise strategy.  I welcome the opportunity to talk about it today even though I have only four minutes in which to do so.</p>  <p>  I have never been as frightened.  Deputy O'Dowd is a lovely man, but taking his speech, the Minister's speech and this policy, I am frightened.  I am fearful that they either have no idea what they are talking about or they are completely and utterly in the hands of the developers who are leading the data centres, as confirmed by EirGrid in its report.  I say that reluctantly.  To accuse the Social Democrats, who I am not here to defend, of stopping the clock is sick in a sense when, in reality, the clock will be stopped by climate change.  We declared an emergency when the children of this country stood on the streets in May 2019, which was less than a year after this Government's statement on the role of data centres in enterprise.  In case there is any doubt, Government was delighted to set out that the State's ambition was to be the digital economy hotspot in Europe.  We will be a hotspot all right.  I can tell you that.  </p>  <p>  The Government is amending the planning processes such that buildings over a certain size will become strategic.  There are not enough thumbs on the Government's hands to endorse this strategy.  Before that, we had the policy and study of the benefits.  Perhaps the Deputy I mentioned earlier got some of his facts from this.  Had he looked at both documents and done a word search manually, as I did, he might have noted that climate change is not mentioned, except in regard to the Department.  Climate change does not feature, water does not feature, unsustainability does not feature nor does the fact that the data centres are being utterly led by the developers.  </p>  <p>  I read a good article earlier this year, which I have mislaid, about the feathery - I have difficulty with the word "ethereal" - view of data centres and the cloud as if they are up in the sky when they are very much down on the ground.  I do not think people - I do not like the phrase "ordinary people" -  know, as I did not know until I read this policy, what these centres are about, notwithstanding what happened with the proposed site in Athenry, County Galway.  As outlined by the Social Democrats, we have 70 centres in being and 30 more in the process.  What is the magical figure, where do we stop, when do we begin to question and where is the bigger debate on the need for all of this data?</p> <p>As for accusing us or anybody here of wanting to stop, I want a thriving Galway city, I want foreign direct investment and I also want indigenous industry, but I want an analysis of how we will have that and still meet our climate objectives.  We cannot do that with the speech we got today or the contribution from the backbencher because it is utter denial.  We have learnt nothing except we are in hock to the big boys and, indeed, the big girls who are here.</p> <p> I have only 18 seconds left.  I hope I get a chance later in the week.  There are many facts I would like to go into, particularly that it is being led by the developers and that the CRU, when it appeared before the committee in July, thought it was okay to continue on as is.  The CRU would seem to have changed its mind now.  I will stick to the time.</p></speech>

Like most Members in the House, I would agree with each and every one of the concerns its Members have expressed in the motion about data centres, the amount of energy they use, the cost of that energy, the water that is used and the sustainability of it all.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, I am quite ambivalent about the motion because I am not, I have to say, convinced by their response.  I listened to Deputy Catherine Murphy yesterday talk about what good employers Intel were in Kildare and they are.  Of course, they use huge amounts of energy etc.  We in Ireland want Facebook, Google and Twitter headquartered here.  We want all of these corporations headquartered here generating employment, generating wealth and raising the standard of living throughout the country, but they have one thing in common.  Every chip that Intel makes goes into a computer and ultimately the user of that computer is storing data somewhere.  Likewise, Facebook is storing vast amounts of data somewhere.  Google is using vast amounts of data somewhere.  Is it okay for us if the data that is being generated through companies based in Ireland are stored elsewhere?  Is the problem that the data are being stored in Ireland or is it the vast amounts of data that are increasingly being used and stored?  I have a major concern about the amount of data.  I share the Social Democrats' concern about that, unless we tackle it.  We are in a position, as a country.</p>  <p>  In saying I am ambivalent about the Social Democrats' motion, I am completely underwhelmed by the Government's response.  I accept the Government acknowledges the problem but we need to do something about it.  What are we going to do?  Are these data okay if they are stored in America instead of Ireland?  We, at least, have a temperate climate here.  My understanding is data centres have to be at a certain temperature throughout the year.  If they are in a climate like that in America, it will cost a great deal more to heat them in the winter and to cool them in the summer.  I looked at the top ten locations for data centres in the world.  They include China, Russia, Japan, Australia and America.  The Netherlands and the UK are there too, but the rest of them are not temperate climates.  Is it okay we use even more energy across the world storing those data once they are not in Ireland?  I am not convinced that is the response.  The response has to be a reduction.  The problem is not a data centre in Ireland.  The problem is the use of data by everybody in Ireland and everybody in the world who are customers of companies based in Ireland regardless of where those data centres are.</p>  <p>  Doing nothing is not the solution.  I am not suggesting it is and that we do nothing.  We have to face up to the problem at an Irish level and at an international level.  Is it to be taxed?  Are people to be curtailed in the amount of data they use?  We can complain about the use of anything, for example, companies that make plastic, but we all use so much plastic.  We will have to change how people behave.  That is a very difficult thing to do.  It is a lot more difficult than introducing a moratorium.  I am not saying we should do nothing because what we can do is so insignificant but shifting where the data are stored to somewhere else is not the answer - shifting where that plastic is produced to somewhere else is not the answer - as long as Irish consumers and consumers right across the world continue to use these data and those data are stored somewhere, using vast amounts of energy and perhaps more energy in other places than it does here.</p>  <p>  I thank the Social Democrats for raising this very important issue.  I regret that I cannot support the motion and I am not in any way impressed by the Government's response.</p></speech>

Sitting in the Chair is always a good place to be to listen to the debate.</p>  <p>  It is a necessary discussion but I am disappointed.  That is why I liked the contributions of Deputies Bacik, McNamara and others.  I found some of the other contributions incredibly one-sided - this rush to be on the side of the virtuous here.  Yet someone is eating, to use the terms we use about data, or consuming a great deal of data.  It is a generational issue.  Your Spotify, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and TiKTok are all data.  I am not loading this on a particular generation but if those data were not being used, there would not be a reason to store them.  Equally, the provision of data centres has saved multiple indigenous Irish companies, including semi-State companies and, I imagine, commercial companies, a huge amount of money in terms of research and development because these companies now manage their data.  They themselves do not have to manage their data.  They give it to these companies to manage, thereby saving institutions in this country hundreds upon hundreds of millions of euro.  Imagine if each financial institution, technological institution or tech company had to manage its own data and continually upgrade its systems to ensure those data were secure.  Instead, you have a corporate provider - we may not agree with it - who does all that and guarantees it and takes responsibility for it.  That is data.  If we are to have a cycle and want it to be a virtuous cycle, the target cannot always be those who manage the data, store them and secure them, including memories such as photographic memories.  All those photographs we take every day on our iPhones, all those selfies around Leinster House and all those videos we publish on social media are up in the cloud.</p>  <p>  I know a bit about the cloud because part of it is in Tallaght.  Deputy Paul Murphy also made a considered contribution, and he talked about the Amazon Web Services, AWS, site in Tallaght.  The Deputy correctly mentioned the old Jacob's factory - the Irish Biscuits factory - which was a great employer in Tallaght.  It closed, and that site lay dormant for many years despite different attempts to get companies to move into it.  AWS moved in.  What the Deputy forgot to mention was, and this is what we need to bear in mind too, it is not only the investment.  There are hundreds of people employed in the construction of that site, in securing the site and in landscaping the site.  Then there is the commercial rate the local authority gets.  When I was a councillor on South Dublin County Council, there were approximately 15 companies that paid 85% of the commercial rates, and if you were to remove any of them from South Dublin County Council, it would impact the services provided to each and every citizen of the county.  I am not being an advocate, because I recognise we need to have a conversation, but let us not say we are the bad guys and they are the good guys because they all use data and I use data.</p>  <p>  Then I thought of the funniest ones of all.  I am sure there must be a significant carbon footprint in that data centre that is housing all Sinn F&eacute;in's electoral data, although it is not in Ireland.</p> <p>It is in Germany so at least our electricity grid is being spared that burden.  The whole talk today is that data centres are bad and everybody who is against them is good.  Data are essentially with us.  They are like the air we breathe.  The amount of data has grown and it is time for a conversation, but that conversation should not be framed around pitching those who favour and see the value of the enterprise side of it, and all the good and positive things data centres bring, against those who do not.</p> <p> I want to talk about AWS because it is the only instance I know of in my constituency.  Many of the contributions here said there is very little economic, labour and employment benefit.  Obviously, we all know about the corporation tax that is paid.  That is the headline figure but there is also the commercial rate.  Commercial rates are the lifeblood of every county in this country.  Councils could not move, exist, function and do all the things they do, from libraries to roads to environmental issues to parks, without the significant contribution, and rightly so, the commercial rates bring them.</p></speech>

There is great synergy going on between AWS and South Dublin County Council in terms of the district heating scheme.  We talk about water and I am very conscious of the amount of water.  Do we know if data centres must use clean water?  To the best of my knowledge, AWS has been investigating the use of brown water to cool data centres.  The CEOs of these companies will be sacked if they do not achieve their carbon footprint goals.</p>  <p>  One of the final things I will mention is the employment spin-off, which has not been discussed.  By the time it is finished in Ireland, all these data centres hope to use and rely on renewable energy and actually give back the grid, which is what AWS is doing with the district heating system that is proposed with South Dublin County Council.</p>  <p>  To conclude, and I thank the Acting Chairman for his forbearance, this has to be a balanced debate.  There are no good guys and bad guys here.  Everybody in this Chamber uses huge amounts of data.  We also have a responsibility, as was mentioned by a speaker yesterday, to look at how we can limit our use of data and then perhaps we would not need as many data centres.  Let us have a balanced debate on it, however.</p></speech>

I refer to the following article that appeared on <i>Extra.ie</i>:</p> <blockquote> 	Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said he will push for massive offshore wind power capacity to be developed before any more data centres are built if his party re-enters government after the general election.<br /><br />Speaking to <i>Extra.ie</i>, Mr Ryan said that the next government needs to be sure that data centres 'don't interfere with meeting climate targets', with the government committed to supplying 70% or around 10,000 megawatts (MW) of energy from renewable sources by 2030.<br /><br />'Ireland has everything to gain from this type of energy and data centres fit into that but they have to fit into it, we can't build the data centres first and then try and tap into the offshore energy, I think we need to get the offshore energy built and that then deals with a lot of the sustainability concerns that people have'. </blockquote>  <p>Indeed, that addresses the point made by Deputy McNamara regarding where they should they be located.  They should be located where we have renewable energy to power them.  I believe that is the point the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was making last year.  Four days later, after that article published, we had a generation election and the Green Party was very successful in winning 12 seats.  I believe there was an expectation this would make a sizeable difference in terms of focusing the Government.</p><p>Essentially, this is a central issue in terms of power supply.  How can the Government possibly argue for people to go out and buy electric cars and then power them by Moneypoint?  It is argument the Green Party was making last year.  I do not know who wrote the speech the Minister gave, but to be perfectly honest with the Minister of State, it must be an embarrassment.  The noticeable absence of Green Party Deputies in the D&aacute;il this morning says it all.</p><p>I will finish on one point because I am going to allow my colleague, Deputy Whitmore, to wrap up.  We are not looking for something that has not been done elsewhere.  Singapore has recently become the first country to introduce a moratorium on data centres.  It is taking what we believe is the very sensible approach of only lifting the moratorium when renewable energy capacity has been increased and data storage technologies, which would reduce the energy burden, have been developed.  The Government might also wish to know that Singapore is the fifth largest recipient of foreign direct investment, FDI.</p><p>We are seeing at the moment that IDA Ireland, which was an advocate for data centres, is now making the argument that are our problem with energy and secure energy supply is actually an impediment and could cause us reputational damage.  We must get to grips with assessing what is needed.  We do not do planning in this country but we have to do it with regard to this because what is happening is unsustainable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="11:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900019#R00800"><p>In his speech earlier, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, made quite an astounding admission.  When talking about the challenges of the electricity and the security of supply, he said, "The increase in data centre demand was forecasted and is increasing in line with forecasts."  I thought the Government had taken its eye off the ball with this and fallen asleep at the wheel when it came to managing data centre increases.  It seems this was actually quite a conscious decision, however.  The Government consciously allowed data centres to increase to the point where we are facing blackouts.  It consciously allowed data centre energy requirements to increase to the point where energy prices will skyrocket and we will have to have oil and coal-fired electricity, which was meant to be shut down and which will have to be continued.  That a Green Party Minister consciously allowed that to happen is astounding.  I could not believe it when I heard the Minister say it.</p>  <p>  The Government made a decision to allow our energy supply to be stretched to the point of breakage.  That is exactly what EirGrid said, that it was primarily from the data centres.  The Government consciously allowed that to happen.  For the Minister to call our moratorium a blunt instrument is frankly ridiculous.  It is not a blunt instrument; it is the only responsible thing this Government can do at this point.</p>  <p>  It is estimated that if all the data centre applications are granted, that will result in 70% of our electricity being used by data centres by 2030.  There has to be a pause on it until the Government gets its house in order and figures out exactly what it means and how it can condition these data centres to make them sustainable and energy and water efficient to make them part of the data and energy solution in the country.</p>  <p>  The Minister met last week with the Fridays for Future group, which talked about how it wants a fossil-free future, a liveable city and a just society, which I believe are things we would all like to see.  It wants urgent and immediate action.  Instead of the Minister taking urgent and immediate action today and putting a pause on data centres, he is going to allow them to continue to grow.  Does the Minister think it is quite disingenuous that he said this to those students last week while getting his photo opportunities and is now refusing take the tangible actions they want him to take when he has the opportunity?</p> <p>The Government has the opportunity to make a change now.  It has the opportunity to put communities, investment, jobs and the environment ahead of a specific industry.  I really hope it takes that opportunity.</p></speech>

In the Taoiseach's budget day speech at the time, he claimed this fund was a result of Fianna F&aacute;il influence over the then Government.  Will he also claim the fact the plan was an absolute failure?  Zero affordable homes to rent or buy were delivered in 2019 or 2020.  In response to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has confirmed that only eight affordable homes to purchase will be delivered by this Government by the end of 2021.  The Minister, who believes the property market is not out of control, will only have delivered eight genuinely affordable homes to buy this year.  Is it any wonder we have a housing crisis?  N&iacute;or chuir an tAire ar f&aacute;il ach ocht dteach inacmhainne sa bhliain seo.  Is scannal &eacute; seo agus t&aacute; s&eacute; maslach d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d at&aacute; s&aacute;innithe sa gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im tith&iacute;ochta seo.  Taispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; go bhfuil an Rialtas ag teip ar thith&iacute;ocht.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has now been in government for 15 months.  The fund to which I refer was in place before he took office.  He has stated many times that housing will be his priority.  He has stated he wants to give working people a chance to own their own homes.  Is he seriously telling me this can actually be achieved by him when his Government will deliver only eight affordable homes to buy this year?</p>  <p>  It seems that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael refuse to change.  They simply recycle failed policies, the policies that got us into this mess in the first place.  We see that in the plan of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.  It caters for the interests of big developers, large landowners and institutional investors first and foremost and not those in housing need.  The Government will not invest enough money in delivering affordable homes through councils and approved housing bodies because those would be homes that people could actually buy.  For the Taoiseach, it seems housing is all about the profits of the private sector and Government initiatives that are about lining the pockets of developers.  He continues down that road relentlessly.  He knows full well that so many people are stuck paying massive rents, forking out as much as &euro;2,000 a month.  I do not know how you put together a deposit for a house while paying that kind of rent.  Now, through this parliamentary question, it has been confirmed that only eight genuinely affordable homes will be delivered this year.  That is a slap in the face to every person who is in housing need throughout the State.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that this scheme has been an utter failure?  Can he explain how it is that the Government will only deliver eight affordable homes this year?</p></speech>

It has voted against every affordability measure at every turn.  In particular, it opposed the help-to-buy scheme that has helped 22,000 people to get onto the property market.  It opposed more than 6,000 homes in Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  Right across the board, it has opposed projects that had significant affordable components in those particular schemes.</p>  <p>  From the perspective of the Government, we were not in government in 2018.  We have been in government for 15 months and during those 15 months there have been two significant lockdowns.  That has impacted in terms of house construction, but the Minister has spent that time putting in a legislative foundation in terms of the affordability Bill and other measures to ensure there are a number of schemes, which he has resourced - they are resourced in the Housing for All strategy - that will make thousands of affordable homes available in the coming years.  State intervention will be provided for up to 36,000 affordable purchase homes in the context of that plan.  That is in addition to 90,000 social homes and up to 18,000 cost rental homes.  These are clear targets in the Housing for All strategy.  That is backed up by &euro;4 billion per annum in Government resources and has been approved by the Government.</p>  <p>  On the legislative front, the Minister has put in the legislative underpinning for affordable homes.  He has engaged with the local authorities on a local authority-led scheme and approach in terms of affordable homes and in terms of providing the necessary finance and supports to approved social housing bodies, which the Deputy referenced in her comments.  I found that comment striking because the opposite is the case.  We are resourcing the approved housing bodies very significantly in terms of their particular objective on the social housing front.</p>  <p>  That initiative in 2018 did not lead to affordable home provision.  We were not in an executive position to determine that or deliver it, but we are now and I am very focused on delivering on the commitments within the Housing for All strategy now that we are emerging from Covid-19 and progress is being made on a number of programmes.  The first affordable homes will be developed in Boherboy in Cork this year and the engagement has happened with local authorities.  The reform of the serviced sites initiative scheme is one example of that and there are a range of other measures, such as the legislation in terms of the delivery mechanisms that will be required to get affordable homes built in this country and to enable people to afford the cost of houses.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;l aon amhras ach go bhfuil b&eacute;im faoi leith ag an Aire ar thithe a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine ionas go mbeidh siad in ann iad a cheannach ar phraghas r&eacute;as&uacute;nta.

I send my condolences to her son, Seamus, and her other family.  I wish to thank her for all her work in promoting the HPV vaccine.  I also ask the Taoiseach, at this juncture, to look again at the issue of the CervicalCheck tribunal, which we know is not functioning.  Many of us have raised the issue in this House.</p>  <p>  Today I wish to raise an issue that many people in Ireland are concerned about.  That concern has been multiplied by the interviews given by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications today in relation to where we are going from an energy point of view.  In multiple interviews this morning, he could not say that he could guarantee that the lights will stay on this winter.  I ask the Taoiseach the same question.  For everybody in Ireland watching now, in his reply, will he guarantee that the lights will stay on this winter?  It is a fairly simple question.</p>  <p>  I was in Brighton over the last few days at the Labour Party conference.  I passed many fuel depots and saw cars queuing up for petrol.  Obviously, because of Brexit, the UK has sleepwalked into a crisis.  I am concerned that because of our lack of long-term planning, we are sleepwalking into a crisis here when it comes to energy.  Anyone watching this debate today will be very worried.  I must ask a number of questions.  Is it because we have a dysfunctional system that EirGrid and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications are not talking to one another?  How is it that two gas-fired plants went down at the same time?  We all know when to get our cars serviced.  How come these two plants went down at the same time?  It has never been explained.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste last week if heavy industry was being issued with stock requests to manage the grid.  Amazingly, as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, he did not know the answer.  When IDA Ireland is attracting companies here, and I have often complimented it for the work it does, do we actually index the load requirements of the industry we are bringing in?  Do we do a cost-benefit analysis, for want of a better phrase?  We have had our debate on data centres and we know we have to manage that.  Is the Department of Transport at the table in the conversations on the whole energy issue?  We are expecting people to buy more electric vehicles in January.  We want people to move to heat pumps.  This will all increase load.  On the one hand, we are asking them to do this, and on the other, we are saying we might not have enough electricity to be able to ensure they work.  At the end of the day, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has warned that people will face higher energy costs.  What are we going to do in order to help them?</p>  <p> Unlike the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications this morning, will the Taoiseach guarantee that the lights will stay on this coming winter?  Can he explain how we got to this point and how short-termism got us here?  Finally, what regulations is he going to bring in to ensure people will be able to afford to heat their homes this winter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900021#T03500"><p>First of all, I thank the Deputy for the question, because it is a very important issue that is facing the people of the country today.  As the Deputy outlined, it is the responsibility of the CRU and EirGrid to ensure the right balance of electricity supply and demand.  When they briefed me and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications on Monday night, they assured us that everything necessary is being done to guarantee supply.  The generation capacity statement published by EirGrid today highlights two concerns, the first of which is short-term pressures this winter due primarily, as the Deputy has stated, to two gas-fired plants currently undergoing maintenance and going out.  This has been complicated by Covid-related delays in terms of getting the actual maintenance work done because of people travelling into the country.  However, we have been assured that these plants are due back in operation in October and November.  That will ensure supply throughout this winter.  Any short-term problems will be managed by working with large energy users who have their own back-up power supply.  That answers the Deputy's question about the lights going out.  The dramatic question is whether the lights will be on or off.</p></speech>

We will work with large energy users that have their own back-up power supply.  That is how that issue will be dealt with.</p>  <p>  Secondly, there is a generation gap between 2022 and 2025 because planned capacity increases will not come on stream, while demand has increased more than expected.  We have been assured by the CRU and EirGrid that they have plans in place to bridge that gap, including extending the operation of existing generators - that is going to have to happen - as well as providing temporary generation capacity and ensuring future auctions will be successful in bringing new gas-fired capacity into the system.  There will also be new interconnectors to France and Britain, while battery facilities will help to store renewable energy.  The CRU is also developing a new data centre connection policy to ensure their operation is aligned with supply.  There will be greater obligations on the operators of data centres in respect of the issue.</p>  <p>  The Government will be briefed regularly by the CRU and EirGrid on the roll-out of this work programme.  We will not hesitate to take any further steps, such as emergency legislation or other intervention, if we are advised it is necessary.  We will also continue to make clear, through the national development plan and the new climate action plan, that gas-fired generation capacity is an essential part of the energy transition.  This will reinforce the confidence of investors in new capacity.  These new steps will ensure that Ireland remains a location with reliable energy supplies which investors, businesses and households can have confidence in.</p>  <p>  I also wish to state that we have a long track record of meeting the needs of foreign direct investment, and we will maintain that record.  As we implement our ambitious renewable energy plans, including offshore wind, we will actually be in a very strong position by the end of the decade.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to join Deputy Kelly in extending my condolences to the family of Eileen Rushe at this very difficult time for them.  I thank Eileen for her extraordinary campaigning in relation to the HPV vaccine.</p></speech>

He knew this question was going to be asked this morning.  Will he just give the public an assurance, a guarantee, that we will have enough energy this winter and that the lights will stay on?  It is a very simple question.  I am sick and tired of short-termism.  We need to think about the longer term.  What new technologies are being considered?  Where is the plan for microgeneration?  Where is the plan for battery storage technologies?  We have only Turlough Hill.  A plan for a battery storage project in my constituency, at Silvermines, is noted as one of national and European importance.  Where are we going in regard to these technologies?  We really need to know that the lights will stay on and that there is a long-term plan that will deal with the issue over the coming years because it seems like we have sleepwalked into this and it has just been sprung upon us at this moment.  The public and businesses need assurance.</p></speech>

In respect of any short-term problems between now and when the two plants are back in operation in October, any issues that arise will be dealt with through demand management.  That means working with large energy users that have back-up generators.  That is how it will be dealt with.  It will be dealt with calmly and pragmatically that way.</p>  <p>  A key point I am making is that gas-fired generation capacity is an essential part of the energy transition.  The last two options did not succeed in bringing players in.  The next option will have to.  A clear roadmap has to be laid out in respect of anybody interested in that.</p>  <p>  On the issue of demand, data centres comprise just one aspect.  There are two big changes in the world.  One concerns data.  There will be an ongoing need for data centres all around the globe but we must have conditions attached and obligations concerning prioritisation and so on.</p></speech>

Those affected face losing their heating on freezing cold nights.  As warned by Professor John FitzGerald, who heads up the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, there is potential for hypothermia among old people.  This is not just to do with the limitation on energy; it has very much to do with the increased cost of electricity and the rising price of carbon.</p><p>To go back to the issue of the data centres, because it is very much connected to the overall problem we are having, I will relay some of the facts again.  I am aware that Members were all listening to the debate this morning but I was not.  There are currently 70 data centres operating in Ireland, which represents a 25% increase by comparison with 2020.  Dublin has the largest number of data centres and has now become the hub for them in Europe.  This represents an annual increase in demand of around 600 GW, the equivalent of 140,000 households per year being added to the grid.  Would that it were 140,000 new homes per year; that would be marvellous.  It is not a matter of new homes, however; it is a matter of data centres.  Over 2020, we saw a 27% increase in gas demand from the data centres.</p><p>Let me quote some very representative bodies that look after our energy.  EirGrid has stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The rate at which data centres are seeking to grow their load is unprecedented.  Over the last 4 years we have seen annual increases in demand usage of around 600 GWh [&hellip;] &ndash; equivalent to the addition of 140,000 households ... </blockquote>  <p>According to EirGrid, the key demand is data centres, and the median demand predicts data centres accounting for 25% of all demand by 2030.  The CRU has said that the types of projections EirGrid has given it indicate that electricity demand is to rise by between one third and 50% by 2030, primarily driven by the data centres.  The centres are the primary driver and their impact is really exceptional.  MaREI, the research institute, has stated that if data centres currently requesting connection are facilitated, Ireland's legal 2030 target of reducing economy-wide emissions by 51% would become effectively impossible to meet.  Which is it: data centres or providing people with energy to heat their homes?  Are we going to focus on data centres or reaching our climate targets?</p><p>Professor FitzGerald of the ESRI states the cost of interruptions to electricity supply in a modern society are huge &ndash; we all know that &ndash; but also states that if there is a significant interruption, the blackouts, if they occur, will have a much greater impact on households than on businesses.  I put it to the Taoiseach that, in a context in which households are facing ever-increasing energy bills and carbon taxes, the continued granting of planning permission to energy-intensive data centres is being perceived as an unfair distribution of the costs and benefits.  Not only is the Taoiseach failing on his climate targets and on giving people energy but he is also failing on just transition, which is supposed to be the key and cornerstone of everything his partners in government stand for.  Which is it: data centres or heat, or data centres or climate targets?</p></speech>

That is an overly simplistic presentation.  The CRU and EirGrid have statutory responsibility to ensure a balance between demand and supply.  That is what this Oireachtas established.  It provided the infrastructure.  That said, the Government has met representatives of both organisations and it will be taking decisions in respect of immediate issues.  Again, both bodies have advised there is a short- to medium-term risk to the security of electricity supply, and they have identified the main challenges, one being the lower-than-expected availability of some existing power stations.  Two went down.  Other challenges include anticipated new power stations not being developed as planned and expected growth in demand for electricity, including due to the growth of data centres.  We are not ignoring the issue of data centres because, as I stated earlier, the CRU is currently undertaking a review and developing a new data centre connection policy to ensure the centres' operation is aligned with supply.  There has not been any movement on data centres pending the outcome and conclusion of that review.  The idea of simply saying data centres should be banned is not a measured response, nor is it tenable into the future.</p>  <p>  The expected closure of power stations that make up approximately 25% of conventional electricity generation capacity is another factor.  Hence, there will be a need to extend those by a year, if that is required, in the medium term.  Short-term risks are reducing significantly because of the upcoming return to operation of the two key gas-fired stations.  They are due back now.  Their being down reduces supply.  Any risks in this regard will not necessarily affect the supply of electricity to customers, particularly households.</p>  <p>  On the energy cost side, the measures we take in the budget will have to address issues associated with the capacity of people, particularly low-income families, to meet fuel costs to try to protect them from the separate issue of the increase in energy costs across Europe, including here, because of the rebound of the economy after Covid-19, issues concerning supply from Russia and so on.  There are many global issues affecting the oil supply and the cost of energy that we will obviously have to take into consideration in the budget to protect people in this regard.</p></speech>

I have not heard anyone on the Government benches deny the warnings from the CRU, EirGrid and MaREI or call them wrong, but there have been meetings with these bodies.  Has the Taoiseach, as a leader, met representatives of Cloud Infrastructure Ireland, including former Labour Deputy Michael McCarthy, who heads up the lobbying group on behalf of the global corporations, towards which the Government's attitude is so servile that it says Ireland has a reputation for serving the interests of foreign direct investment companies?</p> <p>The Government, however, does not have a great reputation of serving the interests of its own citizens.  This country should not be used as the basis for the ever-expanding need of global citizens for data.  We have to be measured in how we look after our own citizens.  I see here a craven bending over of this and previous governments to the global corporations.  At their behest the Government is willing to have heat cut off in homes this winter, to miss our climate emissions targets in 2030 and to destroy the reputation of this country in other ways in that it is not able to provide the energy needed to bring in other investment.</p> <p>Are we listening to Jeff Bezos and Zuckerberg or are we listening to Joe and Josephine Soap who need the heat and need the price of electricity to be kept down?</p></speech>

I have no doubt that after the easing of the Covid-19 pandemic that the biggest crisis that this country will have to deal with will be health and waiting lists.  At the present time we are shockingly ill-prepared for the crisis which leaves many questions hanging over the head of the Minister for Health.</p>  <p> I ask the Taoiseach to look at his own county and the shambles that health is in at the moment in west Cork.  Hundreds of people are going to the North for crisis operations as they have no other choice.  During the summer, we saw the shocking handling of Bantry General Hospital, which is west Cork&rsquo;s only general hospital and serves up to 90,000 people living in the area along with tens of thousands of visitors.  Accident and emergency admissions were closed for 16 days due to a lack of staff.  This was flagged three years prior to this but due to major incompetence on the part of the HSE it was not addressed until the HSE was pulled, dragging and screaming, through the streets of Bantry by the great people of west Cork in a public protest.  The HSE then woke up and reopened the accident and emergency unit.  During all this time, the Minister of Health was nowhere to be found.  It looked, yet again, like another Minister was asleep at the wheel.</p>  <p>  SouthDoc services in Castletownbere and Kinsale are now non-existent.  Imagine the people of Ardgroom, Allihies, Adrigole, Urhan, Glengarriff, Castletownbere and Lauragh in south Kerry spending every night without a proper out-of-hours doctors service unless the day doctors in Castletownbere continue to work by night.  It is shocking to ask anybody to work day and night.  This is coupled with a crippling ambulance service in west Cork.  The Castletownbere ambulance, which one of four in west Cork, now spends its nights in Kerry.  The Clonakilty ambulance is now dubbed the Cork city ambulance.  Every night during the week, the other two ambulances are in every other part of the country but west Cork.  As a result, car accident victims in west Cork were recently left by the roadside for two hours and 45 minutes and two and a half hours, respectively, with garda&iacute; and fire personnel to care for them.</p>  <p>  We had a suspected stroke victim in Schull recently, where efforts were made to source an ambulance from another county.  Another person near Skibbereen passed away while waiting for an ambulance from another county.  This leaves ambulance staff, fire brigade staff, doctors, garda&iacute; and suffering patients and families astonished as to how this is allowed to happen.</p>  <p>  All of this has happened over the past two months on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s watch.  If this were not enough, CoAction has now decided to close its community houses in Castletownbere and to move loved ones with intellectual disabilities to Skibbereen and Bantry, which is nothing short of heartbreaking.  Again, the excuse is lack of staffing.  This is the same excuse that was used for Bantry hospital recently and for SouthDoc.  Now, the most vulnerable in our community will have the doors in their community homes - some of whom are in their 50s, 60s and 70s - shut in their faces.  This is another astonishing attack on the vulnerable people of west Cork. </p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach tell me why Bantry hospital was allowed to close its accident and emergency unit at the busiest time in August of this year, why there is no SouthDoc out-of-hours service in Castletownbere and Kinsale and why there are no ambulances in west Cork on most nights of the week?  Can the Taoiseach personally intervene with CoAction to prevent many heartbreaks with the closure of the CoAction homes in Castletownbere?  I may add that the funds for these homes were raised by local people.</p></speech>

Deputy Collins should have paid tribute to them for the outstanding service that the health service provided in the most difficult of times during a pandemic.  It is easy to be condemning all of the time.</p>  <p>  During August, I was very well aware of the Bantry situation.  Deputy Christopher O&rsquo;Sullivan contacted me on a daily basis.  What had transpired was no surprise to anybody, in terms of personnel issues rather than policy.  The Deputy would know that if he had bothered to ring the hospital or the HSE.  They would have explained it to him.  I believe they eventually spoke to the Deputy about this.  Resources have been provided for Bantry General Hospital.  There has been continued consistent investment in the hospital.  The Minister for Health engaged with the issue.  There were personnel issues in terms of availability which were beyond anyone&rsquo;s control at that particular point in time, but they were dealt with by the HSE in the south west.  Bantry hospital continues to play a very significant role for the entire hinterland because of the extent of west Cork right down to the Kerry border, to Castletownbere and so on.  I have always been a strong supporter of and advocate for Bantry hospital.  In my time as Minister for Health, we secured significant investment for that hospital and its identification as a unique type of hospital given its location and its need to service a very large rural hinterland.</p>  <p>  The ambulance service is a national one, as the Deputy is aware.  We will continue to work on any improvements that can be made to ensure provision of supply.</p>  <p>  The Minister will be producing an action plan in respect of waiting lists both from now until the end of the year and right through to 2022.  This is an enormous challenge because of the fact that we have had two lockdowns since March 2020 which impacted on the capacity of the acute system to get operations done.  That is no surprise to anyone.  Those challenges added to a list that had built up in the previous number of years.  There will be an all-out effort, in the first instance, to reduce waiting times for people in respect of acute hospitals.  Significant progress has been made on assessment of need; for example, in the past 12 months there has been a dramatic reduction by 91% in the number of children waiting for their assessments to be completed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, did great work there.  I know she will happily work with CoAction on any issues that it has.  I have also been a long-term advocate for and supporter of CoAction down through the years.</p></speech>

I welcome his confirmation that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will work with us on the CoAction issue in Castletownbere.  This is a very serious and upsetting issue for many of the families.  I did not break the news for nearly two weeks until I got no reply from CoAction as to what is going on there and as to why they are closing the residential homes.  For the Taoiseach's own information, I was well aware of what was going on at Bantry General Hospital.</p> <p>The HSE was aware of it for three years.  Does the Taoiseach not know that?  The HSE knew for three years that this was coming.  The consultants at the hospital have told us that.  These are the facts.</p> <p> I am well aware of what is going on in Bantry General Hospital; it is at my back door.  I respect the staff who work there.  I do not respect the way the HSE let down the people and left the hospital closed.  The Taoiseach stated he knew about it but he was invited to the protest every day of the crisis.  He should have stood with the people and that is where his voice should have been heard, but he failed the people.  The same is true in the case of SouthDoc.  The HSE reverted last week to say the issue relating to SouthDoc in Castletownbere had been resolved, but it lasted two days and collapsed.  There is no SouthDoc service there by night.</p> <p> There is a failure.  The Taoiseach can praise the staff all he likes.  There are great staff on the ground and the ambulance staff are second to none, but the bottom line is the problems in this country are at the top.  There is overpaid management, with layers that collapse continually, and the Taoiseach is in denial.  He is trying to say he knew about this issue every day of the week, but 16 days of admission were closed at a local hospital.

I heard from his responses earlier today that he clearly does not appreciate how anxious people are in regard to rocketing energy costs and the threat of power cuts this winter.

A submission has been made in respect of the NDP from a group at the home.  It is a comprehensive submission and I ask the Taoiseach to seriously consider it and ensure it is announced as part of the new NDP.  We need more public nursing homes and, in particular, a new unit in Roscrea.  This issue is the biggest priority for the people of the town.  I urge the Taoiseach to ensure it happens because, according to both HIQA and a letter from the Minister for Health to the group at the home, this unit will close to long-term residents on 1 January 2022.  That cannot happen.  The town needs its nursing home, and a long-stay one at that.  Will the Taoiseach please ensure it happens?</p></speech>

It operated outside of the scope of mainstream homelessness services provided by local authorities and voluntary NGOs, which are subject to a range of oversight arrangements and standards.  That is an important point.  In the context of the homelessness issue, there are many strong conventional providers and we have to be alert to new groups appearing overnight to deal with homelessness issues more generally.  That has been an ongoing issue.  The organisation did not receive statutory funding from the local authority for its services.  Issues have been raised around the role of the Charities Regulator in this case, while the Deputy and others have raised the Garda vetting issue.  There is a concern that not all of those working in homelessness services are being vetted, and the time has come to examine that issue-----</p></speech>

I explained how he had abused his position, persistently and completely inappropriately, to pursue a vulnerable woman, who was before his court on a family law matter, for a sexual relationship.  During the summer, I was contacted by another woman, who told me a very similar story relating to the same judge.  She too was before him on a family law matter.</p> <p>He approached her repeatedly, he got her number and then he persistently pursued her.  There are multiple incidents, so I will not go through all of them.  I will quote one incident she related to me.  She said:</p><blockquote>	He rang me another day and said he had stuff for my case.  He told me to meet him at the back door of the courthouse.  I went to the back door.  He was waiting.  He said he did not have the paperwork with  him.  He brought me in there to get the paperwork.  Then he lunged at me.  I pushed him and left.  He obviously felt he could have done anything he wanted to. </blockquote> <p>That is Ms B. in Michael Clifford's story in<i>The Examiner </i>today.

The first case, when I read up on it and so forth, went to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  The existing mechanisms and investigative authorities have not been in a position to bring this to what one would anticipate the conclusion should be.  Governments do not engage in the operational side of prosecution and so forth, but this matter raises very serious issues on which I will be consulting with others in terms of how to deal with them.  However, there is an overall issue that the Oireachtas and the Executive cannot investigate every case.  There is a real issue here regarding the authorities and how diligently assertions and allegations of this nature are followed up and dealt with comprehensively, because they have not been dealt with comprehensively in this case.  I am very concerned about it and about what I have read today in the articles the Deputy mentioned.  I will give further consideration to this and revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>

As a result, families with somebody who is immunocompromised will not now be told if their child is a close contact, exposing vulnerable people to Covid-19 infection.  The CMO said that while a public health risk assessment will be carried out to protect vulnerable children in special schools, no such assessment will be carried out if a child's brother or sister is a close contact in a mainstream school.  How can this be right?  The policy must be looked at again, even until the immunocompromised people have received their booster Covid shot.</p></speech>

Some people keep second-guessing public health advice.  The bottom line is that the schools have fully reopened safely after the summer break.  From the start of the pandemic schools have consistently operated on the basis of public health advice, and it has been a consistent principle that the Minister for Education and the Department of Education operate in accordance with the public health advice that is given at any point in time.  Following a review, NPHET has recommended that from 27 September routine contact tracing of asymptomatic close contacts among children in settings such as childcare facilities, primary education and social and sporting groups will no longer take place, with the exception of children in special education settings.  That is the advice that has been given and the Department has issued updated guidance to schools on foot of the change.  The balance is correct in that decision.</p></speech>

It is vital that the bypass is included.  Hopefully, it will be in the footprint of the new M24 which will go from Limerick to Waterford.  Something has to be included to relieve the people, businesses and households of Tipperary town and let them live without fumes and large trucks.  The extra traffic since Brexit is desperate.

Those pickets are still taking place.  We are receiving emails from women and men who feel they have been stigmatised, shamed and intimidated as they access reproductive healthcare.  The legislative programme for this autumn states that the safe access to termination of pregnancy services Bill is to be introduced, but it is only at preparatory stage.

The Loughrea power station in County Longford was the largest rate payer in the county at &euro;1.2 million annually.  That compares dramatically with the average rate bill locally which is just &euro;1,800.  The report from the Just Transition Commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, was very specific on this point.  He was adamant that it would be unfair if provision was not made centrally to compensate local authorities for such a significant loss in revenue, especially as the planned closure was brought forward from the original planned date of 2027.  Bringing forward the closure decision has undoubtedly posed large financial challenges for Longford County Council, which is already operating in a very challenging socioeconomic environment.</p></speech>

The Lanesborough plant in Longford accounted for 15% of the rates base while in Offaly the Edenderry and Shannonbridge plants together accounted for almost 25% of the local rates base.  In recognition of this, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, provided compensatory funding in 2021 equivalent to 100% of the rates that would otherwise have been due, with &euro;1.4 million allocated to Longford and &euro;3.3 million to Offaly.  It was intended to be a once-off allocation to support the two authorities.  However, recognising the challenges in 2021, during which local authorities continued to support the national effort to combat Covid-19 and the reopening of society while delivering key services to the public, compensatory funding is now again under consideration for 2022 as part of the Estimates process.  I will relay what the Deputy said to the Minister in respect of this key issue.</p></speech>

Renewable energy support scheme, RESS, auctions have been postponed.  Wind Energy Ireland maintains that offshore projects under the watch of this Government have been delayed due to the lack of a framework and the microgeneration scheme continues to be promised ma&ntilde;ana.

That is a matter for the Oireachtas.  We will work with the Oireachtas to do that.  I support the Deputy's point that it needs to get through as quickly as possible and if the Oireachtas comes on board, we can do that.  The same applies to microgeneration.  I do not believe the Deputy's points accurately reflect the commitments I gave this morning.

Our Gaeltacht communities in Mayo are an incredible asset to our county from both a tourism and a cultural perspective.  We need to ensure that our teachers do not feel disincentivised from taking up employment in these areas.  I understand that, in 2017, schools that were previously categorised as Gaeltacht schools were given the option to opt in or out of sc&eacute;im aitheantais scoileanna Gaeltachta.  However, I was advised that teachers in the schools that opted out continued to receive the Gaeltacht allowance, which is viewed as incredibly unfair to new teachers who are teaching in the schools that remained.

Parents in the area have been turned away from other schools farther away because of lack of spaces.  We have heard of people waiting for two years or more.  Some children may have to travel even farther to Waterford city, Dungarvan or Kilkenny, which, as the Taoiseach will appreciate, is unsuitable for many children.  It is distressing for parents to have to put their child on a bus to go to a school farther away to say the least.  The parents concerned have set up a Facebook page to raise awareness of their situation.  Since appearing on local radio, they have become aware of more than 20 families in this situation, some with more than one child.</p>  <p>  How can the Department claim to know enough about St. Brigid's in Carrick-on-Suir that it can close it and yet children in need of ASD units or classrooms are being totally overlooked?

The NCSE would assess the demand in given areas and would approach schools with a view to providing ASD units.  There is no issue with resourcing ASD units.  A total of 269 additional special classes have been opened this year, which brings the total number of special classes nationally to a new high of 2,118 for this school year.  They will provide 1,600 additional places throughout the country.  The additionality is being provided.  The extra classes are being opened.  Schools need to apply for the ASD units.  If the Deputy wants to work with us on it, there will be no issue.</p></speech>

When can we expect these guidelines to be published?  There are many issues and people in rural communities have no protection from wind energy companies coming in and constructing monstrous turbines against their wishes.  In respect of an application for wind turbines in Lemanaghan, County Offaly, there have been 2,300 objections, including one from me.  The site is important for its heritage, history and archaeology.  There are no protections because we have no guidelines.  These guidelines are long overdue.  I ask the Taoiseach to give a specific timeframe.  This matter is of concern to many Deputies across all parties.  I call on the Government to publish the guidelines urgently.</p></speech>

The issue relates to people looking to import items.  On 1 July, stringent new EU customs rules were introduced.  Certain companies have failed to prepare and may not necessarily be providing the correct information.  This is not being filtered, particularly when it is posted from Britain.  It means we have a stockpile here and there is a major hold-up.  It is taking significant time for An Post and customs to have their stuff returned to Britain.</p> <p>I know An Post is engaging with the Irish customs, the Royal Mail and other non-EU carriers but we need to engage with the British Government and with customs and we need to get it sorted.</p></speech>

I have no doubt about that.  On wider issues, Brexit continues to have an impact and in many ways Covid masked some of the issues that have arisen from it.  The issues are mainly in the United Kingdom in the operation of small to medium-sized businesses there, for example.  Their capacity to supply the European market and Ireland has been affected.  Many of our SMEs are finding the timelines longer in terms of receiving orders and supplies from customs in the UK.  I am conscious of the issues the Deputy has raised.</p></speech>

We brought forward an amendment to the Project Ireland 2040 plan and the Government voted against it.  The Government is stopping people building in towns, villages and rural areas because of a lack of investment.  All of the investment to upgrade infrastructure is going into the cities.  When you look at the towns and villages around County Limerick, the Government is saying it will invest in the upgrade of the existing structures but it will not allow for any additional capacity.  That means SMEs and all the businesses in our towns and villages in County Limerick cannot go to the banks and tell them that their businesses need to expand because of extra footfall.  The Government has stopped any expansion of any business in any town, village or rural area because of the lack of infrastructure.  All of the funding is going to the cities and unless you are within 15 minutes of a city, your existing sewerage systems will not be upgraded.  They will say there is existing capacity and that extra capacity will not be allowed on top of that.</p></speech>

Heat is very important.  We had an impassioned and emotive debate on child poverty in the D&aacute;il this week, which brought up the matter of the basic needs of children such as food and heat not being met.  Electricity, fuel and gas prices are surging.  If someone loses his or her job today and he or she has to go on jobseeker's benefit, he or she is not entitled to get fuel allowance for the first 13 months.

This was a positive development.  A lengthy due diligence process is under way, which we thought would end around 31 December and which could now run until March.  In that interim period from January to March, Shannon Heritage and Shannon Group are talking about closing these sites again.  This is unthinkable, commercially unwise and represents a head in the sand approach.  They are also turning away commercial bookings and I am hearing from staff that they will desist from taking employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, supports for their staff.

She requires two carers at a time to operate a hoist so that she can be cared for properly.  There have been numerous occasions when she has been left with no care; once for a whole weekend.  Carers on holidays or sick leave are not replaced or sometimes only one turns up when two are needed to operate the hoist.  She has ended up with bed sores as a result of inadequate care.  I am afraid she is not the only one and that many other. might not be in a position to speak out about their situations.  What efforts have been made to recruit more carers?  There is a crisis in the sector.  When will home care be put on a statutory basis as per the programme for Government?</p></speech>

It would be unthinkable if an organisation was not going to operate them.  No one in government said that just because we are transferring from one entity to another, they should close in the interim period.  That is not a runner.  Neither did anyone say that if the EWSS is available, it should not be used.  I will ask both Ministers involved to engage and make sure that does not happen.  It should not happen.</p>  <p>  Deputy Tully raised the issue of home carers and she made a legitimate point about the difficulties with getting a workforce in.  There has been a dramatic reduction in hours in recent months and that has meant there is a need to get more home care personnel.  In the short term we will have to look at the work permit issue, the facilitation of more people to become involved and the training of others.  Legislation is on target to put home care on a statutory basis.</p></speech>

Survivors have submitted subject to access requests under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as the relevant data collector, and they have been told that their records have been withheld from them until they nominate a GP to receive the records first.  Then it is the GP who will decide if it is appropriate to pass on survivors' own medical records to them.</p>  <p>  The Department is withholding access to the records on the basis of a 1989 data protection regulation.  The Department's position is not alone in breach of European law but it falls foul of the Court of Justice of the European Union judgment.  The fact is this 30-year old regulation has been superseded by the directive.  There is no requirement for survivors to nominate a GP for these records.  Under Article 15 of the GDPR, a data controller can and should process this request in the same way as any other.  Article 23 of the GDPR states that restricting access to data by way of a legislative measure can only be done where the directive's fundamental rights and freedoms are upheld and where the restriction is necessary and proportionate.</p> <p>Has advice been provided by the current Attorney General on this matter and does the Taoiseach stand by it?  If not, what action will he take to ensure survivors' fundamental rights are upheld?</p></speech>

Their representatives were in front of the Oireachtas committee on social protection this morning.  The current model, which is very holistic and supportive of jobseekers, is under threat not just because of a new tendering process but a new financial model that is being put in place, post tender.  These are predominantly not-for-profit companies but they are being asked to tender on the basis of a profit model.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to a review of the fuel allowance.  To give an example of some of its anomalies, I know of the case of an 81-year-old lady who minds her adult daughter who has additional needs and early stage dementia.  She could not find a residential place for her daughter and has taken her home again, for which she is getting carer's allowance.  Because she is getting carer's allowance, she is now losing her fuel allowance at the age of 81 after a lifetime of care and commitment to the community.  There are so many anomalies that a Cabinet committee is the perfect place to address them.  In the context of fuel prices at the moment, I ask that urgency is given to that.</p></speech>

It was anything but a normal situation.  It was a judge in court who met a vulnerable woman in front of him as a result of a family law issue.  He got her number in the context of that meeting in court and then used it to pursue her completely inappropriately and persistently in a way that made her scared about a sexual relationship.  She went to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, but also got no joy.  She contacted and wrote two letters to the Taoiseach's office.  I sent two emails to him, which had no response.  We understand from freedom of information, FOI, requests that the Chief Justice and the Minister for Justice were aware of this case.</p>  <p>  Unless that woman had very bravely decided to speak out, which she should not have to do, and I pay tribute to her and to the other women who did so, absolutely nothing would be happening in this case.  We need action and change to ensure people in these circumstances are not subjected to the kind of abuse and imbalance of power situations that exist between judges and people in front of them.</p></speech>

This is despite the fact west Cork has produced some of the most talented athletes in Ireland.  Bandon Athletic Club is right at the top of that, which continues to produce some incredibly talented athletes despite only having a grass running track and no proper infield facilities.  It has produced some incredible athletes such as Phil Healy, who I do have to tell the Taoiseach about and who did us so proud in the Olympics, decathlete Diarmuid O'Connor, hammer thrower Nicola Tuthill and distance runner Fionn Harrington.  Bandon Athletic Club has a very ambitious proposal to create a state-of-the-art track and field facility.  I urge the Government to get behind that proposal.</p></speech>

There are sports clubs in my constituency whose members need to fundraise for kit and changing rooms, as no doubt there are in the Taoiseach's constituency.  Does he agree that if his Government decides to spend &euro;150 million on the America's Cup, there can be no excuse whatsoever for the continued failure to fund grassroots sports?  Will he give the House an update on where things stand on the issue of the America's Cup at the moment?</p></speech>

A mother of a 17-year-old boy in my constituency - I will not mention names, obviously, because it is a sensitive matter - has asked me to raise this issue with the Taoiseach and anyone who will listen.  The boy is on the very severe end of the autism spectrum and, as a result, his family were not able to manage him at home.  He got a placement out of Dublin, away from where he lives, which broke down through nobody's real fault and he now finds himself in emergency homeless accommodation.  This is completely inappropriate and his mother is distraught and seriously worried for his life, such is the nature of his intellectual disability.  His autism behaviour is the sort of thing that requires specialised, residential supports, which we completely lack in this country.  There are autism spectrum disorder, ASD, residential specialised units in the UK but we have none here and this is a young man who is on the streets and whose life is potentially in danger.</p>  <p>  This case has much wider implications in terms of Tusla's responsibility to young and vulnerable children.  I would like to email the Taoiseach the details of this case in the context of the wider issue of our responsibility to young children with disabilities. </p></speech>

Every year, Hallowe'en starts earlier and earlier.  I am referring to illegal fireworks and bonfires being lit on our public open spaces.  People and animals are being terrorised and public open spaces are being destroyed.  It is the same every year and it has to stop.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister for Justice has launched the fireworks awareness-raising campaign for 2021 in association with the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Dublin Fire Brigade and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Fireworks are dangerous and can cause serious injury.  Last year, Dublin was awash with fireworks.  From what I hear, I am sure it is the same this year.  I welcome the launch by the Garda of Operation Tombola.  Garda&iacute; in the Dublin metropolitan region need to get behind this.  They need to be visible and plan to prevent public disorder and antisocial behaviour.  Local authorities also need to get behind this campaign and start to collect illegal bonfire material.  I also welcome the fact that divisional public order units will be deployed on Hallowe'en night.</p>  <p>  I ask the Cabinet subcommittee on justice, if it is going to meet very shortly, to please deal with this issue to stop Hallowe'en turning into a frightening night for so many people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900028#AA00800"><p>I thank all the Deputies for raising important issues.  Deputy McDonald raised the issue of access to records, which I will follow through on.  In my view, it should not be necessary to seek the permission of a GP to get access to your own medical records; they should be available.  It relates ultimately to the information and tracing legislation published in May this year and which is currently before the House.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is taking place and the Minister went before the Oireachtas joint committee yesterday.  This is priority legislation that will deal with all the issues the Deputy raised.  In the interim, I will engage with the Minister for clarification of some of the points raised.</p>  <p>  Deputy Calleary raised the important issue of employment services.  Fundamentally, these are services we must ensure are of the highest quality for those who use them in the first instance.  It is 90% about engagement.  This is not similar to JobPath.  These services relate to engagement and 90% of the transactions have to be ones of engagement with, and guidance to, the service user.  Parallel with that, advice from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Attorney General is that the Department of Social Protection is in breach of EU procurement rules and there has to be a competitive procurement process for these contracts.  The Minister has met with the services involved and officials have visited every local employment service, LES, in the country over recent years.  Phase 1 has commenced and that will inform phase 2.</p> <p>We are looking at an expansion of services across seven counties where currently there is no LES-type service.  It is about providing quality employment services in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly.  We will need those additional services to help people navigate their route back to work.  It is around the quality of service and experience.  More than 75% of the marks in the request for tender were based on the quality of the service, the experience and track record of the tenderers in providing supports to those furthest from the labour market.  As I said, 90% of the fees are based on engagement with the service and agreeing a personal progression plan.  It is all about working and engaging with people.  I am conscious of the issues the Deputy has raised in terms of the local context and dimension.  There is a journey to travel yet in that regard.</p> <p> On the fuel allowance, the Deputy raised a sad case.  There will be an examination of these issues prior to the budget to see what can be done to alleviate the problems faced by people facing fuel poverty.</p> <p> Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan raised the issue that there are no athletic tracks in west Cork.  I fully take his point in terms of the extraordinary success of Bandon Athletic Club.  Phil Healy is the iconic representative of the club, among others.  We will give that application active consideration.  We want to improve sports facilities.</p> <p> Deputy Barry raised the issue of the Americas Cup in a sporting context.  We want to support grassroots sport and clubs that find difficulty in applying for grants.  The application system for certain sectors of sport has become very difficult.  We need to ease access for clubs that are in disadvantaged situations in terms of their wherewithal to apply for grants.  On the Americas Cup, the organisers have written to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  There must be due diligence and due process before any decisions are made.  There is a unit within the Department that deals with the hosting of big events such as the Ryder Cup and the teams from American colleges that come to Ireland.  Those events have proven to give significant ratios of return to the economy and to create jobs.  It is in that context the issue will be looked at.  There is now a longer timeframe of up to six months for consideration of that matter.</p> <p> Deputy Paul Murphy raised the issue of Judge O'Connor.  The members of the Garda on the ground must assess and prosecute cases.  When people are concerned about how that duty is carried out, complaints are made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  I regularly make the point that we need to reflect on the fact that the first port of call has to work.  Our existing agencies have to work and do their jobs diligently and properly.  It is a fact that we have a range of inquiries.  The House will recall that some years ago, arising out of a big case, a whole range of cases were submitted to the then Minister for Justice for review.  The Oireachtas and the Executive can never replace the operational agencies and institutions that have been established by the Oireachtas to deal with these issues.  There is a real dilemma here in terms of how we can individually pursue every single case.  This raises fundamental issues and I do not dispute that.  I will give the matter consideration to see how we can proceed.</p> <p> In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, there are residential locations or accommodations for young adults with severe autism but there are not enough.  The situation the Deputy described is shocking and the young boy involved should not be in emergency homeless accommodation. Every effort should be made by the HSE and others to make provision for that young man.</p> <p> Deputy Haughey raised an issue around Hallowe'en and I agree with him entirely.  We should be encouraging the elimination of bonfires.  They are polluting.  I participated in bonfires myself.  I was in my local primary school last Monday and was shown photographs of a bonfire up the road from where I lived.  We thought bonfires were the bee's knees at that time but I think of all those black tyres that we burned.  We sat around thinking it was great fun.  I would like to think we have moved on from that era because bonfires are pollutants.  They are dangerous as well, when one considers what is thrown into them today.  Anti-social behaviour should be stamped out.  We will work with the Garda and the authorities on the matter of illegal fireworks.  That is a fair point.  We want that time of year for children to enjoy.</p></speech>

The public service, justice and policing reform unit sits in the social policy and public service reform division of the Department of An Taoiseach.  The unit supports the Civil Service management board, including the Civil Service renewal programme; contributes to the oversight and governance of the new public service reform plan; supports me in my role as Taoiseach on criminal justice, community safety and related matters; and incorporates the policing reform implementation programme office that oversees the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future, which is the Government's plan to implement the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.</p><p>The unit also assists the work of the Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality, and the associated senior officials' group established to oversee implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy, equality and public services, including matters relating to arts and culture, children, justice, policing reform and community safety, disability, social inclusion, gender equality, direct provision, the Irish language and sport.</p><p>The unit also has departmental oversight of the National Economic and Social Council and provides me with briefing and speech material on social policy and public service reform issues.

The families and their advocates, including myself, argued that the Minister for Justice could resolve this matter through the introduction of a regulation to waive the requirement of the financial eligibility test.  Eventually, the Minister for Justice signed the civil legal aid regulations to allow all families on an exceptional basis to access legal aid for the Stardust inquest, regardless of their means.  That was welcome progress and the families believed the final hurdle put before them by the State had been overcome.  However, disgracefully, that was to prove not to be the case.  Families have recently learned that the Department has not engaged with the Legal Aid Board since the regulation was signed, nor has the necessary budget been provided by the Department for the legal costs associated with the inquest.  It is, of course, deeply unfair on families to have the State continuously put up blockages when its stated position is that it wants to do all it can to support them.  Families have had to fight too hard for too long.  This matter surely should have been resolved between the Department and Legal Aid Board in advance of the regulation being signed and not left for the families to deal with.  It is unacceptable for the Department to take the position that this is a matter between the Legal Aid Board and the families.  I have raised this issue with the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State, neither of whom have deemed it fit to respond.  I now raise the matter with the Taoiseach and ask him to intervene on behalf of these families and to sort out this issue as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:27:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900029#BB00500"><p>I will continue to speak about the case I raised of the 17-year-old child with autism who is wandering the streets and reliant on homeless accommodation.  As the Taoiseach rightly said, the agencies that are the first ports of call should work.  In this case, we are talking about T&uacute;sla, which has constitutional responsibilities.  We had a referendum in 2012 about the specific responsibility of the State in terms of children.  We have also signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in terms of our responsibility to people with disabilities.  The young man concerned has an intellectual disability and severe forms of autism.  He is in homeless accommodation, wandering the streets and his life is in danger.  His mother has gone to the ombudsman who is going to look into the case but that young man is still on the streets.  His mother has gone to court to try to compel T&uacute;sla to provide the proper placement and services he needs.  The first port of call is not working.  That is where we come in.  We have a constitutional and legal obligation to a child like this.  I will pass on the details of the case to the Taoiseach.  I appeal to him.  The whip needs to be cracked and the services need to be provided.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="13:37:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900030#CC00100"><p>I will come back to the case of James O'Connor again.  The Taoiseach says that the first port of call, the agencies and so on, should work.  I agree.  They should work but the point is that it is very clear that they did not work and that there is a problem and, therefore, a need for reform.  The central issue is that the massive imbalance of power between a family law judge and a person coming before that judge was simply not taken into account.  The woman I quoted earlier said this puts you in a position where you feel you cannot say "No" because you know you are going to be back in front of the judge.  To return to the story I told about this woman going into the courthouse and the judge lunging at her, she had to go back before that same judge again in a situation where he could potentially have been deciding whether she would keep her kids.  I am not asking the Taoiseach or the Government to make themselves into the Garda, the Judiciary or whatever but the Government was contacted multiple times by this woman and then by me with regard to this case.  Did the Government do anything about it?  Did it spot that there is an issue here that needs to be resolved through reform of how such matters are deal with?</p></speech>

The Government is committed to ensuring the Stardust inquests and the families involved are provided with all relevant supports.  As the Deputy said, the Government did respond to that issue.  Funding of &euro;8 million has been allocated for the new inquests.  This includes funding for legal aid for the families and for the fit-out of a bespoke courtroom in the RDS.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has signed the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 2021, which allow all families to access legal aid, on an exceptional basis, for the Stardust inquests regardless of their means.  I am informed that the Legal Aid Board, which is independent in the conduct of its function, is engaging with the legal representatives of the families to agree an appropriate funding structure and schedule.  The Minister for Justice understands that the public-facing elements of the inquests are expected to commence once the necessary preliminary hearings conclude.  The conduct of the Stardust inquests is entirely a matter for the senior Dublin coroner.  The coroner's independence in regard to such matters is set out in the Coroners Act 1962.  The Minister for Justice does not have a role in that regard.  The senior Dublin coroner has held five preliminary hearings to date and has scheduled a sixth pre-inquest hearing, to take place on 13 October.  The Deputy raised a number of issues this morning.  The Minister has signed the regulations.  It is law now.  Funding has been provided and is there to be drawn down.  I do not see what the issue is but I will pursue the matter with the Minister for Justice and seek a response from her.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of that young man with autism.  It is a matter for Tusla, service providers and the HSE working with those providers to get the optimal care model in place for that young person.  I do not know what the various actions that have been taken to date amount to, in respect of that young man in terms of any particular service that he was a part of.  I do not know whether he grew up accessing particular services provided by a section 38 body, for example.</p></speech>

That is what we need to do.  If the Deputy will send on the details to me, I will certainly pursue the matter with the authorities to see if we can get a place for that young man.  It is certainly not acceptable for him to be on the streets.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Paul Murphy's point, the Deputy has acknowledged that the Government cannot act as the Garda or as GSOC.  There is a wider issue regarding the Judiciary and the behaviour of judges.  Progress has been made on the Judicial Council but I do not know whether this applies within the timeline of this particular case.  That is a further complication in this regard.  The Government does not want to become GSOC on an ongoing basis.  Increasingly I am getting feedback which suggests that many people who go to GSOC are not happy with the outcome.  I do not know whether that is because people's expectations are too high or whether there are issues regarding how GSOC operates but there are real issues here with regard to the degree to which the Government can supersede the role of the various agencies involved.  That is a legitimate problem.  Having said that, very serious allegations are being made in respect of someone who is no longer operating as a judge.  That person is entitled to contest those allegations and assertions.  Determining the degree to which the Government can respond or how it will respond is not simple but I will examine the matter.</p></speech>

The work of the unit involves supporting engagement with the social partners through a variety of mechanisms, including the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, which deals with labour market issues.  The LEEF meets regularly to facilitate discussions with the Government on issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic and our economic recovery.  The most recent plenary meeting, which I chaired, took place on 5 July.  A further meeting will take place in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Under the auspices of LEEF, there has been significant progress on other issues such as the introduction of statutory sick pay, remote working and the establishment of a high-level review of collective bargaining.  There are also LEEF subgroups dealing with issues including aviation and childcare.  Social dialogue through the LEEF process has also played a crucial role in ensuring workplaces are safe during the Covid-19 pandemic and an updated version of the work safely protocol was agreed and published earlier this month. </p>  <p>  The social dialogue unit also supports engagement with representatives from the environmental pillar, the community and voluntary pillar and the farming and agriculture pillar.  This includes a series of meetings between myself and key Ministers with those groups held before the summer.  This was an opportunity to discuss how social dialogue can be strengthened as well as current issues of concern to those sectors.</p>  <p>  Social dialogue also takes place through structures like the National Economic Dialogue, the National Economic and Social Council and many sectoral groups.  There is also regular dialogue between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and public service trade unions.</p>  <p>  Overall, I believe this is strong evidence of the Government's commitment to social dialogue.  However, given the scale of challenges which lie ahead, for example in areas like climate action, housing and economic recovery, I will continue to work with Ministers to strengthen the structures and practice of social dialogue across all areas.</p></reply>

The families must be at the heart of this inquest and must be treated equally and fairly, along with all of the other participants in the inquest.  That is at the heart of this.  The funding must be released to those families to ensure that they are represented properly at the inquest and so that preparatory work can be done.  I ask the Taoiseach to follow up on that specific issue with regard to the Stardust inquest.</p></speech>

The first comes from a senior Aer Lingus cabin crew member:</p> <blockquote> 	I have young cabin crew colleagues regularly attending soup kitchens for meals and getting help from St Vincent de Paul.  My own brother bought my son&rsquo;s school books this year.  Mental health is on the floor. </blockquote>  <p>The second comes from an Aer Lingus ground crew worker:</p> <blockquote> 	We&rsquo;re having everything taken away.  My parents have done food shopping for us throughout the pandemic.  I&rsquo;m paying rent of &euro;1,550 with two children to support. </blockquote>  <p>Both of these quotes were given in interviews with my colleague, Ruth Coppinger, last week.  This week, Aer Lingus's parent company saw its share price climb 21%.  Aer Lingus kept its hand out for massive State subsidies while continuing to push for its workforce to submit to a four-year pay freeze, new yellow-pack starting rates and cuts to sick pay and shift allowances.</p> <p>Will the Taoiseach intervene in this situation?  Will he tell this company that continued State aid is conditional on an end to attempts to force brutal austerity on its workforce?</p></speech>

I will give a few suggestions in that regard.  First, health workers who were on the front line in hospitals fighting to keep the disease at bay and getting infected are a particular category whose work must be recognised, along with that of other people, including home carers and anybody in the health service who was directly confronting the health consequences.  Beyond that, there are other groups not in the front line in that sense, such as retail workers, transport workers, teachers, local authority workers, civil servants, contact tracers and so on, who need recognition.</p>  <p>  There is a more fundamental point, which is that during the pandemic we realised the key role played by many working people who suffer low pay and precarious work, and are generally not acknowledged, in sustaining us.  In some cases, such as musicians, artists and so on, we really felt their absence because they could not work.  That requires a more general response, rather than a once-off response, in terms of addressing low pay.  We need to have something like a &euro;15 living wage as a mandatory minimum wage, to do something serious about precarity in employment and to bring bank and statutory holidays, not on a once-off basis, up to the levels we have in Europe.  They are much lower here.  There needs to be a general recognition that before the pandemic, we failed to fully recognise how important many categories of workers are.  If we are to learn the lesson of the pandemic and have a better future, we need to make those changes.</p></speech>

I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  A few weeks ago, I participated in a protest of local employment service workers at the Department of Finance and around to the front of the D&aacute;il.  They were protesting against the proposal, which the Government is pushing ahead with, for the outsourcing or tendering of their work.  They were able to tell stories of how they help the long-term unemployed.  They work alongside them to try to get jobs that would be suitable for them.  They rightly pointed out that the drive of the Government would turn this from a useful service that helps people into a JobPath 2, where the service is outsourced to private companies that have horrific records in Britain and here, put pressure on people and are just interested in ticking boxes that maximise their profit.  They are not interested in helping people to get out of unemployment and into quality, decent jobs.  In doing this, the Government will ironically make a bunch of people unemployed and create further unemployment when it is meant to be addressing the unemployment crisis.  Will the Government back off on this proposal to effectively outsource these vital services and this important work done by local employment service workers?</p></speech>

What were the outcomes of the meeting?  Will the issues raised be reflected in the upcoming budget?</p>  <p>  Over recent months, I have met with community-based services across the country.  The work they do is extraordinary but the overwhelming feeling of those providing and accessing the services is one of invisibility.  For each of the services I have met, every month is a struggle as they deliver services to hundreds of thousands of citizens, many of whom are very vulnerable.  Inadequate infrastructure, insufficient funds for staff and a dogged refusal of Departments and State agencies to provide multi-annual funding are universal challenges.</p>  <p>  I have a particular concern for family carers, in terms of the inadequacy of State supports and their physical and mental health.  During a meeting I had with Family Carers Ireland services in Wexford and those that support them, it was clear an informed and progressive shift by the Government on specific policy areas would be transformational in terms of quality of life and care.</p>  <p>  I welcome the work of the social dialogue unit and the Taoiseach's engagement with the Government partners in the community and voluntary sector but I urge the Taoiseach to ensure that there is an outcome from these engagements, and that the outcome is progressively reflected in next month's budget.</p></speech>

I will talk to the Minister for Justice and come back to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Deputy Barry raised the Aer Lingus issue.  I have met with Aer Lingus representatives.  The Government's objective was to maintain the viability of airlines and airports and support their workers through the pandemic.  We provided the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which has been a huge support.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, independently provided a loan facility to Aer Lingus.  It has been challenging.  It is a private company.  We pressed with them the need to look after their workers.  They would say the collapse in air travel has been a huge factor in the losses of over &euro;1 billion the company has endured during the pandemic.  It is probably more at this stage.  </p>  <p>  They would have been very opposed to zero Covid policies, which they felt would have killed off the airline and the industry.  The Deputy put forward that proposal at the time.  People in the House come forward at different times saying the Government must do this and that for aviation, and the next month they say the Government should do X and Y to support the industry.  It does not always square and the Deputy's position on aviation does not square.  The realities of the pandemic are real.  We have done everything we can to support workers through unprecedented interventions.  I am conscious that people and cabin crews have suffered.  Everyone working in the airline-----</p></speech>

I had better get moving.  I will be as quick as I am forced to be.</p><p>I welcome the Housing for All plan.  I think one of the key issues regarding the housing crisis facing renters and people looking to buy is affordability and people being unable to find suitable homes.  We are talking about a home, not just a house or a place to stay.  To build communities is at the heart of Housing for All.</p><p>One of the things driving that affordability is the roll-out of cost rental.  Cost rental is an incredibly important way of controlling rents for those who are able to access cost rental.  It has been shown to have the effect of reducing rents and putting a downward pressure on rents generally across all rental accommodation, so it is very welcome to see.  As well as driving affordability, cost rental has been a key component of Green Party housing policy for quite some time.  We fought for it in the programme for Government negotiations and in respect of the Housing for All plan, and it is great to see that the Green Party policy of cost rental is now central in Housing for All and in delivering affordability.</p><p>I also wish to talk about the measures introduced to share the increase in value from zoning.  This is incredibly important legislation.  I refer to financial management to reduce speculation that is driving up costs and making life hard for those seeking homes to rent and to buy.  This is an important measure and one the Green Party introduced when we were last in government to try to take the legs out from under land speculation.  It was referred to in the Kenny report all those years ago and we finally implemented it.  Unfortunately, it was removed in 2015 by the then Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, so I am very glad to see that it is coming back.  If we read the news reported bravely by <i>Dublin Inquirer</i>regarding the former Chivers site in Coolock, we see exactly why this is needed.  There, lobbying by Veni Vidi Vici Limited pushed for rezoning of a former industrial site with emails to councillors talking about how kids would no longer need to live in bed and breakfast accommodation if they rezoned the site.  The site was rezoned, has increased in value by ten and is now back on the open market without a single house having been built.  Without a single child having been removed from a bed and breakfast, it has been flipped and put back on the market.  This is exactly the sort of thing that would have been prevented if the Green Party's measure on windfall tax on rezoned land had never been removed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="13:57:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900032#EE01200"><p>I welcome the Housing for All plan.  It is a plan and a document that recognises the scale of the housing crisis that exists in this country at present.  One of the reasons I welcome the document is that it recognises that this is not just a housing issue but also a societal issue.  We need to recognise that in this House, and I believe that the Government is coming to recognise it with the publication of this document.</p>  <p>  Since Independence in Ireland, a social contract has existed between the citizen and the State.  One of the clauses of that social contract was that if you worked hard and got a good job, you would be able to own a house of your own, that is, you would be able to buy a house.  As we know, good jobs in this country were not always available, but certainly from the second half of the last century many good jobs did become available, and the vast majority of people who worked in private business or in the public sector were able to say they would be able to buy and own their own houses.  Obviously, it was always the case as well that there were people who were not able to buy their own houses.  That is why it was so important for the State to step in and build local authority houses.  Houses were available for people to rent and to live in long-term with security from the local authority.</p>  <p>  It is now the case, however, in respect of the social contract that young people today face a terrifying prospect.  They now can find themselves having good jobs and earning very good money but having no prospect of ever being able to buy a home of their own.  They are becoming involuntary lifelong renters.  We need to recognise that this is not a transient issue.  Sometimes there are issues we debate in this House of which we can say fairly that if we leave them for a number of years they will resolve themselves.  That is not the case with the housing crisis the country now faces.  Let us be clear about it: this crisis is an existential threat to the social contract I described earlier and, if not addressed, the problem will get significantly worse.  We have to be careful that we do not allow our society to be divided into two different groups of those who are property owners and those who are not property owners but renters.  As well as this having a significant social impact, it will also have a significant political impact.  People in this House may think it will benefit those who are in the Opposition and damage those who are in government.  That may be the case.  My concern, however, is that the political impact it will have, unless we resolve this crisis, will go far beyond the issues that are addressed in this House and there will be political consequences that none of us here are aware will occur.  We know that part of the benefit of the social contract that exists in this country is that we have social solidarity between different groups.  That is extremely important when it comes to dealing with issues such as climate change or Covid or trying to rebuild our health service.  If we lose that social solidarity and lose the terms of that social contract, we will find ourselves in a very difficult position where different groups will not be prepared to agree to terms that we know are for the benefit of us all as a collective.  We need to recognise that all generations need to make sacrifices in order to resolve this issue.  However, older generations and those of us who are property owners need to recognise that the people who are really suffering are those younger people who are unable to purchase their own houses, notwithstanding the fact that they have good jobs.</p>  <p>  Three issues come to mind from Housing for All that we need to focus on and which I wish to address.  The first is that we need to focus public expenditure on availability and affordability of homes.  I am pleased to say that Housing for All contains a range of measures designed to address these issues and others.  We need to implement Housing for All.  I know there will be very many criticisms about the fact that it looks like another glossy document.  There is much more to it than that.  It is a serious plan but it will be dependent on implementation by the Government, and we have to commit ourselves to ensure that it is implemented.</p>  <p>  Second, the Government and the Minister need to be flexible in respect of that implementation because, inevitably, some parts of the plan will be more effective than others.  We therefore need to have the flexibility to re-evaluate what is working well and what is not working well.</p>  <p>  Third, we need to recognise that our laws need to change in order that it becomes uneconomic for large funds to purchase residential property.  In my constituency a new site has just been developed.  It has not gone up for sale.  People pass by and ask how much the units are going for.  None of them are for sale; they have already all been purchased.  Another site that is about to be developed in Milltown is being promoted in the same way.  We need to look at amending our tax laws in order that we impose punitive taxes on those funds that seek to buy up new properties that have been developed.  If those funds want to buy their own land, build their own houses and rent them out, they are entitled to do that, but what we cannot allow any further is that these funds come in and buy up properties that young people want and have some capacity to purchase.</p> <p> We sometimes talk in this House about amending the Constitution to include a right to housing.  If we need to amend the Constitution, let us do it.  We should not be fearful of that.  Let us not spend endless time having different lawyers discuss whether our Constitution is flexible enough at present to permit further State intervention.  If we are going to intervene in the Constitution and change it, the way we should do so is by stating expressly that the State can intervene to discriminate in favour of first-time purchasers who are trying to buy a home.</p> <p> The final action we need to concentrate on is addressing the decline in construction skills.  That requires engaging with industry and trade unions.  We cannot continue to have a situation whereby, when there is a recession, there is an automatic decline in expertise in the construction sector.  We need a viable and long-term solution to ensure those valuable skills remain available to the sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="14:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900033#FF00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  There is much talk in these discussions about the generation comprising those aged 25 to 35, about whom I know a lot from a personal perspective as well as a professional and political perspective.  The question people in that age group have on their mind - perhaps not all of them at age 25, but it will articulate itself at some stage - is whether they can own their own place.  For the current generation, however, particularly those aged 25 to 30, that question has changed to wondering when they can have their own place, never mind buying it, or whether they will always have to share.</p>  <p>  I was 26 when my wife and I bought our own property, which was not unusual at the time.  In fact, we probably came quite late to owning our own home.  That was what most young couples did; they saved for a mortgage and there was time, space and the disposable income to do so.  Later, in the early 1990s, mortgage interest rates hit 16% or 17% and we did not go out for approximately four months because there was not a penny to spend.  However, home ownership was an aspiration for people.  There are areas of my constituency populated by a generation of people for whom one income was sufficient to run a household and pay a mortgage, with one of the partners staying at home.  That was more common than not.</p>  <p>  Circumstances have changed considerably since then.  The idea of a house having a monetary value beyond one's own lifetime, the drive to accumulate property and all of that became big issues.  As I said, young people are asking when they will have their own place, whether they will be able to buy a place, whether it will be close to where they live if that is their choice, and how much it will cost.  These are questions we have to answer.  They are also questions that are easy for Opposition Members to exploit.  If I were in their shoes, I might be inclined to exploit them as they do, although we were not like that when we were in opposition.  There are significant changes contained in the Housing for All plan, including the ending of SHDs and co-living schemes.  A number of the worst policy excess of the past few years are addressed in the plan.  However, they are not recognised by anybody in opposition.  No credit is ever given to this side of the House.  There is no acknowledgement that we on this side of the Chamber want a future for our young people and want them to be able to have their own homes to own or to rent.  In fact, it is this objective that motivates me more than anything.</p>  <p>  It is easy now that the plan has been presented for some in the Opposition to say they see nothing good in any of it.  I recognise it is not prefect and I would be the first to criticise elements of it in the appropriate environment and context.  I have done so, but I also make constructive contributions and suggestions.  We are facing into a perfect storm in the housing sector, with issues arising in the supply of materials and labour.  Of course, those issues will be exploited to argue that there has been a failure to deliver X or Y.  I will give way now to my colleague, Deputy Durkan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900033#FF00300"><p>I thank my colleague for sharing time.  This is a important issue.  If this debate were to be organised again, it would be helpful to have allowed for a longer debate to accommodate Members' contributions.  Housing is the issue that has taken up most of our time and concerns when we engaged with constituents over the past seven years.  There are a number of reasons for that.  I have noted all the points made by previous speakers, some valid and others not so valid.  An all-party committee that was set up back in 2014 encouraged all of us in the House to make suggestions on how to deal with the housing issue.  I put forward the proposal at that time - it was interesting to see the same suggestion coming from a Deputy on the other side of the House earlier - that AHBs be suspended and everything be devoted towards direct build for tenancy or purchase.  There was not a consensus on that suggestion, however, and it did not happen, but it should have happened.  If it had been done then, we would not be in the position we are in now.  The opportunity could have been taken at that time but events superseded everything and it was not possible to do it in the meantime.  It had not been possible to do it prior to that time because the pillar banks were not in a position after the financial crisis to facilitate it.  For one reason or another, they did not provide the necessary funding to allow building to take place in the way it should have done.</p>  <p>  It is easy to be sceptical and to say at every stage that nothing is being done and nothing will work.  We should not forget, as Deputy Lahart alluded to, that there used to be a suggestion that there was a preoccupation with home ownership in this country, which was claimed to be the cause of our housing problems.  That is a load of rubbish.  The reasons people want to own their own home go back to the Land War and the fight for fixity of tenure, fair rent and so on.  It is interesting that those issues are coming up again in conversation in recent times, and rightly so.  We have people on "Morning Ireland" telling us they want to rent, do not want to carry a mortgage and this is the way of the future.  It is a load of rubbish and propaganda pushed to take people away in a different direction.</p>  <p>  We are going in the right direction now, but whether we are doing so in time, I do not know.  I believe there is time to address the issues, provided we tweak the legislation as we go along.  It will be necessary to increase expenditure in the first year and probably the first three years.  If we want a result, we must lay out the expenditure now.  It is no good saying what we are going to do in five years.  The problem will be worse in five years and we will be back where we are now, still having to make a start.  I advise the Minister of State to be mindful of the necessity to increase the focus on expenditure in the first year, which is as and from now.</p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh asked about the eligibility of people who have experienced family breakdown for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  That needs to be examined as a matter of urgency to ensure the loans are accessible.  There is no sense in saying we will spend X amount and then do nothing more.  If we want to deal with the situation for first-time buyers, we must look at the definition of who makes up that cohort.  First-time buyers are individuals or couples who have not previously owned a house.  That needs to be modified somewhat to enable people who are entering into a new contract between themselves to make an application for a loan in that context as opposed to their application being assessed on the basis of their previous arrangement.</p>  <p>  Much emphasis has been placed on refurbishing older houses.  It is a good idea in some circumstances but not in all.  We should be wary of depending on such activity to deliver a host of houses.</p>  <p>  The last point I want to make relates to the magnitude of the housing problem.  This is a major issue and it has never before been as pressing.  Reference was made to escalating prices.  I know full well that developers will not pay a particular price for land for development purposes unless they know what they will eventually make a profit on it.  The problem I see in this regard relates to certain changes that have been made.</p> <p>Reference was made to zoning that has taken place.  If it was not possible for the developer to know certain matters beforehand, he or she would not make outlandish bids for property because he or she would know there were restrictions in place.</p> <p> A colleague referred to a site in Dublin city.  There is a simple way to deal with that.  There is a contract in such situations.  The local authority can encourage the developer to enter into a contract containing a condition stipulating that if the developer undertakes to do a certain thing but does not do it, the ball is off.  The developer would have no basis for actions such as those described.  The land would have been rezoned under false pretences.  It has been done previously.  There have been many instances of it.</p> <p> I do not know how much I can cover in the 16 seconds I have remaining.</p></speech>

Frankly, I find it underwhelming.  One would like to think that those delays related to ensuring the plan was sturdy, deliverable and truly transformative.  Unfortunately, it is not.  What we have been presented with is more of the same, with lofty ten-year plans that do not solve the many immediate problems we face.  Rental prices continue to rise and the plan does little to stymie that.  The media suggested the delays were due to arguments between the Government parties.  It is clear which of them won that argument.  This is a Fine Gael plan - its fingerprints are all over it - written on Fianna F&aacute;il headed paper.</p><p>I am proud to represent the constituency of Limerick City, which includes parts of north Tipperary.  The area is in the middle of a housing crisis.  The almost 6,000 people on housing waiting lists in Limerick do not benefit from this plan.  The 2,500 people in need of HAP to help them to afford their rent gain nothing from the plan and neither do the thousands more who are paying extortionate rents without such assistance.  The plan will not stop rents from increasing and it will not stop evictions.</p><p>Measures I would like to have seen in the plan are a ban on rent increases for three years and a rebate to renters in the form of a refundable tax credit, which would seriously help them.  The Housing for All plan outlines a rent value freeze to 2024 but linking increases in RPZs to inflation is a bad move that will only increase rent prices in these areas.</p><p>Going by the recent comments of the Minister, he would have us believe that house prices are not out of control.  We know from experience that what he says can vary widely from reality.  The residential property price index figures show a yearly average increase in property prices of 8.6%.  A June 2021 <i>daft.ie</i>sales report indicated that Limerick city has seen the biggest jump of any city in the State, with average prices rising by 15.5%.  That begs the question of what percentage increase the Minister would consider to be out of control.  He is clearly out of control and, going by this offering, he is out of ideas as well.</p><p>The larger Government parties created the housing crisis and then exacerbated it, but now people are expected to accept that those same parties can fix it.  This document fails to offer solutions to the big issues.  It falls at nearly every juncture.  Under this plan, social housing delivery will remain low and those looking to buy or those renting are offered nothing new.  It is the <i>status quo</i>in shinier clothes.  The social housing targets in the plan are lower than those promised by the previous Fine Gael Government.  With this Government at the helm, I am not confident it will meet its own modest targets for social and affordable homes.  In the past four years, only 4,326 social homes were built.  I mentioned the housing waiting lists in Limerick.  Is it any wonder those lists are so long, given that only 293 builds of this type were delivered in Limerick since 2019?  We need 20,000 social and affordable houses to be built every year.  We are past the point of crisis when it comes to housing and it is a crisis the Government parties created.</p></speech>

It fails to meet the expectations the Minister set out before it was published.  It falls short on some of the basic issues and it is just more of the same when it comes to housing policy of Governments of the past decade.  Ordinary workers and families paying mad rents will not be in a better position as a result of this policy.  Corporate landlords and vulture funds were at the table and they have had their way once again.  They have walked away rubbing their hands.  The Minister has repackaged Rebuilding Ireland and presented this plan as him having come up with solutions to the problems facing people seeking to buy their own home.  In fact, it has fallen short of the targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland, with the Government now aiming to build 10,000 fewer homes than under the former plan.</p><p>In my constituency of Dublin Bay North, houses are being snapped up for prices way above their value.  Families that have lived in the community for generations are being priced out.  These are people who want to live and work in the communities in which they grew up but a crazy housing market is robbing them of that opportunity.  According to the most recent <i>daft.ie</i>report, houses prices in Dublin have risen again.  People are struggling but it is clear the Minister is completely out of touch with reality or just does not get it.</p><p>There is nothing in the plan for renters.  They can expect their crazy rents to keep on rising.  They have been overlooked again and again and they will continue to be fleeced.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in and others have been calling for a rent freeze for three years.  We want to look at ways to put money back into the pockets of renters, but this plan does not do anything like that.</p><p>The Minister has been saying in recent days that the property market is not out of control.  Is he for real?  Seriously, is this coalition for real?  It is failing people who want to own a home of their own.  It is failing families, workers and a whole generation of young people who will never own a home of their own.</p></speech>

There are numerous reports on house prices and rental prices.  Whichever of the reports one chooses, the results are damning for this Government.  The most recent national survey by Real Estate Alliance found that, since June, my county of Tipperary has experienced the biggest rise in house prices of any county.  Prices for a three-bedroom semi-detached house in the county have soared by 9.2% in just three months.  However, that is not the end of the story.  In Nenagh, prices rose by 23.7%, to &euro;235,000.  That is back to boomtime levels.  Meanwhile, even more extreme, a report by <i>daft.ie</i>found that house prices in Tipperary increased by 13.9% year on year.  Rental prices have increased by 12.7% in the past year.</p><p>The Government has lost control of housing provision.  That is made obvious by the claim in the Housing for All plan that there is a target of 156,000 private homes by 2030.  That target means nothing as the Government cannot control or deliver it, but it is well able to shift blame.  Throughout the pandemic, we have seen failure on the part of the Government to make any effective contingency plan.  We have seen it in the education sector and now we are seeing it in the housing crisis.  The impact of Covid and the procurement issues have resulted in the loss of 10,000 social homes.  One would think the Government would address that shortfall, but it is not doing so.  Instead, there is a commitment to 90,000 new social homes by 2030.  However, that figure is 10,000 below the number of social houses promised under Rebuilding Ireland and the national development plan.  Rather than making up for lost time, Covid is being used as an excuse for an underperforming Government with an under-ambitious housing policy.</p><p>The purpose of a plan of this nature is to make housing available for communities, towns and villages, but also to make it affordable for the people who need it.  Again, the Government has failed to grasp this issue.  That may be due to its over-reliance on the private sector to provide what the Fine Gael arm of the Government wants or it may be because the Fianna F&aacute;il part of the Government has a history of failure.  Whatever the reason, this plan again fails to grasp the reality that what people need is for house prices and rents to come down, rather than the Government's preferred option of increased debt for working people.</p> <p>There is nothing in this plan to tackle the ever-increasing rises in rents.  Through this plan, renters are being told to hang tight for another decade.  They have been left with the possibility of facing eviction into a marketplace with nothing to offer.  </p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in knows that the housing crisis can only be fixed if Government focuses on what it can control, namely, the direct delivery of social and affordable houses.  We need a minimum of 12,000 social houses a year and 8,000 affordable homes - 4,000 through affordable purchase schemes, and 4,000 through affordable rent schemes.  We need a doubling of direct capital investment by Government in public housing and public land; a three-year ban on rent increases and a month's rent back in every renters pocket through the refundable tax credit; and a referendum to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.</p> <p> Housing for All offers nothing new.  Only a Sinn F&eacute;in Government and a Sinn F&eacute;in housing Minister will make the kind of change in housing that is needed in response to the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael housing crisis.</p></speech>

However, I wish to raise the issue of the lack of housing suitable for disabled people and the lack of will to meet the needs of disabled people who seek social housing.  I have been contacted by many families where there are aged parents, perhaps in their 70s or 80s, and they have a disabled son or daughter living with them.  The disabled person could be in their 20s, 30s, 40s, or even 50s, and they are still living at home with their parents.  They have their name on the social housing list, often for in excess of ten years.  Either the council is not forthcoming with accessible housing or, more often than not, the HSE will not provide the supports needed to allow the disabled person to live independently.  In fact, frequently it is dragged out so much that the parent passes away or is no longer capable of looking after their son or daughter, and he or she end up being put in a residential home or, worse still, a nursing home against his or her will.  This has to stop.</p>  <p>  The Government states in the document that it is going to continue to assist the transition of people from congregated settings to community living.  If it continues at the current pace, it could take 20 years for everyone to be moved.  People are still being admitted to congregated settings and to nursing homes, even though there was a commitment given to relocate people to community settings in time to move on.  Of course, that deadline was missed.</p>  <p>  The Housing for All document states that the delivery of key health and social care support is particularly important and that strengthening and supporting such co-ordination for people with disabilities will be a particular focus.  Will there be a ring-fenced budget for housing disabled people?  Until the various Government agencies come together committed to delivering housing for disabled people with a dedicated budget to do so, it will not change.  It is mentioned in the document that the Government is including disabled person's organisations in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  They should be included anyway and not just because the convention says so, but because it is the right and obvious thing to do.</p>  <p>  In general, the number of people looking for a place to live continues to increase.  The number of options to rent are zero unless exorbitantly priced.  People are sleeping on the street, in cars, on the sofas of family or friends or in hovels, which best describes some of the rental properties on the market.  A properly planned and resourced affordable housing scheme is needed.  Building eight houses this year for affordable purchase just does not cut it.  The most vulnerable are those who are just above the income threshold for social housing, but only just, and therefore cannot afford the rents being charged.  Couples who are separating and have to vacate the home are also particularly hard hit.</p>  <p>  The issue of derelict houses was raised by other Members.  I have witnessed over the years attempts to draw up a register of derelict houses.  It is never completed, or if it is, nothing is ever done about it.  It is time to properly resource this and tackle the problem in a serious manner.</p></speech>

Some have been on social housing lists for more than ten years.  Unfortunately, this is not a housing for all strategy, but more of the same failed Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael housing policies that created the crisis in the first place.  A constituent wrote the following to me this week:</p> <blockquote> 	I am writing to you again to vent my desperation with regards to my housing situation and ask for some help.  I am 35 years old and born and raised in Dublin 15.  I work in social care support services.  I love my job and I have worked hard all my life.  I am living in my parents' attic and have been trying for years to save for a mortgage.  I am a single applicant, but the increase in house prices has meant that I am still stuck here and see no hope for the future and no hope that I, an adult woman, will ever be able to move out of my family home. </blockquote>  <p>How disgraceful is that?</p><p>I would say that there is hope.  Circumstances will change when this Government has been replaced and Sinn F&eacute;in begins to implement a people-led strategy.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a plan to ensure the delivery of at least 20,000 social, affordable and rental homes, and also to deliver on social housing through new build acquisition and the refurbishment of vacant and derelict stock.</p><p>There is &euro;500 million for developers in the Housing for All strategy.  That sums up this Government's approach.  There is nothing in the plan to tackle rising rents, but there is plenty for developers, including the controversial shared equity loan scheme, which will inflate house prices even further.  The vast majority of housing that is promised by this Government would lead to the State still relying on private developers to deliver homes.  Have we not learned, and has the Government not learned, time and again that this has failed?  We need a huge investment of public money to allow local authorities to build homes in places like Churchfields in Mulhuddart, Dublin 15, a project that has been in the planning stages for the past four years.  I was a councillor when the process started, yet not a single affordable or cost rental home has been built there.  We need to put forward a genuine strategy in relation to housing.</p><p>Deputy Lahart mentioned the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il has stopped SHDs and co-living developments.  They would not there in the first place if Fianna F&aacute;il had put their foot down during the confidence and supply agreement.  It is a bit rich for members of that party to come in here and continuously claim that it is something for which they can now congratulate themselves and pat themselves on the back.  </p><p>Planning development was mentioned by the Taoiseach earlier.  A planning application was submitted for co-living development in Blanchardstown last year.  It was opposed by myself, Deputy Chambers, Senator Currie and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, plus a plethora of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party councillors.  The opposition is across the board.  The Government should not be patting itself on the back for something it cannot claim for itself.</p></speech>

Precarious housing leads to precarious lives.  It also leads to precarious health and a precarious economy.  We hare having an open debate in this society and indeed, in this Parliament currently on the potential impact that an increase in corporation tax might have on our industrial strategy and our economic model.  However, it is interesting to note that employers' organisations, such as IBEC and, indeed, the American Chamber of Commerce, are less concerned about the reality facing us regarding potential corporation tax increases than they are about the infrastructural and societal bottlenecks that we are experiencing in this country.  Every discussion I have with an industrialist or an investor is not about corporation tax; it is about housing, transport or affordable childcare.  We need to look at housing through an economic prism, as well as the prism of individual and societal needs.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the problems of housing supply and affordability, given the constituency that I represent and the direct experience I have, as we all have, of problems facing family members and friends in respect of accessing adequate and appropriate housing.  My home town of Drogheda has experienced the biggest increase in the price of a standard three-bed semi-detached house over the past six months in this country.  There has been a 13.6% increase in that time.  Similarly, the Laytown and Bettystown areas of County Meath that I represent have experienced a 6% increase in house prices over the past three months.  Overall, average house prices nationally have increased by &euro;3,500 per month since the end of June.  To put that into context, the average monthly income of the average worker is &euro;3,400.  That puts into context the challenge that is facing this Government and all of us in this House to address the acute housing situation that we have.</p>  <p>  This did not dawn on us overnight.  It has been a reality for quite some time.  It is the result of an ideological failure and a failure of a Government that inherited a prosperous economy to invest in public and affordable housing and to allow the conditions to prevail to provide for the development of private housing for those who want to and wish to buy their own home since 2016.  The fundamental flaw of Housing for All is that there is no definition whatsoever of "affordability". </p> <p>That is an absolute cop-out.  The Government is not willing to confront that elephant in the room.</p> <p> An affordable housing plan does not merit the name if affordability is not actually defined.  It was the advice of experts before the committee that affordability should be defined specifically as one third of the person's income.  My colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, the Labour Party&rsquo;s housing spokesperson, put forward this expert definition as an amendment only for it to be rejected.  I find that extraordinary.  There are &mdash; I checked this earlier &mdash; 63 references to affordable housing in the 160-page Housing for All document but no definition.  That is an indictment of the Government and its plan.</p> <p> I want to turn to renters&rsquo; rights.  We are aware that there remains a huge imbalance in power between renters and landlords.  Last week, the Minister spoke favourably about the Labour Party&rsquo;s Residential Tenancies (Tenants&rsquo; Rights) Bill but seemed to focus on issues related to the quality of rental accommodation, important as they are.  The real important issue here, however, concerns price, cost and security of tenure.  We did not get solid commitments on security of tenure.  Ultimately, as the Minister of State knows, that is the bedrock on which renters&rsquo; rights are based.  There is a huge deficiency in Housing for All in respect of the coverage of renters&rsquo; rights.  Renting is now a reality for so many.  I said to the Minister last week that if he is serious about building a bridge between where we are now and his own ambitions around Housing for All, he needs to provide security of tenure and improved affordability for the 400,000 who are currently renting and who will continue to rent, often in desperate conditions, over the coming period.</p> <p> Even if we were to accept that the Minister&rsquo;s ambition to have 33,000 homes built per year will be realised &ndash; I do not, for several reasons &ndash; there would be a challenge.  There are no really clear timelines and there is an issue in this country, as we know, over access to and the availability of skilled tradespeople to carry out the works that are necessary.  Inevitably, there would be a conflict between the demand for housebuilding and the demand for the retrofitting of homes.  That is a genuine challenge the Government is going to have to face.  Therefore, I repeat the call that all my Labour Party colleagues and I made last week, that is, for the Minister and the Department more generally not only to consider Deputy Bacik&rsquo;s renters Bill but also to accept it and work with us in good faith to make it a reality.  That would be greatly beneficial to our society.  I hope this House could unite on it.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and wish him well, along with his colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in dealing with the issue.  This is the issue on which everything else will turn for the country in the coming years.</p>  <p>  I listened to most of the contributions to the debate made both yesterday and earlier today.  It has been a frank discussion and I am going to be frank also.  For too long, politicians in this House and the other House and at local authority level have sought to gain political advantage by opposing the development of housing.  It has happened in every constituency and local authority in the country and I am sure it will happen in the future.  There is hypocrisy in the debate on housing.  There are representatives here and elsewhere who consistently speak of the obvious need for a supply of extra houses but their voting records and objections say the exact opposite.  I have been an elected representative for 22 years and have never objected to housing of any description, be it housing for people with disabilities, as Deputy Tully mentioned, or Traveller accommodation.</p>  <p>  With regard to all the thorny issues that we are all presented with regularly, Members have a responsibility to tell the truth to their constituents.  There are senior members of Opposition parties in this House who led massive campaigns against housing developments in this city.  I am thinking of the northside, in the Clontarf area, in the not too distant past.  Representatives have a responsibility, if they are to be taken seriously regarding the supply of houses, not to talk out of one side of their mouth in Leinster House or a council chamber and then out of the other when it comes to local applications that are reasonable.  Of course people have a right to object to the inappropriate siting of a development of any kind &ndash; I strongly uphold it &ndash; but it cannot be stood over that so many Members of this House have such a track record of objecting to housing and then coming in here regularly bleating that we have a shortage.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGuinness will be very familiar with the shortage we have in Kilkenny.  There is a very limited amount of private housing being built.  What is being built is very much aimed at the top end of the market.  Some 100,000 people live in Kilkenny city and county.  It was 99,000 according to the last estimate but it is probably closer to 110,000 now.  The survey mentioned by other Members referred to there being 15 or 16 properties for rent in Kilkenny city and county.  There is obviously a huge shortage, putting great strain on very many people.  People have different reasons for seeking accommodation.  They may be advancing in years or building a family, or they may want to move out of their parents&rsquo; accommodation if that is where they are residing.  We have a duty, as elected representatives, to try to meet the demand in Kilkenny, Carlow and the rest of the country.</p>  <p>  I have a few issues.  I welcome the document.  It is a broad-ranging one whose success will depend on implementation and the number of houses that are successfully built in the coming years.  We should not forget that the basic rules of supply in terms of the shortage that exists apply to the housing market.  The market has certain kinks.  Over the past 20 years, during my membership of the Oireachtas, various interventions by the Government have not worked for all sorts of reasons but at the moment there is an intense shortage.</p>  <p>  I have a couple of suggestions that I hope the Government will be able to take on board to implement the plan on foot of the upcoming budget.  We need a massive increase in funding for Irish Water for capital works.  So many towns, cities and villages throughout the country that are suitable for development cannot be developed unless the investment is made to address the fact they are at capacity in respect of water or wastewater.</p>  <p>  The planning system continues to be too slow and, even more than too slow, too uncertain in its outcomes.  I was going to say I will not refer to the cheese plant in Belview seeing as this is a housing debate but the plant is a very good example of how our planning system is not working.</p>  <p>  There is also the issue of access to funding for builders, particularly smaller builders.  Over the years, Deputy McGuinness and others have mentioned access to credit union funds, and I do not believe we should turn our back on this matter yet.</p>  <p>  The shortage of tradespeople has been referred to.  I echo the comments made.  I find it very disappointing that page 124 of Housing for All contains the only reference to reducing construction costs.  It is vague and waffly.  Construction costs have increased dramatically in the past 18 months.  In the upcoming budget, the Government needs to take specific action to ensure construction costs and their part in this regard are actively reduced if we are to see a pretty quick response in terms of housing construction over the next 12 or 18 months.</p></speech>

I was with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, last week in Kilkenny, where we visited several completed housing schemes.  The houses were top quality.  Tenants had moved into some of them and they were more than happy with the finished product.</p> <p>The Minister is enthusiastic and passionate about delivery of this housing programme, but he will not do it on his own.  This requires the same passion from the officials and members at county council level.  A number of obstacles preventing delivery rest with the efficiency of local councils and the attitude generally of chief executives and the County and City Management Association.  It is often said we do not have the expertise at local level anymore. I disagree with that.  We have the builders and expertise at local level.  Expertise can be bought into the councils if they so wish to deliver the houses that are needed in each county council area.  That is the reality.  You would not say that if you were in business.  You would confront the obstacles, get over them and sort them out.  How committed are the chief executives and the officials in every county to delivering on the housing schemes that are now being put forward?  What has happened since the 1950s?  There was no money and there was very little to do on planning, yet local councillors went out and delivered very significant housing schemes in every single county bar none.  I was reared in one of them, and they were excellent homes and houses.</p> <p> Why can we not go back to allowing the councils to review their lists and to deliver on those for the profile of applicant they have?  Why can we not remove some of the bureaucracy within local councils, and indeed the Department, to ensure the councils can do small things, such as refurbishing houses by getting the money for them and getting them back on the market?  That is an issue at local authority level.  Why can they not access the funds easily to extend a house to provide a growing family with what it needs, be it either a four or five-bedroom house?  It does not seem to happen easily any more.  There appears to be a big song and dance about any issue that relates to local government and the Department.</p> <p> I am aware that local councillors are anxious to see these schemes completed and to see the small things being done, but for some reason bureaucracy tends either to stall them or prevent them from proceeding.  I have spoken to builders.  You can call them developers and give them a bad name but we need the builders to go out and build.  I know they are there to go out and build but we are not giving them enough leeway at local level to make it happen.</p> <p> The big issue that will confront us now in completing schemes will be the cost.  There is a 15%-odd increase in building costs.  You can argue that it rests between 7% and 15% but one way or another it is an extra cost.  If we are going to stall the decision-making on that, then we are going to prevent homes from being completed and being made available for people to be housed.  Every local authority should be forced to come forward with a plan to deal with the extra costs and the issues that are arising now on completed housing schemes to ensure these houses are allocated as quickly as possible.</p> <p> I will finish by saying in respect of Irish Water, as my colleague Deputy Phelan did, that if we do not get investment in rural Ireland in existing water schemes in the areas that are at capacity, then we will not have housing and it will not be possible to implement these proposals for the various schemes.  That requires us to take the big step forward of accommodating Irish Water on the specific schemes around Ireland and, in particular, rural Ireland, to ensure the infrastructure is there to take care of the housing needs of local communities.</p></speech>

The plan mentions urban regeneration but does not mention the regeneration of flat complexes within that context.  There is no big plan for flat regeneration, which in many ways is the Cinderella of housing.  We need an acceptance that there is an issue beyond patching up a few leaks in the roof.  Regeneration of flat complexes like Pearse House, Glover&rsquo;s Court, not too far from here, Rathmines Avenue flats, and flat complexes in Ringsend needs to be fast-tracked.  Indeed, I cannot think of one flat complex that does not need a complete regeneration.  Even the new York Street apartments, which are just 12 years old and won awards for their design when they were first built, are infested with rats and have ongoing flooding and other maintenance issues because of the neglect.  One resident has been flooded seven times and is living in constant fear of it happening again.</p>  <p>  The conditions people are expected to live in are unacceptable in this day and age.  The tenement-like conditions of flat complexes are as a result of the buildings' age and neglect and cannot be allowed to continue.  There is rat infestation, raw sewage, electrical issues and severe dampness, which often makes clothes unwearable and, in some cases, rooms uninhabitable.  Residents feel neglected by Dublin City Council and residents in Dublin's inner city feel the architecture they live in is more appreciated than they are as a community.  Residents living in Mercer House, Markievicz House or Pearse House believe there is greater concern for the buildings they live in than there is for the living conditions they have to put up with daily.</p>  <p>  These complexes were originally, probably, the first Housing for All plan, which was at a time when the State was broke. The construction of these flat complexes showed great foresight by the State and the investment is now needed in the regeneration of flat complexes.  If Dublin City Council was a private landlord, it could be brought to an independent arbitrator.  That is not the case as the council is judge and jury and it has failed residents.  The Government now needs to intervene.</p></speech>

Successive governments, which have been made up of the current Government parties and the Labour Party, have been doing this for decades.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, acknowledged yesterday in this House that the system is broken.  Does he realise it did not break itself?  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party and the Labour Party blindly following free market-led policies has broken this system.  I am unsure if any of the Government parties know how broken the system is and a big part of me feels they do not greatly care either.</p>  <p>  The Minister also said yesterday that Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the Land Development Agency.  He is right, and if he was listening to his own party councillors, he would also know they also opposed it.  The president of the Association of Irish Local Government is Fianna F&aacute;il Councillor Mary Hoade.  She appeared at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in May and spoke of councillors' fears that their role in planning is eroded by the Bill which introduces the Land Development Agency.</p>  <p>  I have said it before in this House that Government Deputies must have nobody belonging to them that has ever had to appeal or apply for social housing, because if they did, the system would be better.</p>  <p>  The plan proves that this Government is out of touch and out of ideas.  It is time for them to move aside and allow Sinn F&eacute;in implement its policies.  These are policies which would tip the scales away from developers and vulture funds and towards ordinary workers and families.  Only a Sinn F&eacute;in Government and housing Minister will make the kind of change in housing that is needed to end the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael housing crisis.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin literally wrote the book on how to fix this, and in fact he has written two.  The current Government might learn a small thing or two by reading them.</p>  <p>  I will finish with this.  I was listening intently to Deputy McGuinness where he spoke about local authorities.  I inform him that there is a 12-year waiting list in my local authority in Kildare.</p> <p>Not only that, there is a 12-week waiting period to get on the list in the first place.  It is ludicrous.</p></speech>

I will highlight four areas that would make a substantial difference to the families and individuals affected.  The first relates to the obvious need to build more social and affordable housing.  Every week, I, like other Deputies, am contacted by families seeking a home, cohorts of people on social housing waiting lists, or people who cannot find affordable rented accommodation in their area.  They represent only a small fraction of a generation who know that, despite their hard work and savings, there is little hope of them ever getting their own home.  This needs to change.  We need to ensure all families and individuals have the dignity of housing.  We need an Ireland where people can afford to buy a home.  The Government&rsquo;s social and affordable housing targets are welcome.  However, they do not address the current need, not to mind the growth in demand annually.  Moreover, these targets are over a ten-year period, which is of considerable concern to families who have been on waiting lists for years.  We need a greater commitment on this matter, such as legislative-based percentages of annual housing stock being social and affordable.</p>  <p>  Second, there is only one reference in the plan to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which is very disappointing.  Again and again, organisations and advocates that support survivors of domestic violence have called for a whole-of-government approach to respond to this epidemic.  We need joined-up thinking.  Housing is one of the main State services with which victims or survivors interact.  Domestic and gender-based violence is not just a justice or health matter; it is about safe and secure housing.  A housing policy must and should include this cohort of people, who are often in desperate need of housing.  It is very concerning and disappointing this has largely been left out of the Government&rsquo;s plans.</p>  <p>  Third, there are numerous mentions of housing for people with disabilities in the plan, but this is against the backdrop of two recent reports that highlight failures of housing policy in this area.  A report of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, found that almost one third of people living with a disability experience housing quality issues and are more likely both to report an inability to keep their home warm and to be in arrears on rent or mortgage payments.  Furthermore, research from Inclusion Ireland and Independent Living Movement Ireland shows that people with disabilities feel their housing needs are being completely overlooked within the housing crisis and do not feel seen as people with an equal right to independent living.</p>  <p>  Many of the more acute issues in this area are housing related.  For example, we in the Joint Committee on Disability Matters have seen how a lack of proper housing and supports has resulted in more than 1,300 people with disabilities under the age of 65 living in nursing homes, some in psychiatric wards.  This is a disgrace.  In a recent appearance before the committee, Inclusion Ireland stated, "One of the biggest barriers facing people with an intellectual disability in accessing social housing is the clear lack of available support services that are required for them to live in their own homes."  This is not just a matter of building or adapting homes, it is about the wrap-around supports tailored to the needs of individuals who are entitled under the UN Convention of the Rights of People with Disabilities to live independently.  Without this integrated and rights-based approach, this plan will be yet another that fails people with disabilities and their families.</p>  <p>  The plan also mentions the Department's support of the decongregation of people with disabilities to their own homes.  This is only a passing reference, however, without the context of the incredibly low numbers of people who have been moved out of congregated settings.  The targets to continue to do that are also very low.  There is also an increase in funding for housing adaptation grants, a very useful programme to help people live independently, but these are not available to social housing tenants, a demographic who are often in most need of these grants, and the means test includes the income of adults in the house.  This means that in cases where adult children, and sometimes their families, reside with older parents because of the housing crisis, the grant can be denied.  The Minister needs to address this issue immediately.  On that point, it was very disappointing that he, as the senior Minister, would not come before the disability matters committee to address this issue in advance of the budget.  If we are to address this issue, every build, or at least most of them, will need to include some degree of independent supported living.</p>  <p>  Finally, the measures on vacancy and dereliction reflect the urgent need for more Government intervention in this area.  Too many towns and villages in west Cork have vacant and derelict buildings, which, although they are eyesores and potentially dangerous sites, could support a local business or house another family.  This would have a massive impact on our high streets as well, which are becoming more and more derelict.  The Government should mobilise every possible mechanism to convert vacant and derelict buildings into homes.  Bringing vacant stock back into use should be an essential aspect of addressing the housing crisis.  Building new homes takes time and has a considerable carbon footprint compared with adapting existing structures.  The failure to introduce a vacant home levy is a missed opportunity to get much-needed homes back into use.  The Minister also needs to ensure local authorities do everything they can to address this.</p>  <p>  To return to the issue of domestic violence in the context of the housing plan, one issue that has greatly affected people throughout the country relates to the fact that before homelessness became such a big problem in this country, people could go their local community welfare officer to present as homeless, which people fleeing domestic violence often need to do.  Because community welfare officers became overrun with that work, due to the increase in homelessness, people now have to turn to their local housing authority.  As an example, in Cork South-West, that is located in Clonakilty.  If someone lives in Castletownbere, for example, there is not even a bus that goes there and it often takes up to two hours to get there.  When people do manage to get there, they are asked to prove they are homeless.  As you can imagine, such persons might not have that proof to hand and could have children, pets or anything else with them.  They are then given a list of emergency accommodation providers in the area and asked to phone them themselves.  When they return, if they have found somewhere, they might be told it is actually too expensive, despite it being on the list.  Training is needed in all the local authorities to deal with such cases in other counties.  There are multidisciplinary teams who are better able to deal with these issues and they need to be considered in respect of housing because an awful lot of people fleeing domestic violence end up being homeless.</p>  <p>  Housing is a fundamental issue that supports vibrant communities and sustainable economies.  We need the Government to provide the full investment necessary to achieve this.</p></speech>

Building on the work produced through Rebuilding Ireland, this proposal will make a significant difference for people in society, benefiting those in need of social homes, renters, older people and those seeking to purchase their first home.  Throughout this debate, however, both yesterday and today, we have heard numerous contributions from members of Sinn F&eacute;in and the left and we will hear more before it ends.  Unfortunately, as we have all become used to, Sinn F&eacute;in and the left are interested only in getting a sound bite, a headline in tomorrow's newspapers or a clip for YouTube.  They will continue to use the issue of housing to bait and stoke frustration on social media.  They will do all these things while contributing nothing to the resolution of the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in and the left have consistently approached the housing crisis in a hypocritical way.  Their local councillors have worked on projects such as that in Oscar Traynor Road, not too far from where I live in north Dublin, and that in O'Devaney Gardens in Dublin city centre, only to withdraw their support at the final moment, preventing hundreds of people from getting a place to call home.  In my constituency, Dublin Fingal, as recently of May of this year, Sinn F&eacute;in councillors voted against a proposal that would have seen 1,200 homes built in Donabate, providing 20% social housing and 20% affordable housing, and with a guaranteed price point between &euro;250,000 and &euro;270,000.  Thankfully, this vote was carried despite their opposition.  More recently, as they have recognised the hypocrisy of their actions, a pattern of abstention from votes has emerged.  Just this month, members on South Dublin County Council abstained from voting on a project that would have seen 620 homes delivered in Tallaght.</p>  <p>  The evidence is clear and damning.  Sinn F&eacute;in has made no genuine attempt to resolve the housing crisis, regardless of books published.  Instead, it has chosen to play on people's fears and worries and, in doing so, seeks to profit politically.  This is the kind of disingenuous populist approach that serves only to hurt the very people the party purports to want to help.  Behind every one of these figures are real people and families, our friends and relatives, and getting the keys to their own home is a life-changing experience that improves the lives of individuals, their children and their community.</p>  <p>  To be clear, I do not claim that Fine Gael has got everything right when it comes to housing, but no one can say we have not prioritised the issue.  Housing has been treated as a core Government policy since 2015 and this Government is no different.  No Opposition party in this House has a monopoly on the desire to fix the problem.</p> <p>I am in regular contact with constituents who need housing assistance, as I am sure all Members are.  Fine Gael has been, and will remain, committed to solving the problem and will not relent until the opportunity of home ownership is attainable for all people in Ireland.  While in government, Fine Gael has introduced numerous policies that have made a profound difference to tens of thousands of people across Ireland.  Under Rebuilding Ireland, almost 85,000 new homes were built, and a plan also delivered 34,000 social homes, making a real difference to all those who benefited from this implemented policy.  Last year, over 20,000 homes were completed, despite the impact of Covid-19 and the implications it presented for the sector.  The help-to-buy scheme has helped 22,000 first-time buyers to achieve their goal of owning their own home.  Rent pressure zones have been introduced to protect renters from uncapped increases in rent.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan has loaned &euro;354 million, helping almost 2,100 people to buy a home.</p> <p> There have been many more examples of progress in the housing sector, and we will continue to build on these schemes.  These are facts that nobody can deny.  Housing for All will build on the progress we have seen in recent years and represents the biggest investment in housing in the history of the State, committing &euro;20 billion over the next five years.  This is an unprecedented level of investment and shows the Government's commitment to addressing this problem.</p> <p> The plan will also see the Land Development Agency, LDA, take on a significant role in the use of public lands.  The LDA faced opposition from Members of the House, but it will be a game changer in the housing crisis.  The LDA will also allow the State to be a vital player in the housing market and will allow the State to access land at a discount, to ensure that affordable housing can be delivered to all people across Ireland.  Housing for All will see an average of 33,000 homes delivered each year for the next decade.  It will also see 10,000 social homes delivered every year until 2030.  At least 4,000 affordable purchase homes will be provided each year, which will benefit families, couples and single people.  Moreover, new taxes will be introduced on vacant homes to incentivise properties to be returned to the market.  It is my hope that we will see plans properly resourced and carried out with additional community needs such as schools, playgrounds, local community amenities and transport links that will contribute to avoiding the mistakes of the past.</p> <p> If the Opposition parties are truly committed to solving the housing crisis, it is time to stop the attention-grabbing stunts and statements, to work with the Government to ramp up delivery in the housing sector and to provide solutions, not obstacles, to the problem.  That includes their councillors.  This plan can, and will, help hundreds of thousands of people in the coming years.  It is costed and deliverable.  At its core is a belief that the State should support the delivery of homes to as many people as possible, using any and all means available to it.  We are far more concerned about delivering on this plan than delivering sound bites.</p></speech>

It is one that has the potential to tackle the major housing crisis that affects this country at present significantly and very well.  It is the largest State-led building programme in Irish history.  I welcome the fact that there is an emphasis on the need for local authorities to build houses, not buy or lease them, in the future.  There is a clear message about building new homes.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the town centre first aspect of the plan.  All Members are aware of dereliction and of the existing vacant premises and vacant homes that can be brought back to use.  I welcome it in particular because it will bring multiple benefits from the point of view of bringing life back to town and village centres and using existing services.  There are demands for housing in those areas.  The Minister indicated through the Housing for All strategy that the Department will provide strong support for compulsory purchase orders for derelict sites to enable urban development.  I understand from speaking to local authority officials that councils will be in a position to buy suitable lands for development adjacent to towns and villages.  Often local authorities have faced cash flow problems so it is a welcome measure that the Department will fund such purchases.  The local authorities can know that they will have the necessary resources to buy suitable lands.  In particular, I welcome the fact that there will be strong support for local authorities to remove derelict properties and to build or restore housing.  The multi-annual, multibillion euro programme has the potential to deliver housing to deal with the very serious problems that have existed over the last number of years.</p>  <p>  Earlier, I listened to my colleagues, Deputies Jim O'Callaghan and Costello.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan spoke about social solidarity and the right of people to have access to quality homes.  Deputy Costello made that point as well.  We are not talking about building houses, but about building homes.  On many occasions in this Chamber over the years I have spoken about the great social housing policies we had for decades, since the 1930s, whereby there was a great mix of people in different local authorities.  Unfortunately, in recent years we have been losing that mix because of inadequate income eligibility limits.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has often heard me outline in the House the totally unacceptable income eligibility limits in areas such as Cavan and Monaghan.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor has spoken similarly as well.  Small amendments are needed to the tenant purchase scheme.  I outlined the case of people on a social welfare payment who have the resources, through family support or whatever, but are not allowed to buy their homes.  That is wrong.</p>  <p>  I saw the report that the director of housing in Cavan, Mr. Eoin Doyle, gave to the local authority recently.  The council will build 500 houses over the next number of years.  That is a very substantial development in a small rural county.  It will mean more than doubling the built house provision over the last five years.  That is very welcome.</p>  <p>  With regard to the voids programme, in 2019 Cavan brought 29 houses back to habitable use.  In 2020, the local authority brought 70 houses that were vacant back to habitable use, and this year 90 houses will be restored to habitable use.  That is putting public funding to very good use.  I sincerely hope the Department will continue that policy.  These are houses where services exist and where there is a demand for housing.  It is giving a vote of confidence to many estates that suffered due to dereliction in the past.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that a good, strong voids programme continues into the future.  I know the value of it for local small contractors.  There are 11 small contracting firms in my county engaged in local authority repair and building work at present, so it is giving local employment as well.</p>  <p>  Another aspect of Housing for All is the need for investment in infrastructure.  In my county, Irish Water has been far too slow to advance projects relating to a major sewerage scheme in Ballyjamesduff and in Virginia.  That has complicated housing applications and has delayed the provision of housing.  We must ensure that Irish Water is resourced to eliminate any delays in that respect.  Further problems will arise in Kingscourt and Bailieborough, areas where there is great demand for housing.</p>  <p>  I hope that a clear message can be given to local authorities to build houses in the smaller towns and villages.  All of us represent such areas.  There is already a social infrastructure there and there are educational and sporting facilities.  A dozen houses in smaller towns and villages can mean a great deal to those communities.  It would be a very good investment and there will be people who will want those houses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="15:07:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900039#MM00300"><p>In the limited time I have I will focus on just one issue relating to the Housing for All plan.  Over the last weeks in my area of South Dublin County Council there have been over 60 25-year leases available for people on the social housing lists.  These are private homes that were bought on the market and leased back to the local authority.  Investment firms are buying these homes on the private market and then leasing them back to the local authority for big profits.  This is another barrier to first-time buyers who are seeking to get onto the property ladder.  I tabled a parliamentary question seeking a cost analysis relating to the cost of public funding for this model.</p>  <p>On average across the State, it would be &euro;300,000 for the lifetime of the lease, but on top of that there is also the cost of maintenance and the landlord's responsibility to the local authority.  However, in Dublin because the rents are much higher, it would cost on average &euro;450,000 over the lifetime of the lease.  Public money is being used to pay investment firms &euro;450,000 to rent the property.  The local authority must do all the maintenance and all the landlord obligations.</p> <p> At the end of the 25-year lease, the local authority returns the home back to the investment company.  We have no asset at the end of it even though it will cost &euro;450,000 or more.  At the end of the 25 years, the other side of it is that the 60 families in South Dublin County Council who have used this scheme over the past six weeks will be banging down the door of the local authority again seeking social housing support.</p> <p> HAP tenants who were in these homes previously and received notice to quit from the investment firms also need to go back to the local authority again seeking social housing support.  This means we are evicting social housing tenants to supply other social housing tenants, which is absolutely bonkers.  It is another way of putting investors before workers or families.  </p> <p> Listening to the debate across the room, it is like being in the twilight zone.  Fine Gael Members seem to forget they have been in government for the past ten years.  They presided over the housing crisis.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members like to forget they propped up the Government with the confidence and supply agreement.  It definitely was not the confidence to supply homes.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results.  Unless we move away from the tired measures of putting private developers before public housing, things will not change.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1571" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900040#NN00200"><p>Ireland is in an unenviable position of relying on Fianna F&aacute;il to fix the housing crisis that many believe it created.  Does anyone really believe the architects of the recession, who drove us off the cliff, will fix the housing crisis?  Like every housing plan we have seen from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, it is a developers' charter that will pour even more money into the pockets of developers and speculators.  There are no plans to stop the few homes that will be built being hoovered up by vulture funds and cuckoo funds.</p><p>Social housing targets are now lower than those promised by Fine Gael the last time, not that they were ever built.  The affordable housing element is completely out of touch with the realities facing ordinary working families.  There is no realistic plan to stop rents from rising even higher.  There is every likelihood that the Government's plans will push up the cost of homes, meaning that many workers and families will be trapped in the rental market.  Homelessness will continue and will increase as more and more workers' income flows into rent.</p><p>I do not know anyone who trusts Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael to solve the housing crisis.  That is what most people say to me.  Housing for All preserves the <i>status quo</i>so that a few privileged people do not lose out while workers and their families are being driven deeper and deeper into debt.  Sinn F&eacute;in has a plan to solve the housing crisis.  We need 20,000 social and affordable houses built every year, delivered by local authorities and community housing trusts, not by developers.  We need a three-year ban on rent increases and a month's rent back in every renter's pocket through a tax credit.  </p><p>I return to my original question.  Does anyone seriously believe that the same parties that created the mess and told us there was no problem - I was in this Chamber when we were told there was no housing problem - are now capable of or serious about fixing this crisis?  That is the big question.  I certainly do not believe they are capable.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="15:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900040#NN00300"><p>Housing for All is a good name for a policy document; I will give the Government that.  I believe the name is borrowed from the housing movement.  It obviously bears no relationship to the actual content of the policy and the actual strategy of the Government.  It would more accurately be named something like "Profit for a Minority", "Profits for the Few" or "Profits for Developers".</p>  <p>  The core of the so-called Housing for All plan is simply a continuation of the same failed reliance on incentivising the private sector to deliver housing.  Effectively the Government's model is trickle-down housing.  It takes some level of gumption by the Government to claim it will deliver 300,000 homes by 2030.  That is the blaring headline it wants.  While I am used to a lot from this Government, I found it astounding that the majority of those homes are simply the Government estimating what the private sector will deliver.  That is it.  The Government does not have any hand or part in it; it is simply saying the private sector will deliver that.  If the private sector delivers it, the Government can claim that is great, but if the private sector does not deliver it, the Government washes its hands of it and will have no responsibility for it.  It is the same model of incentivising private developers to build and hoping some of that trickles down to ordinary people.  </p>  <p>  I will focus on a few points.  Due to the pressure from below, there are relatively significant increases in the amount of social housing that is promised of something like 10,000 a year.  However, the emerging details indicate the Government is including housing built under the provisions of Part V.  These are not separate builds driven by local authorities.  The Government is relying on the private market and then hoping it gets 10% or 20% of those.  They are not all new builds and also include refurbishments.  As we know - we debated it last week - the Government bowed to the lobbying of the private developers in accepting that many of them would be exempt for a long time into the future.</p>  <p>  The other point is that literally a week or so after the publication of Housing for All, the same Government policy continued, with the privatisation of public land in South Dublin County Council.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Green Party and the Social Democrats all voted to sell off public land to a private developer.  Unfortunately, Sinn F&eacute;in did not vote against; it abstained.  Strikingly the land was not given to the LDA.  The Government has gone on and on about how it would give the land to the LDA.  In this case it was given to a private developer.  Some of the land will be used to build houses at market price.  The majority of the land will be used for so-called affordable housing, which in reality is just at a discount to the market rate and will be unaffordable.  </p>  <p>  I want to focus on the most glaring omission.  There is almost nothing for renters in Housing for All.  Rents in Ireland are at the highest on record and Dublin has among the highest rents in the world.  More than 500,000 households are trapped in the private rented sector, their lives blighted by housing insecurity and unaffordability.  Those renters are commonly paying 30%, 40%, 50% or more of their income on rent.  They have little if anything left over after rent to pay for the essentials.  We are facing into a crisis with fuel prices and yet they will need to continue to pay these levels of rent.</p>  <p>  Almost 500,000 young people are trapped living with their parents because they cannot afford to rent a place of their own.  How does Housing for All respond to this unprecedented crisis of affordability?  It states that the Government will extend rent pressure zones to 2024 and will link rents to the harmonised index of consumer prices.  We have some of the highest rental costs in the world and the Government's big great idea is to ensure that rent increases with inflation.  This is just when inflation is taking off.  Inflation reached 3% last month and looks set to go higher.  The Government has had the neck to refer to this as a rent value freeze.</p>  <p>  Last week, the T&aacute;naiste commented that we needed to balance that one person's rent is another person's income.  </p> <p>Will somebody please think of the corporate landlords and their need of an income?  It is balanced all right.  It is balanced at a level that index links the enrichment of landlords, many of them in this Chamber, and impoverishes renters.  Once again landlords will be toasting their peers in government.  Instead we need rent controls and reductions and rents should be linked to income with nobody forced to pay one third or more of their income on rent.  People Before Profit is campaigning for real rent controls to bring rents down to affordable levels and we are arguing for the establishment of a rental board with responsibility to maintain minimum accommodation standards, secure tenancy leases and reduce existing rents to below 2011 levels.</p></speech>

It is a short debate and it is hard to get all the points across in the limited time we have.  A significant change in Government policy is proposed here, which I support.  I have been campaigning for a number of years for the compulsory purchase of vacant homes by local authorities and for a tax on empty homes.  I welcome the commitment to introduce a new programme for the compulsory purchase of vacant properties for resale on the open market.  The shining example of this work has been done by Louth County Council.  I understand from a meeting I had on Monday that over a period of two years up to 120 homes that were derelict, empty, burned out in some cases, abandoned or centres of antisocial behaviour have been completely refurbished and taken over.  Families are living full and decent lives now in accommodation that is up to standard.</p>  <p>  This programme must be driven by the Department.  Somebody in the Department needs to be making sure that those so-called vacant homes officers are doing their jobs because the fact is that up to now they have not been doing so.  Few of the county councils, which were given &euro;50,000 each for vacant home officers about two years ago, are doing that job.  It is time for the local authorities to step up to the mark.  They are not saints when it comes to housing and many of them are sinners.  They have been reluctant to get involved, unlike Louth County Council, which has done a fantastic job.  It is also important that there is accountability and that we have a quarterly report on that through the Minister's office in the Oireachtas to see what has happened, who is doing what and who is not doing what.  The Minister must put the boot in if the local authorities are not doing their jobs.</p>  <p>  Some years ago the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, offered over 4,500 houses free of charge to local authorities up and down the country.  City and county councils in Dublin refused to accept over 1,500 homes that would have accommodated people because they did not want to have social housing or because there was too much social housing in their areas.  That went back to the councils on the ground.  It was not Members of this House who made that decision but the county councillors and council officials who were complicit in that.  It was appalling and wrong.</p>  <p>  I have also been strong on the taxing of empty homes.  This is a tax which I welcome the commitment to introduce but I would prefer if it were in this budget rather than next year's budget.  If one looks at what has happened in other jurisdictions such as Vancouver, for instance, this is a tax the Government does not want an income from because it wants the empty home to be occupied.   There must be strategies to ensure that if somebody has an empty home a big tax will be placed on them if they do not occupy it or put somebody into it.  There are significant exclusions for that, one of which would be if somebody was in a nursing home or if it was a principal private residence and so on.  There is nobody here who does not walk streets or drive around country lanes where houses have been vacant for 15 or 20 years with nobody in them.  We have to put manners on these people and force them to fill their properties or sell them because they cannot hold onto a resource that the people need.  We must tax them and hit them hard in the pocket if they do not do that but we must have exceptions such as the six exceptions there are in Vancouver.  In that way we will make sure those empty homes are occupied and full.  That is the way forward.</p>  <p>  I understand the amendment to the nursing homes support scheme and I do not have an issue in principle with saying that if somebody is in a nursing home they should be exempt from the vacant homes tax.  They should be exempt anyway, whether their home is occupied or not.  The consent of the person involved is needed prior to him or her entering that home because many people have dementia and other serious medical issues and they may not be in an appropriate position to make a proper judgment on this.  It is important that the Government would liaise with those groups that advocate for older people such as Sage Advocacy and so on.  There should be a process by which there would be accountability for every action that is taken.  While the vast majority of people honour and respect their older family members, there is abuse, including financial abuse.  We have to make sure that does not happen and that the appropriate decision-making is in place, whether it is a living will or whatever, for those older people who are going into a home they may never come out of. </p>  <p>  I welcome this debate.  I would love to have a further and longer debate with the Minister but I congratulate the determination of the Government.  From my perspective as a Government backbencher, I will make sure the Minister is listening to me this time.  I welcome that and I hope the Cabinet will continue to listen to backbenchers because we all share in the same demand that our people are housed and that young people in particular can get their first step on the housing ladder, which is being denied them under present circumstances.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be a Government Deputy pushing this huge investment.  It is one of the key reasons Fianna F&aacute;il entered Government.</p>  <p>  I want to talk about Irish Water and the infrastructure it needs to invest in.  We have to have proper waste treatment facilities in our towns, villages and major urban centres.  The current lack of infrastructure is contributing to a deterioration in water quality.  This issue needs to be addressed and there needs to be significant investment in it.  It would be a shame if our lack of wastewater treatment plants and the lack of infrastructure there was to restrict the building of houses.  This area needs very significant investment.  We have seen reports from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which clearly show that part of the deterioration in water quality is due to the lack of infrastructure in these key areas.</p>  <p>  I want to mention once-off housing in rural areas.  As a rural Deputy this is extremely important to me.  Rural people feel there will be a ban on the building of houses in rural areas and communities.  I have been in touch with the Department about this.  Hopefully we will get a commitment on this in the near future and we expect a draft plan on it.  It is imperative for rural areas that people are allowed to build there.  If we are to keep services and rural communities alive, once-off housing has to be part of any plan for housing in this country.  To keep rural communities alive and to keep schools in rural areas, they have to be revitalised.  The only way that can happen is with once-off rural housing.  Anyone who is from a rural community has to have the right for their family members to build in that area.</p>  <p>  I also want to mention the revitalisation of town centres and villages.  As others have said, there are a lot of empty dwellings in these town centres and villages and I welcome the commitment in Housing for All to incentivise the refurbishment of same.  It will enhance these town centres and villages and will provide a lot of units for families to live in.</p></speech>

That process is coming to a conclusion and I acknowledge the Minister's commitment to it.  We urgently need definitive decisions on that to begin to put this nightmare to an end.  It will only be the beginning because there are long journeys ahead.</p> <p> Housing for All is a plan I welcome.  It is different because it is funded.  However, staff need to be put in place in our local authorities to deliver and drive it.  I do not mean additional administrative staff but additional engineers, quantity surveyors and people who can build these houses.  We need to radically change our approach to apprenticeships.  What we are doing with them at the moment is a sticking plaster.  We need to be more ambitious and to deliver.  We also need to put a programme in place to bring our labourers who are working abroad home and to encourage and make it easy for them to come back, so they can relocate and bring their skills and families with them.</p> <p> Targets need to be published, so the public can see which local authorities are delivering and which are not.  The various plans within this document need to be published in a way that is accessible and understandable.  I agree with Deputy Cahill regarding Irish Water.  We need fundamental changes in this regard, including resourcing and more partnership in delivering.  We need more investment in our towns and villages.  I particularly welcome the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe programme but it needs to be driven quickly.  As the Minister represents what is, to a certain extent, a rural constituency, he also knows about what Deputy Cahill talked about with regard to rural housing.  I feel very strongly about that matter.  We cannot allow Housing for All to be housing for urban areas.  Housing for All must mean what is says on the tin in respect of giving opportunities for rural people to live in the communities they come from, are working in and were reared in.  They have a stake in those communities and in housing.  They deserve Housing for All.  </p> <p> Caithfidh m&eacute; labhairt faoi ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; plean&aacute;la sa Ghaeltacht.

What is in this plan for the 137,000 workers on the national minimum wage or for workers on the average industrial wage who cannot get a mortgage from a bank but who do not qualify for social housing?  Meanwhile, they face skyrocketing rents and increases in the cost of living.  Have we learned nothing from the property crash?  The Government is out of touch with the gravity of the situation and the reality of the housing crisis on the ground for the majority of people, including hard-working young people, who have not got a hope of getting a foot in the door of somewhere safe, warm and secure for their children.  With homelessness on the rise, is this the great vision of an Irish republic?</p>  <p>  In County Wexford, the most recent data shows house prices increased by an incredible 16.4% last year.  From talking to many people on the ground, I can speculate that more people from Dublin and its surrounds are migrating to rural areas such as north Wexford, in particular Gorey, where they can either work from home or deal with a long commute to Dublin to work.  This level of demand is driving house prices up.  I am concerned about the impact on our infrastructure, such as public transport and our education system.  I fail to see how this plan will deal with this in any meaningful way.  People will continue to be priced out of cities and towns while the corresponding price rises and high rents are once again fleecing the pockets of young families. </p>  <p>  The rental sector in County Wexford is not much better.  Year-on-year analysis shows average rental prices in the county increased by 13%.  The reality once more is that property speculators are buying up all around them and then charging exorbitant rents.  I hear the fallout from this every day in my constituency office.  Hard-working families are struggling to cope with uncertainty, insecurity and the threat of eviction.  The stress and pressure they are under is unbelievable at times.  This is happening at a time of their lives that should be all about the excitement of starting their independent lives.  They are worried about being one pay cheque away from some vulture fund repossessing their home or if they will have enough to pay for childcare after rent or if they can deal with substandard accommodation for just a little longer until, maybe, something better turns up on the market.  </p>  <p>  Another generation of young people is being let down.  We are failing them and, sadly, upon reading this so-called Housing for All plan, it looks like large landowners, institutional investors and big developers are rubbing their hands again.  As WB Yeats once said, "You [will dry] the marrow from the bone".</p></speech>

None of us need to go into the ins and outs of the difficulties.  I am sure the Minister of State, similar to everyone in the Chamber, is inundated with people who cannot get on the housing list, people who can get on the housing list but cannot get a council house and, beyond that, people who cannot even get a rental property.</p>  <p>  I know a large number of Sinn F&eacute;in councillors in towns such Dundalk spend a great deal of time dealing with renters or Blue Sky Property in trying to facilitate people into HAP properties.  We are dealing with a dysfunctional situation.  People coming to Dundalk to work in places like WuXi will be lucky to get accommodation and they will, possibly, be taking it from a family that is not able to get it.  Dundalk Institute of Technology, DKIT, is under severe pressure.  The students' union has a list of people who cannot get accommodation in Dundalk, which it never had previously.  DKIT is an education instituteion where many of its students come from Dundalk, or within shooting distance of it, which just shows the level of the problem we are dealing with.  </p>  <p>  We are dealing with multiple issues.  I am sure any Deputy from County Louth who will talk about Housing for All in the Chamber will mention the fact that the maintenance budget in Louth County Council is not dealing with the problems we have, especially in respect of windows and doors.  We welcome the retrofit programme but we do not believe it is sufficient.  I will come back to the Minister of State and the Minister with a proposal from the council on what needs to be done from the point of view of ensuring people are able to get adequate works done.  The likes of Dundalk is dealing with very old housing stock and, therefore, has an issue beyond what is currently happening.  </p>  <p>  It is as simple as this.  Housing for All does not have the solutions that are required.  The big problem is supply and we need to deal with that, which includes affordable cost rental, affordable mortgages and council houses.  We just need the State to kick off and do it.  We could do it at points in time when there was no money in this State.  Caithfimid rud n&iacute;os fearr a dh&eacute;anamh amach anseo, seachas an m&eacute;id a rinneadh cheana.</p></speech>

The housing issue has been a constant topic for debate during my time in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We have seen housing lists grow consistently over the past number of years, with each Government struggling to deal with a very serious issue.  I have said many times in this House that I will support any measures that will help tackle the housing problems we are currently experiencing.  While I welcome the Government's recent Housing for All announcement, I am not satisfied it will produce the result we need.  Housing for All lists the following as its goals: to put affordability at the heart of the housing system; to prioritise the increased supply of public, social and affordable homes; and to increase the supply of social housing by more than 50,000 units with an emphasis on new builds.</p>  <p>  I could go on, but these goals are all aspirational.  What we need is action, not aspirational statements.  When I heard the Government was going to increase the supply of social housing by 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds, I despaired.  Surely, I am not the only one who sees the many hundreds and thousands of vacant homes throughout the country.  In my home town of Dundalk, one can walk down any street and find at least one vacant property.  Why is the Government not putting more emphasis on bringing vacant properties back into the housing stock?  Surely, this can be a short-term solution to the current housing crisis.  Many of these vacant properties are in well-established residential areas where there are already communities, services and schools.  It is a no-brainer to fund local authorities to get these vacant properties back into use for tenants.  Louth County Council has been to the forefront in this regard and we are well regarded as leading the way.  </p>  <p>  From speaking to officials, I know they could do much more if adequate funding was forthcoming from Government.  There would be many benefits to this approach.</p> <p>Vacant houses, which are often used as areas for antisocial behaviour, would be habitable again.  It would improve the area and the quality of life for existing residents.  While I welcome the Government's Housing for All plan, not enough resources are being put into getting vacant properties back into the housing stock.  It is more important than ever that we have an accurate vacant property register.  It would help identify vacant properties that are suitable to be brought back into the system.  I have called for this previously and urge the Government to move on it.</p> <p> When discussing housing, it is important to examine rent increases over recent years.  Efforts by Government have clearly failed to prevent rent inflation.  How can it be that in Dundalk someone will pay between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,600 for a standard, three-bedroom home when servicing a mortgage on the same property would cost significantly less?  There is something wrong somewhere when are in this situation.  Surely we should support people who are currently paying these rents and who are quite clearly capable of servicing a mortgage, yet cannot get one.</p> <p> While I support the efforts of any party to address the housing situation, it is quite clear that we have a short-term solution in converting vacant properties into habitable homes.  What we need now is a commitment from Government that it will make available the necessary funds to local authorities to upgrade vacant homes.  Every week, mothers, fathers and children come into my constituency office looking for a home.  They are walking down all the streets in Dundalk and Drogheda and seeing vacant properties.  They cannot understand why they cannot get a home.  Residents in lovely areas have vacant properties and all we see is antisocial behaviour.  We can see drug takers and people on corners.  It is wrong.  Louth County Council is one of the leading authorities at the moment.  It is pleading for the Minister to give it more resources so it can get homes for families.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1576" speakername="Noel Grealish" time="15:47:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900043#QQ00200"><p>I welcome this plan, which will offer more people a chance of getting a home in which to live.  The sooner it gets off the ground and starts delivering, the better.  I would like more attention to be given to the yawning gap, which is getting wider, between groups of people trying to do just that.  On the one side are those who can hope to get a house, either by buying one privately, if they can afford to, or securing a social house from their local authority or from an AHB.  On the other side, an increasing number of couples, families and individuals who can never hope to get a mortgage from the bank because they are not earning enough but who will never get a social house because their earnings are considered too high.  The numbers are starting to shoot up.  The problem is becoming particularly acute in Galway where "For Sale" signs are only up for a few weeks before being replaced by "Sold" signs, such is the demand, which is also pushing up prices by the week.  New construction has a long way to go to fill the gaps in supply.  That means that a considerable number of people are finding themselves falling into the category where their only hope now is an affordable house while they are, all the while, paying huge rents.</p>  <p>  Thankfully, the building of social housing is at last picking up pace, though perhaps not as quickly as we might like.  However, the number of affordable houses being built is pathetically small.  I would like a special effort to be made by the Government to ensure it catches up.  In that regard, I urge that more developments put a greater emphasis on the provision of affordable housing where the need is increasing by the day.  There is, for instance, a new development planned by Galway County Council on a seven-acre site close to Claregalway where it is proposed to build 45 social houses in the first phase and 45 affordable houses in the second.  The work is unlikely to start until next summer and it will probably be years before the second phase will be completed.  I urge that the entire development be dedicated to affordable housing so that those families caught in the middle can be offered some hope.  </p>  <p>  The number of calls to my office has increased by approximately 200% over the past six or seven months from people looking for affordable housing.  These people want to buy and live in their own houses.  There needs to be considerable emphasis on providing more affordable housing.</p>  <p>  The Regional Independent Group had a great meeting with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform this morning.  We put forward a plan or proposal for cluster developments for elderly people who want to downsize.  These are for people who voluntarily want to downsize and want to buy a house.  In Claregalway, we put a plan together a number of years ago and, with the help of a local landowner who gave us approximately seven acres of land free of charge, we were able to build 12 independent, two-bedroom, live-in units with support from the Department with responsibility for housing.  We also built a day care centre in the middle of the development with the support of the Department of Health.  There was a great team involved, including Seamus McNulty, Tom McGann and Geraldine Carr.  They managed the facility.  I invite the Minister to come and look at it.  People often approach me who want to get into that facility.  They want to be able to use it and want to sell, downsize and have a bit of capital in their bank accounts so they can go on holidays.  We need to start looking at that solution around the country.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies mentioned rural housing.  We must ensure that we can still build once-off rural housing.  I refer to areas in my constituency such as Turloughmore, Clarinbridge, Annaghdown and Corrandulla.  If a rule was put in place that people had to move to the nearest town or village and building could not take place in the countryside, people from those areas would move to Tuam, Athenry or Claregalway.  It would kill the rural community.  We must retain the option of one-off rural housing.  I am delighted to see in the draft county development plan in Galway a proposal to bring in cluster developments.  That is important.  It would either be a family cluster development or a community cluster development where three or four houses would be built together with one access route onto the road.  It is crucial that we continue to build in the countryside.</p></speech>

The Government has provided the funding and legislation.  The challenge will be the implementation and delivery of the plan within the given timeframe.  I am particularly glad to see Green Party housing policies at the heart of the plan, including cost rental, which is a model for which I have advocated since being elected.  In just over a year, we have moved from the provision of 50 units in total to 2,000 units a year.  We would like to see this number further increased, going forward.  A key Green Party policy is 100% public housing on public land and that was secured.  That policy is crucial to increasing the provision of social and affordable housing in areas such as Dublin and Cork where there are chronic affordability crises.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, we need legislation to level the playing pitch for first-time buyers to ensure they are not outbid by pension funds by reserving 30% of units in all developments for first-time buyers.  The commitment to increase Housing First tenancies to 1,200 units, as well as providing 90,000 social homes through the LDA and AHBs will assist in eliminating homelessness.  Organisations such as the Peter McVerry Trust, with whom I recently met, play a vital role in leading on Housing First and bringing vacant units and derelict properties back into residential use for our most vulnerable.  </p>  <p>  We need to ensure that budget 2022 provides enough financial support through the Housing Agency for our housing organisations and charities such as the Peter McVerry Trust to continue their important work.  Crucially, we also need to look towards identifying and mapping our vacant units, led by our local authorities' vacant homes officers.  This would assist our efforts to utilise and bring back into use vacant properties in our towns, villages and cities.  The Centre for Irish Towns research hub in UCD is perfectly placed to assist and deliver the identification of our vacant units across the country.  However, it requires a funding mechanism to allow it to process the work required.  I hope this can be found to assist with the town centres first initiative.</p>  <p>  We must not overlook the chronic lack of investment in our wastewater treatment infrastructure.  Housing developments are being stalled and new estates are suffering from abhorrently poor water infrastructure, which is alarming and needs urgently to be improved.  We need a national audit of our wastewater plants to identify areas where there is capacity and areas where we need to improve infrastructure to allow this plan to move forward progressively.  We also need to begin a programme of attracting people to build our homes and I am sure this process has begun in earnest within the Government and appropriate Departments.</p>  <p>  I look forward to introducing my Bill on defective dwellings tomorrow.  It aims to legislate for a process to deal with defective properties and the provision of redress for impacted homeowners.</p></speech>

Now, the real work gets under way.  Fianna F&aacute;il in government always had a track record of building houses and ensuring that the most marginalised people in society are looked after.  We again see that at the centre of Government in Housing for All.  I am glad that the Department, led by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is leading this initiative.  We are hanging our coats and our hats on this because, when this Government's term ends, this is what we will be judged on.  We hope Covid will soon become a distant memory.  Our vaccination rate is at 92% and we are at a point where it is quite manageable.  We are now down to the real issues: housing, health and homelessness.  This plan will see 33,000 new houses per annum.  Some 10,000 of these will be social houses and 6,000 will be affordable.  That is positive.</p>  <p>  I will bring up two more localised topics.  The first relates to Ennistymon, a largish town in north Clare.  There is a derelict convent building in the town.  I am sure there are similar buildings in many towns in the west and east.  Inagh Housing Association has come up with a plan to develop accommodation units for the elderly on the site.  It wants to form a partnership with Clare County Council.  Older or ageing people and elderly people - I believe the terms refer to different categories of people, although I do not know if others use them that way - will be able to live together in a supported environment.  The plan has run into some stumbling blocks.  At the moment, the housing waiting list figures for north Clare suggest that there are only 22 people over the age of 60 in need of housing.  I do not believe that figure captures the real data on people who might want to live in this accommodation.  People in the existing housing stock who may wish to transfer should be considered.  People who live in remote rural parts of north Clare might want to move to more comfortable accommodation in their later years.</p>  <p>  I believe I have a minute left, although I am not great with the clock.  I will conclude by talking about the national planning framework.  This was set in a time before Covid, when people were largely living in cities and towns.  They have now returned home.  They have come back to counties such as Clare in the west.  The national planning framework needs to be overhauled.  Population targets and the fact that towns and village without sewerage schemes are to have zoning removed pave the way for a decimation of rural Ireland.  We have to stand up for rural planning.  There is a surge in the number of planning applications being made to rural county councils at the moment because people fear what is coming down the line.  We have to stand up for rural development and rural planning.  It is a God-given right.  I know that term is used and abused but it is a God-given right to live in the community you have grown up in and to live down the road from your parents to support them as they move on in life.  It is a right we should uphold at all times in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

It is referenced some 20 times in the Housing for All document and also forms a central plank of Our Rural Future, the development policy issued by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  However, as I said to the Minister of State last night, I still do not have a clear picture of what the town centres first principle looks like when applied in the Irish context.</p>  <p>  On my way here today, I attended the official launch of St. Declan's way by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  This is a long-distance walking trail from Cashel, County Tipperary to Ardmore, County Waterford.  It passes through Ardfinnan, Cappoquin, Lismore, Aglish and more.  These are small rural market towns built around a historic core.  Cappoquin in particular is an exemplar of what towns centres first could and should look like.  Its development is heritage-led and centred around community engagement.  In the Heritage Council's collaborative town centre health check, we have a toolkit at the ready, which takes a holistic view of the regeneration of our smaller urban centres.  We cannot continue to take an atomised and financialised view of housing stock in our town centres.  It cannot just be about the development of units.  We must sit these homes in the context of local heritage, creating vibrant and sustainable communities that take account of factors such as embedded carbon, place-making, sustainable transport and localised retail.</p>  <p>  Just as we consider the negative societal impact of vacancy and dereliction, both of which we should tackle head-on, we should consider and calculate the positive impact across the economy and society of reanimating our town centres and incentivise their redevelopment, breathing life back into their historic cores both in terms of the built environment and of the communities they support.

I grew up at the foot of Slieve Mish in the open countryside of Keel, Castlemaine.  I will not be told that my children will not be able to build a house and live there after me.  It is the same for every other rural community in the country.  We have a right to live in the countryside and we will always have that right.  This party will always stand for that right.</p>  <p>  In the minute or so I have left, I will focus on one particular area of Housing for All.  I welcome the document overall.  It is overdue but its implementation will make a real difference.  We particularly need to look at the thousands of derelict properties in our towns and dotting the countryside.  These are properties that could become homes in a relatively short period.  Many of the measures in this plan are for the long term.  Those waiting for a home cannot wait that long.  It is a crying shame.  We have so many derelict properties and so many pinch points in respect of the rules and so-called supports that are in place.  I will focus on one or two of them.  One relates to the help-to-buy scheme.  This is available to someone to demolish a derelict building but not to renovate it.  That makes no sense.  Can we not cop on and make the scheme available to a first-time buyer who is planning to renovate a home?  Can we get more supply of those types of homes onto the market by allowing a capital gains tax holiday of a year or a year and a half for people selling such properties to first-time buyers?  These are measures that I have been seeking for three years.  </p>  <p>  Can we look at the home renovation incentive, HRI, model?  That was very helpful.  Can we apply similar thinking to the case of first-time buyers buying derelict properties to help bring them up to modern standards?  It is not rocket science.  We could get thousands of derelict properties in towns, villages and the countryside back into circulation as homes.  </p>  <p>  Finally, can we work with our utility companies such as the ESB and Irish Water with regard to rebates for first-time buyers looking to reconnect properties?  These could operate over seven years and an occupancy clause could be applied.  It would take that additional cost off of people who are trying to renovate these properties.  We are in the middle of an unprecedented housing crisis, yet people who are trying to bring these properties back into circulation as homes face obstacle after obstacle.  These problems can be fixed quickly but the political will is needed.  The budget next week is a great opportunity to show that will.</p></speech>

It is terribly important that we raise the following matters.  On behalf of Kerry County Council, I will say that we desperately need more one-bedroom units built in our county.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has acknowledged that.  When I raised this issue previously, the Taoiseach agreed that the Department would finance more of these units, if possible.  With regard to planning permission for rural dwellers, people who are in a position to build a house for themselves should be accommodated in every single, solitary way possible.</p> <p>We will have to turn this whole thing around of being against rural planning and putting every obstacle in the way and instead encourage people to live, if they can, in rural areas.  There needs to be a new tenant purchase scheme for people living in local authority houses.  I was thankful when a tenant purchase scheme was reintroduced by Enda Kenny but I was disappointed by the content of it.  Over 80% of the people living in those houses were not able to avail of it.  What good is a scheme if people cannot buy their houses?  I want that to be looked at.  I know it is under review but, my goodness, it has been under review for a very long time.  I want it to move on.</p> <p> I listened intently to all sides of the House.  People in here know I do not go out of my way to criticise others but there seems to be a mentality of people talking about developers and builders as if they are some awful type of people.  I have no difficulty in the world saying that, over the past couple of days, I met with a builder in County Kerry.  There are other politicians who, if they had met with a builder, would nearly want to hide from him.  I am delighted I met him.  He is a great man and is building houses in County Kerry for many years.  He tells me he will do his best to build one-bedroom accommodations and make them available for our local authority or voluntary housing agencies.  This is a reputable man who, thankfully, survived the bust and all that.  We want respectable builders, developers and people to create employment and turn ground into housing.  That is important.  The whole thing that we cannot be seen to talk to developers or builders is nonsense.</p></speech>

I started in building early and I am still in building.</p>  <p>  When I see the Housing for All plan for 2030, I reflect, as I told Government Deputies earlier, that the only reason they are trying to amend planning laws for one-off houses is that the electorate came and told them they had better not show their faces at the doors again.  That is why they listened, but they have not been listening for years.  I have been in discussions with Irish Water for the past 12 months or more.  Its representatives tell me that, in towns and villages in areas of Limerick, they will upgrade the existing system but not allow extra capacity.  Do not fool the people of Limerick.  We want extra capacity.</p>  <p>  I have planning permissions coming out my ears regarding Oola and they cannot get extra capacity.  They are told it will be upgraded but with no extra capacity.  Askeaton has been waiting for 33 years.  Irish Water has it since 2013 and still has not sorted the problem.  Now it says it will be by 2025, but with no extra capacity.</p>  <p>  I can build houses in Kilmallock or Croom.  When I come to Croom, 56 houses are being held up by a document that only Irish Water can sign to say there will be water there by 2023.  I have questioned its representatives in the housing committee.  They told me they will get back to me directly.  There is a meeting tomorrow.  They are holding up 56 houses for me to house people in County Limerick.  Housing for All is countryside, rural areas, towns and villages, not just cities or towns that have capacity.  All of County Limerick has to be supported and funded, not just where there is capacity.</p></speech>

I appreciate anyone who is doing their best.  However, too much emphasis is on what the private sector will provide in this plan.  Local authorities should be given funding to build more social houses.  We should build more rural cottages where applicants provide the sites.  We should give local authorities like Kerry money for homes to be sited in farms or other places so people do not leave the places they were born and reared in.</p>  <p>  A proper tenant purchase scheme, as touched on by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, needs to be put in place.  There is a stipulation that a house built since 2015 cannot be purchased.  This is out the window when we hear the Taoiseach saying he supports the ideal that everyone should own their own home.  That is not happening, even with local authorities.  The cap for a couple with three children is &euro;33,600.  People a small bit over the threshold are thrown off of that.</p>  <p>  On planning permission for one-off houses, we are having trouble in Kerry at present and I ask that it be looked into.  We need treatment plants for towns and villages that have been crying out for them for so long.  In Kenmare, you cannot get permission for a development but you can for a one-off house.  All development is stymied by the state of our treatment plants in our towns and villages.  Scartaglin and Curra have no treatment plan at all.  Scartaglin was number one at one stage when Tom Fleming and I were councillors.  Where is it now?  It is on no list at all.</p>  <p>  There has been much talk of the cost of rents.  The Government must consider doing something to reduce the percentage it takes from landlords paying 51% or 52% tax.  That has to be addressed.</p></speech>

The Government's housing strategy is not the fundamental and radical change needed.  The right to an affordable home with security of tenure is a basic human right which should be enshrined in the Constitution.  I believe many Deputies believe in that right but not many believe it should be enshrined in the Constitution.  To vindicate that right, we need a sufficient supply of affordable housing.  The reliance on the private sector, the dominance of developer-led planning and the abandonment of council house building by successive governments as a deliberate policy has been an abject failure.  These are the causes of the homelessness and housing crisis.</p>  <p>  The State has to play the key role.  The Government is not doing so.  There is already sufficient zoned State-owned land to fit at least 100,000 public housing units.  This should be the basis of an initial emergency five-year programme by the State in conjunction with local authorities.  It can take up to four years for a local authority to obtain planning permission to build.  There is a need for a State-owned housing agency to speed up the planning process for local authorities and build directly, employing workers and apprentices on trade union pay rates and conditions.  No public land should be given to private developers in exchange for a limited amount of public housing.</p>  <p>  I favour a mix of traditional council housing and the European cost rental model and welcome the fact the housing strategy includes cost rental as a legislative form of housing delivery.  However, in the Government's housing strategy there is not enough of it.  It was not a party in this D&aacute;il that came up with the idea of cost rental.  The first I heard of it was when Tom Healy from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, produced a report for the communities involved in the regeneration of St. Michael's Estate and they grabbed the concept and drove it through the planning application for St. Michael's.  It is all affordable and cost rental housing in that estate.  We are still waiting for it three years later, but that is where the concept first arose in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The cost rental model could achieve mixed tenure with well-designed, well-built, environmentally sustainable housing and an emphasis on community facilities.  Rents must be affordable with long-term security of tenure.  The differential rent system will apply to traditional council housing and cost rental accommodation.  It would cater for workers whose incomes are above the limits of council housing lists.  The only impediment is a lack of political will.</p> <p>The political will existed between the 1930s and 1960s when this country was broke but we built public housing.  This is the Government's opportunity and it has lost it again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="16:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900046#TT00200"><p>My time is brief so I will go straight into it.  I am not convinced this plan will deliver for renters.  Rents are out of control and many people end up paying more in rent than they would on a mortgage.  This means, of course, that they cannot even save for a mortgage because they are paying such high rents, and that is a really cruel trap in which to be caught.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that a majority of Berliners recently voted to buy out corporate landlords.  How often have we looked to Berlin for the best model of renting?  Yet they are experiencing the negative impacts associated with large corporate landlords owning many thousands of units and they want that to stop.  They recognise that state intervention is a balancing mechanism and helps to correct market failure.</p>  <p>  For this plan to be truly radical, as it must be, there needs to be more State intervention and State action, and I do not just mean legislation.  For example, Part V is good and welcome but is not operational soon enough.  The 20% must apply now, or at least a very speedy transitional arrangement to get to 20% needs to be put in place.  When I speak of State intervention, I am speaking about local authorities.  I listened to Deputy McGuinness and others who say local authorities must be a cornerstone of any plan for housing, and I fully agree.  They have to be given the resources and the responsibility and they have to be accountable for delivery.  The refurbishment of homes is a prime example.  Sometimes houses lie idle for months, even years, because there is no money to refurbish them, and the red tape at times is mind-boggling.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State knows and I know that the waiting lists for local authorities are a nightmare.  In my constituency, in Sligo it is 580, in Leitrim 502, in Roscommon 300 and in Donegal 2,681, and that does not include those on the housing assistance payment, HAP.  The Minister of State and I know that fewer and fewer landlords are taking HAP, and that will put greater pressure on the housing list.  We need to trust our councillors and our officials and we have to resource them.  It will not be perfect but it needs to be done.</p>  <p>  I will make a final point on rural housing.  Many Deputies have raised it.  The Minister of State and I know it is very important in maintaining sustainable communities and taking pressure off our cities.  Yes, we are told time and again that rural planning will be given, but many of us from rural constituencies see that being eroded year on year.  I am asking the Minister of State to be proactive on this issue because the truth is that, up to now, I do not see that.  I do not see it in Sligo and, most especially, I do not see it in Leitrim.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="16:17:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900046#TT00300"><p>As I begin my response, it is incredible to note that the Sinn F&eacute;in Party has 37 Deputies and not one of them has been here for almost an hour as we respond to one of the biggest challenges in our State.  That is very noticeable in the context of all the ideas we have from the various political parties and Independents.  It could not send one Deputy into this House to listen to the debate.</p>  <p>  Housing for All has huge ambition: 300,000 houses - 300,000 homes - right up to 2030.  The Government of which I have been a part since 2016 increased the number of social homes tenfold right up to 2019.  This plan aims to double that output again, 48% of which will be social and affordable homes.</p>  <p>  I was privileged in 2009 to be elected to Westmeath County Council, where I started my political career, at a time when our economy, our country and our society was gripped by a huge recession in which society was torn apart.  It was a very difficult time for all and a financial crisis.  Our country was spending 50% more than it was taking in in income.  Ghost estates were everywhere, all over our towns and villages, 3,000 with remedial schemes being brought up to try to resolve them.  Two thirds of our construction workers had left the country.  We were borrowing from the lenders of last resort.  My county, Westmeath, along with Dublin city, piloted the mortgage-to-rent scheme, and that showed just how difficult a space we were in.</p>  <p>  Yet, over that period, we have increased the housing budget by 400% to &euro;3.3 billion this year.  This builds on existing measures my party supported such as the Rebuilding Ireland home loan; the help-to-buy scheme, which gave ownership to more than 20,000 families in this State; the LDA legislation, which gave birth to an agency that will deliver mixed tenures that will assist all of society throughout our State; the affordable housing fund, which has come from the serviced sites fund; and the repair and lease programme, on which we have seen huge work done in counties such as Waterford that so many other local authorities can work with and learn from.</p>  <p>  The ask was very clear.  The ESRI said we could increase our deficit by &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion up to &euro;7 billion to deliver 33,000 units per annum into our society.  We have met that call as a Government: &euro;4 billion in multi-annual funding, &euro;2.4 billion per annum through our national development plan, &euro;1.6 billion through the Housing Finance Agency, and &euro;700 million through the LDA.  That is &euro;4 billion in multi-annual funding which gives certainty to the industry.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is bringing 10,000 apprenticeships into our economy each year, committing to the skill set that is so badly needed to build all the houses we require.</p>  <p>  As for our water and wastewater infrastructure, which many Deputies raised, I point to the &euro;4 billion right out to 2025 to unlock that infrastructure through Irish Water and our urban regeneration funding.  As for the potential we are looking at for our country and families who call into our clinics week in and week out in such vulnerable situations, I point to 10,000 social homes on average per annum, 4,000 affordable, 2,000 cost rental and 17,000 from the private sector.  That is 33,000 homes to fill that latent demand and the current demand that is so acute.  Schemes such as the affordable house purchase fund will give families who may not make it onto the social housing list a chance to get access to own their own homes.  We are targeting it through the 31 local authorities.  They have to give their plans by the end of the year through the housing needs and demands assessment, which will be targeted and will tell us the type of tenure we need and the places we need it.  We need that up-to-date information we have not had before.</p>  <p>  We have 213 actions driven by the Department of the Taoiseach.  I also lead the Towns First programme, which was referred to by many Deputies in the debate and in respect of which we expect to have proposals for Cabinet in November.  It is a matter of trying to unlock the potential of our towns and villages throughout this country to give them the opportunity to bring in more footfall and ensure there are more residential mixes to breathe life back into them.</p>  <p>  As for renters, we have extended the rent pressure zones, RPZs. right out to ensure rent increases are limited.  We have put in five separate pieces of legislation to enhance tenancy rights in the Thirty-third D&aacute;il.  Those will strengthen protections for those who are renting.</p>  <p>  Many referred to rural housing.  I would say to Deputy O'Donoghue that the rules have not changed.  Many Deputies come in here and say the rules have changed.  They absolutely have not.  What we need is a sustainable approach to rural housing.  We need to acknowledge and understand the demand in our localities and in our society and give people the opportunity to live in their home areas.  I am fully committed to updating the 2005 sustainable rural housing guidelines and I will bring in the political system as part of that because we all need to have a voice, unlike Sinn F&eacute;in, whose members will not attend this debate.</p>  <p>  As for our infrastructure, it is so important we unlock the gaps that are there because there are many.  As I travel around the country to the 31 local authorities, I see areas that are zoned and have the potential but the infrastructure is not there.</p>  <p>  I do not like saying this when Sinn F&eacute;in does not have a representative at this debate, but I have listened to many Deputies saying "if only we had been in government".  That is what I heard from Sinn F&eacute;in.  Their members say "if only Deputy &Oacute; Broin had been the housing Minister".  I take out its 2016 general election manifesto and read on page 45, "We will commit ... &euro;2.2 billion ... in capital spending ... [between 2016 and 2021] ... to ... [deliver] 36,500 ... [units]."</p> <p>That is what the party wanted to deliver if it got into power.  However, the previous Government - a year early, up to 2020 - delivered 39,000 homes.  It was a Government in which I, as a backbencher, played my role in voting for the measures it introduced.  It delivered a lot more than Sinn F&eacute;in said it would deliver in its 2016 manifesto.</p> <p> There is a second point I want to make about what is contained in that document.  The first paragraph on page 45 states, "We will ensure that all housing construction delivered by the State is designed in mixed tenure developments..."  If we look, however, at the Oscar Traynor Road development, a mixed-tenure project comprising 854 houses, we see that Sinn F&eacute;in did not support it.  The party also refused to back proposals for 1,200 houses in Ballymastone in Donabate, citing the mantra of "only public housing on public land".  However, a proposal for 18 public houses on public land at Kilbride Bridge in Wicklow was likewise voted down by Sinn F&eacute;in.  Deputies from that party have spoken here today about reading emails from vulnerable constituents, almost as though they have a monopoly on compassion and we do not understand what it is.  Yet, when we scrutinise the decisions of party members in local authorities up and down the country, we see one common thread in Sinn F&eacute;in's policy, which is to oppose, oppose, oppose.</p> <p> We on this side of the House are trying to make a difference.  We are moving might and main right across every strand of government.  This plan will be driven by the Department of the Taoiseach to ensure we can meet the demand for the housing provision that is so badly needed by our society.  Many measures have been talked about in this House, including, as referred to by Deputy Griffin, the help-to-buy scheme, in respect of which we can do much more to unlock development potential and give families the chance of home ownership.  I fully agree that such efforts must be supported.  I do not like calling out people, but it must be done when I hear voices condemning us for doing our very best.</p> <p> In regard to mixed-tenure provision, which will be key to delivery under the Land Development Agency, I want to emphasise that we must offer people sustainable options.  Where we can support them to achieve home ownership, the Government commits to do so.  In the case of cost-rental accommodation, it can offer people long-term, sustainable and secure tenancies that guarantee them a family home at 25% to 30% below the market rental price.  It is also about reforming our planning code, which is very important.  Many Deputies referenced the strategic housing development process and how we are bringing control back into local authorities and ensuring more decisions are made locally.  That is also very important.</p> <p> I thank all the Deputies who have drawn our attention to many valuable points.  I thank everyone who attended the debate and listened to what was said.  I assure them that I listened to the points they made.  The Government will do its very best to ensure every person in the State has access to a secure tenancy.  I know from my clinics every week, as do my party colleagues and colleagues in government in respect of their constituencies, that there are vulnerable people who need help.  We are working really hard to get solutions for them.</p></speech>

Although the gaze of the media has shifted somewhat since the middle of August when we were all shocked by the scenes of panic and chaos at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, there is no doubt that the crisis still continues.  It continues for Afghans displaced by conflict and violence, Afghan women and girls, those who depend on humanitarian aid or have simply run out of cash, Afghan human rights defenders, minorities and LGBTQI persons.</p>  <p>  This is a humanitarian and human rights crisis.  I welcome this debate which highlights the importance the House places on the situation in Afghanistan.  From the representations made to my office by many Deputies and the public, it is evident that people have been shocked and saddened by the events of recent weeks.  People are quite rightly demanding to know what Ireland has done to respond to this international crisis.  I will address this question from a consular perspective - how we have assisted Irish citizens and Irish-resident Afghan citizens during the crisis - and from the perspective of Ireland's engagement in the international political and humanitarian reaction to the evolving situation.</p>  <p>  Of course, our first concern as the crisis unfolded was to provide assistance to Irish citizens in Afghanistan who wished to leave the country.  My Department and the Irish Embassy in Abu Dhabi worked tirelessly through August and into September to that end.  This work continues, including with an additional 11 citizens and dependents evacuated last week on a Qatar plane.</p>  <p>  The rapid evacuation effort at the airport in Kabul before the end of August was one of the most complex operations of its kind ever managed by the international community.  I deployed an emergency civil assistance team, ECAT, to Kabul to support the consular efforts of staff in Dublin and in the embassy in Abu Dhabi.  That team, which comprised consular staff from the Department and members of the Defence Forces, was an example of the close partnerships between the two Departments I lead.</p>  <p>  The impact of both geopolitical turmoil and climate change will almost inevitably lead to more situations of rapid onset crisis and there is no doubt that we will be required to assist Irish citizens in increasingly complex and insecure environments in the future.  The crisis in Afghanistan saw the first deployment of a joint ECAT since the crisis in Libya in 2011.  Both Departments and the Defence Forces have gleaned valuable lessons from that successful deployment which we will use to further improve and enhance readiness and interoperability to manage crisis situations in the future.  I wish to sincerely thank the members of the ECAT, diplomatic and military, for their efforts in such a challenging and complex environment, as well as all those who have supported the overall consular response, which has been significant.  I also wish to thank our international partners, particularly France, Finland, the UK and Germany, for their assistance in our efforts and helping our citizens.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, a number of Irish citizens and residents remain in Afghanistan and wish to return home.  We continue to liaise with partners, including EU partners, regarding safe exit options in the period ahead.  To date, 58 citizens and their dependents and family members have safely left Afghanistan.  A total of 50 Irish citizens and their direct family members remain in Afghanistan and require ongoing support.  Of those 50 citizens, 48 have requested to leave.  Additionally, there are a number of Afghan citizens with Irish residency who wish to return to Ireland and my Department is also providing support to them.  I know there are many people with deep concerns for family members, friends and colleagues who remain in Afghanistan.  I can give full assurance that the Government remains strongly committed to assisting those requiring ongoing consular support in Afghanistan.</p>  <p>  As the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will set out in more detail, in excess of 370 Afghan citizens have been offered support through the Irish refugee protection programme.  More than 150 people have already arrived in Ireland.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is leading on the arrangements for them once they arrive.  Priority for refugee status has been given to those working on human rights issues, as well as those working with independent media, NGOs and European and international organisations.  These are people who have been dedicated to improving and safeguarding the lives of others.  They are very welcome here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I have been heartened by the many offers of support from the public to those arriving through this programme.  Some people have offered space in their own homes.  My Department and our diplomatic network are continuing to engage with those accepted into the refugee programme and their families who have not yet reached Ireland.  We are liaising with relevant authorities, airlines and individuals, in particular regarding travel routes.  In addition, the Department of Justice is reviewing all international protection applications from Afghan nationals, including family reunification visas, with a view to expediting their progress.  This is in line with updated advice provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, in recent weeks.  Furthermore, I am very pleased that a new humanitarian admission programme was agreed at Cabinet this week, namely, the Afghan admission programme.  This is a further concrete demonstration of Ireland's support for and solidarity with the Afghan people.</p> <p>The programme will allow current or former Afghan nationals living in Ireland to apply to bring their close family members to Ireland to live with them.  Applications will open in December, the Department of Justice will administer the new scheme and up to 500 places will be provided.  Priority on the programme will be given to those who are especially vulnerable in terms of the risk to their freedom and safety, such as older people, children, single female parents, single women and girls and people with disabilities.  People whose previous employment exposes them to greater risk, for example, UN and EU employees and people who worked for civil society organisations, will also be included in this priority group.<br/><br/>I would like to put on record my appreciation for the excellent co-operation and flexibility that I and my Department have witnessed in recent weeks from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Justice in responding to the situation in Afghanistan.  This collaboration has enabled us to directly assist several hundred people.  It is no exaggeration to say that this co-operation has saved lives.  I suspect, as the months pass, that well over 1,000 people will be assisted.<br/><br/>It has been both a great responsibility and a great privilege to hold the Presidency of the United Nations Security Council this month, as the international community, faced with recent events, decides how best to manage this crisis.  I chaired the Security Council meeting on the situation in Afghanistan on 9 September at the UN.  The meeting led, the following week, to the unanimous decision by the Security Council to renew the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, for six months.  The adoption of Resolution 2596 by all Security Council members demonstrated firm support for the vital work of that mission.  The fact that the resolution was adopted unanimously sends a strong message about our collective support for UNAMA's mandate of peace, equality and inclusivity for all Afghans.  It also sends a clear message to the Taliban that the Security Council is united on a number of key principles.  The resolution sets out a basis for the Security Council's engagement on Afghanistan over the next six months.  It emphasises the importance of the establishment of an inclusive and representative government, including with the full, equal and meaningful participation of women.  It underscores the need to uphold human rights, including for women, children and minorities, and the need for full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access for humanitarian agencies.  Meetings on Afghanistan will take place every second month, rather than every quarter as was previously the case.  This will allow us to monitor what is happening on the ground and ultimately to decide what the next steps will be in terms of future UN engagement in the country.<br/><br/>In the statement that I made to the Security Council on 9 September, I highlighted a number of other issues, including the importance of the new administration adhering to Afghanistan's obligations under international law, including international humanitarian, refugee and human rights law.  Of course, the Security Council's heightened engagement on Afghanistan did not start with the debate on 9 September.  Ireland pushed for immediate and focused engagement throughout August.  We also played a central role in the negotiations on Resolution 2593, adopted on 30 August.<br/><br/>During my visits to New York this month, I had detailed discussions on Afghanistan with the UN Secretary General; the UN's emergency humanitarian co-ordinator, Martin Griffiths; and the UN Under-Secretary General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Rosemary di Carlo.  All encouraged Ireland to continue to speak out on fundamental human rights and humanitarian issues in Afghanistan, particularly the rights of women and girls.  They also urged Ireland, as President of the Security Council, to ensure coherence and unity among Security Council members on Afghanistan.  We have worked extremely hard to deliver on that agenda.<br/><br/>I also discussed Afghanistan in a number of bilateral meetings in New York, notably with the Pakistani and Russian foreign ministers.  Close engagement with countries of the region, particularly those, like Pakistan, that have a level of influence over the Taliban, will be crucial in the coming months, as will all of their neighbours, in fact.  With my EU colleagues, we have also had extensive discussions on Afghanistan, as Members would expect.  The EU is committed to supporting the people of Afghanistan.  Their needs were significant even before the events of the last six weeks.  One of the key themes of discussion at EU level has been how to continue addressing these needs.  We are keen to re-establish an EU presence on the ground, once it is safe to do so, to focus on providing humanitarian support to the Afghan people.  Believe me, that humanitarian support is an enormous challenge.  Even before the Taliban took over, the value of humanitarian supports going into Afghanistan each year was between $5 billion and $6 billion.  Members can imagine how difficult it is to get that volume and value of humanitarian supports in under the current circumstances, or even a fraction of it.  In particular, we have agreed a set of five key benchmarks to guide future EU engagement in Afghanistan, which set out the context in which we should engage with the de facto administration there.  Those benchmarks are to allow the safe, secure and orderly departure of all foreign nationals and Afghans who wish to leave; to promote, protect and respect human rights, in particular those of women and girls and minorities, while respecting the rule of law and freedom of speech and of the media; to allow the implementation of humanitarian operations and respect the independence of humanitarian operations and safety of beneficiaries of humanitarian aid; to prevent Afghanistan serving as a base for terrorism to other countries in the future, as it did in the past; and to establish a negotiated, inclusive and representative government, which includes all ethnic and religious minorities and ensures the meaningful participation of women.<br/><br/>The Taliban reassures us that they are a different organisation from the one ousted from office in 2001.  They have sought to portray themselves as more modern and more moderate.  They have said that they want peace and prosperity for their country and they want to engage with the international community.  However, as Ireland has said consistently since their takeover inAugust, our attention is focused not on what the acting administration says, but what it does.Perhaps it is trite to say that actions speak louder than words.  However, some actions are so loud as to be deafening.  Actions such as the closure of the women's affairs ministry and its conversion to the ministry for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice; the arrest, summary execution and disappearance of civil servants, journalists and civil society activists, as reported by reliable sources; and the appointment of a largely homogenous, all-male administration drown out any positive messages that the de facto authorities may want the international community to hear.  The links between the acting Taliban administration and terrorism give rise to particular concern.  It is of note that a number of those appointed to the Taliban cabinet are on UN and EU sanctions lists.  A particular focus of the EU will be to ensure the Taliban regime ceases all ties and practices with international terrorism.<br/><br/>I have mentioned already my concerns about human rights and, in particular, the situation of women and girls, as well as minorities, in Afghanistan.  It is unacceptable that women are denied their most basic rights.  The voices of activists such as Malala Yousafzai and Wazhma Frogh, who addressed the Security Council meeting that I chaired in New York, and human rights defenders such as Hassan Ali Faiz, who addressed the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence yesterday, need to be listened to and heeded.  Many are risking their lives and the lives of their families to speak out and make known their expectations to participate in the future of their country.  With our fellow EU member states, we will continue to listen to and amplify their messages and promote their right to participate in the political future of their own country.<br/><br/>Sadly, not all Afghans will feel that they can remain in their country following the events of recent weeks.  This is why one of the EU benchmarks is that the administration will allow those who wish to leave to do so.  The EU will work with international partners on durable solutions for Afghan refugees.  We will also look to address the needs of communities in countries where large numbers of these refugees are hosted.<br/><br/>As I said at the outset, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has reached a full-blown crisis.  It is a country of 38 million people.  There are already approximately 5 million internally displaced people in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of refugees have already crossed the borders into Pakistan, Iran and other neighbouring countries.  Almost half the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, and one in three Afghans is food insecure.  The Afghan Government previously relied on the support of the international community for the majority of its budget, but many of Afghanistan's traditional donors have frozen development aid until the situation stabilises.</p> <p> The Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid and the diaspora, Deputy Colm Brophy, will now provide further details on the humanitarian situation and how we are responding to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1573" speakername="Colm Brophy" time="16:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900050#CCC00200"><p>I am thankful for the opportunity to have this important debate on the extremely worrying situation in Afghanistan.  The current crisis comes against a background of 40 years of conflict, recurrent natural disasters, chronic poverty, drought and the Covid-19 pandemic.  The people of Afghanistan have borne many hardships and are now experiencing new suffering, with the most vulnerable, particularly women and girls, most at risk.</p><p>Even prior to the events of 15 August, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan was one of the worst in the world.  One in three Afghans was facing food insecurity at an emergency level.  Half of all children under the age of five were suffering from malnutrition.  The UN said this morning that almost half of Afghanistan's population, of 40 million, need humanitarian assistance and protection.  This is likely to get worse in the near term.  The latest reports from aid agencies on the ground indicate there are now 5.5 million people internally displaced and an additional 15 million Afghans at risk.  Within these groups, women and girls are particularly vulnerable.  International financing to Afghanistan has been suspended.  Development funding has been severely reduced given the changes in government and governance now under way.  However, this is happening at a moment when the country's economy and public services are under severe strain, with risks to the delivery of basic services, such as health services and education.</p><p>The UN's emergency relief co-ordinator, Mr. Martin Griffiths, recently visited Afghanistan to assess the situation and engage with the new acting administration.  I spoke to him on his return.  In our conversation, he highlighted the extremely challenging operating environments.  He said that in the meeting with the acting Taliban authorities, he stressed the need for humanitarian access and principled humanitarian assistance.  He also raised the issues of women's and girls' rights and their protection.  These are top priorities for Ireland that we have highlighted in our interventions on Afghanistan at the Security Council, as the Minister has highlighted.  In our discussion, Mr. Griffiths and I agreed on the importance of a particular focus on women and girls in the UN humanitarian response over the months ahead.  We also discussed how the international community's humanitarian response was, in a sense, a litmus test for engagement between the acting Taliban authority and the international community.  </p><p>Despite many operational challenges, the humanitarian community is on the ground and delivering much needed aid to millions of people.  I thank those aid workers who stayed in Afghanistan to deliver under these most difficult circumstances.  Their vital work reminds me of humanitarians in other places who are working in circumstances of conflict and at personal risk to ensure that aid reaches those who are most vulnerable.  That is why respect for international humanitarian law is imperative.  International humanitarian law helps to protect those who go only to serve.  Our humanitarians, more than deserving of our thanks, deserve this respect, this protection.</p><p>Through the work of dedicated people, agencies are now scaling up operations across Afghanistan.  This is allowing the delivery of community-based education initiatives, food assistance, emergency water supplies, treatment for acute malnutrition and psychosocial support services.  Schools are reopening and vaccinations are starting.  Airlifts of essential supplies have resumed.  It is an extremely complex operation, but it is delivering results on the ground.</p><p>Significant challenges remain, however.  Critical shortages of medicines and medical supplies are being reported across the country and are attributable to the absence of government funds.  The salaries of healthcare workers and teachers have not been paid, in some cases for many months.  The provision of humanitarian assistance is, in many cases, the only lifeline available for millions of Afghan people.</p><p>Additional funding is urgently required for humanitarian agencies to continue their vital work.  The UN launched an urgent appeal for Afghanistan at the high-level ministerial meeting on 13 September.  It asks for &euro;515 million to provide assistance to 11 million of the most vulnerable Afghans to the end of the year.  The UN has urged donors to fast-track funding and ensure that funding is flexible so that partners can adjust to the fast-changing conditions on the ground.  At the high-level ministerial meeting, I confirmed Ireland's intention to do just that.  I announced that, in addition to &euro;2 million in Irish Aid funding already provided for Afghanistan in 2021, I had authorised a further and immediate grant of &euro;1 million to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, in August.  This enabled an urgent response to the needs of the people displaced by the changes in Kabul, both in Afghanistan and in neighbouring countries.</p><p>Yesterday I was able to announce a further &euro;2 million in Irish Aid funding to support the vital work of UNICEF and the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund addressing the humanitarian needs to the end of the year.</p><p>UNICEF has a presence in 13 offices right across the country and is in the process of further scaling up operations.  Owing to its field presence, mandate and existing network, UNICEF is uniquely positioned to respond to the urgent needs in the areas of education, nutrition and water and sanitation.  Its expertise in targeting women and girls is critical in the context of Afghanistan.  Community-based education initiatives, for example, comprise one way of continuing girls' education.</p><p>The Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, managed by the <font color="#2F2F2F">United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs,</font>OCHA, from its office in Kabul, is a pooled fund that enables swift and principled action in response to humanitarian priorities throughout the country.  Its field presence means it is able to identify experienced humanitarian partners who can access remote and hard-to-reach locations.  Approximately 80% of its funding is allocated to NGOs, both international and national.</p><p>The Irish Aid response reflects Ireland's long-standing commitment to the people of Afghanistan, working with partners such as Concern Worldwide and HALO Trust over many years.  My officials are in ongoing dialogue with our NGO partners on their plans for continued engagement in Afghanistan and to help ensure the well-being of their staff there.  In addition to direct funding, Irish Aid core funding to key humanitarian partners such as UNHCR, UNICEF and the Red Cross Family, as well as global funds such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, is essential.  This core funding has allowed our partners to react quickly to emerging needs.  Only last week, for example, the UN Central Emergency Response Fund allocated &euro;38.25 million to support the delivery of basic health services in Afghanistan.  Ireland is proud to have been the tenth largest donor to the fund in 2021.</p><p>Our financial support to respond to urgent humanitarian needs in Afghanistan goes hand in hand with our strong engagement and advocacy at the UN Security Council and the EU.</p><p>During our Presidency of the UN Security Council this month, and, indeed, for the duration of our term on the UN Security Council, Afghanistan has been a priority for Ireland.  We use our membership of the UN Security Council to advocate for a principled humanitarian response in Afghanistan.  We also use our membership to advocate for safe, rapid and unimpeded access for all humanitarian workers &mdash; both male and female &mdash; so they can deliver aid to civilians wherever it is needed.  The role of women in the delivery of aid in Afghanistan is critical.  If women aid workers cannot operate, there is a real risk that the response will not reach the most vulnerable women and girls with critical supplies and services.</p><p>The renewal of the <font color="#2F2F2F">United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan,</font>UNAMA, mandate will play a crucial role in facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid and monitoring any potential abuses.  This will be an important test of the Taliban's commitment to allowing full, unfettered humanitarian access, and it is our responsibility to ensure there is no impunity.  The international community must speak with one voice on this most critical issue.</p><p>Ireland has engaged strongly with the EU.  Discussions on Afghanistan have dominated recent meetings of the Working Party on Humanitarian Aid and Food Aid, COHAFA.  We supported the development of the European Council conclusions on Afghanistan, which call for full and safe humanitarian access to respond to the urgent needs of all Afghans, including families forced to flee their homes.</p><p>At EU level, we have developed key asks to all parties for the delivery of humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan.  These include asks on the need for the independent needs assessments that include marginalised populations; impartial and independent humanitarian activities; and safe and unimpeded access for all aid workers &mdash; regardless of gender, nationality, religion or ethnicity.  These will be critical to ensure we will be able to deliver well-targeted humanitarian assistance that is based on needs, and needs alone.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the EU announced an additional &euro;200 million in additional humanitarian support to Afghanistan and it is engaged with member states, including Ireland, in the development of a longer-term, Team Europe, response.</p> <p> The situation of women and girls in Afghanistan merits particular attention. There is a deep concern that there will be a backsliding of gains made in the past two decades for women and girls and, indeed, some of that is obvious already.  There are reports of women and girls being denied access to education, further reports this morning of women having been denied access to university, of restrictions on their movement, and reports of violence and violations are becoming all too common.  We must put gender and the needs of women and girls at the heart of the humanitarian response in Afghanistan.  Never has this been so important.</p> <p> At that same time Ireland will continue to use its membership of the UN Security Council to consistently call for the protection and promotion of human rights, especially for women and girls.</p> <p> Finally, we all know that there is no humanitarian solution to a humanitarian crisis.  While we have a moral imperative to save lives and livelihoods, reducing humanitarian need over the long term will only be achieved through lasting peace for all the people of Afghanistan.  Ireland will remain a strong voice on the UN Security Council advocating for an inclusive, sustainable, political settlement with full, equal and meaningful participation of women and inclusion of minorities and youth.</p> <p> We also remain steadfastly committed to standing by the Afghan people in their hour of unprecedented humanitarian need.  We can be rightly proud of Ireland's support to the Afghan men, women, and children most impacted by this devastating crisis.  The House can be assured that my Department, through Irish Aid, will continue to monitor the evolving humanitarian situation on the ground and respond appropriately.</p></speech>

There are many Afghans in Ireland who have been here for many years and who are very concerned about their family members and others whom they know in that country and how they can manage through this situation.  </p>  <p>  I also pay tribute to the great number of human rights activists and workers on the ground who have done such great work over the past number of years, in particular since this crisis emerged.  I especially welcome the introduction of the Afghan admission programme announced by the Department of Justice yesterday allowing an additional 500 people to resettle in Ireland.  Indeed, at the time that the crisis unfolded a number of weeks ago, I joined the calls of many others asking for a proportionate approach to be taken to the resettlement campaign.  It is good that the Department has heeded those calls.  Indeed, everything should be done to provide flexibility for people trying to leave Afghanistan because before the Taliban took over, it was difficult for many people get travel documents, passports, etc. to leave.  It is even worse now as we are hearing reports now of people having passports and travel documents confiscated and they cannot leave because of that.  An element of flexibility is needed in respect of all of this.</p>  <p>  I also pay tribute to the tireless work of the emergency consular aid team, ECAT, that was sent to Afghanistan by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We heard of the relentless efforts of that team to locate and provide safe passage for Irish passport and visa holders across the airways since the Taliban took over, sometimes at significant risk to themselves. </p>  <p>  While I understand that the mess in Afghanistan is certainly not of Ireland&rsquo;s making, it is probably an issue where we can look more to NATO, the US and other big players on the world stage as to how we got into this situation.  At the same time, our seat on the UN Security Council gives us the ability to influence how the situation can be dealt with as it progresses.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the international community has an opportunity to offer aid to Afghanistan conditional upon reform and the upholding of human rights for all of the citizens, and in particular, for women and minorities.  We have all heard about the Taliban carrying out door-to-door searches to identify anyone who poses a threat to their Islamic emirate.  Women are, once again, being targeted by them.  Before the takeover, one third of the government employees in Kabul were women.  We now have testimonies of women being ordered not to return to work, with the exception of women who cannot be replaced by men.  Despite the initial promises to be tolerant and inclusive, restrictions have also been introduced on girls attending school.  The ministry of women's affairs has been replaced by the ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice, which is tasked with enforcing Islamic law.</p>  <p>   Protests against the Taliban&rsquo;s rollback on social progress have been quashed by Taliban forces.  Members of the LGBTQI community live in fear of their lives, many of whom are going into hiding or changing their locations for fear of being denounced by their neighbours or even by their own families.       </p>  <p>  There is a significant issue with the supply of drugs and we need to bear this in mind.  There was a recent seizure in India of almost three tonnes of heroin worth &euro;2.72 billion from Afghanistan.  Indeed heroin production has been a major source of funding for the Taliban&rsquo;s campaign since before its return to power and will continue to be so.  Afghanistan already supplies between 80% to 90% of the world&rsquo;s heroin.  This situation will worsen as economic conditions in Afghanistan deteriorate.  If the international community cannot stabilise Afghanistan, that supply is only going to increase and cause more problems in other parts of the world so this is a completely urgent situation.  </p>  <p>  When we talk about Afghanistan, much of the discussion is on terrorism and foreign-policy sanctions but we at times forget the people who are left behind and who cannot leave as they are trapped there.  Afghanistan is on the brink of an economic meltdown with much of the social infrastructure built up over the past 20 years at the point of collapse.  Basic services such as healthcare and education are faltering because teachers and medics are not being paid.  For 20 years the economy was run by grants and aid to the tune of $20 trillion, which has effectively been switched off overnight.  Coupled with the withdrawal of aid and basic services, everything is quickly breaking down. </p>  <p>   We must recognise and understand that the occupation of Afghanistan for 20 years was a dismal failure.  Little of the &euro;20 trillion spent every day in Afghanistan was seen to help or assist the ordinary people of this country.  We see that reflected in the ease with which the Taliban were able to take over.  Had that money been spent to build an inclusive society and build civic leadership within that society, we would be in a different situation.  It simply was not.  The emphasis was on security and on counterinsurgency measures.  Those counter-insurgency measures have, in the long term, been a complete failure because they do not provide for people and only provide for the egos of those in NATO and other organisations who set out with a particular agenda.  That is the problem and is why we are in this particular situation.</p>  <p>  People are now facing a serious drought and food shortages throughout Afghanistan.  This will also lead to further serious, civil unrest and possibly even famine and we also have to be prepared for that.  Currently, 2 million children are suffering from malnutrition and 7.3 million people are affected by drought.  Afghanistan needs food, water, dams and infrastructure but, above all else, it needs external aid.  We believe that any interaction to provide aid into that country can only be brokered on the condition of reform and we have to work to ensure that happens.  That is not to say it will be easy.  It will be a long and complex process but it is vital that the people of Afghanistan are not abandoned by the international community and I implore the Minister of State to consider what can be done, and in particular, to use our place on the UN Security Council to ensure that we can make certain that the ordinary people of Afghanistan get fair play out of all of this and are looked after because they have not been looked after to date.</p></speech>

It won its full independence from Britain in the same period as the Twenty-six Counties of the Irish Free State gained independence from the same colonial power.  Since that civil war, the occupation by the Soviet Union in 1979 and by the US in 2001 has seen that country in conflict for most of that time and certainly for the past 40 years.</p>  <p>  According to Brown University, approximately 241,000 people have been killed in the Afghanistan and Pakistan war zone since the US invasion in 2001.  Some 71,000 of those killed have been civilians.  For the past 20 years the economy of Afghanistan was run by grants and aid and $20 trillion has been spent by the US since its invasion in 2001.  This is a significant amount but since the US withdrawal, the Afghan economy has begun collapsing and inflation is rising.  </p>  <p>  Hunger and drought rather than conflict pose the gravest danger to ordinary Afghans.  Drought is affecting 7.3 million Afghans and more than 2 million children are suffering from malnutrition.  What Afghans need most now is water, food and investment in their infrastructure to support themselves.</p> <p>To date, however, the evidence seems to suggest the Taliban is intent on returning to governing as it did in the past.  Therefore, aid must be conditional on reform and on the Taliban respecting international law and protecting all human rights.  The people of Afghanistan desire peace and freedom from violence and the international community cannot allow the rights of Afghan women and children to be lost or rolled back as before under the Taliban.  Prior to the takeover, one third of government employees in Kabul were women.  Women workers were ordered home by the Taliban, with the only exception being those who could not be replaced by men.  This is despite an initial promise to be tolerant and inclusive, and restrictions are also being reintroduced on the participation of girls in secondary school.  The women's affairs ministry has been replaced with a ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice.</p> <p> Protests against the Taliban's rollback have been quashed with force.  Members of the LGTBQI community live in fear of their lives.  Many of them have gone into hiding or changed location for fear of being denounced by neighbours or family.  There are reports of armed raids to arrest individuals, with families being threatened with punishment if they do not reveal their whereabouts.  There is growing alarm over the freedom of the country's media, with reports of threats, detention and violent attacks on journalists.  Diplomatic pressure needs to be applied by the international community to stop these regressive steps.</p> <p> I welcome the fact the mandate of the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan was renewed with unanimous approval on 17 September under Ireland's Presidency of the Security Council.  The world community cannot abandon the Afghan people.  The Government has a role critical role in ensuring the UN does everything in its power to provide urgently required humanitarian aid and to offer protection of refugees and civilians, now and in the time ahead.  Ireland needs to use its position at the UN to be a voice for reason, keeping a focus on the long-term goals of peace and social equality.</p> <p> I welcome the 500 additional places for Afghan family members but this needs to be expanded and Ireland needs to do more.  Certainly, the EU and the broader international community need to step up and do more.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes the international community has an opportunity to offer aid to Afghanistan, conditional on reform and the upholding of human rights for all citizens, particularly women and minorities.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that the people are very welcome and I wholeheartedly agree.  They will add a great deal to Irish society and culture and will be a welcome addition.  Following on from Deputy Martin Kenny's comments on that figure of 500, it is important it not be stuck to and adhered to rigidly.  We have to be flexible and open to changes.  I have no doubt the Minister believes the same and I would like to hear a commitment from him in that regard.</p>  <p>  The Afghan people have known nothing but war and occupation since the 1970s and it appears painfully clear the US never learned from the mistakes of previous wars.  Since invading Afghanistan in 2001, the US has spent &euro;2.3 trillion on the war, much of which was siphoned away by rampant institutionalised corruption.  The US pursued a policy that prioritised spending on tanks, guns and bombers, rather than focusing on advancing and improving the lives of ordinary Afghans, both rural and urban.  For all the trillions of euro spent, Afghanistan still has one of the smallest formal economies on the planet.  Today, 10 million children are in need of emergency assistance, with many of them suffering from severe malnutrition.  Countries can be occupied by sheer brute military force, but that alone cannot create the new progressive nation so many Afghans have dreamed of.  Sadly, for the moment, that hope has been lost.  </p>  <p>  Senator Higgins recently organised a briefing on events in Afghanistan and the accounts from some of the contributors were harrowing.  US and NATO war crimes in the region, and a lack of accountability for those who carried out these crimes, played into the hands of the extremist Taliban and kept much of the rural population cautious about US and NATO forces.  Many of these war crimes only became public knowledge to us in the West thanks to the likes of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, people who risked everything to shine a light on the dark, shadowy actions of the US Government.  Julian Assange has been incarcerated in Belmarsh Prison in London since 2019, even though his sentence has long been served.  The UN special rapporteur on torture examined Mr. Assange in prison and concluded that he showed all the symptoms typical of prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma.  The question must be asked as to how long it will be before Ireland and the EU speak out and say enough is enough and demand that Julian Assange be freed.</p>  <p>  This State's co-operation in respect of war in Iraq and Afghanistan has cast a dark shadow over our proud legacy of peacekeeping.  Since the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, more than 10,000 military and military-contracted aircraft have passed through Shannon Airport, carrying some 3 million US soldiers and an untold number of weapons.  Indeed, according to research, the airport has been used on a number of occasions by the US Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, during extraordinary rendition to carry prisoners to CIA black sites for advanced interrogation - more commonly known as torture.  As Eduardo Galeano put it, every time the US "saves" a country, it converts it into either a madhouse or a cemetery.  Time and again, these words have proven true.</p>  <p>  I compliment the Minister's office and Irish Aid for the commitment of these agencies and the delivery of overseas aid.  The circumstances in which they work is difficult and challenging and it is important to acknowledge the contribution they have made to both Ireland and these deeply challenged communities throughout the world.</p></speech>

That is to be commended and acknowledged, as my party colleagues have done.</p>  <p>  I cannot even begin to imagine the experience of women and girls in Afghanistan over the past month.  My thoughts are with those who have lost loved ones or fled their homes or who feel they are no longer safe and have no hope.  The US, Britain, NATO, the UN and the EU have all failed the people of Afghanistan, but in particular the women and children.  They have failed future generations who will now be born into an unequal, segregated, fear-filled, oppressive society.  Ireland, given its role on the UN Security Council, needs to work to undo this harm and extend a hand of peace and support to the men and women, boys and girls, in Afghanistan, who have now had 43 sleepless nights since the Taliban took over.</p>  <p>  My wife is a secondary school teacher and we have two daughters.  When they were younger and we talked at home as a family, we would talk about their dreams and ambitions and what they wanted to do when they grew up.  I would always smile when they talked about being scientists or artists.  They play sports and love camogie.  My heart goes out to the mothers and fathers in Afghanistan now who look at their children and think of their futures, because their daughters will not have the same future.  They might never have had the same future my daughters had, but they certainly had the possibility of a much better one than they do now.  There are parents now who in July were listening to the same stories from their daughters, who wanted to be vets, doctors, nurses or teachers.  Those girls have had their dreams ripped away from them, practically overnight.</p>  <p>  We need to send a clear message, to my daughters, to the Minister's daughters and to the daughters in Afghanistan, that this is not right or acceptable.  We need to work together, through the UN Security Council and the EU, to let those girls know that they have a future, that we will help in every way we can and not forget them, and that we will ensure there are pathways through European and UN states to give them a chance in the future.</p> <p>We must ensure that there are places for these girls in our colleges, universities, internships and positions, and in our society in the future.  We cannot lose their potential.  This is the bare minimum we can offer them.  As the saying goes, "Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;" - if we support the young people, they will prosper.  I want every girl, woman and everyone in Afghanistan who has suffered so dreadfully in the past month and over decades to know that people are thinking of them tonight.  People are planning, hoping and working.  I hope these statements will send the message, no matter how small, that people in Ireland and in this Chamber are thinking of them and their human rights.</p> <p> We will support the Minister and the Government in everything they can do to support the people of Afghanistan.  It is morally right and, for a country with a history like Ireland's, the Irish people would want us to do it.</p></speech>

We were aware of the type of regime the Taliban implemented 20 years ago, when it was last in power in Afghanistan, with the oppression of women, the exclusion of girls and women from education, employment and public life itself and the brutal implementation of a variety of Sharia law, including amputations and death by stoning.  The world cannot be blind or indifferent to that type of regime being established yet again and to half of the population of a nation being literally removed and obliterated from society.</p>  <p>  There are a number of different, but urgent, issues that we, as a small country, can address.  The World Food Programme warned last week that only 5% of the people of Afghanistan had enough food to eat.  The ongoing drought, soaring prices and economic collapse are together building a humanitarian disaster.  Our first task is to work to ensure that the world, acting together, provides sufficient food for the Afghan people to survive the coming winter and provides shelter for the millions of displaced people in Afghanistan to be able to endure the coming harsh weather.  I listened to colleagues say that our support has to be conditional on change.  I understand that.  It is a major moral dilemma for us.  However, I do not believe we have any choice but to provide, in these days, weeks and months, whatever is needed to the people of Afghanistan to allow them to live.  We can certainly deal with the Taliban authorities, refuse to recognise them and even hold off releasing their international funds, but we must get food, shelter and relief to the people immediately.</p>  <p>  Our second task is to address and support the millions of Afghans who are refugees in neighbouring countries, notably in Pakistan and Iran.  These are people who fled for their lives, bringing virtually nothing with them.  There are up to 3 million refugees in Iran.  They fear being returned because the Iranian authorities say they will return them.  Conditions in Pakistan are precarious too.  The inflation rate there is 9% and there is huge pressure on existing natural resources.  Pakistan has had 1.5 million Afghan refugees for decades and hundreds of thousands more have arrived in recent weeks.  It cannot be expected to be able to carry that burden without significant aid.</p>  <p>  Third, what can Ireland do immediately?  Yesterday, as other Members have acknowledged, it was announced that up to 500 Afghans are to be given temporary residency rights in the State.  A special admission programme for family members of the 1,200 Afghans living in the State will allow up to 500 to come here.  I listened carefully to the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, on the radio yesterday.  The families here would be required to house and maintain them.  There are also limits on the number per family to be allowed in.  The impossible task of selecting which of their family members in peril, sometimes in peril of their lives, can come is to be left to the Afghan families residing here.  Of course, since they have to be maintained and housed by them, it is also, in essence, a means-tested scheme.  We have to think again about that.  We cannot ask people to carry that burden.</p>  <p>  There is much more that must be said about these matters, but I want to give time to my colleague.  However, I hope the Government will discuss that particular programme with the Opposition and think again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="17:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900053#FFF00300"><p>I thank the Government for allowing these statements tonight and allocating a good amount of time for them.  That is important.  I first made the request for the statements some weeks ago, when the airlifts and chaos were happening.  I am glad the statements are taking place now because we have had a couple of weeks of the Taliban being in control and seeing what the Minister called the backsliding happening already and how it is impacting the people of Afghanistan.  We have heard in the contributions about the impact that this intolerable medieval regime is having right now and will have in the future.  We know it because it has been in power previously.  I will return to that.</p>  <p>  I have a short amount of time and I wish to focus on two matters.  With our role on the UN Security Council, and I am delighted that we are on the Security Council, I ask that the Minister and Ireland speak strongly about the role of private security companies in conflict zones and in peacebuilding.  They play a vexatious role.  If the Iraq War was the gold rush boom for the private security companies, Afghanistan was their pension pot.  It was a nearly 20-year war and conflict zone in which private security companies absolutely coined it, not just in battle but also in training and in the provision of everything, including food, supplies and education.  This was a privatised war and a privatised peacebuilding effort that ultimately failed.  A retired Irish Army colonel, Ray Lane, on "Today with Claire Byrne" a month ago spoke about his experience there.  I am 99% sure it was him and I apologise if it was not.  He cited the role of private security companies and their failure in any efforts to peacebuild effectively.  How can one win the hearts and minds of a nation when one goes in and then outsources the very job one went there to do?  I refer, of course, to the United States and its active allies in this.  That is a major global question, and we are well placed, given our history of neutrality and our history in the United Nations, to lead on the role of private security companies and how they operate throughout the world.  What they have done in Afghanistan is absolutely abhorrent and has led to where we are today.</p>  <p>  I welcome the announcement yesterday regarding the 500 Afghans.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has entered the Chamber.  I know him and I am aware of his work.  I know what he achieving and trying to achieve in that regard.  I am glad he is in his current position because I know we will welcome as many as we can.  Nonetheless, it is still a drop in the ocean.  However, if we can welcome, house and make safe those we can, that is the least we could do.</p>  <p>  We are talking about the impact on girls and women.  If people want specifics about the barbarity that is ongoing, I ask them to read the article on the BBC website by Elaine Jung and Hafizullah Maroof entitled "Giving Birth under the Taliban".</p> <p>It is an horrific and frightening article.  I will read two lines from it:</p><blockquote>	Rabia is cradling her newborn baby, just days after giving birth at a small hospital in Nangarhar province in Afghanistan's east.  &quot;This is my third child, but the experience was totally different.  It was horrible,&quot; she says.<br /><br />In a matter of weeks, the birthing unit Rabia delivered her baby in had been stripped down to its bare basics.  She was given no pain relief, no medicine and no food. </blockquote> <p>That is happening now and has been happening in the years and months leading up to this.  Anywhere the Taliban got in, this was being foreshadowed.  With the rules requiring women to be chaperoned, men must accompany women to appointments for the maternity care.  The cultural norms are different.  Husbands and partners do not accompany women to birthing appointments in Afghanistan.  This is leading to women missing their appointments as the husbands are not going because it is not the cultural norm.  Women are missing their very important appointments throughout their pregnancy and then giving birth in these horrific conditions.  One part of the article states they are required to bring their own supplies, including one woman who had to bring her own scalpel for her caesarean section delivery.  This is the barbarity that is happening in Afghanistan and will continue to happen.<br/><br/>We all have a question about this regime.  We can take as many refugees as we want and we can give as much aid as we want, but ultimately millions of women will live in that country.  What do we do?  How do we tolerate a regime like this on this planet?  I do not have the answer to that question but we all must face it with honesty because the answers are not easy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.491" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="17:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900054#GGG00200"><p>I welcome the attention that the D&aacute;il is devoting tonight to the situation in Afghanistan and the terrible plight of its people.  Like me, Members will have been distressed by the images of men, women and children enduring atrocious conditions outside Kabul Airport over many days just for the simple chance to flee Afghanistan, their home, and to get to a third country.</p>  <p>  When we see scenes such as these, hear the pleas of people in Afghanistan whose lives are in immediate danger and reflect on our country's own history of conflict and hunger, it is incumbent on us to do all we can to help.  As Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, what I heard from the people in Ireland were calls for compassion and solidarity.  Irish people wanted the Government to represent the best of them.  We have had offers of housing and employment.  People have offered their time to befriend and help to integrate those who have come here.  These offers came from right across the country, from cities, towns and rural areas.  In responding to the crisis in Afghanistan, the Government has sought to live up to those intentions.</p>  <p>  My Department has been engaged since July, when it became apparent the Taliban would take over and there would be a serious threat to human rights.  Our efforts have been to deliver an effective humanitarian response under the Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP, in this case one focused solely on Afghan nationals.  To date, my Department has offered almost 400 people the chance of a new life in Ireland as refugees.  I have worked actively with my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and our respective officials to create a number of pathways to Afghan citizens coming to Ireland and to respond quickly to the magnitude of the crisis in that country.</p>  <p>  During this period, my Department has co-operated with a wide range of organisations, including Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee Council, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the UNHCR, to identify individuals and families whom we could welcome to Ireland under the IRPP.  We have prioritised human rights defenders, people supporting women&rsquo;s organisations, LGBTI+ activists, journalists and those most at risk from the Taliban takeover.</p>  <p>  A total of 163 people have arrived so far either directly from Afghanistan or from third countries.  Exit from Afghanistan was and remains extremely difficult for those fleeing the country.  Many of the people we have offered places to as refugees here are still in Afghanistan, many in hiding there, but those offers remain live and valid.</p>  <p>  Arrangements for those arriving in Ireland have been made by staff of the Irish refugee protection programme who are also assisting with access to services, accommodation, education and employment.  More people will arrive over the coming weeks.  Our work continues daily.  We continue to identify further individuals and families to whom we will offer access to the Irish refugee protection programme.</p>  <p>  Even as media attention on Afghanistan may wane, the threat of the Taliban will remain and our work will continue over the months ahead.  While Ireland does not have a presence in Afghanistan or the means to get individuals or families out of that country, we have offered support and advice to those seeking access to a third country and from there to travel to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The IRPP has proactively co-operated with organisations and individuals in the interests of helping the widest number of people.  From the beginning, we have used community sponsorship as a way of supporting Afghan refugees.  Community sponsorship mobilises communities to come together to support refugees and to help them to integrate into their local areas.  Many of the Afghan refugees arriving in Ireland already have fluent English and are highly skilled.  The local networks will help them quickly to become established in Ireland and access suitable employment.</p>  <p>  I thank those community sponsorship groups and other groups which have already reached out with help and who are enabling us to support Afghan families and individuals in need of assistance.  Their commitment of time, resources and expertise is giving many Afghans the chance of new lives here in Ireland in peace and safety.  The interpersonal relationships, which are at the heart of community sponsorship, offer programme refugees very good outcomes for their integration into our communities in Ireland.  My Department is funding regional support organisations which provide information, training and support to communities interested in establishing community sponsorship arrangements.  I would like to highlight the important work being done by Amnesty International, Nasc, the Irish Refugee Council, Doras Luimn&iacute; and the Irish Red Cross to support the community sponsorship programme.  My Department can provide information to Deputies on the process if communities in their constituencies are interested in establishing new community support groups or are willing to assist arrivals in other ways.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of the IRPP unit in my Department and particularly the leadership shown by Eibhlin Byrne.  They have worked tirelessly over recent weeks to respond to the crisis and to find innovative ways of making our resources go further in the interests of supporting as many people as possible.  They have demonstrated a strong commitment to helping people in the very greatest need.</p>  <p>  The Government has been responsive to the level of need in Afghanistan as the scale of this crisis has grown.  We allocated 150 refugee places initially and then revised that number upwards in light of demand and in light of the scale of the tragedy in that country.  The programme anticipates there will be ongoing demand from Afghan women, men and children for places in the programme over the months and possibly years ahead.  The IRPP will provide further admissions on a humanitarian basis for Afghan refugees in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  However, there are constraints as to what we can do immediately.  The programme is comprehensive and offers accommodation as well as intensive supports to those admitted to it.  Obviously, resources are not unlimited.  I make that point because Ireland has existing obligations to resettle citizens from other countries also at risk and in need of our help.  We have admitted programme refugees from Myanmar this year, who had been placed at danger because of their opposition to the military coup there.  Earlier this month, 50 Syrian refugees arrived in Ireland.  They had come from Greece and some of them had been rendered homeless by the fire at the Moria camp on Lesbos last year.</p>  <p>  We also have ongoing commitments to bring unaccompanied minors to Ireland from Greece.  In the past two months, 28 unaccompanied minor children have arrived in Ireland from Greece.  This is on foot of the additional &euro;5 million funding I was able to provide to Tusla in this year&rsquo;s budget to ensure it can provide proper aftercare support, including residential support to these unaccompanied minors from Greece and Syria.  All separated children who arrive in Ireland are received into care.  The children are placed with families or in small residential settings of not more than six children.  These children have the same entitlements as all other children in the care of the State.</p>  <p>  On behalf of Tusla, I recently launched a campaign, F&aacute;ilte Care, specifically to recruit foster carers for unaccompanied minor children.  There was a very strong response to this.  Tusla received more than 500 inquiries from people wanting to learn how to become a carer for a separated child.</p> <p>In light of our finite resources and the competing demands for places on our programme, we will have to prioritise those most at risk and most in need of our help.  That may involve difficult choices depending on the numbers seeking admission to Ireland in the months ahead.</p> <p> We continue to fulfill our other obligations.  Earlier this month there was a mission to Lebanon to engage with our responsibilities under the 2019 UNHCR global compact on refugees.  Officials in the Irish refugee protection programme were engaged in a selection mission in Lebanon.  They spoke with more than 260 individuals with a view to bringing many of them to Ireland.  Of those, 139 are children and many of those children have been engaged in child labour while they have been refugees in Lebanon.  Many of the women who were spoken to have been the subject of sexual violence.  A similar selection mission is planned for Jordan later this year.</p> <p> Ireland has a proud record in humanitarian assistance and this year we have maintained that record.  Sadly, when the risk involves an entire population, as is the case with the people of Afghanistan, we will not be able to help everyone in the country.  Enabling people to come to Ireland as programme refugees is a necessary crisis response.  We know that coming to Ireland comes at a significant personal cost to refugees.  They have to leave their former lives behind including their family, friends, community, culture and employment.  For many these losses mark their lives even when they manage to integrate successfully into their new communities.  Enabling people to become programme refugees in Ireland is necessary where a person is at immediate risk.  It is not the answer, however, to the wider challenge faced by millions of people in Afghanistan who are now deprived of essential rights and Deputies Duncan Smith and Howlin referred to that.</p> <p> If we are to support the essential human rights of the Afghan people more broadly, we have to use all available opportunities to remind the Taliban and their backers that human rights matter.  We have to reiterate the importance of women&rsquo;s equality, the rights of LGBTI+ people, the right of girls to education and the rights of all people to democratic representation.  I will use all opportunities at my disposal to promote respect for human rights in Afghanistan and to support those working to defend human rights there.  We can all play our part in showing solidarity with Afghan human rights and equality activists who have demonstrated such courage in working to protect the rights of the many groups at risk in Afghanistan.  It will continue to be important to let the people of Afghanistan know that their rights to equality, safety and self-fulfilment remain legitimate and that such rights should be capable of vindication.  The space for change is limited at the moment but we can plant seeds that may grow in the future.</p> <p> The Government has responded proactively and generously to support Afghan women, men and children who are at risk and it will continue to do so.  The generosity of Irish people and communities is enabling the Government to help as many people as possible.  Some 400 Afghans have been admitted to Ireland through the Irish refugee protection programme and 500 will be admitted through the Afghan admissions programme announced by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, yesterday.  Another 300 Afghans have been admitted through existing family reunification processes.  These 1,200 people represent a significant statement by Ireland that we will always be there to help the most vulnerable.  As Deputies have mentioned, it is incumbent on other EU countries and other developed countries to likewise step up.  Working together, we will be able to offer hope to Afghan women, men and children.  We will be able to support more people to create new lives with us in Ireland, safe from harm and secure in the knowledge that their rights are respected.</p></speech>

I welcome what the Minister has said about the 1,200 people who are being facilitated to come here.  That is necessary work and it is a piece of humanity that we have to offer.  It is incumbent on other states, particularly on those with power and wealth, to deliver for these people.  We have to use our position on the UN Security Council to ensure that the international community does the best it can.</p>  <p>  We must accept that we are not starting from a particularly good place.  We are all in fear of what the Taliban has done in recent times and of what it is capable of doing.  The Taliban is not a monolith and there may be sections within it that are looking to keep the show on the road as far as Afghanistan is concerned.  The international community has to be clear on what is acceptable and basic human rights have to be acceptable.  If we go back in time there was a point when the Americans had no major difficulty dealing with the Taliban.  That was long before 11 September 2001 when they saw it as a possible force for security in the region, a region America played a huge part in destabilising.</p>  <p>  You do not need to be a major student of history to accept that few of those engaged in putting US and other international plans in play as they impacted Afghanistan necessarily read a whole pile of history.  Everybody knows that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires or a breaker's yard for empires.  It is where the Americans decided the Soviets would have their Vietnam and they had no difficulty in ensuring that all the resources they believed were required were put in.  This was long before the trillions of dollars that were spent in the recent war in Afghanistan.  The mujahidin would not have been able to put up much of a fight if it were not for the weapons that were brought through, that the CIA facilitated and that the Americans paid for.  The same number of helicopters would not have fallen if it had not been for the stinger missiles the CIA provided the mujahidin with.</p>  <p>  We all know that due diligence was not done on who the money and resources went to.  They went to the wrong people and to who the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence, ISI, decided they would go to.  These people did not have America's best interests at heart.  As the Americans saw it the job was complete and they left after the mujahidin had for all intents and purposes beaten the Soviet Union and played a major role in winning the Cold War as they saw it.  Those elements of the mujahidin then went to war with each other and eventually the Taliban took over.  Then we had the situation where the Taliban allowed al-Qaeda to operate and we know the history of America with that.  No one would ever consider standing over what then happened and the brutal crime that was visited on America.  There might have been options at that point to deal with al-Qaeda without engaging in a war that was an abject failure and that cost 20 years and trillions of dollars.</p>  <p>  The big regret in any of these situations is the fact that had that money been spent on something other than armaments and on destroying whatever level of infrastructure and economy there was in Afghanistan, we could possibly be in a better place.  The international community and the American regime in particular did not do justice to those who lost their lives on 11 September 2001.  In no way, shape or form was justice done for those people who have suffered over the past 20 years.  We are dealing with it, we have to set out to do better in the future and we have to do whatever we can to facilitate the people of Afghanistan.</p></speech>

The staff at every level of the Department have worked tirelessly to seek safe passage and sanctuary for those Afghan-Irish citizens needing to flee, for front-line defenders to whom we are providing sanctuary, for those people who are here or who will arrive shortly to our refugee protection programme, or for those in the new special admissions programme for Afghan citizens which was approved at yesterday's Cabinet meeting.</p> <p>In a parliamentary democracy, I make no apologies for disagreeing with the Government on fundamental issues that pertain to taxation, spending, policy and approach.  However, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the words of Hassan Ali Faiz, a member of Front Line Defenders who addressed the foreign affairs committee yesterday, having arrived in Ireland with his wife and daughter following a dangerous and traumatic journey while fleeing from Afghanistan.  He told the committee that what the Government did in the current Afghan crisis to protect human rights defenders and journalists rekindled faith and belief in the great cause of human rights.  It revived hope in human rights defenders that they are not alone and that there are friends out there who will recognise their noble work when they feel helpless and hopeless.  All those involved in aiding Hassan and his family, and others like him, to come here safely should be commended in the strongest terms.  Our only purpose now in this Chamber should be to find out how we can help many more people like Hassan and his family here, in Afghanistan or elsewhere.</p> <p> I started with thanks and now I want to highlight some concerns about the scheme, simply to see where it may be improved.  We all received communication from the Irish Refugee Council today.  I echo some of its thoughts on the scheme announced yesterday in terms of how we can better aid the Afghan people who may arrive here in the coming months and how more of them could be brought in.  There was broad recognition following its announcement that the new special admission programme for Afghan nationals had been improved by the Cabinet.  There were some concerns and recommendations regarding the scheme.  There was a request that the proposed commencement date be brought forward from December to October to reflect the urgency of the current situation in Afghanistan and the real risk to the lives of individuals there.  In addition, it should remain open for a reasonable length of time to allow people to submit applications and gather their documents.</p> <p> There were concerns that the proposed 500 places would be inadequate to meet the needs of the Irish-Afghan community's family members, who are equally at risk.  Members of that community have urged the Department that each application be considered on its merits without a cap on numbers.  They have asked that the limit of four family members per sponsor is removed.  This arbitrary limitation does not preserve family unity and is not based on the factual position in Afghanistan, where entire family subgroups are at immediate risk of persecution.</p> <p> While the focus on prioritising these groups of people is laudable, the categorisation must not be operated to limit the possibility of other groups that may qualify as beneficiaries.  Others might equally be at risk, whether they are individuals from ethnic minorities, including men from the Hazari ethnic group, or former state employees.  It is not possible or advisable to specify every group that may suffer and any such criteria should be applied broadly so as not to exclude individuals at risk.  While single female parents and single women and girls are extremely important categories of persons at risk, it must be recognised that many married women are also at risk and it is not appropriate to wait until such time as their husbands have been killed, or forcibly recruited to the Taliban, to enable them and their families to reach safety, where necessary.  It is believed to be essential that meaningful operation of the programme means having a broad definition of eligible beneficiary that is operated flexibly and does not result in such arbitrary exclusion of individuals.  The new humanitarian admissions programme, HAP, must be adequately resourced and staffed to process applications quickly in recognition of the urgency of the situation.  There is a recognition that understaffing may be taking place and this should be addressed as a matter of urgency.  </p> <p> There are concerns that provisions in the new scheme may replicate the documentary requirements of previous schemes.  This programme will have to acknowledge the real challenges individuals in Afghanistan face in obtaining their identity documents, especially passports.  Many individuals do not have passports, or have passports that have expired, and cannot apply for them at this time.  Even if the Taliban resumes the issuing of passports, presentation to apply for a passport may expose individuals to danger.  Even those who have held valid passports may not be able to exit their safe hiding places to collect them.  It will be necessary to take a flexible approach in respect of documentation in light of the crisis nature of the situation.  Canada, for example, is waiving passport requirements for certain categories of Afghans seeking to join family members there.  Other possibilities include relying on available documentation or undertaking remote interviews. </p> <p> There must be discretionary family reunification visas.  Under the International Protection Act 2015, people with refugee status or subsidiary protection have a right to family reunification with the spouse to whom they were married when they left their country of origin.  Minor children who are still under the age of 18 at the time of application for family reunification also have that right.  Children have a right to be reunited with their parents and siblings who are minors.  The family reunification policy document provides a policy around applications for visas for persons who fall outside the right to family reunification under the International Protection Act.  Generally, the family reunification visa process is highly restrictive, requiring the physical receipt at the Irish embassy in Abu Dhabi of the applicants' passports and other identity and support documents and, very significantly, income and financial proofs on the part of their sponsor.  In Ireland, this is &euro;70,000 net in the case of an elderly parent.</p> <p> Other suggestions have been made on the process and legal pathways that are responsive to the challenges faced by individuals in respect of documentation during the humanitarian crisis.  Putting in place an electronic processing system so that electronic copies of passports and other documentation can be uploaded to a secure portal for the processing of applications would make it much safer for Afghan individuals than trying to get their passports out of the country for consideration in visa applications. </p> <p> There are additional suggestions.  We should encourage universities, employers and others to set up and expand student scholarship schemes or work visas that cover Afghans and, where applicants have been identified, to provide that it is an administrative requirement to issue relevant visas swiftly.  We should act on expressions of support from individuals, groups, faith-based and diaspora organisations, municipalities, cities and universities to welcome Afghan refugees by setting up and expanding opportunities for community sponsorship and humanitarian corridors.</p> <p> Other important issues are related to, if slightly outside of, the scope of what we are discussing.  We need to believe people when they tell us they are fleeing danger, persecution or the threat of murder in their home countries.  There has been a worrying trend of increased levels of leave to remain refusals that were apparent pre-pandemic.  In 2017, 3,746 persons were refused entry to the State, 4,795 persons were refused entry in 2018 and 7,455 persons were refused entry in 2019.  Not only has there has been an overall increase in refusals, and I fully accept not everyone can be accepted, these have increased from countries such as Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen where people's lives are clearly at risk.  We know people are coming from unsafe, in-conflict zones, so how can we turn around and say we do not believe them when there is a dearth of information on refusals?  Refusals of leave to land also impact on a person's potential future as it is considered to matter for future immigration applications.  It echoes through all future visa applications made by a person refused leave to land so there is a heightened responsibility that it is only ever used appropriately and with the knowledge and burden of both the emotional distress and future impact it can have on a person.</p> <p> When we talk about Afghanistan, we should also talk about complicity and future threats.  I will raise a number of issues.  The Taliban has profited exponentially from the continuing heroin trade.  Over the coming years, that will create a danger for us in the West as the Taliban seeks to flood it with heroin and to maximise the taxation they will accrue on it.  There were some suggestions in its first press conference that it would cease to trade.  That has proved not to be the case and it will have ramifications not only for the Afghan people but for all of us in the West.  That needs to be addressed and looked at.  There is also the issue of complicity and the question of what it was all for.  America was attacked on 9/11 but it responded by replicating the evil it sought to confront.  We should reflect on our role within that and what constitutes true neutrality.  It is my firm belief, as it is for many in this Chamber, that Shannon Airport should not support the military incursions of any state if it seeks to attack another.  The world is not safe 20 years on.  The strong continue to do what they will, while the weak will suffer what they must.  We should be a proud and strong republic.  Let this be a line in the sand in terms of Ireland's acquiescence in the use of our airports for the purpose of American militarism.</p></speech>

While it is welcome, I have some recommendations that have been articulated very succinctly by Deputy Gannon and the Irish Refugee Council.</p> <p>I feel the proposed commencement date should be brought forward to October to reflect the urgency of the situation in Afghanistan and the real risk to individuals there at the moment.  I also feel it needs to remain open for a reasonable length of time to allow people to submit their applications and to gather the necessary documentation.  I am also concerned that the proposed 500 places will be inadequate to meet demand, and I get a sense there is a belief we will be taking in additional Afghans in the future.  That is to be welcomed.</p> <p> A large number of Irish-Afghan community family members are at risk, as are many Afghan families who have made a connection with Ireland or Irish aid and humanitarian workers and communities in the region.  I am pleased the guidelines for the new scheme identify that it will prioritise those who are especially vulnerable in terms of risk to their freedom and safety.  This also includes people whose previous employment exposed them to greater risk, for example, UN and EU employees, and people who worked for civil society organisations in Afghanistan.</p> <p> Prior to this week's announcement I have already brought to the attention of the various Ministers the situation pertaining to three Afghan families.  In those specific cases, their applications would be challenged under the new guidelines as they are five- or six-person family units, as opposed to the guideline specification of a family unit as four people.  I am anxious that all three families are considered under the programme as their situation has been brought to my attention by Longford native Ms Rose Kane, who is currently working with the UN in Sudan.  Previously, Rose would have worked closely with the lead applicants in each family during her time in Kabul as part of an international humanitarian effort.  One of the applicants is a lawyer currently working for a local non-governmental organisation, the Supporting Vulnerable People organisation, and has a long record of human rights effort with an emphasis on women's rights in Afghanistan.  The people of Longford are especially proud that Rose and many others have put their hands up and committed to humanitarian aid and effort overseas.  It is very much the mark of a modern nation and a compassionate community that we are prepared to step forward and champion those faced with the darkest of challenges.  Both my constituent and her colleague from County Mayo are very supportive of these applications and, indeed, Mayo man Mark Flanagan is one of 75 UN international staff who have remained in Afghanistan to keep humanitarian operations running in the most difficult circumstances.</p> <p> This House truly appreciates and understands that the security situation in Kabul is deteriorating, day by day.  It will be necessary to have all the paperwork in order and to take the opportunity when it comes to allow people to travel safely out of Kabul.  For that reason, it is critical we bring forward the commencement date of the new resettlement scheme to October.</p> <p> I thank the Ministers involved, in particular the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, for the chance to come here today and articulate the case for these families.  I would hope they can be included in a resettlement programme that I, as an Irish citizen, am immensely proud of.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.498" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="18:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900057#KKK00200"><p>I welcome this week's announcement of the updated Afghan admissions programme and plan for family reunification.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, for their leadership on this important issue.</p>  <p>  Ireland has always been a world leader when it comes to offering support and aid to countries in turmoil and I am glad we have moved so quickly to support the people of Afghanistan.  We have given 340 humanitarian visas to activists, those with Irish connections and women at particular risk in Afghanistan.  Some 150 of them have already arrived on our shores and I know we will work to ensure the remaining people arrive here safely as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I welcome that we are continuing to expedite the protection applications of Afghans in Ireland and we are taking responsibility for Dublin III and inadmissible applications.  This all amounts to a huge amount of support for families and for individuals living through the nightmare that has once again unfolded in Afghanistan in recent months.  If we can further increase these numbers and extend our support, we absolutely should.</p>  <p>  I thank Senator Alice-Mary Higgins who this week organised an Oireachtas briefing on the situation in Afghanistan.  With all the news coverage and social media posts we see, it is easy to think we know what is going on in Afghanistan and that we understand and appreciate the trauma people are suffering when really what we see is just the tip of the iceberg.  In Senator Higgins's briefing, we heard from Afghan nationals who are simply terrified for the safety and well-being of their family members.  We heard horrific stories of families being torn apart, of young women and girls being kidnapped by the Taliban and used as bargaining tools to pay off their families' debts to a terrorist regime.  What was their families' crime?  Working for the former government and being hard-working and well-educated citizens.  That was their crime.</p>  <p>  Many had hoped that the Taliban's charm offensive of being reformed and reasonable could be believed, but that was never going to be the case.  Activists are in danger, as are the outspoken, those who protest, members of the LGBTA+ community and women across Afghanistan.  The past 20 years saw huge strides being made for equality and education, particularly for women, in Afghanistan.  However, in a few short weeks, that has all been destroyed.  Women have resumed their former place as second-class citizens.  They are no longer safe, even inside their own homes.</p>  <p>  I welcome the initiative that Ireland has taken to support and welcome Afghan citizens to our country and I hope we will do more.  In August, I was inundated with messages and emails from constituents calling on the Government to support the people of Afghanistan.  The people of Ireland want to welcome Afghan nationals to our nation.  While I very much welcome the new family reunification measures, I am concerned about asking Afghan people in Ireland to choose which four of their family members should come to Ireland.  Families do not come neatly in fours.  I do not think I could make that decision and I am not in such a traumatic situation.</p>  <p>  I would also ask that leeway around the technical elements of visas and reunification be looked at.  Digital copies of passports and IDs should be accepted from those looking to come to Ireland, given the exceptional circumstances.  We must also be aware that for some of these people, the location of their ID or passport might not be known to them.  Perhaps they have never had a passport.  Perhaps their child does not have ID.  As we continue to support the people of Afghanistan and welcome them to Ireland, these are straightforward and simple steps we could take to make the process just a little easier.  I hope the Minister will consider this and will continue to work with the Irish Refugee Council to support our new Afghan Irish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-29a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1557" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="18:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092900057#KKK00300"><p>I compliment the Minister on the leadership he has shown during this awful situation and humanitarian crisis.  He has shown great leadership in enabling the citizens of Afghanistan who live in fear and are traumatised to see a pathway out.  It was lovely to hear the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, talking about the various programmes.  He ultimately talked about 1,200 people being able to see a pathway into this country.  Deputy Higgins is right that the Irish nation has thrown its arms open wide.  We have said we are here, prepared and willing to do what we can to help and assist.  That is the nature of the Irish people.  The Minister is leading that campaign and I compliment him.  That is important.</p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to Afghanistan has been consistently clear.  We have called for an end to the violence, for negotiations between all parties to reach a negotiated political settlement, and for the Taliban to work with others to build a peaceful and inclusive transition government that serves all Afghans.  Of course, we have seen something very different in the weeks since the Taliban took over the country in terms of its attitude to families, women, children and those who worked for the former government.  It has not built confidence in any of us who are watching.</p>  <p>  The Afghan Administration must protect civilians and fulfil Afghanistan's obligations under international law.  Human rights, especially for Afghan women, children and minorities, must be respected, protected and upheld.  Afghanistan must never again become a haven for international terrorism.  I again make the point that I truly fear for what is ahead for the people of Afghanistan.  I do not see a bright future at the moment.  All foreign nationals and those Afghans who wish to leave Afghanistan, including those who want to come to Ireland to be offered resettlement, should not be hindered in any way in doing so.  The Taliban must guarantee safe access for humanitarian aid and those providing vital and life-saving assistance to the Afghan people.  These are the principles that are guiding Ireland on Afghanistan during our Presidency of the Security Council.  The Security Council adopted Resolution 2593 which reaffirms the importance of human rights, humanitarian assistance and the need to allow safe passage.  Ireland will be very involved, and was very involved, in drafting the resolution.</p>  <p>  At an international level, Ireland is working to address a range of issues, especially through our role as President of the UN Security Council.</p> <p>When the Minister chaired the meeting of the Security Council on 9 September, he highlighted the need for an inclusive and negotiated peace settlement, for the human rights of all Afghans, especially women and children, to be protected and promoted and for the Taliban to fulfil its commitment to allow the safe, secure, orderly and unhindered departure of foreign nationals and Afghans at risk.  The Minister has urged the Taliban to facilitate full and safe humanitarian access to allow lifesaving support to reach Afghans.  He also recently approved the provision of an additional &euro;1 million in humanitarian support through the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  It is incumbent on us to compliment the Minister for the work he has done so far.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, talked about significant numbers of people making their way to this country.  I welcome yesterday's approval for the establishment of the Afghan admission programme.  Like many of my colleagues around the House tonight, I will make the point that it would be truly heartbreaking and devastating for families with more than four members to have to choose which four will come to this country.  Words cannot describe what it must be like for them.  In light of the importance of family reunification and how difficult it can be, this should be revisited, if there is any way to do so, and we should ensure that families are not separated, adding further trauma.  That is of great importance.</p> <p> Yesterday, we saw the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid and the diaspora announce an additional &euro;2 million in Irish Aid support for people in Afghanistan who are experiencing severe humanitarian crises.  There is a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and it is deeply concerning.  The country is facing a deadly combination of conflict, disease, drought and hunger.  More than 18 million people, almost half the population, are in need of humanitarian assistance.  One in three Afghans is facing crisis levels of food insecurity and more than half of children under the age of five are at risk of acute malnutrition.  These are stark realities for people and I urge the Minister to continue doing what he is doing, to ensure pathways are created for people and to do all he can to ensure that women, children and minority groups are protected.</p></speech>

We all have seen the horrors on our television screens.  We have seen the desperation of people who are trying to get out of Afghanistan and who are facing the Taliban, particularly in the scenes at Kabul Airport in the final days of the American occupation.  There is no doubt that the situation in Afghanistan at the moment is extremely worrying but it is even more worrying for the Afghan people who are now Irish citizens and who call Ireland their home.  Their neighbours, friends and family members have been executed in front of their families because they have worked for western companies, the Americans or NATO since the Taliban fell in the early 2000s.  These Irish citizens are anxious for their families to be airlifted out of what is now essentially a war zone.</p>  <p>  A constituent of mine contacted me in the last day or so.  In her own words, she said that Afghanistan is under the control of the Taliban and that her family are dying and endangered.  She feels extremely helpless and reached out to me for emergency humanitarian reasons.  She says that she needs an emergency visa for her family and that this is an opportunity for Ireland to provide shelter for people in need.  She goes on to say that this opportunity is worth a person's life and that the situation is extremely dangerous.  She notes that the main targets are women and schools.</p>  <p>  It would be wrong not to take this time to talk about the disastrous war, led by the US, which led to this situation.  Afghanistan is a glaring example of the disastrous foreign policy of a series of American administrations and presidents.  It is clear this policy is certainly not led by any desire for peacekeeping if you look at the trail of death and destruction left across the Middle East and in Afghanistan.  It is mind-boggling.  I recently watched a programme on Netflix which provided a really deep history of what had happened since 9/11 and even previously, during the Russian occupation.  It is mind-boggling that in the 20 years the Americans were in Afghanistan, the US spent close to $3 trillion and yet Afghanistan's infrastructure, economy, health system and education system are in a complete and utter state of collapse.  They were never developed, or certainly not while the Americans or Russians were there.  This is not due to the Taliban but due to the American Government's corrupt funnelling of those trillions of dollars to Afghan warlords and then back out to its friends in the US.  American taxpayers' money was effectively laundered through Afghanistan before being returned to the massive American military-industrial complex.  </p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for the horrors the Afghan people now face rests with the Taliban fair and square.  However, the American Government and its allies also bear great responsibility.  It is our moral responsibility to help the Afghan people, like my constituent who now lives and works in our community.  I ask the Minister and his office to ensure that the family members of citizens are prioritised as a matter of urgency.  We also need to use our seat on the UN Security Council to provide whatever aid we can to the people of Afghanistan, whether through humanitarian support, the provision of emergency visas or relocation and resettlement schemes.  I welcome the moves made in recent days to accept more Afghan people who have family connections here.  As I have said, it is important that conversations are had with the Irish Refugee Council about the ways in which we can make it easier for people to come to Ireland.  I genuinely hope that there will be some respite for the people of Afghanistan, particularly the girls and women who now face weeks, months, years or possibly decades of absolutely horrific oppression.  I hope we do something.  We in this House, and this Government, have a responsibility to support the people of Afghanistan.</p></speech>

We will take five minutes each.  I echo the sentiments expressed regarding the programme for admitting Afghans who have relatives here.  It is a good initiative.  Ireland has always played a good role in showing humanitarian solidarity across the world.  There are other matters on which I would fundamentally disagree with the Minister but Irish people across the world have always held a hand out to those who are in need.  That is a proud tradition of ours.  It is very good.</p>  <p>  The circumstances in Afghanistan are truly tragic but it is a tragedy made by occupation over the last 20 years.  We have to understand what the last 20 years were all about.  What was that all about?  Why was the United States in Afghanistan in the first place?  Afghanistan had nothing to do with the events in New York on 11 September 2001 and yet more than 75,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan.  Ironically, most of these were women and children.  There then followed the absolute catastrophe of the occupation of Iraq.  The US has framed itself as a liberator.  It is not a liberator but an oppressor.  It is the oppressor that has left Afghanistan in a pretty terrible state.  The amount of money spent is absolutely astronomical.  After spending all that money, after all that time under occupation and after all that death and destruction, including the deaths of Afghan civilians, combatants, American soldiers and NATO soldiers, as soon as the Americans said they were leaving, everything fell apart.  The Afghan army fell apart after two or three weeks.</p> <p>What does that say about western and American imperialism?  There is a narrative that this is about protecting women's rights.  The hypocrisy is incredible.  Look at Saudi Arabia.  Who is the biggest economic contributor to Saudi Arabia?  It is the United States.  Nobody says anything about that.  The situation regarding women's rights in Saudi Arabia is terrible but America deals with that country no problem.  The Taliban is in some ways the creation of the United States.  From 1979 to 1989, the mujahidin were supplied with arms by the United States which killed thousands of people.  This is the bitter fruit of imperialism and occupation.</p> <p> The Taliban are no friends of the Afghan people.  They are reactionary fanatics and, eventually, the Afghan people will turn against them.  The state was so corrupt that the president went to, I think, Qatar because he knew the game was up.  It is the bitter fruit of adventurism and imperialism.  We should have nothing to do with it.  We stand shoulder to shoulder with the Afghan people here and in Afghanistan.</p></speech>

Female employees in Kabul's city government have been instructed to stay at home.  High school girl students have been instructed not to return to class.  Executions and amputations have been restored as punishment for criminals.  Journalists have been arrested and other attacks made on press freedoms.  The ministry for women has been renamed the ministry for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice.</p>  <p>  The return of US imperialist rule is not on the cards but it would not be a solution in any case.  More than 100,000 Afghan people were killed or injured under Washington's war on terror regime.  In one recent year, more Afghan civilians were killed by occupying forces than by the Taliban.  Under the occupation, corruption was rife and ordinary Afghans were treated with colonial disdain.  The key beneficiaries of the occupation were the weapons manufacturers and military contractors who got the lion's share of the $1 trillion spent by the occupying power.  US imperialism was the force which had armed and financed the mujahidin warlords in the 1980s, when they went to war with the Soviets.  From the mujahidin came the Taliban and al-Qaeda.  US imperialism spawned the Taliban in the first place.</p>  <p>  Neither imperialist intervention nor rule by Islamic fundamentalism offers any way forward for the Afghan masses.  The hope for the future lies in those masses, in particular the urban population and new generation of women whose interests clash so sharply with those of the country's new rulers.  In time, I hope the clash results in a popular challenge to the rule of the Taliban and puts onto the agenda a democratic workers' and peasants' government that explicitly champions the liberation of women.  Such a government would find its key allies not in the ministries of London and Washington, but in the working class of neighbouring countries, not least Pakistan.  A socialist federation of those countries, based on the right of nationalities to self-determination, would represent a decisive step forward.</p>  <p>  I will comment on the Afghan admission programme.  Afghan nationals living in Ireland since 1 September can sponsor up to four family members.  This is restrictive and will force people to choose between family members in some cases.  What is fair or humane about that?  Why is the scheme starting in December?  Why is it not starting at the beginning of October?  There are 1,200 Afghan nationals residing in Ireland, but only 500 places on the programme.  This is far too low.  Given the horrors that people in Afghanistan are experiencing and enduring, we should not put in place such restrictions.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and thank the emergency consular aid team, made up of Irish diplomats in the Army Ranger Wing, who travelled to Afghanistan in the initial days of conflict, a little over a month ago.  The contribution they made in getting Irish citizens and their families out safely was crucial.</p>  <p>  I have parliamentary questions in with the Minister about family reunification and humanitarian visas.  I am a patron, as are some other Deputies, of Front Line Defenders and I know they have requested additional support on the matter.  I look forward to getting the opportunity to discuss that further during the Minister's questions tomorrow morning in the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  My initial direct engagement with those affected by the situation in Afghanistan was with Ascend Athletics, a group in Afghanistan which trains and works with girls to become community leaders and role models through the medium of sport, specifically mountain climbing.  There was an immediate concern for the well-being of the co-ordinators of the programme, as well as the safety of the girls who had taken part.  After extensive engagement with a range of Deputies, including me, and with different Departments, 20 visas were granted under the humanitarian admissions programme.  I mention Ascend Athletics, their volunteers and their advocates to acknowledge the work that went into the process by so many Irish citizens and people concerned about the well-being of girls in every walk of life and the support they will provide to those 20 girls resettling in Dublin and Galway.  It is a good news story, driven by citizen engagement and the responsiveness of the political system to that.</p>  <p>  I welcome yesterday's announcement about the Afghan admission programme.  It is a sign of how effective government can be when there is cross-departmental engagement and swift action across the board.  The programme has come not a minute too soon and I look forward to further information on it and details on how the most vulnerable, such as refugees and asylum seekers, may apply.</p>  <p>  I note that the Irish Refugee Council, whom I work with as do others, has requested that the opening of applications be brought forward to October.  I know there will be a lot to configure but I fully support that request and ask that it be facilitated to reflect how urgent the family reunification process is in relation to Afghanistan.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the Minister said yesterday this is a tailor-made programme.  That is deeply appreciated by all who will apply, I imagine.  I highlight that considerable support needs to be in place for people and families making the applications.  We know as public representatives that, at the best of times, filling out applications can be overwhelming, but those applications carry extra weight and there are practical issues such as the inability to access required documentation in time, or at all, and language barriers.  There are also people in a position where they have to choose which family members to nominate on applications, which is an unimaginably difficult situation.  I will speak in a moment on a few cases which highlight how difficult those decisions will be.  Some applicants may have five, ten or 15 family members while others have two or three.  If it were possible to review them on a case-by-case basis, I believe it would be worth the additional resources required to make it happen.</p>  <p>  Since I was appointed as Fine Gael's equality spokesperson last year, I have linked in again and again with charity and advocacy groups for refugees, asylum seekers and those in direct provision.  I have spoken and engaged directly with people in direct provision many times.  Some have been there for many years.  That includes, as of today, 211 Afghan refugees.</p>  <p>  A number of weeks ago, I had the privilege of virtually meeting a few Afghan families living across the country in direct provision centres.  Brought into that Zoom call were their family members, at that time in Afghanistan.  It was a deeply moving experience to be speaking at that point with Afghan families in Ireland and in Afghanistan.  The pressure that placed was visible on the children's faces, knowing where they were and not knowing the risks they faced.</p>  <p>  With their permission, I will give details of some of the families.  Telling a story always brings the issue to life.  One family I am in touch with constitutes a couple and their three children who left Afghanistan in 2008.  They have moved twice since being forced to leave their home country before arriving in Ireland in summer 2020.</p></speech>
