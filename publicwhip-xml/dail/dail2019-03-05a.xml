As we learned quickly and anyone with a busy constituency office would know, the scheme was extremely difficult to process, with many hurdles put in front of people and many delays.  Far from four to six weeks, the process went on for months in many cases.  At the time the Minister announced that a second fund would be created very quickly that would be demand-driven, given the overall state of the mortgage market, at a figure of &euro;99 billion.  He said it would be a demand-led scheme that would progress.</p>  <p>  We learned this morning from Louise Byrne on the RT&Eacute; "Morning Ireland" programme that in a briefing note to the Minister's press office the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government stated it had been advised no further approvals should issue for now, that the Department was undertaking a review of the scheme and that the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance were engaging on it.  That was on 31 January this year and notwithstanding that Deputy Darragh O'Brien had tabled parliamentary questions about the issue and that Deputy O'Dea had been told in December by the Minister that he was progressing reforms to ensure the loan scheme could work for more people and more quickly.  One month later he is advising his press office that no further approvals should issue.  </p>  <p>  I do not know what planet the Minister is living on, but the question I ask the Taoiseach is why was the scheme not extended.  Why was there no public announcement to that effect?</p><p>If the Taoiseach tells his press office, surely the public deserves to know.  Why was the D&aacute;il not told in an upfront and honest way?  Why is there this continuing lack of respect for the House in terms of being open, upfront and honest about what is going on with schemes of this kind?  People are still applying, but no one save for the press office has been told that no further approvals will issue, according to RT&Eacute; this morning following a freedom of information request.  Why can the Government not just be honest with the people about these issues?  Will the Taoiseach bring clarity to this situation?  When will the scheme be extended and to what degree?  The original limit was &euro;200 million and the Minister alleged that 1,000 houses were to be accommodated.  Approximately 1,550 applications, if not more, have been accepted.  Will those people who have been approved be in a position to draw down their loans?</p></speech>

It has been very popular.  So far, 575 people have been helped with buying their first home with a Rebuilding Ireland home loan and a further 1,000 applicants have been approved but have not yet drawn down the funding.  The scheme was initially limited at &euro;200 million and that &euro;200 million has been allocated, but as loans are not drawn down - they expire after six months if they are not drawn down - more finance does become available.</p>  <p>  We now have to consider two things: whether we should increase the cap above &euro;200 million, and that is under consideration by the Government, and we have to consult the Central Bank because this is a mortgage.  It is a loan that is being offered to people who have been turned down by banks and building societies and it is at a reduced interest rate.  We have to consider two things now: whether we should increase the &euro;200 million cap and the need to consult the Central Bank as to whether it is comfortable with us offering more of these loans, taking into account the fact that it is a low-interest loan offered to people who were not able to get loans from commercial lenders.</p></speech>

The Minister said last year: "We are not going to wait for the fund to run out before we build up a second fund to allow a continuation of the scheme with whatever changes we might deem to be necessary".  He said that there would be no issue here and he would continue with a second fund.  He was saying that as late as December, when he stated in a parliamentary reply that he wanted more people and for them to be processed more quickly.</p>  <p>  It is low-income people who are being let down again.  Their hopes are raised with fanfare by the Government, but the dashing of those hopes is done silently.  Why was what the Taoiseach just told the House not said by the Minister in his parliamentary reply?  Why did the Minister not say that he was going to be approaching the Central Bank and that the Central Bank was going to place a limit on this?  Why all the secrecy and silence around this?  Why can the Government not just be upfront and straight with people about what it is doing instead of hoping that the problem will go away or that someone will not discover it?</p></speech>

We are all dealing with applications in our constituencies.</p><p>These are people who are desperate to buy homes.  If they could get mortgages, they would be cheaper than the rents that they are paying.  There have been higher rents for seven or eight years now and they could be paying much less if they could get a mortgage.  They are all going through this charade, being asked for this note, that letter, and the other form.  That is what is going on in the real world while the Government just prances about the place, going on about this and that.  It is just not good enough.</p></speech>

Its findings are an indictment of the Government's record on poverty prevention and alleviation among single parent families, many of whom are at work.  The report finds that one in 11 working lone parents were living below the poverty line in 2012 but that number had jumped to one in five in 2017.  The high cost of housing and childcare combined with low levels of income are making it impossible for families to make ends meet.  The report finds that the living standards of lone parents in this State are among the worst in Europe.  We have the second highest rate of income poverty, persistent poverty and severe deprivation among 15 other EU states.  That is shocking.  What is most shocking, however, is that the majority of one-parent families, the vast majority of whom are headed by women, are in work.  These families are like others.  They are people who get up at the crack of dawn but who still struggle and fail to meet their own and their families' basic needs.  Our cost of living crisis is leaving hundreds of thousands of people struggling and living in fear of any extra financial burden like a car breaking down or a washing machine packing it in.  These are people who work hard to provide for their families.  They have a modest aspiration for a decent, happy life but they cannot plan for their future.  How can they plan when they cannot make ends meet in the here and now?</p>  <p>  Low pay, especially in the context of the soaring cost of living, is the real problem.  Workers on low wages, in many cases in insecure employment, are being asked to find money to pay for extortionate rents, crazy insurance premia and crushing childcare costs.  It is not good enough to brush all of this aside, as the Taoiseach does frequently, with the promise of a meagre tax relief at an ill-defined point in the future.  These families do not need a handout but a hand up in the here and now.  These are people who work and who want to continue working to give their families and their children a better life.  What does the Taoiseach propose to do in the here and now to address the cost of living crisis that is crippling these families?  When will he introduce a living wage?</p></speech>

It is particularly difficult for lone parents who do so without the support of a partner, without a second income and without someone to share in the burden, cost and time taken by childcare.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, we are helping all parents, but especially lone parents, to improve their living conditions by creating jobs.  The number of lone parents who are working has increased.  The rate of unemployment is down by almost two thirds and the Deputy will know that it is down again today.  We are increasing welfare payments that had been cut back in the past.  They are being restored with an increase kicking in to the one-parent family payment and the jobseeker's transition payment in a few weeks' time.  We have introduced the working family payment to replace the family income supplement, which allows lone parents who are working to keep more of the money they earn and to have their income topped up so they can avoid poverty. </p>  <p>  We have reduced the costs of childcare and we will further enhance that with the introduction of the affordable childcare scheme later in the year.</p>  <p>  We are increasing pay.  The minimum wage has increased and pay has been restored for people who are public servants.  It is also increasing across the private sector.  We are reducing the costs of medicines and prescription charges are being reduced.  General practitioner, GP, visits, which are already free to all children under the age of six, will be extended to a further 100,000 people from April onwards.  Those are the measures we are taking to reduce the costs of living, to assist lone parents into work and to ensure they have more money in their pockets.</p>  <p>  We are also focusing very much on education.  We have, for example, restored the costs of education grant, and as a result record numbers of people from non-traditional backgrounds are now participating in higher education.</p>  <p>  I have immense respect for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and have worked with it on many occasions; especially when I was the Minister for Social Protection, but I do not believe the report that was issued today tells the full picture.  This morning I asked for the statistics from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which collects the official statistics on poverty in Ireland.  The CSO figures show that the consistent poverty rate - the official measure of poverty in Ireland  - jumped from 18.4% in 2012 to 26.3% in 2013.  Since 2013, however, for each of the past four years, consistent poverty and deprivation among lone parents has actually gone down.  It fell to 23.1 % in 2014, there was a slight increase to 23.2% after that and then 20.7% in 2017.  The most recent figures we have are for 2017 and they are less than those for 2013.  This demonstrates that the policies we have implemented in helping people get back to work, helping them into education, improving welfare and reducing the costs of childcare are working.  I predict that when we see the 2018 figures they will have improved again.</p></speech>

The measures his Government is taking are clearly not working for hundreds of thousands of people across the State but in particular for those families headed by a lone parent.</p><p><i>The Irish Times</i>carried a very interesting series on child poverty.  If the Taoiseach has not read some of the articles I would recommend them to him.  One of the articles compared the standard of living of a mother of two from the midlands with an appropriate counterpart living in another jurisdiction.  The article made for incredible reading.  The woman concerned is at work.  Such are her struggles to ensure her family can get by that she rations the number of times the kids are allowed to boil the kettle.  Can one imagine having to count the number of times that a family can boil a kettle in its house?  I put it to the Taoiseach that this is how tight things are.  Many of the interventions cited by the Taoiseach are, in effect, subsidies for low-pay employment.</p></speech>

She is the now 16 year old Swedish school student who started a worldwide movement of school student strikes and protests demanding action on climate change.  At the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, conference in Poland, she stated:</p><blockquote>For 25 years, countless people have come to the UN climate conferences begging our world leaders to stop emissions and clearly that has not worked as emissions continue to rise.  So I will not beg the world leaders to care for our future.  I will instead let them know change is coming whether they like it or not.</blockquote><p>That urgency for action, that recognition that we cannot rely on convincing those in power to do what is necessary is absolutely correct.  It is perhaps the reason the European Parliament groups to which Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il belong have blocked her from speaking to that assembly this week.  The latest IPCC report warns that we have 12 years to avoid global warming growing over 1.5&deg;C.  After that, a further 0.5&deg;C would have devastating consequences.  Sea level rises would affect 10 million people, 99% of coral would be destroyed and many insects would be wiped out.  The current level of commitments, which are not even being honoured, would still mean a rise in temperature of 3&deg;C.  In fact, given what is actually happening, we are heading towards a 4&deg;C to 5&deg;C increase in temperature, which will make large parts of the Earth uninhabitable.  That is why young people have taken the lead.  More than 300 cities have seen strikes by schoolchildren, while hundreds of thousands have come out on the streets in Belgium, the Netherlands, Australia, Sweden, Germany and elsewhere.</p><p>I note that 15 March has been named as the date for a global school student strike action.  School students in Ireland will, hopefully, join that in large numbers.  The contrast of those young people with the inaction of the world's leaders could not be starker.  The contrast is stark not only with climate change deniers like Trump, but with those like the Taoiseach, who acknowledge that climate change exists and the role of human society in it but who do not want to do anything about it.  As a result, Ireland is the second worst in the EU at meeting climate change targets.  According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, today, Ireland is third worst in the EU at meeting renewable energy targets.  The reason for this inaction is clear.  Establishment politicians represent big business, including the 90 corporations responsible for 63% of cumulative global emissions and the oil, gas and big agribusiness companies pursuing the maximisation of profit.  A mass movement on climate change is needed and the school students should be joined by others, in particular the trade unions, to demand investment in green jobs and a centrally-based eco-socialist programme to take control of the economy out of the hands of the polluters and profiteers and to place it under the democratic control of the public to enable the rapid just transition we need.</p><p>I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  First, will he listen to school students when they strike on 15 March?  Second, given that transport is the second largest emitting sector of the economy, will he agree that radical action is needed to get people out of cars, that the State should invest in properly funded public transport services and, furthermore, should make public transport free, as has happened in Estonia, Luxembourg and 100 cities around the world?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, we are implementing proposals for major investments in public transport through projects such as BusConnects, MetroLink and so forth, of which I hope he will be supportive.</p>  <p>  I heard Greta's speech.  The fact that young people are taking action, protesting and going to strike and take a break from school on 15 March is good.  It is welcome.  Unlike the Deputy, I do not see it as a party political matter.  It is quite different and I have heard what they have said.  These are young people who are standing up to adults.  They are children, pupils and students telling all of the adults in all parties to get their act together and do more about climate change because it is their future that is in jeopardy.  That is why I support what they are doing and we all must listen to what they are saying.</p>  <p>  Among the people who must listen are those in socialist parties such as the Deputy's who are climate tax deniers and deny the fact that a carbon tax or climate charge must be part of the solution to climate change.  We know that a carbon charge alone will not solve the problem of climate change, but we equally know and science tells us that without it we cannot achieve our objectives.

If it is not to be a patronising pat on the back, it will support and defend the rights of the students who are protesting for their future and the future of humanity.  I agree that it is not a narrow party political issue.  However, the system and policies the Taoiseach defends are incompatible with dealing with the issue of climate change.  An economy that continues to be based on the drive for profit of individual companies that treat nature and damage to it as an externality cannot deliver the rapid change needed.  What is required is a democratically planned economy.  That is why we need eco-socialist policies.</p>  <p>  Second, using climate change as a green washing exercise to try to introduce more regressive taxation measures will not wash with people.  They know that the polluters are the top companies which are responsible for 63% of emissions.</p></speech>

The consequences of not changing our model of care are plain to see.  Fine Gael has been in power for eight years and this Government has been in power for the past three years.  In those past three years, we have seen little or no health reform.  In fact, the situation has deteriorated.  The Taoiseach talks about health reform but he fails to implement what is glaringly obvious.  Time is not in our side as demand for our health service continues to grow with our ageing population.</p>  <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare is now two years old.  It still awaits transitional funding to trigger meaningful roll-out and delivery of better care to our patients.  Sl&aacute;intecare is stranded in the doldrums of inertia.  There is much talk about implementation but no implementation.  We cannot reform the health service from current spend.  It is not possible.  Specific independent, targeted funding is needed.  Without this, Sl&aacute;intecare will be just another report.  Transitional funding is needed to shift the balance of care towards community care while at the same time delivering on unmet need.  New models of data gathering, digital healthcare records and individual patient identifiers are essential so that we can gather data which will make meaningful progress in informing how we reform our health service.</p>  <p>  The HSE service plan for 2019 indicates the HSE will struggle to maintain services at 2018 levels, which in themselves were inadequate, and will not deliver services as we require them in 2019.  We still do not have multi-annual budgets.  Without this, long-term planning is impossible.  Unmet need will continue to grow as elective care will be limited by necessity.  We will be providing only essential and urgent care in our hospitals.  The expected increase in emergency admissions this year will diminish the ability to provide elective care.</p>  <p>  Meeting current and future challenges within our service as it is currently designed is not sustainable.  The service is facing extraordinary challenges and will need an extraordinary response.  The capacity of our service is at maximum, with ever-increasing unmet need.  Our hospitals are operating at 100% capacity which, internationally, is recognised as unsafe.  We have a shortage of intensive care unit, ICU, beds, which limits elective care.  We need 8,000 extra beds over the next ten years unless we engage in extraordinary health reform.  Opening 200 beds this year is wholly inadequate.  We educate our graduate nurses, doctors, consultants and general practitioners, GPs, for export.  This feeds into inadequate quality in the services that we provide.  The affect of this on our population is clear, with 100,000 people on trolleys, 70,000 awaiting elective care and 500,000 on waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Will this be the legacy that this Government leaves behind?  When will the Government deliver the extraordinary response that is needed to reform our health service?</p></speech>

I do not agree with his contention that health reform is not happening at all.  I will give a few examples in response to some of the questions the Deputy raised.  At the heart of Sl&aacute;intecare is the view that health care should be affordable and that we should extend free GP care to more people and reduce the cost of accessing medicines.</p><p>That is happening.  We have extended free GP care to all children under the age of six and all citizens over the age of 70, as well as to an extra 100,000 people based on income from April.  </p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare, which the Deputy advocates for and supports, recommends that we extend free GP care to an extra 500,000 people a year, that is, 500,000 this year, 1 million next year and 1.5 million the year after.  I think that the Deputy's recommendation is a mistake because it is too fast.  I do not think the capacity to increase free GP care as quickly as he advocates, that is, an extra 1 million in two years and an extra 2 million in four years, exists in our GP surgeries.  I think he is mistaken in that regard, although I recognise that he is a strong advocate of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p>  <p>  We are also investing in primary care centres.  There are now 120 primary care centres open throughout the country, while there were only 40 a few years ago.  We have set aside a ten-year capital budget envelope for health, which is a multi-annual budget if ever there was one.  It provides for &euro;11 billion, which is double what it was for the past ten years.  As a result, three new national hospitals are under construction, with one to go to tender quite soon.</p>  <p>  There is investment in ICT.  The medical laboratory information system, MedLIS, is now available almost across the board, allowing people to see blood results all over the place.  There is also the picture archiving and communication system, PACS, and what replaced it in radiology, and there is the maternal health record, where women who attend maternity hospital now have electronic records which they did not in the past.  We are introducing reforms such as a commissioning model, where the National Treatment Purchase Fund is used to commission operations and procedures, which is why the waiting times for those waiting more than three months for an operation or procedure has fallen for months.</p>  <p>  We are increasing bed capacity, by 200 last year and approximately another 200 this year.  I visited Clonmel the other day, where there is a new 40-bed unit under construction, while the Minister for Health recently gave approval for an extra 60 beds in Limerick.  As a result, the number of patients on trolleys thus far this year, while still far too high, is at its lowest in four years, and let us hope that will continue.</p>  <p>  The next large step is contractual reforms for GPs and we are in negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, having concluded talks with the nurses on a new contract for them.  We are keen to get that done to provide additional resources for general practice, that is, not just additional money for doing the same things but rather for change, embracing medicines management and ICT, giving information that we need to plan our health services and providing new services, particularly in the field of chronic care.</p></speech>

As he will know, the continuation of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, has devastated general practice and it will take years for general practice to recover.  He referred to the expansion of primary care, which is an essential component of Sl&aacute;intecare, and he was quite right that we cannot expand eligibility or services unless there is the manpower to do so.  That is the very issue: we do not have the manpower in general practice to underpin Sl&aacute;intecare.  We do not have the capacity in general practice to supply the increased eligibility that the Taoiseach proposes and to expand the range of services if GPs are not available.  We are losing GPs from our urban practices, not to mention from our rural practices, and we cannot recruit GPs to supply the extra services.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has put the cart before the horse.  If our health service is to be reformed, manpower in general practice needs to be expanded, which is the underpinning of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Unless we have an expansion of primary care, Sl&aacute;intecare cannot progress.  The Government is damaging general practice by the continuation of FEMPI and the failure to reverse it.</p></speech>

I am broadly a supporter of multi-annual budgets, not just in the health service but across the board.  Before there can be multi-annual budgets, however, one must demonstrate that one is able to keep within annual budgets.  We already have a multi-annual budget in health, namely, a ten-year envelope for capital, but have the HSE and the health service managed to keep within that budget?  Is there anyone in the House who believes that if there was multi-annual budgeting for current spending, the HSE, which has gone over budget every year for any number of years, would not also go over budget on its multi-annual budget?</p><p>I believe it would.  It may burn up the money quicker than it does now and we have to take those concerns into account.  We are training more general practitioners, GPs, have increased the number of training places and, thankfully, those training places are being filled.  We are in negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, to restore funding for general practice and to link that to important reforms, including extending eligibility, moving to greater chronic care, medicines management and use of IT.  Where I disagree with Deputy Harty in his strong advocacy for Sl&aacute;intecare is that it is pretty unequivocal that it wants, as well as the 1 million people who already have free GP care, to have an extra 500,000 next year and 500,000 more after that.  I think the Deputy is mistaken on that and that we need to do the other thing first.</p></speech>

I think everybody in the House has co-operated with Government because we recognise the necessity for contingencies for such a scenario.  It is inexplicable therefore how so many of our amendments, moved in that spirit of being prepared, have been ruled out of order.  They have covered such things as equality of citizenship and dealing with green card measures to support agriculture.  I could go on.  Some 25 of our amendments have been ruled out of order.  It raises a question for us as to the quality of this debate and exchange and the robustness of the legislation.  We were encouraged to co-operate with the Government, which is fine.  We were told that we would be listened to and there would be an opportunity for substantive amendments to be brought forward, yet here we are, with 25 amendments on critical issues that have simply been set aside.  Speaking to some colleagues earlier, they now regard the debate as something of a sham because it is a precooked outcome from the Government and we are to operate as some kind of elaborate rubber stamp.  On that basis, we do not support the proposition.  I would like substantiation of how so many of these amendments represent a charge on the State.  They have been ruled out of order wholesale and we are very disappointed.</p></speech>

Some 74 amendments were tabled to the Bill.  They got the highest level consideration from the Service before they were ruled upon.  Some 38 of the 74 have been ruled out of order.  Each Deputy who submitted an amendment has received correspondence setting out clearly why they were considered to be out of order.  I have written to Deputies to say that I am available after this sitting to meet with any Deputy who wants to discuss the ruling out of an amendment.</p><p>I am sorry, Deputy Cullinane, only leaders can come in on this matter. </p></speech>

How could an amendment we proposed, about ruling out under any circumstances physical infrastructure between North and South in the form of a border, not be in line with the objectives of the Bill or how could it be deemed to be in conflict with a Bill that specifies in its description that it is a Bill to deal with the potential consequences of no deal and to prevent "disturbance" to the South in economic or other terms?  How could, for example, asking that British driving licences would be recognised in the South be in conflict with the Bill?  It is incomprehensible and it renders the debate a sham.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500014#N00200"><p>In the context of justice legislation and the "Claire Byrne Live" programmes last week and this week, there is a need to progress legislation to ensure those who commit homicides will not benefit from their actions, particularly in cases of familicide.  Deputy O'Callaghan tabled the Civil Liability (Amendment) (Prevention of Benefits from Homicide) Bill 2017 just over two years ago and it was passed on Second Stage in October last year.</p><p>The Government did not oppose it and it now needs to prioritise it.  The Parole Bill was published in 2016 and passed Second Stage.  It passed Committee Stage in May 2017 and the Government gave a commitment to bringing it to Report and Final Stages.  At present, a person may apply for parole after seven years and the Bill proposes to raise this to 12 years.  The parents and family of Rachel O'Reilly are particularly anxious about this.  The Bill has other positive provisions.  Will the Taoiseach agree to accelerate the passage of both these Bills?  They are well drafted.  Deputy O'Callaghan is a good legislator and knows what he is doing.  It is sometimes alleged that Opposition Bills are not up to scratch.  These ones are and they should be done.</p></speech>

The Government is on record as accepting the principle of both Bills.  Now that the Brexit legislation has been settled and will hopefully be passed in the coming days, I am keen to sign off on a number of amendments on both these Bills.  I am anxious to advance both, acknowledging the importance of what Deputy Martin has said.</p></speech>

Some of these include fire-safety issues, rotting roofs and defective balconies.  The people concerned have bought or rented homes in good faith, but the Government has all but ignored calls to assist them.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government published a report in January 2018 with 26 recommendations to tackle the issue of latent defects, including the establishment of a redress scheme to assist homeowners.  The report received cross-party support.  That redress scheme would be funded via an industry levy matched by Government funding and low-cost loans to help homeowners pay for remedial works, offering a real solution to those living in defective properties.</p>  <p>  It is not acceptable to claim that this is a matter solely between the developer and the home purchaser since weak regulation was an underlying cause of the problem.  Will the Government consider the establishment of a redress scheme for those living in defective properties?  When will homeowners in Donegal and Mayo, affected by mica and pyrite, be able to access the redress scheme approved by Cabinet in November? </p></speech>

It is a very stressful situation and they are trying to find assistance with that, which I understand.</p>  <p>  Building standards were not complied with during the boom-time years.  Today, unfortunately, certain politicians are looking for us to relax standards once again and to remove layers of oversight when it comes to building, but we will not do that.  In 2014 the controls and regulations on building designing, architectural works, planning and the actual completion of works were greatly improved to protect people who were buying homes under this new control regime.  The difficulty we have is that there is a significant risk to the taxpayer if the Government accepts liability for individual buildings or for works that were not completed in the appropriate way, while at the same time potentially letting off builders who are responsible in this matter.</p>  <p>  Of course we want to find a pathway to help these people, but it is difficult to see one that does not take on this enormous open-ended liability on every other taxpayer in the State that the State simply could not meet.</p>  <p>  On the second part of the Deputy's question, at the time of last year's budget agreement in principle was reached for a scheme for people in Donegal and Mayo where pyrite, pyritic heave and mica have been damaging internally the concrete blocks of buildings that were built.  My Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are close to completing the outline of that scheme.  An amount of money has been allocated to it in 2019, but we just need to finalise the details of how the scheme will be applied in those two counties.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach may be aware that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission operates a support scheme where the operations of this House are reported both to local print media and radio stations.  The print media arrangement ends today and the broadcast media support ends on 1 April.  I ask all Members of the House, if we are all interested as we all said we were in supporting local media, to indicate our support so that the views expressed in this House and the debates should be presented free of charge to those media outlets that carry it.  That would be good for both democracy and the sustaining of local media as well.</p></speech>

Can I suggest that promise is a hoax given the revelation today that, without telling anybody, instructions were given not to give out what is already a very limited scheme around affordable mortgages under the Rebuilding Ireland mortgage scheme?  The limitations of this scheme can be told by the fact that in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown only three Rebuilding Ireland mortgages were given out.  Indeed, I have raised this issue with the Minister before, how people who should and are supposed to qualify did not qualify.  The affordable scheme, which is supposed to deal with the same cohort of people and in which we were told &euro;300 million was to be put, still has not appeared two years later.  Are not all of the "affordable" promises in the programme for Government just a complete hoax?</p></speech>

Is that the situation because we have been told that there are multiple dual applications and that this is the reason for the delay in the approval of the additional 1,000?</p></speech>

They have not been able to draw down the funds because either it is taking too long for the underwriting process or, particularly in Dublin, the amount of money being offered - on average about &euro;200,000 - comes nowhere close to the average house price of &euro;340,000 and in D&uacute;n Laoghaire of &euro;590,000.  We have a situation now where &euro;136 million of this fund is sitting there and the people to whom it is being offered cannot access it.  It is not just a matter of extending the overall funding, it also involves fixing the scheme to ensure that when people are offered loans, it is an appropriate amount of money and it is done in a speedy enough fashion so the money can be spent on the houses they so desperately need.</p></speech>

Could the Minister comment on how long have some of those, the longest of them, been in the system?  Does he appreciate the limbo that those applicants find themselves in while waiting for those applications, to know whether they will or will not be drawn down?  Can the Minister give an assurance to the House, particularly in relation to the number of constituents that I am familiar with, that the response as to whether they will be able to draw down these mortgages will be considered and given as swiftly as possible?</p></speech>

I was clear with the D&aacute;il and I can direct attention to parliamentary questions on 5 and 26 February but also to previous conversations we have had at committee about the operation of this loan.</p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan is incredibly worthwhile and supportive of people trying to buy their first home.  Time and again Deputies were come into the House to say that it is not working.  Today we see clearly and know that it is working so well that it is working better than anticipated, because the additional &euro;200 million of funding was a tranche that was meant to be there for three years, but only a year and a month into the operation of the scheme we have already seen hundreds of people approved and drawing down and hundreds more waiting to draw down their loans.</p>  <p>  We have dual applications because people are applying to different local authorities depending on where they intend to buy their homes.  We also have cases where some loans are approved but not drawn down.  That happens for many reasons.  The lag between an approval and a drawdown is not necessarily on the local authority's side.  Once one get's approval for a mortgage it takes time to find a home, to complete the sale and to do all the things that one has to do when someone is buying a home.  In those circumstances, that is where a delay can arise and that is often the case.  Sometimes a loan is not drawn down at all because the circumstances or the choice of the individual changes.  I indicated to the D&aacute;il that we would need to look for a second tranche when the first tranche did expire.  Only half of the first tranche has been drawn down to date.  That is why at the moment I am in negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about a further tranche to ensure we can continue with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  It has been successful in helping hundreds of people to buy their first home and we want to see that happen for hundreds more.</p></speech>

Outside the Red Cow and indeed in all of rural Ireland, since the ramming through of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018, to please the Minister, Deputy Ross, people in rural Ireland are angered and frustrated like never before, young and old.  Provisional drivers who are waiting for driving tests have no transport now and have to impose on parents and family members to drive them.  Old people are facing checkpoints daily and several times a day right around the country like never before.  Will the Taoiseach reduce the level of checkpoints, seeing as it was this Government that put them in place, and with this Government reverse this Act in the light of the anger, frustration and hardship that has been imposed on the people of rural Ireland at this time?</p></speech>

There are no Ministers ordering checkpoints anywhere: I can guarantee that.  There is a degree of misunderstanding on the new law.  This new law has not changed the drink-driving or alcohol limits: it has changed penalty.  The limits are exactly what they were before.  The solution is not to allow drink-driving but is better transport.</p>  <p>  I am particularly enthused by what the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, is leading with his lift scheme in the Deputy's own county, which could be the potential prototype for a much more flexible, more individualised and much more available road transport, particularly at night.</p></speech>

Is it intended to advance a change to our defamation laws or will he consider the call from the National Union of Journalists that there should be a commission into the future of the media, which will obviously look at things like social media and other platforms at the same time?

A further 22 young people over the age of 18 years have been impacted upon.</p>  <p>  Page 62 of A Programme for a Partnership Government makes specific reference to the issue of open disclosure and no-fault compensation.  The number one priority for these 106 people and their families is to get access to educational supports, aids and resource supports.  Some of the families and children are getting resource hours, but others are only getting reduced resource hours.  We need to see a uniform allocation of resource hours and supports to these young people.  Will a dedicated person be appointed within the Department of Education and Skills to co-ordinate on behalf of these 106 people and minimise the impact of this audiology failure on each of them?</p></speech>

I know it was raised in the D&aacute;il a week or two ago.  I agree with the Deputy's sentiments.  The most important thing now is to make sure that those children and adults affected get the health interventions they need and should have got in the past, and the education and welfare supports they need.  I am informed that some have, but it has been inconsistent and patchy, and we are keen to resolve that.  I have asked someone in my office to pull together the main Departments - Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Education and Skills and Health - to try to resolve the situation.</p></speech>

Since 2005, our local authorities have been using the same guidelines.  In 2016, the Government informed the EU that it would be reviewing the local needs situation.  On 22 January, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, stated that this had to do with the Flemish decree, his Department was working on the matter and a working group had held a meeting the prior week.  He said that he would revert to me with an update on local needs.  People in villages and rural areas cannot build on their own lands.  This situation has been going on for two or three years.  Will it come to an end at some stage?</p></speech>

The matter remains as I explained to the D&aacute;il recently.  We are operating on the 2005 guidelines.  We have been in negotiations with the Commission following on from the Flemish decree.  Much of the thinking that is being incorporated as a result of the Flemish decree made its way into the national planning framework, which is being put through the regional spatial and economic strategies.  However, it is not true to say that new homes are not being approved depending on local needs.  That is happening.  We will have the updated guidelines shortly, but local authorities are working to the 2005 guidelines at the moment.</p></speech>

A comprehensive set of Government structures has been put in place to ensure that all Departments and their agencies are engaged in detailed preparedness and contingency activities.  Since well before the referendum in the UK, Brexit has been the subject of detailed contingency planning across all relevant Departments.  Staff across several divisions in my Department contribute to the work on Brexit, including the international, European Union and Northern Ireland divisions, as well as the economic division.  To augment this ongoing work, my Department also has a dedicated unit on Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  The unit, working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, focuses on cross-Government co-ordination, planning and programme management.  The unit provides assistance to a Secretaries General group, chaired by the Secretary General to the Government, which meets weekly to oversee ongoing work on national Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  </p><p>The unit also assists an assistant secretaries group on no-deal Brexit planning which meets on a regular basis.  This group is wholly focused on planning for a no-deal scenario based on the Government&rsquo;s contingency action plan published last December.  That plan provides detailed sectoral analyses and approaches to mitigate the impacts of a no-deal Brexit.  On 30 January, an update to the contingency action plan was published, setting out how preparations for a no-deal scenario have intensified since December.  </p><p>Our preparedness and contingency planning takes full account of and complements the steps under way at EU level to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal, notably as regards the implementation of the European Commission&rsquo;s contingency action plan.  There is ongoing engagement between Irish officials and their European Commission counterparts.  The unit, in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, also assists a senior officials group on Brexit-related legislation, which also meets on a regular basis.  The group is overseeing the necessary primary and secondary legislation required for a no-deal Brexit.  This has involved a painstaking, whole-of-Government screening of our laws to determine what changes will be needed if the UK becomes a third country overnight.</p><p>  On 22 February, the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019, known as the Brexit omnibus Bill or BOB, was published.  This landmark legislation crosses the remit of nine Ministers and is made up of 15 parts, all of which are designed to prepare Ireland for a no-deal Brexit.  The senior officials group on legislation will continue to work on the omnibus Bill as it progresses through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Work is continuing in parallel on complementary and necessary secondary legislation.  The Government will continue to work very closely with Opposition parties in the Oireachtas and all members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to ensure that this necessary legislation will be in place by 29 March 2019 in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p></reply>

Every time, the Taoiseach has replied that he is not contemplating or planning for a hard border but he has steadfastly refused to actually answer the specific question.  Even for him, this has been a remarkable display of ignoring what one has been asked.  It may very well be that Brexit will not be happening on 29 March due to an extension, as yet not agreed, but the Taoiseach has repeatedly said that we have to be ready for any eventuality.  He has also said that the United Kingdom leaving without a deal has major implications for the Border.  He is saying that we have to be ready and that something will happen but, with 24 days to go, he refuses to say what exactly will happen.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach not realise that there are orders already under production that will be delivered after 29 March?  Why is Ireland the only member of the EU that has not said what will happen on its borders in a no-deal scenario?  Today it is being reported that armed units of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are being sent to the Border in anticipation of a no-deal Brexit.  Are these reports false or are they confirmation that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, was correct and the T&aacute;naiste was wrong when the former claimed that there were "immediate security implications"?  Last week Dublin Port confirmed that it will have enough custom checkpoints available on 29 March but that there will not be enough customs officials to staff them.  Does the Taoiseach think this is acceptable, given past assurances that everything would be ready by 29 March?  </p></speech>

I have been seeking clarification for some time as to what might constitute this legally binding assurance.  I understand that the British have abandoned the notion of altering the withdrawal agreement itself.  It has been the very clear position of the EU from the start that the agreement will not be altered.  I asked previously if the assurance might take the shape of an amendment to the political declaration.  While I understand that this is still a possibility, it will not constitute a legally binding commitment as far as the British are concerned.  What is the Taoiseach's understanding of the nature of the discussions now taking place in terms of what will give the British the guarantee they are seeking?  Will it be a European Council declaration that could be interpreted as legally binding?  Could it be, as was suggested this morning on the national airwaves, some sort of new arbitration system?  The latter hardly gives the British the guarantees they need.  I ask the Taoiseach to provide clarity to this House so that Members here are at least as well briefed as our British counterparts on what exactly is being negotiated to give the British the guarantee they require.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this is a very important issue for us?  This is a moment of peril for Ireland and we must not weaken in the firm resolve have shown thus far, in this House and across the European Union, to hold fast on an unalterable backstop until and unless something better replaces it.</p></speech>

Amendments that my colleagues and I put forward to the omnibus Bill have been ruled out of order and the Government does not deal with the possibility of such a border in that Bill.  The Taoiseach says publicly that the Government has done nothing to prepare for the possibility of a hard border between the North and South and yet we are hearing a constant drip, drip of commentary and reports which suggest that behind the scenes, the Government may be considering installing a physical border.  The latest of such reports, emblazoned on the front page of today's national newspapers, suggests that hundreds of garda&iacute; are being sent to the Border counties.  At Davos, the Taoiseach talked about the possibility of the Army being deployed along the Border and we have heard leading figures in the EU saying that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, measures would be needed to protect the integrity of the Single Market.  To say that there is a lack of clarity and certainty about the Government's intention to absolutely prevent, under all circumstances, a hard border between North and South would be putting it mildly.  Can the Taoiseach shed any light on this?  As the clock ticks down, there has to be a real fear that, unthinkable as it, such a border is being planned for, either by the Irish Government or the European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500018#R01100"><p>At this stage, with just 24 days to go, I ask the Taoiseach to confirm to the Oireachtas that he has not given any undertaking or intimation to any negotiating party that his Government or the Irish State will be in any way resiling from the backstop or Irish protocol, as it is currently drafted.  It is important that he makes that clear.  We may speculate as to what the British Government might seek to negotiate but important though that is, it is outside of our control.  We need a clear understanding of the resolve of the Taoiseach and his Government to remain steady and firm in a position for the backstop.</p><p>Will the Taoiseach simply place it on the record of the House that this is the position of the Government and that it will remain the position of the Government, irrespective of overtures from London or anywhere else?</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach confirm or deny the news of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being sent to the Border?  This matter is important.  Not to up the ante of dramatics around the Brexit issue but for people living in the Border areas, news like this certainly causes real concern.  Perhaps the Taoiseach can shed some light on this.  Is it true?  Is the story - as carried in the media - true, yes or no?</p> <p> Whatever way it happens, be it by accident or design, a no-deal Brexit means a hard border.  That is the upshot of it.  Will the Taoiseach tell us how he plans to mitigate that?  How will the Taoiseach stop that hardening of the Border?</p></speech>

I cannot predict with absolute certainty or absolute clarity what will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I do not believe that anybody can.  All we can do is plan for different scenarios.  I will say - and I am happy to say again - that we as a Government have made no plans for physical infrastructure, checks or controls on the land Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland under any scenario.  If we end up with no deal in a few weeks, we will have to have difficult discussions involving the European Commission and the UK Government on how we can protect the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union while avoiding the emergence of a hard border on the island.  The only workable solution we have come up with so far is what is written in the Irish protocol and the backstop, which is a system of regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the European Union, and also to an extent between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  People talk about alternative arrangements but the only thing we have written down, that we know works in law and in reality, is what is contained in the backstop.</p><p>On staffing, we had a memo to Cabinet today about no-deal Brexit planning.  We will be in a position to have some 400 Revenue and Customs people in place at the end of the month.  There also will be between 50 and 60 officials from the Department of Health and between 150 and 200 inspectors from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We are confident that the IT systems will be in place and that we will be able to implement the <i>acquis </i>at the ports and airports.</p><p>With regard to Border policing, I did not have a chance to read the story in today's newspapers, but my note says that there was an article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent </i>stating &quot;Armed support units will shortly be deployed around the clock in the Border region, under plans being finalised by Garda chiefs&quot;.  Anybody will appreciate there is a difference between the Border and the Border region.  The Border region is what other people would call the northern division of the Garda.  I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that in 2018, a cross-Border threat assessment was prepared jointly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.  This assessment estimated that some 43% of organised crime gangs in Northern Ireland have a cross-Border dimension.  Likewise mobile, organised crime groups responsible for multiple serious incidences of domestic burglary operate on an all-island basis.  There are also increasing incidences of borderless crimes such as cyberfraud and international terrorism.  This is the context in which the Garda Commissioner made an operational decision to establish another regional armed support unit, which will be based in County Cavan.  Members will appreciate that the detail on the number of garda&iacute; and resources allocated to this armed support unit is deemed to be operationally sensitive and cannot be disclosed for security reasons.  The Cavan Garda district armed support unit, ASU, is expected to become operational in the near future.  The Commissioner has now established armed support units in each of the six Garda regions to provide an armed response capacity and capability on a regional basis to support and supplement the national emergency response unit.  In the northern region ASUs are currently based in Ballyshannon and Dundalk Garda stations serving all Garda divisions comprising the northern region.  The unit based in Cavan will augment that.</p><p>A further 200 Garda recruits will attest later this week.  I understand that a further 49 newly attested garda&iacute; will be assigned to the northern region, which comprises the Border counties, but not the actual physical Border itself, which of course does not exist.</p><p>There is close and ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.  This measure consists of additional garda&iacute; and an additional armed support unit for what are the Border counties, but not the Border <i>per se</i>.  I believe this will be welcomed by people, in particular by those who have been subjected to burglaries, in that region.</p><p>Discussions are ongoing between the EU and the UK.  I do not have clarity on the content or form of any further guarantees that may be made around the backstop.  The ongoing work is focused on what guarantees could be given regarding the backstop that underline once again its temporary nature, and to give the appropriate legal assurances on both sides.  Prime Minister May has acknowledged the EU's position that the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated and that we cannot agree to anything that changes the meaning of the backstop therein.</p><p>We are open to providing further assurances on the temporary nature of the backstop but these can in no way contradict, change or undermine the legal operability thereof.</p></speech>

This was a valuable opportunity to update participants on the Government&rsquo;s position on the latest Brexit developments and on our intensive contingency planning work to prepare for a no-deal withdrawal by the UK.</p>  <p>  Having met the five main political parties in Belfast the previous week, I welcomed the opportunity once again to engage with political parties, North and South, and to hear the concerns of society and business, through interactive discussions on people, citizens and rights and on business preparations.  This has been a deep consultation exercise, which has helped to shape the Government&rsquo;s policies, strategy and objectives in the Article 50 negotiations and our domestic response to Brexit.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will produce a report of the proceedings and this will be published on its website.</p></reply>

Many businesses have told me about how slow everything has been to move from calling on people to be prepared and actually delivering substantive aid at the level of individual companies.  One and a half years after aid for the agrifood sector was announced, the loans are only beginning to be approved now.  Since last summer we have been seeking an update from Government on the preparedness data, which were formerly being prepared on a six-monthly basis.  For some reason the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the Government have decided to discontinue this research series.  Will the Taoiseach explain why the Government has not published any recent data on the level of business preparedness?  We have lots of data on the number of companies seeking basic information, but the more important information on the impact of Brexit and preparedness levels has disappeared.</p>  <p>  Last December the Taoiseach stated that the Government's intention was to ensure that every business which needs to be ready will be ready by 29 March.  What is the Taoiseach's current assessment of the level of preparedness?  Does the Taoiseach still believe that everything that can be done has been done?  If, as expected, there is an extension, what will be done to address clear deficiencies in preparations in the added time?</p></speech>

One of the aspects that impacted on that confidence over the last weekend was the sudden blowing up of the <i>voisinage</i>dispute when a Northern Ireland-registered vessel was arrested in Irish territorial waters.  I am aware there was immediate contact between the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il to fast-track legislation that has been stalled for some time.  What exactly is the Taoiseach's legislative solution?  There are concerns around finding a solution - which is important for all of us - but not one that does not address the issues that caused the court case to be taken in the first instance.  The case was taken by a number of fishermen who were very concerned about the impact of mussel dredging by Northern registered boats.</p><p>The concern is that one cannot restrict the impact to Northern boats only, as all UK-registered boats could avail of this gentleman's agreement, as it has been constituted to date.  Can the Taoiseach indicate, on foot of his deep involvement with this over the weekend, what exactly he understands the dispute to be and what specific legislative measures he wants to fast-track to address the matter into the future?  Will that provide the guarantee and assurance to people that it will not be a backdoor to wholesale access to Irish waters from other UK registered or, indeed, London agreement vessels, which would be very significant for the Irish fishing industry?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500020#T00200"><p>The atmosphere at the conference was one of apprehension and concern, in particular on the part of the business people there.  It is particularly an issue for small businesses, of which there are many on both sides of the Border.  Most hauliers in Ireland are small to medium-sized businesses and the average fleet size is approximately five trucks.  No matter what happens, there will be a significant increase in the volume of documentation that will have to accompany imports and exports.  That means massive costs in time, administration and money for most medium-sized businesses.  I heard on the fringe of the meeting people voicing their concern that very little has been made explicit to them.  I understand that because the Taoiseach does not know exactly what is going to happen, he does not want to frighten people.  On the other hand, people need to undertake a great deal more preparation than we have seen.  There has not been enough outreach.  For instance, works on the former customs building in Dundalk are the talk of that town, notwithstanding claims that nothing is going to happen.  Clearly, however, documentation will have to increase with any change in the UK's status.  It would be better if people were prepared for that now in order that they can minimise the disruption that might, unfortunately, happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.246" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500020#T00300"><p>I agree with the Taoiseach that the all-island civic dialogue has been a necessary and useful exercise.  I am interested to know what his future plans for the dialogue are.  Does he foresee it becoming a forum for exchanges on Ireland post Brexit?  Whatever way this lands and whether it is hard or soft, Brexit will have huge implications for the entire island.  We need to work to involve unionism in this format.  I note that the Taoiseach spoke at the Alliance Party conference at the weekend, which was extremely positive.  More unionist opinion needs to be engaged, whether that is through political parties or more generally across society, or civic unionism, if I can use that term.  The forum needs to be a space for those views to be articulated.  Can the Taoiseach share with the House what he sees as the future of the dialogue?</p>  <p>  On the last occasion we met, in addition to issues around business, commerce and trade, huge issues were raised around citizens' rights.  Famously, the Taoiseach assured Northern citizens that they would never again be left behind.  The truth, however, is that they are being left behind.  Even in the best-case scenario now, where the backstop or protocol is honoured and delivered, there nevertheless will be a significant move away from the initial promise to Irish and EU citizens that they would be free to exercise and enjoy their rights where they resided.  That is now not the case, which is a very serious matter and one people are very seized of at this moment.  It is a pity the Taoiseach did not avail of the opportunity to afford the two additional European Parliament seats to the people of the North.  It could and should have been done.  The Taoiseach should have put his money where his mouth was as regards not leaving people behind and allowed people right across society in the North to return two representatives to the European Parliament.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500020#T00400"><p>I also attended the dialogue and while dialogue is, of course, important in this current situation of Brexit, it is not much good if some of those involved are not in full possession of the real story.  The Taoiseach says he has not read the report on the front page of one of the national newspapers on hundreds of garda&iacute; being deployed to the Border counties.  It is astonishing that he has not read the report.  If I understood his reply correctly, the Taoiseach said the deployment had nothing to do with Brexit and the possibility of a hard border.  It is simply a coincidence and involves a more general concern about organised crime.  Can the Taoiseach clarify that is what he is actually saying in order that the House understands?  Most people reading the newspapers today will have considered the report to have something to do with preparations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the possibility of a hard border.  That anxiety and fear will have been fuelled by comments the Taoiseach made in Davos referring to the deployment of the Army.</p>  <p>  Another important item of information I seek in this regard is whether the Taoiseach has had any discussions with EU Commissioners, Barnier, Juncker or leaders like Macron and Merkel about what they mean when they talk about the need to protect the integrity of the Single Market in the event that there is no deal.  What are they expecting?  I am fearful that there will be pressure from that quarter on the Taoiseach in the event that there is no deal.  I find it hard to believe the Taoiseach has not asked them what they mean when they make those sorts of statements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500020#T00500"><p>To clarify matters for Deputy Boyd Barrett, the position is that we are improving and increasing Garda resources all over the country.  There are more garda&iacute;, more armed support units, more vehicles and more investments and, as such, it should surprise no one that the Border region, or the northern division as the Garda calls it, should see increased deployment of garda&iacute; and armed support units.  It is happening everywhere in the country, which is the context in which it is happening there.  I am happy to clarify that it would be happening, Brexit or no Brexit, due, unfortunately, to the level of crime people experience in Ireland, not least on foot of armed burglaries in rural areas on which we are determined to crack down, not only in Cavan, Donegal and Louth, but everywhere in the country.</p><p>Deputy Burton asked about customs declarations.  At the meeting, figures were released on the number of customs declarations which will increase from approximately 1 million to 20 million.  That is a roughly 20-fold increase in the level of information and documentary obligations falling on business, which would impose considerable costs in time and administration.  We are trying to make the process, if it happens, as simple as possible through the use of ICT that did not exist 20 or 30 years ago and training is also on offer for businesses that want it.</p><p>The Government's policy on <i>voisinage</i>is to restore the situation to the <i>status quo ante</i>, which means going back to what we thought the law was before the Supreme Court struck it down in 2016.  That situation involves a reciprocal arrangement to allow vessels from Northern Ireland to enter our six-mile limit just as vessels from Ireland can now enter the six-mile limit in Northern Ireland.  It is quite an unfair situation currently as vessels from south of the Border can enter the Northern Ireland six-mile limit waters whereas vessels from Northern Ireland cannot enter ours.  We want to correct that situation.  While there were complications previously around large vessels, large vessels are all now banned from the six-mile limit and I hope we can, therefore, get cross-party support to get the relevant legislation through.  The Bill has been published and passed on Second Stage in the Seanad and I hope it can be enacted by Easter.  It would help if the UK Government clarified its intention not to withdraw Northern Ireland from the London convention, but we are not going to make that a precondition.</p><p> With regard to European Parliament representation, it is not possible to have a constituency for the European Parliament that is outside the European Union and only EU citizens can vote in European elections.  That is in the treaties.  It would not be possible to have a constituency of Northern Ireland.  Even if it was possible, only EU and Irish citizens would be allowed to vote.  One would have to forbid UK citizens from voting and that would be a problem.  However, in voting for Mr. Mark Durkan in the European elections people will have an opportunity to ensure there is somebody living in Derry who can represent all of the Ireland in the European Parliament.  We will look at other mechanisms that might work.  Accession countries can elect observers to the European Parliament and perhaps we might do something similar for Northern Ireland, but I cannot promise that at this stage.</p> <p> Regarding citizens' rights, people living in Northern Ireland who hold Irish citizenship and, therefore, EU citizenship will continue to have citizens' rights.  They include the right to work, study and travel anywhere within the European Union without the need for a visa, permit or the like.  If the withdrawal agreement is adopted, they will continue to have access to the European health insurance card and be able to participate in the Erasmus programme during the transition period.  I committed in Belfast last weekend to making it a negotiating priority for me in the future relationship talks to ensure EU citizens living in Northern Ireland would be treated as though they were resident in the European Union when it came to practical rights and privileges such as the European health insurance card and participation in the Erasmus programme.  I also want Northern Ireland's universities to be able to opt into EU research programmes.</p></speech>

I meet and speak regularly to my counterparts, bilaterally, at formal and informal meetings of the European Council and on the margins of international meetings such as the World Economic Forum which I attended earlier this year.  Such engagement is crucial to ensure partners are fully aware of our positions on Brexit and other important EU issues and, more generally, further strengthen our relationships for the period ahead.</p>  <p>  I had an informal engagement in Lisbon with the Prime Minister, Ant&oacute;nio Costa, at his invitation, on the evening of 15 February.  Our ambassador to Portugal joined us for the meeting.  We discussed bilateral relations between our two countries, which are excellent, as well as the forthcoming European elections.  We also exchanged views on a number of EU issues, including the latest developments related to Brexit and the political situation in the United Kingdom, as well as preparations at domestic and EU level in case the United Kingdom exits the European Union without a deal.</p>  <p>  I again met Prime Minister Costa on the margins of the EU-Arab League summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on 24 and 25 February.  I used the opportunity of the summit to also speak informally to Presidents Tusk and Juncker, as well the Prime Ministers of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Greece, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Finland, Sweden, Italy and the Czech Republic, the President of Cyprus and the Chancellor of Austria.  As Deputies are aware, I had met more formally Presidents Tusk and Juncker and Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt when I visited Brussels earlier that month.</p>  <p>  I met Prime Minister May most recently on the margins of the EU-Arab League summit.</p>  <p>  The French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, paid a courtesy call to me on 26 February, following his meeting with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, who joined us.  We spoke about current EU issues, particularly Brexit.  The Minister, Mr. Le Maire, reiterated France&rsquo;s unwavering solidarity on the backstop and its firm view that the withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated.</p>  <p>  Most recently, on 4 March, I met Prime Minister Skvernelis of Lithuania in Dublin.  We discussed the positive bilateral relations between Ireland and Lithuania and a range of EU agenda issues.

The Portuguese are well known for being very good contractors.  Given the pickle the Government has been in because of the extraordinary cost of the national children's hospital, did it occur to the Taoiseach to obtain some friendly advice from another European country on how to manage costs?  The issue was underlined again this morning in one of the newspapers which reported that HSE internal documents from the estates department showed that as far back as last May the head of estates in the HSE had made it clear that the budget figures for the children's hospital would have to be available for inputting into the budget last October.  That would be the normal practice with which I am familiar.  Big capital budgets must be considered in the context of the overall budget.  This makes a nonsense of what the Minister for Health has asserted, that the children's hospital budget had no bearing on the overall budget announced last autumn.  It is simply not credible to most people who are experienced in how government works in this country.</p></speech>

What were the circumstances?  Was the meeting organised in advance or did the Taoiseach happen to be in Portugal and just call in to see him?  The media were not informed in advance and not brought along.  It was published via a tweet afterwards, which caused some surprise at the time.  Why was the meeting informal and not formal, given that the Taoiseach met other European leaders in a formal context?</p>  <p>  The British Attorney General has been in ongoing contact with Dublin in the past month and it is now clear that tripartite negotiations are under way.  On Saturday it was reported that Brussels would basically accept anything Dublin was willing to accept, but it was also stated there was a belief that the major stumbling block to agreeing to whatever was being discussed was the Taoiseach's fear that he might not be able to manage the politics of the situation.  Of course, the Taoiseach will deny that anything of the sort is an issue.  Will he explain to the House exactly what he has been discussing?  "Clarification" and "reassurance" are fine words, but what do they mean in practice?  Is the Taoiseach saying he is not willing to agree to anything that would give greater legal certainty to the United Kingdom's ability to leave the backstop - in an earlier reply he described the temporary nature of the backstop - or is he saying the backstop is intended to be temporary and that he is okay with reinforcing the fact that it will be temporary?</p>  <p>  It appears that a committee of Tory backbenchers is receiving detailed legal briefings and will have a chance to review the text and the UK Attorney General's advice before the debate on 12 March.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to provide the same courtesy for this House?  If he will be making legal claims at some stage about what was agreed to, it is important that he be up-front with this House also.  What is he prepared to do to ensure D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will at least have the same level of access to the deal and its legal interpretation as the British Parliament?</p></speech>

There are major parallels, historically and socially, between Portugal and Ireland in the sense that Portugal developed a big problem with illicit drugs at a similar time to this country in the 1980s.  It was an enormous problem, with high rates of HIV, drug related crime, addiction and so forth.  Portugal made the brave decision in 2001 to decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit drugs and it has been a spectacular success.  HIV and drug related crime rates have plummeted.  The levels of addiction have not disappeared completely, but they have reduced dramatically and stabilised.  I heard the Taoiseach say recently that he wanted to have a health led approach to dealing with the drug problem.</p><p>People Before Profit has long advocated for that approach.  It is long overdue that we move in that direction because criminalisation has not worked.  As shown in Portugal, decriminalisation and wrap around support policies can make a difference in dealing with this problem.  Did the Taoiseach discuss that model and does he think it needs to be considered for this country because the way we have dealt with it up to now in terms of criminalisation has not worked?</p></speech>

I did not understand the point Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was trying to make in regard to the backstop.  I am assuming he was not suggesting or encouraging that the Government might resile from the content of the backstop.  If he was, I want to pour cold water on it.  It is essential at this juncture that the Government does not blink and that it is not distracted or unnerved on any level.  The backstop is the absolute bare minimum.  Whereas legal assurances and words of comfort are one thing and might be entertained, nothing that in any way compromises what are the absolute bottom line requirements as per the current Irish protocol should be entertained for a second.  There needs to be clarity around that.  For what it is worth, I also think that the Taoiseach as Head of Government deserves and should expect the support of the Oireachtas in adopting and maintaining that stance.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said he has not seen the form of reassurances that the British side might want.  Has he had any indication as to what they will be putting on the table?  I am sure, through his contacts, formal and informal, he must have some notion of how they are proposing to come at this.</p></speech>

The informal meeting in Lisbon with Prime Minister, Ant&oacute;nio Costa, was exactly that.  We got to know each other a little over the years and I was there on a personal visit.  I told him I was there and he invited me over to his residence for a glass of wine and a chat.  I brought the ambassador with me and he brought one of his officials with him.  That was about the size of it.  I do not think there is any need for conspiracy theories on this one.</p>  <p>  We did not have a chance to discuss hospital construction.  I imagine construction costs are lower in Portugal.  I imagine labour costs are lower as well and professional fees are less.  I do not know if material costs are lower but they may well be.  Generally, Governments and Government agencies examine capital programmes in other countries and try to learn from what they do well and what they do badly and vice versa.  A lot of people examine our programmes too.  By and large for the past ten years we have been successful in delivering a capital programme on time and on budget.  This is true for the massive Irish Water investment programme, the school programme, which is really big, the primary care centres, the &euro;300 million Luas cross-city project and the &euro;500 million projects such as the M17 and M18 and Enniscorthy-New Ross.  The vast majority of projects have come in broadly on time and on budget in the past ten years, the children's hospital being the notable exception.</p>  <p>  There are examples of how it has gone wrong in other countries.  Karolinksa hospital in Sweden will probably cost somewhere around &euro;6 billion by the time it is finished.  It is easily the most expensive hospital project in the world.  We all know the problems that have arisen in Australia as well in terms of the parliamentary inquiries into the cost of the new hospital in Perth and the problems that have arisen in Adelaide.  Those of us who are interested in aviation will know about Brandenburg Airport, a new airport for Berlin completed five years and not yet open.  There is a lot to be learned from what other countries get right and what they get wrong.  Unfortunately, big capital projects go wrong in all countries.  We need to ensure, particularly when it comes to the new children's hospital, that we do not run into the problems around commissioning that other countries have had.  We need to prepare now for that.  I have seen examples of other children's hospitals built, which it took three years to commission when construction had finished.  We cannot allow that to happen in Ireland.  We need to plan for that now.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Brexit negotiations, briefings are, of course, available to Opposition Leaders.  We are happy to provide them.  The position as of today is that we have no texts or draft texts to consider or get legal advice on.  I am not entirely sure what MPs are looking at in London but we have no legal texts or draft legal texts to consider, to propose amendments to or to seek legal advice on.  What happens a lot in London, as Deputies will be aware, is internal negotiations.</p></speech>

The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, under the Chairmanship of the now Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, did an interesting report on the issue.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Portuguese model has been successful in terms of harm reduction and not imposing criminal convictions on people for minor possession, thus keeping people who were found to be in possession of minor amounts of narcotics out of the criminal justice system and dealing with them in the health system, thereby ensuring that these people, who are mainly young people, do not get a criminal conviction which then causes problems for them for the rest of their lives in terms of getting employment, visas and so on.  That seems to me to be a humane approach, although it is evident that drugs and narcotics are very available in Lisbon.  They are sold openly on the streets and squares.  People will probably tell me that is true of Dublin too but they seem to be more available there than they are in our cities so we would have to bear that in mind as part of any model that we may wish to consider.  The issue of decriminalisation is being examined by a group headed up by Mr. Justice Garrett Sheehan and I look forward to seeing the report when it is done.</p></speech>

The purpose of it is to get an update from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, on the status of that work.  As the Minister will be aware there is a recruitment and retention crisis across the Defence Forces which I know is an issue of concern across the board.  I look forward to the Minister's update.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the first module was published by the commission in August 2018 and deals with issues relating to nursing and midwifery, non-consultant hospital doctors and hospital consultants.  The commission has not yet confirmed a timeline for completion of the further modules of its work programme, which will examine recruitment and retention issues in other areas of the health sector, the Defence Forces and the Civil Service, building on the preliminary analysis in its 2017 report and on the various submissions it has received.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Defence Forces, I understand that written submissions have been received from both the employer and the staff associations.  Oral presentations are scheduled for this week, following which I expect the pay commission to be in a position to indicate a likely timeline for the completion of the Defence Forces module.  I understand the pay commission has engaged an independent firm to conduct a survey of Defence Forces personnel to assist in the analysis.  This follows on from a study conducted in the second half of 2018 of specialist personnel in the Defence Forces.  The main data gathering for the survey, which is being facilitated through the Defence Forces, will be conducted in February and March 2019.</p></speech>

I understand that the current number is 8,874, which is below the threshold of 9,000 the Government indicated it would not allow the Defence Forces to fall below and which is far short of the 9,500, which was set out within the White Paper.  Will the Minister clarify the role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of this issue?  He referred to oral presentations, but I understand that the Chief of Staff made a presentation before the commission on behalf of staff and management this morning, and that he was accompanied by officials from not only the Department of Defence but also the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We know that the latter Department was very much involved in a submission made in September by the Department of Defence and military management.  Why is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform directly involved in detailed presentations by the military and the Department of Defence?</p></speech>

As a result, we are present or involved in the preparation of submissions to the pay commission.  The Deputy will know that in addition to the submissions that the employer makes, submissions are also made by those who represent employees, which, one hopes, allows the Public Service Pay Commission to make a nuanced conclusion in respect of the different issues it examines and make recommendations that will form the basis of acceptance by both sides.  The short answer, as I have stated, is that my Department is present because of its responsibility for overall pay policy.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister's determination to uphold the integrity of the public service stability agreement, which I support.  We are dealing with a construct, however, within the confines of that agreement to address specifically a crisis in recruitment and retention.  Any recommendations or any report of the pay commission will need to be evidence based and, therefore, it must be methodical and thorough in its work.  The Minister stated that an independent firm is involved and that the survey work of the personnel directly involved has been ongoing in February and March.  Members of the Defence Forces, however, want to know when there will be an outcome.  Does the Minister have any expectation or understanding as to when he will receive the Public Service Pay Commission's report on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces?</p></speech>

It is independent of my Department and reaches its own conclusions about the report and its processes.  Nevertheless, as I have outlined, I expect the commission to indicate soon the timeline of the completion of the work.  I hope that its indication of a timeline, which will be the first time it will be done publicly, will be of help in managing its work and in maintaining confidence in its work.</p></speech>

These include transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination, proportionality and mutual recognition.  The European Union directives set out the legal framework for the award of contracts that exceed the specified monetary threshold for supplies, services and works.  Under Article 69 of Directive 2014/24/EU, the EU directive governing public procurement, contracting authorities are obliged to require tenderers to explain the price or costs in a tender where tenders appear to be abnormally low in relation to the works, supplies or services.  Contracting authorities must assess the response from the tenderer before coming to a decision as to whether they will admit the tender or reject it on the basis that it is abnormally low.  Where the explanation provided by a tenderer does not satisfactorily account for the low level of price or costs, having taken into account the circumstances outlined in the procurement directives, the contracting authority may reject the tender, although it is not obliged to do so.  When investigating what may appear to be an abnormally low tender, contracting authorities must take into consideration the possibility that the tenderer may be obtaining more favourable terms from suppliers and subcontractors than rival tenderers.</p>  <p>  There is little scope for manoeuvre on labour rates since contractors are required by law to pay workers covered by the sectoral employment orders, SEOs, in accordance with the terms of the applicable SEO.  More efficient methods, however, of working to reduce labour costs cannot be ruled out in assessing a tender.  Notwithstanding this, there is nothing to prevent an entity from performing a contract at a loss, subject to it being compliant with labour, social and environmental regulations.  Where the contracting authority discovers that the price is abnormally low because the tenderer is not meeting its obligations in the field of social, labour or environmental law, the tender must be rejected.  Where works contracts are concerned, specific reference to unbalanced tenders and abnormally low tenders is made in section 8 of the standard template instructions to tenderers published under the capital works management framework.  These documents, which constitute the rules under which a tender competition is run, must be used in all public works contracts and have been published since 2008.</p></speech>

It is contained in SI 284/2016, which deals with abnormally low contracts, but that is not the question I asked.  Rather, I asked whether any guidance notes on the matter had been issued by the Department since 2011.  While we are on the subject of abnormally low contracts and how they are meant to be addressed by the contracting authority, will the Minister of State explain why the contract for the national children's hospital was not considered an abnormally low contract?  Perhaps the Minister of State has different information to me, but why were no discussions, as far as I am aware, entered into in respect of that particularly low contract?</p></speech>

This was established by the Government contracts committee for construction, which engaged in its work from May 2014 over a long period.  Derogations are allowed in exceptional circumstances, where there can be a presentation to the Government contracts committee for construction, which is a separate entity, to indicate that the circumstances of the standard work contract would not suit the development of a particular piece of infrastructure which in this case was the national children's hospital.</p><p>With regard to available guidance, the Deputy has outlined that he is aware of the regulations as set out in the statutory instrument and the law itself.  There are provisions of guidance and supports available to contractors in advance of a tender being submitted through the contracting authorities, which will clarify individual issues in advance of the tender being submitted, and through representative organisations.  The small and medium enterprise committee within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which I chair, has representative organisations from across the sector and I am sure they will be able to engage with the sector on that.</p></speech>

Why was the guidance and law related to the statutory instrument not adhered to and implemented with regard to this project when there was an abnormally low contracting price compared with the other prices tendered for?  One of the individuals who sat on the development board and was responsible for that contract was put on the board because of his expertise and knowledge in this area.</p></speech>

Where there are issues of abnormally low tenders, the contracting authority, whether a public body or State agency, does not have to accept the tender, and I have outlined the reasons for that.  As well as that, once a contract for a tender is awarded, there is a dispute resolution mechanism.  There can be issues with the tender after it has been awarded where there needs to be dispute resolution and issues arise that would not have been foreseen.  On the issue that the Deputy raises, I am sure that the PwC report that has been charged with looking at all of this will enlighten all of us and the debate in its entirety.  I cannot comment on an individual case because, regardless of the contract, it is up to the contracting authority, which is the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, and its parent Department, the Department of Health, which has ultimate responsibility for it.</p></speech>

I am satisfied that there is a firm understanding at an EU level of the unique and disproportionate impact that Brexit will have on Ireland.</p>  <p>  Last March, the T&aacute;naiste met EU budget Commissioner Oettinger when he visited Ireland and discussed with him the negative consequences to the Irish economy resulting from Brexit and the possibility of EU assistance.  In November, in its contingency action plan, the Commission confirmed that it would support Ireland in finding solutions addressing the specific challenges of Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  Officials at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and its agencies have been working closely with the European Commission and Directorate General for Competition since November 2017 through the Irish-EU technical working group on state aid.  Through the mechanism of the technical working group, Ireland has fully utilised the provisions of the state aid framework to enable the investment by Enterprise Ireland of &euro;74 million in Brexit impacted businesses in 2018.</p>  <p>  On 24 January 2019, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, met the European Commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager.  The focus of the meeting centred around the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p>  <p>  The Stability and Growth Pact provides flexibility for budgetary requirements in certain circumstances.  One such provision relates to unusual events outside of the control of government which have a negative impact on the budgetary position.  If the impact of a disorderly Brexit were to be severe, the Government could make a case for an application for the use of the so-called unusual events clause, which permits temporary deviations from our medium-term budgetary objective or the adjustment path towards it.  This could facilitate extra spending linked to the disorderly Brexit as long as it does not endanger our medium-term budgetary sustainability.</p></speech>

Will the Minister outline to the House any specifics of what European authorities have committed to doing to assist the areas of the economy that will be worst-affected, including farmers, the food sector, agrifood and indigenous manufacturing?  We have the Brexit loan scheme which is welcome and is supported by the European Investment Bank.  Are there other specifics where commitments have been given where, in the event of a disorderly Brexit, direct and immediate supports are required?  Has the nature of those supports been scoped out yet?  Do we know what they are and how they will be administered?  With only such a short window left, people want to know whether specifics have been agreed, and if so, what they are.</p></speech>

At this point the Commission, through many Commissioners, has indicated its support in principle and its firm commitment to supporting Ireland in facing this grave difficulty.  It will use the flexibility that is open to it to support us in decisions that we need to make.  Commissioner Vestager has already publicly said that the Commission would stand ready to act urgently in mitigation of the impact of Brexit on Irish firms.  The fact that she has given that commitment publicly is a strong advance on where we have been previously.  Due to the work that the Minister, Deputy Creed, has under way, Commissioner Hogan has reiterated the EU's readiness to respond to support Irish farmers and the Irish agricultural community in particular.  We will be in a position to give further specifics on this as soon as we are clear on the nature of the event that we are responding to, if this event happens at the end of March.</p></speech>

There has been strong solidarity among our European partners on the issue of Brexit, so that should be acknowledged.  These words of support from the European Commission and others are important.  I assume that in the background the Government has been scoping out and fleshing out what would be asked for in that scenario.  We have the commitment of support from Europe on the one hand, but I expect that with what the Government is doing across all the various strands of state aid and direct support for agrifood and indigenous manufacturing, we have worked out precisely what we will be asking for in the event of a no-deal Brexit materialising on 29 March.  I welcome what the Minister has said about state aid.  An important commitment has been given about flexibility.  Will the Minister reassure the House that the Government is finalising what those asks are in the background?</p></speech>

There has been considerable effort to get ready for Brexit, with the support of this House and the support of the Deputy's party in various budgets.  I hope I am not speaking too soon but I think we should not underestimate the amount of co-operation going on to enable the passage of a Brexit omnibus Bill this week.</p><p>It puts into sharp focus the co-operation in Ireland to help the Government and the people respond to the great external risk we face. </p> <p> In response to the Deputy's question on whether we are clear on the options we might need to pursue in the light of Brexit in the different forms we could face in a few weeks' time, yes, I am clear on the different issues I might face and the different needs we might have and how I would need to respond to them.  We do, of course, hope none of this will come to pass.  The point at which we will need to translate the support in principle into detailed action will be in the early phases of an event that we are all working to avoid.</p></speech>

What I am asking is whether there will be delays in meeting some of the completion dates previously outlined or whether the start dates of some projects will be put back.  There may be reasons for putting them back, including planning reasons or whatever else, and if that is the case, I am sure the Minister of State will tell me, but I want clarity on whether there are projects the completion or commencement dates of which are being pushed out as a result of the re-profiling of the &euro;3 million worth of investment.</p></speech>

Some of them have started, while some are in the planning pipeline.  To reiterate what I said: there will be no delays, but there could, as the Deputy said, be delays because of planning issues.  For example, I was hoping to be in Cork, with work started and machines on site, at the end of last year, but that did not happen.  However, it was outside our control because people were objecting.  The same is true of the project in Ennis south.  I was hoping to be there at the end of last summer, but we will be signing the contracts next week.  Some schemes might be delayed in the planning process, but I believe and know that the &euro;3 million worth of investment has been lost because of the delays in moving those schemes through the planning process.  There are, however, many schemes that will be achieved.  When I was asked about the cut of &euro;3 million, I took it out of the area of flood relief measures for the simple reason that I knew some of the schemes were being delayed in the planning process.  They might be delayed by two or three months.</p></speech>

If that is the case, I welcome it, but there has been some confusion.  However, if that is the answer, I accept it fully.  Will the Minister of State clarify that no projects have been delayed as a result of the re-profiling?

The relevant Minister is the Minister under whose aegis the body falls.   The purpose of the protocol is to set out the reporting obligations of the nominee civil servant board member in the extreme situation where serious issues arise that are not being addressed by the board and where the chairperson of the board does not report such.  Accordingly, for example, the circular provides that where there is a significant public policy issue or where there is disagreement at board level, the civil servant board member should request the chairman to notify the Minister or failing that, notify the Minister himself or herself.  Moreover, the circular provides that the civil servant board member should present information directly to the relevant Minister in cases where there are serious weaknesses in controls that have not been addressed, or where there is a significant strategic or reputational risk to the body that is not being addressed, or where there are serious concerns about possible illegality or fraud.  The operation of the circular is subject to the legal common law, fiduciary and statutory responsibilities of the nominee civil servant board member.</p>  <p>  The protocol is intended to contribute to greater accountability in the non-commercial State sector by providing further guidance for civil servant nominees on the boards of non-commercial State bodies above and beyond the governance framework already prescribed for all members of State boards and set out in the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  In the normal course of events the correct line of authority is from the chairman of the board to the relevant Minister.  As a general principle, the civil servant nominee board member has a responsibility to act collectively in decision-making and I am satisfied that Circular 12/2010 issued by my Department provides guidance and guidelines for civil servants nominated to the boards of non-commercial State bodies which ensures proper accountability and reporting arrangements.</p></reply>

There has to be something deeply wrong with the arrangements the Minister has outlined if the cost overruns that have been experienced happened and nobody from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is charged with overseeing public expenditure to prevent a further collapse of the economy saw himself or herself as able or required, or saw it as appropriate, to tell the Minister about what was happening.  Moreover, there are further revelations in today's newspapers that, in fact, the head of estates in the Health Service Executive who is on various committees dealing with the national children's hospital made it very clear as far back as last May that there were serious problems with cost overruns, yet it seems the civil servant on the board did not do anything.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health, who sat across from him at the Cabinet table decided he did not have to tell him.  That cuts against the grain of everything that happens at budget time, not just in the context of current but also capital expenditure.</p></speech>

I have acknowledged and accept my responsibility for the difficulties with the project.  In answer to the Deputy's question on whether I am happy with the way in which the civil servant on the board fulfilled his duties, the answer is yes because it is very clear that the issue needs to be raised with the line Department.</p><p>The view of my official, whom I have met to discuss this matter, is that the issue was being raised with the Department of Health.

Given that a world-level overrun is happening in the case of the national children's hospital in Ireland, when does common sense click in?  I would have expected that a senior civil servant would discuss this matter with others so that the children's hospital project would come to fruition and the taxpayers of Ireland, and their hard-earned money, would not be taken for a complete ride.  The Minister has said he is happy with the arrangements that have led to this outcome.  I think that happiness is misplaced.  As there are so few people in his Department, I assume everybody pretty much knows everybody.  I am sure lots of cups of coffee and tea are shared.  The Minister needs to give serious consideration to why no one within his very small Department thought to say to him, at the time of the budget or at some other time, that there was a serious problem with costs.</p></speech>

I said I was satisfied with the operation of the circular.  The Deputy either misinterpreted me, or she deliberately attributed words to me that I did not say.  It is up to her to decide which of those possibilities is the case.  I never at any point said I was happy with the processes that have led to this.  I have already outlined what I am going to do to change them.  Work is under way to change them.  I have said that the way in which this issue developed, particularly the latter phase of it, needs to change in the future and will change.  The Deputy will never acknowledge that we get the majority of projects right.  We will deliver three major transport projects on time and on track this year.  We will deliver major projects like primary schools and primary care centres all over this country in the way the taxpayer wants.  I am not looking to minimise in any way the anger and concern caused by the national children's hospital project.  I will not have words attributed to me that I did not state.</p></speech>

As the Deputy may be aware, it falls outside the statutory remit of the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery.  I am aware of the issues in question.  The topic has been raised in general discussions as part of the normal engagement my officials and I have with the regulator's office on matters pertaining to governance.  We receive general updates on the regulator's activities in exercising her functions, as set out in the National Lottery Act 2013.  In a recent meeting, the regulator expressed concern about the potential future impact of online lottery betting in Ireland.  The context for the operation of the national lottery has changed significantly since its original establishment in 1986.  The national lottery remains an important asset.  The level of moneys raised for use by good causes has increased steadily in recent years.  It increased by 28% between 2014 and 2018.  As set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2019, this year's estimated total expenditure of &euro;333 million for good causes will be part funded by approximately &euro;225 million from the national lottery, with the remainder being funded by the Exchequer.  While this is a dynamic and rapidly evolving market, the national lottery continues to deliver strong results.  The most recent reports and financial statements of the current operator, Premier Lotteries Ireland, show that gross ticket sales rose by 6.1% in 2017.  Against this background, there does not appear to be any evidence of a significant impact on the national lottery arising from online lottery betting at present.  My officials will continue to engage with the regulator and Premier Lotteries Ireland to review the impact of online lottery betting websites on the national lottery and the good causes fund.</p></speech>

I think he has conceded that it is a threat.  It would have a negative impact on the good causes fund.  As he indicated in his answer, the Minister appreciates the &euro;225 million that goes to a wide range of community, sporting, cultural and other events throughout Ireland.  Other countries have taken action to reduce the risk to their national lotteries from these unregulated offshore lotteries to ensure funds are held for good causes.  Why does the Minister sound so reluctant to intervene in this case?  Most people who are aware that gambling is a serious problem know that this kind of online gambling is becoming more prevalent.</p></speech>

I could take any year as a benchmark.  In 2011, the figure was &euro;230 million.  It decreased to &euro;178 million in 2014.  That figure has now rebuilt to &euro;227 million.  The contribution the national lottery is making had increased in recent years, but it may have stabilised or plateaued, depending on one's perspective, between 2017 and 2018.  The Deputy asked about the engagement of my office and my Department with the regulator on this matter.  My understanding of the view of the regulator is based on an extract from the last engagement with our regulator that has been shared with me.  The regulator knows that this could be a long-term issue.  At the moment, the type of gambling under way here that could present a difficulty to the lottery is small in scale.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will bring a report to the Government shortly in relation to the regulation of the gambling sector.  I think that will provide a valuable platform for dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

I appreciate that it is also developing quickly in many other areas.</p><p>We have heard about the gambling regulator and gambling regulation legislation over a very long time.  Despite all the talk, nothing has happened.  The Minister may wish to see it introduced.  However, the threat to the national lottery exists in the here and now.  We will welcome whatever the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is going to do in due course.  However, this particular problem needs to be addressed in the here and now.  It would be foolish to think we can leave it to one side until we bring in the gambling regulator's office.  Maybe that will happen but maybe it will not.  It has been very slow to materialise.  I would appreciate any advice from it but I do not know when it is going to come.</p></speech>

It appears to me that the only way in which we can deal with this issue is to look at how we can review and maybe change the 2013 general scheme of the gambling control Bill.  The facts and figures indicate that the current contribution made by the national lottery to good causes has not yet been materially affected by other developments within the lotteries here in terms of online or electronic lotteries.  The contribution that the Exchequer has received from the national lottery attests to that.  I do acknowledge that although currently the competition is small, it can grow quickly.  Were it to grow quickly, it could in turn affect the contribution the national lottery can make to good causes.  We have to look at all this from a regulatory perspective.  The best and most effective way this can be done is through the review that is being undertaken of the 2013 scheme.</p></speech>

They had to retire as per their contract of employment.  A commitment was given, on a request from Deputy Cowen, that within three months there would be a report to see what could be done for those people.  I am looking for confirmation from the Minister that the report is being completed and will be published on time.</p></reply>

The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 provides for an increase to age 70 in the compulsory retirement age of most public servants recruited before 1 April 2004.  As Deputy Michael McGrath will be aware, public servants who reached the compulsory retirement age of 65 before the new legislation was enacted were required to retire in accordance with the statutory compulsory retirement age in effect at the time.  Those who availed of the interim arrangements did so in the knowledge that the contract was for one year only, until they reached the age of 66.  The Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Act 2018 has no effect on those public servants who availed of the interim arrangements.  The terms of their fixed-term contracts continue to apply and they will cease working at age 66 as previously provided for.</p>  <p>  Section 3A(6) of the Act provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform shall, within three months of the passing of the Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the public servants obliged to retire between 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act, due to reaching the age of 65 years, and on potential remedies to assist this cohort of worker.  Work on the report is under way in accordance with the terms of section 3A(6).  Under that provision, publication of the report is required within three months of the passing of the Act on 26 December and the Minister intends to comply with that timeline.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the content of a report which is under preparation and not completed, and which I am statutorily obliged to lay before the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

Is the Minister of State saying that the report will not set out potential remedies, including the possibility of people in that category being retained and being able to benefit from the principal measure of the Bill, namely, that people would be able to stay on until the age of 70?  Is the Minister of State saying definitively that the people who were captured by that interim measure will not under any circumstances be allowed to remain on until the age of 70?  Is it the case that this potential remedy will not be on the table as part of the report?</p></speech>

I accepted the amendment in good faith to see if there was a remedy that could address that cohort.  However, I put it on the record of the House and made it very clear that the spelling out of the legislation meant that those who entered into the interim arrangements when the Government decision was made did so in the full knowledge that it was for a year.  We also have to be very cognisant of those who did not enter into the interim arrangement who were civil and public servants as well.  If we were to unwind that commitment, where would we start?  Would we start at the Government's decision, the publication of the Bill or the passage of the Act?  To be fair to those civil and public servants who did not enter into the interim arrangements when they reached 65, they took the Government's word in good faith as well and accepted the bona fides of the Government that this was an interim arrangement for one year.  I did accept the amendment providing that we would have a report that would be brought before the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, laid before the House and published.  I said that if there were remedies there, they could be legislative in nature.  I also said that there might not be remedies to the issue at hand, given what we were trying to achieve, namely, to introduce a new age of retirement on 1 January.</p></speech>

What does he expect it to address?  Obviously he does not know what the content is but what are the issues that the report is examining?  When does he expect it to be made available?  We all understand what the legal position was prior to the enactment of this legislation.  People had contracts of employment and were required to retire.  As a concession, they were rehired for a period of one year.  Deputies Cowen and Darragh O'Brien would know more about the amendment than me because they were directly involved.  The spirit of the amendment was to see if there would be any way that those who wished to remain on beyond a year might possibly be accommodated and if they could avail of the principal benefit of the Bill.  I am not getting the sense that there is any likelihood of that.</p></speech>

That is not my job.  The provision of section 3A(6) requires that the report covers public servants who were forced to retire between the dates of 6 December 2017 and the commencement of the Act.  It is also very clear that the report is to cover all public servants who reached the compulsory retirement age in that prescribed period.  It will also have to take into account those who did not avail of the interim arrangements.  We have to be fair to everybody.</p>  <p>  I am being as honest as I can and the Deputy can take me at face value in this.  This was not a simple issue to resolve.  Everybody in the House regretted the fact that it had gone on for so long.  Everybody regretted that it took so long for the Bill to be brought before the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  The Deputy knows that we do not control the business of the House.  Every day that passed before the Bill was brought in here, another person entered the interim arrangements.  Unfortunately for a lot of people, they entered the interim arrangements while the Bill was waiting to get a time slot in the House.  That was beyond my control.  I accepted a suggestion from Deputy Cowen that it be looked at.  If there is a solution, it will certainly be considered but that has to be done in the context of what the Bill set out to achieve, namely, a new age of retirement on 1 January 2019 to allow people to work until they are 70.</p></speech>

I am asking specifically about schemes that are ready to proceed.  The Minister of State knows this area better than I do and he will know that the flood defence mechanisms in Athlone have been divided into eight cells.  Of those eight cells, seven have already been approved for planning.  The last cell has not yet gone through the planning process, while two of the seven have been substantially completed and two are under construction.  However, there are three cells that have planning and are ready to proceed, being Deer Park, the Strand and the lower end of Golden Island leading up to Carrickobreen.  Given that those schemes have planning and are ready to proceed, can the Minister of State confirm that these schemes will go ahead this year and the &euro;3 million cut, confirmed by the Minister of State earlier last month at an Oireachtas committee, will not result in a delay to the delivery of these schemes?  What schemes will be delayed?</p></speech>

Some of them are still subject to planning approval.  The Deputy questioned the situation in Athlone.  He knows well that the division of Athlone into eight cells was deliberately done to speed up the planning process and to deliver the scheme for the people of Athlone.  This has been questioned over the last number of weeks.  I do not like it when people play politics with flood defences.  I disagree with it.  I have stated quite clearly that no schemes will be delayed, at Athlone or anywhere else around the country.  If there are delays it will be because of the planning process.  I wanted to be on the ground in Cork last summer, and it did not happen.  I wanted work in south Ennis to have been commenced last year and it was not.  That is out of my control.  However, the delivery of schemes I have identified is continuing.  We are now in the great situation where 90 schemes have commenced.  We are working with local authorities up and down the country.  I have visited most of the local authorities.  We are providing them with the money to employ engineers.  We were spending &euro;2 million on minor works and we have now increased funding by &euro;5.6 million compared to last year.  That is a big jump in funding for flooding defences around the country.</p></speech>

I acknowledged the Minister of State's commitment to the area and his superior knowledge on this matter.  I am simply giving him an opportunity to speak on the record of the House about various flood schemes.  The Minister of State said at a committee meeting that he did not want to mislead anyone and that there would be &euro;3 million in cuts.  He said that his officials did not want him to go to the committee meeting because he would have to deliver bad news.  He was honest with the committee.  I am asking him to put on the record of the House today the flood defence mechanisms that have planning permission in place which will be delayed this year.  I acknowledge again, in case the Minister of State thinks I am playing politics, his superior knowledge of the situation in Athlone, but will there be any delay in completing the final three cells that have planning permission in place, namely Deer Park, the Strand and the lower end of Golden Island?  If the Minister of State cannot give me an answer now perhaps he could come back to me with a definitive answer on when those schemes will start.</p></speech>

The Minister of State had a capital programme planned for 2019 and projects listed.  Can he tell us what projects are delayed that will contribute to the saving he requires?  I am not referring to the cuts.  The Minister of State should be able to tell us what are those projects.  They are not being delayed because of the cut, but are being delayed anyway.  That delay will provide us with the &euro;3 million in savings.  I am sure the Minister of State can tell the House what projects they are.</p></speech>

We were asked to find &euro;3 million, and I did not want to mislead the committee.  I wanted the correct answer.  I did not cower away from the committee.  I wanted to go to the committee and wanted to be accurate and correct.</p>  <p>  The eight cells in Athlone are currently with the local authority.  Permission for one of those cells is still pending.  Work is starting on all of those sites.  Deputy Troy, who visits Athlone on a regular basis, knows that it is well advanced.  We are three quarters of the way through this.  The Deputy said that I have advanced knowledge of all of this, so I am providing that knowledge to him.</p></speech>

Many leaders of this House have visited it, but nothing has been done.  Work is now advanced in Athlone and all cells are going according to plan.  If there is an issue I have no problem with informing the House about it, but there is no issue about Athlone.</p>  <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath asked about the schemes affected.  A scheme in his own neck of the woods, in Cork, has been delayed since the middle of last year, as he knows.  I had hoped to be in Cork already and to have &euro;4 million, &euro;5 million or &euro;10 million spent, but I cannot overcome the objections there.  I am facing serious delays, and I am not being critical in saying that.  I hoped that work would begin last summer.  It did not happen; it was outside my control.  However, I assure the House that I am delivering, via the capital programmes investments, flood defences for this country.  I do not play politics when it comes to this issue.</p></speech>

I also detailed reforms designed to ensure better project management across the whole of government.</p>  <p>  In health, the scheduled draw-down of &euro;24 million across both 2019 and 2020 will be amended to facilitate delivering the overall investment programme as set out in Project Ireland 2040.  Even with this change, this will still leave a year-on-year increase of 25% in capital investment in the health sector in 2019.</p>  <p>  The remaining &euro;75 million will be met by re-scheduling decisions around the A5 motorway, which is a project to which the Government remains completely committed; the re-scheduling of payments in relation to the National Forensic Science Laboratory; advance payment of a sum from the Department of Education and Skills in respect of higher education facilities at the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital; an updating of the scheduled draw-down of &euro;16 million from the two Project Ireland 2040 funds; re-profiling of payments under certain programmes of investment in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment; and &euro;3 million from the re-profiling of investment under the flood risk management programme of the Office of Public Works, on which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, has just answered questions -  I apologise, I meant to say the Minister of State, Deputy Moran.

I have also outlined how we need to change processes in the future for projects such as the national children's hospital to reflect all of the issues that developed during the project.

The Minister has listed the items, some of which include the rescheduling of payments.  I think only two are related to the subject we have just discussed - the flood relief scheme and the re-profiling of payments in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Everything else involves a rescheduling of payments to achieve the sum of &euro;99 million.  I am seeking clarity, as is everyone else.  No capital projects are being delayed or pushed out as a result of the need to find the &euro;99 million.  I am sure the Minister has heard in recent weeks that capital projects in Waterford or Limerick are being delayed as a result.  Is he now saying none of them is being delayed as a result of the need to find the &euro;99 million and that any delay is due to external variables related to the planning process, etc?</p></speech>

I have shared a list with the House and have previously outlined it publicly.  The vast majority are related to how we manage payments that we will make for projects.  I have said there will be no delays on any major project as a result.  I will work with Government colleagues throughout the rest of the year to ensure we end up with a rescheduling of payments without delays on projects, particularly major projects.  I am confident that will happen.  As is always the case, it is possible as we move through the year that savings will accrue owing to things happening such as those outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Moran.  We normally look at where we stand by the summer.  We are simply doing that work far earlier than we have done it before.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows the overrun on the paediatric hospital is &euro;450 million, leaving another &euro;351 million.  Is he saying this process will continue for a number of years or is this the only year?  I seek clarity on that.</p></speech>

As things stand, budget 2020 is a long way away.  Decisions on the allocation of capital funding are many months away from being made.  The focus of my efforts now is on ensuring the decision we have made on how we will manage the cost of the national children's hospital this year will not affect plans for 2019.  I am working to do that and believe we will do it.  The Deputy has been very considered and accurate in the issues he has raised with me in recent months.  If I had come into the House and said we would increase our capital spending plans for this year by &euro;100 million, the House would have been united in saying I had torn up the plans for budget 2019 a few weeks into it.  I will not do that and will deal with decisions on what will happen in 2020 and beyond later in the year.</p></speech>

The framework has been in operation since March this year and will expire at the end of March.  The framework suppliers for the delivery of services under the framework are as follows: Acrux Consulting Limited; Collier Broderick Management Consultants and Raise A Concern Limited.  The OGP is facilitating competitions under the framework for both central government and non-central government public bodies.  In that respect it acts in an advisory role, but the individual public bodies using it are accountable and responsible for the competitions under the framework and any subsequent contract.</p>  <p>  The number of investigations undertaken by each company and the cost of each investigation are matters for the relevant contracting authority.</p>  <p>  The Office of Government Procurement is conducting a competitive tender for the establishment of a new framework agreement for the provision of external workplace investigation services to replace the existing framework when it expires.  The competition is being evaluated and the outcome of the tender process is awaited.</p></speech>

In common with much of the rhetoric on public procurement, the logic behind it is that it delivers better value, is more efficient and will achieve an external workplace investigation service in a cheaper and fairer way.  However, we know from experience with the national broadband plan, the national children's hospital project and CervicalCheck that the rhetoric of private sector efficiency is collapsing and that the neoliberal ideology that underpins it is expensive nonsense.  This is another example of the Minister's rhetoric not matching reality.  It is highly wasteful and I will give examples to show why I believe that is the case when I have a further minute to respond.</p></speech>

I am not a neoliberal, but I believe there is a role in looking at how we can achieve value for money and ensure a variety of organisations will bid for particular projects.  The Deputy referred to the national children's hospital.  It is a State-funded project that will deliver services that will be available to citizens, young boys and girls.  I would have thought that was the essence of the type of public service she would like to see improved, despite, I acknowledge, the great difficulties we have had in the latter part of that process.  If she has particular concerns about the tendering process, I am sure she will share them with me now.  There are many examples of public services - public transport, roads, primary care centres and schools - that have been really well delivered via the private sector through a tendering process.  The Deputy may be suggesting the Government and the public sector should automatically proceed to build every project without a tendering process.  I do not believe that is any more likely to lead to value for money than the processes that, by and large, work for us.</p></speech>

The reason I am concerned is that I am aware of the firms involved, which the Minister has named.  I am aware that one of them tells its customers, that is, the Department or the Government, that it guarantees satisfaction for employers.  What does it say to workers that satisfaction is guaranteed for employers, but not for them, by a firm that is meant to be providing human resources services?  I am aware of one case in which the investigation has been conducted for the past three years.  The suspension of the staff involved has cost millions of euro and other staff are feeling highly aggrieved that the process is being dragged out.  Moreover, for the individuals concerned, it is like "Run your claw along my gut", because it is not being brought to a conclusion by these very efficient, competitive, outsourced HR companies the Minister is about to re-engage.  This is not very encouraging for workers in the public sector.  Anybody undergoing an investigation or a possible dismissal is in dismay about this.  Does the Minister intend to continue with this sort of an arrangement?  What oversight on the costing is he doing to ascertain it is in any way efficient or the best way forward for the public sector and human resources?</p></speech>

It is worth emphasising that if these bodies and organisations win the tendering process, they must be in compliance with Government policy.  The policy they operate will be Government policy on how employees or citizens are treated, not their own.

We already have in different parts of our economy or by policy area, bodies that are charged with the delivery of infrastructure projects.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority, NTA and Irish Water are semi-State bodies.  There is a whole variety of different Government bodies, all of which deliver the majority of projects well inside their particular policy areas.  That is why I am so frustrated with where we ended up on the national children's hospital.</p></speech>

Is profit included in the bid process?  I presume BAM or anybody else would require a profit margin.  Are these things examined?  Does the Minister look at how its bid might compare with what the Government would do if the State did this work directly and did not require the taking of a profit and whether that would work out cheaper and better?</p>  <p>  When bids come in and, as in this case, the lowest bid is &euro;170 million less than the next bid, does anyone say that perhaps we should probably take a look at this?  If it was a difference of &euro;10 million, &euro;15 million or &euro;20 million, one might think there was not too much to look at but when the difference between the lowest and the next highest bid is &euro;170 million, somebody might suggest scrutinising in detail all the line items to see whether this bid was credible.</p></speech>

Had the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, the body that made the decision, decided to go ahead with a bid that was not the cheapest, I would now be facing questions about that as well.  I am well aware of the public anger and disappointment with what went wrong with this hospital and we will do better on projects of that scale like that in the future, because we do very well on many other infrastructure projects for which we are responsible.</p>  <p>  If I am going to take credit for what I believe we can do well, I will take responsibility for what goes wrong as well.  That is the way I have handled this.  I am under no illusion that if we had gone ahead with a project tender that was more expensive than the lowest one, then the Deputy would be raising that with me here today.</p></speech>

It would not require a profit motive, potentially would be able to get things cheaply in bulk and would be able to borrow money more cheaply.  There are all sorts of possibilities as to why the State, when directly constructing projects might end up with a considerably cheaper cost.  Moreover, there might be better oversight of it because there are layers upon layers when dealing with outsourced projects to the private sector.</p>  <p>  Somebody who worked in industry, not particularly a socialist incidentally, made another point to me.  He said that in his experience, the main contractor gives a certain price but is getting a much cheaper price from the subcontractor and is loading on the profit margin for the job.  If one went to the subcontractor, who ends up doing the work in any event, before the main contractor went directly to them, one would find a much better price.</p>  <p>Then there are issues such as quality.  How forensic is the comparison between tenders?</p></speech>

I have not come across a case yet where if a Government body had been involved in not selecting the lowest price option, that this would not have been a cause of scrutiny and questions here.  I believe that would have happened in respect of this project as well.</p>  <p>  As to what Deputy Boyd Barrett has put to me and the early part of his question that I did not have the opportunity to answer, we have many situations in which the State directly builds projects itself.  He should look at local authorities that are directly involved in building houses and our commercial semi-State sector that is directly involved in delivering infrastructure projects and the Office of Public Works, which is directly involved in building flood relief programmes.</p><p>I am unsure of where the Deputy is getting the view-----</p></speech>

I launched the current framework for public service innovation and development, Our Public Service 2020, in December 2017.  This plan is a whole-of-public service initiative that has been designed to build on the success of previous reforms, while also expanding the scope of reform to enable more collaboration, innovation and evaluation.</p>  <p>  Ensuring equity and consistency in the application of reform across the entire public service is central to the framework.  I expect this to be achieved through a robust and innovative governance structure, namely, the public service leadership board, PSLB, and the development of key indicators and metrics that are designed to track performance across our entire public service.</p>  <p>  The PSLB was established to lead the delivery of Our Public Service 2020.  For the first time ever, civil and wider public service leaders will share ownership and work jointly to drive the reform programme.  This governance structure provides a platform for officials at the most senior level and from across the gamut of public services that we provide to ensure the even and consistent application of reform.  Furthermore, Our Public Service 2020 contains an added focus on evaluation and the importance of building an evaluation culture.  This will be achieved in part by developing indicators that support a focus on outcomes.  For this reason, my Department established a reform evaluation unit to monitor and evaluate the reform outcomes and to create greater links between expenditure and reform.</p>  <p>  Our Public Service 2020 seeks to deliver better outcomes for the public by ensuring that the citizen is at the centre of all policies and services that we deliver.  There are always ways to do things better when it comes to the delivery of public services, but I am confident that my Department and those involved in the delivery of public services look to find ways to improve continually.</p></speech>

Are Departments encouraged to compare their results with a view to achieving the best possible outcome for the taxpayer?  Has that happened in the past?  Can that be done and is it likely to be done in future?</p></speech>

What is notable about it is that it involves leaders from our civil and wider public services.  For example, it has the Garda Commissioner as a member in addition to the Secretaries General of Departments.  This is the first time that we have brought leaders from across the entire public service together with a view to seeing what they can learn from one another.  In the delivery of, for example, IT projects, there is a far greater sharing of knowledge and services across Departments than was the case previously.  Local authorities are a leading example of this.  A number of them have taken on responsibility for the discharge of particular services on behalf of all local authorities across the country.  This is a good development.</p></speech>

During the economic difficulties, there was a necessity for change in how we did things.  Indeed, those difficulties provided a burning reason for why things needed to change quickly.  It is fair to ask how we can maintain the same impetus for change when, thank God, we do not have those awful circumstances around us any more.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is the enthusiasm and drive to do this.  That comes from two factors, the first of which is digitisation.  There is a demand from citizens to be able to access services in a new way.  Our public services must respond.  The leading example of this is Revenue and the work it does in terms of the filing and use of tax information online.  Second, those who provide our public services every day come into work and find ways to perform their jobs differently and better.  There is an attitude for change there that will not go away.</p></speech>

The matter was the subject of discussion at the community sector high level forum that was reconvened to examine certain issues pertaining to the CE sector and, in particular, to ensure that the matter was fully examined while having regard to costs and precedent.</p><p>A detailed scoping exercise was carried out by my Department in 2017 in order to examine and assess comprehensively the full potential implications of the issues under consideration.  That exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presented significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347 million, depending on the size of the sector, which is difficult to ascertain, in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State-funded community and voluntary organisations.  This excludes any provision for immediate <i>ex gratia</i>lump sum payments of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p><p>It continues to be the position that State organisations are not the employer of the particular employees concerned and that it is not for the State to provide funding for such pension scheme provision.  The employees in question are, or were, employees of private companies, notwithstanding the fact that the companies concerned are, or were, in receipt of State funding.</p></speech>

He knows that this issue has been around since the Labour Court recommendation of over a decade ago.  The high-level forum that the Minister mentioned has been examining it.  However, the matter must be resolved at some point.  These people have spent years providing a significant service as supervisors and assistant supervisors, yet we are not making the level of progress that we should be.</p>  <p>  I chair the Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which is examining the issue of bogus self-employment.  There are parallels with what has been done to this group of people by saying that they are employed by private companies.  They had no autonomy.  Their sole funding came from the State.  We must accept a level of responsibility and deal with the issue.  It will not disappear.</p></speech>

These workers have taken strike action as a last resort in an effort to persuade the Government to negotiate with them.  Their claim for a pension has been supported by the Labour Court and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, which passed a motion calling on the Government to put in place pension arrangements for these workers.  The Minister is now saying that it will cost too much even though we do not know the size of the sector.</p></speech>

I have shared with the House on a number of occasions the different figures that are involved in this.  The key point I would make to Deputy Curran in response to the points he made is that the Government is not the employer.  These were companies and organisations that were formed to provide services to which the State made a contribution.  I know that Deputy Curran, as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, will appreciate the challenges involved here.  As the Deputy knows, we are about to embark on a process in which we will be asking people, through the pensions master scheme and automatic enrolment, to forgo earnings to build up a pension in the future.  However, we would face a great challenge were we to say that for another group of employees, we are going to do that retrospectively.  How do we handle that issue for the citizens in our State?  That is what is at the heart of this issue.</p></speech>

It is a well-worn phrase but there is no getting away from the fact that Brexit will bring real changes for all of us.  This legislation is about how we respond to that in a worst-case scenario.  I will briefly outline the purpose of Part 1.  Section 1 of Part 1 is standard and provides for the Short Title and collective citation and construction of the Bill.  Section 2 of Part 1 provides for responsible Ministers to commence the relevant Parts of the Bill at the appropriate date and time.  It ensures that, even when enacted, the legislation will not come into effect unless needed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Obviously, we continue to hope that this is will not be needed.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade I have responsibility for commencing Parts 1 and 15.  Part 15 is different in that it relates to an agreed Brexit.  If the withdrawal agreement is ratified, then Part 15 will be commenced to deal with a specific issue arising during the transition period.  Part 1 simply deals with the Short Title and commencement arrangements that are necessary for individual Ministers.</p>  <p>  Why is the Leas-Cheann Comhairle throwing his hands in the air?</p></speech>

They refer specifically to the need for the Minister for Health to seek the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, should he or she wish to make any order or regulation.  Section 75A relates to the sitting Minister for Health being able to make arrangements.  It reads:</p><blockquote>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, make such order or orders as he or she considers necessary to continue in being or carry out any reciprocal or other arrangements in relation to health services which were in operation between the State and the United Kingdom immediately before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from membership of the European Union.</blockquote><p>Section 75B essentially says the same thing with regard to regulations.</p><p>Obviously there is a relatively complex and important set of relationships between Ireland and the United Kingdom in the realm of health care, whether that be using Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry or ambulance services moving north and south of the Border.  In fact, the vast majority of cross-Border ambulance traffic comprises ambulances from Northern Ireland responding to emergency calls in the South and bringing citizens of the Republic to hospital.  We also have the cross-border directive and the treatment abroad scheme.  The relationship is very complex and the issues involved are very important.  There are many people throughout this country who are waiting to have surgery carried out in one of the larger UK hospitals or waiting for UK doctors to come here to provide, for example, some very specialised paediatric services.  Highly specialised surgeons and their teams regularly come from UK hospitals and spend a day or more in Irish hospitals, operating on patients.</p><p>My concern is that the sitting Minister for Health may need to be able to make quick decisions.  Let us say a surgeon and his or her team are coming over to Crumlin hospital for two days of operations but something pops up.  We will be living in a world of unintended consequences and complexities, not all of which we are able to foresee.</p><p>Some order is required from the sitting Minister for Health to make sure the team can come in, that the insurance policies are covered, to make sure the drugs they use are sanctioned and so on: it is a complex legal field.  The way that 75A and 75B are written provide that any order, arrangement or regulation from the Minister for Health all require the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, currently held as one post, but after a reshuffle or a general election the roles could quite easily be back to two different posts.</p> <p> I have two concerns.  The first is that it slows things down and it does not allow the Minister for Health of the day make the decisions that he or she is entrusted by the Taoiseach to make.  My second concern is on a democratic point.  I do not believe it is appropriate that a Cabinet Minister should seek consent of the Minister for Finance.</p> <p> I have tabled three amendments that say, very specifically, consent is required from the Minister for Finance when the issue relates to taxation, and that consent is required from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform where there is an expenditure implication of the order.  For taxation and expenditure it would be yes, but for everything else I do not believe it would be appropriate for a Minister for Finance to have that authority.  It is not what they are doing day to day: they are not immersed in the world of healthcare.</p> <p> I hope the Minister will accept the amendments.  They are modest but important in making sure the Minister for Health of the day can move with the necessary speed.  Sometimes these situations can move very fast.  A surgeon and his or her team could be sitting in an airport ready to come to Ireland, or on arriving in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin they may need support from the sitting Minister.  There is no reason why any Ministers for Finance or Public Expenditure and Reform should be involved, unless there are taxation or expenditure issues, in which case the amendments cover both of those.  I hope the Minister will support the amendments.</p></speech>

I am aware that the Fianna F&aacute;il amendments that relate to the Minister would need to give permission for the provisions of the Bill to come into effect.  Sinn F&eacute;in suggests that the D&aacute;il could give consent.  I put it to the Minister that while we support the passage of the Bill and many of the provisions of the Bill, including the provisions in this section, at the end of the day we believe it is important that there is proper oversight and that the D&aacute;il has proper oversight.  While we give the consent now all of this is being done on the basis that there may be a hard crash.  While nobody wants to see a hard crash most of the provisions are on the basis of a no-deal Brexit and a hard crash scenario.  In that case, if these provisions were to come into effect - the T&aacute;naiste has quite rightly said that nobody wants the majority of these provisions ever to come into effect - we would believe it is important to have proper oversight and that the D&aacute;il would have a say at that time.  I do not wish to prolong the debate and I shall conclude by saying that our amendments are very obvious: we want the D&aacute;il to be able to give its consent if and when these provisions were to come into effect.</p></speech>

It cures a deficiency that in my Second Stage contribution I had asked to be addressed.  In his response to our concerns at the end of Second Stage the T&aacute;naiste will be aware that he said our concerns, which I had set out in my Second Stage contribution, had been addressed.  The T&aacute;naiste said:</p><blockquote>Deputies have noted the range of measures in the Bill to facilitate in an operational way the shift to the UK being a third country.  Deputy Howlin made two points relating to Parts 2 and 6.  I reassure the Deputy that the Bill and all its Parts has been prepared in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and on the basis of legal advice from that office.  I am sure the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, can address the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns in more detail, if necessary.</blockquote><p>Saying that the Attorney General has looked at it is hardly a comprehensive response to the constitutional issue I raised.  I would like to hear what his views were and why it is constitutional in the way it is asserted, which is obviously very important.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Cullinane would cure that in as much as it would have to have the consent of the D&aacute;il.</p><p>Labour&rsquo;s concerns cannot be easily put into an amendment to cure that infirmity - I was trying to think of an amendment myself - on the legality of the section from a constitutional perspective.  The relevant concern is that Labour believes there is a constitutional problem with Part 2 of the Bill.  I had simply sought very clear advice to assuage those concerns.</p><p>The UK Brexit legislation has relied heavily on so-called Henry VIII clauses, which in the British system, with no written Constitution, allow ministerial orders to amend Acts of Parliament and these by-pass the legislature.  I have looked at a number of other countries in this regard and new powers are being devolved to Ministers to act by decree in many jurisdictions because we do not know exactly what problems might arise.  I can understand the administrative attraction of such a power that the Minister may act by decree without reference to primary legislation.  We, however, have very clearly set out restrictions on the powers of Ministers to act without the consent of the Oireachtas.</p><p>Several judgments of the courts make it clear that such clauses are constitutionally prohibited, except where necessitated by EU membership, which has already been permitted by referendum of the people.  In this section the Department of Health is seeking to create a Henry VIII type clause as part of our own Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019.  In Part 2, the Government has proposed to give the Minister for Health power to &ldquo;make such adaptations and modifications to the <i>Health Acts 1947 </i>to <i>2019 </i>or any regulations made under those Acts as the Minister considers necessary for the purpose of bringing those Acts or regulations into conformity with this Part.&rdquo;  I believe this would clearly involve the Minister for Health changing primary legislation without the direct authority for that change being brought before the D&aacute;il and provided by the D&aacute;il.  My legal advice is that this is not constitutional.  The specific section where the power is described is in section 4, which proposes to insert section 75B(2)(c) into the Health Act 1970.</p><p>Under Article 15 of the Constitution, the &ldquo;sole and exclusive&rdquo; law-making power of the State is vested in the Oireachtas.  As a result, regulations that modify primary legislation are necessarily beyond the power of any individual Minister and cannot be vested in any individual Minister.  I read some of the legal judgments into the record during my Second Stage contribution so I will not revisit it here.  In essence, this is a matter of substance.  It is not a trivial matter.  We need to have very clear assurances from the Minister that what he is doing is constitutional.  We do not want a situation where the health co-operation between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland becomes one of the most fundamental causes of concern.  A person contacted me this week who was due to have a serious operation in April under the cross-Border health initiative.  This person asked me if it was safe and would it go ahead.  I do not want there to be any legal doubt about any authority that might vest in the Minister to make changes that could be challenged constitutionally or which could be infirm.  I would welcome a very clear statement on the advice and considerations of the Attorney General on why he and the Government believe that vesting in the Minister for Health - what on the face of it is an unconstitutional power - is in fact constitutional.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste who is also in the House will recall attending a meeting of the working group of committee Chairmen a couple of weeks ago.  The general scheme of the Bill was published on 24 January.  In that regard, I speak as a former health spokesperson for 14 years and a Border Deputy.  As the T&aacute;naiste will recall very well, at the meeting I referred to a quick perusal on my first sighting of the pledged intent in the withdrawal legislation in respect of health services.  On publication of the Bill, however, I see that none of the detail in the area of health has transferred from the general scheme.  This is not the case in respect of the commitments related to other Departments.  The Ceann Comhairle will say I cannot address some of the amendments I proposed.  Of course, in that regard, I would have argued for the inclusion of the word "shall", rather than "will".  However, if the Minister is giving Deputy Howlin an assurance, I will ask for one also.  Will he give me and those I represent an assurance on the critical commitments contained in the general scheme of the Bill?  At the meeting of committee Chairmen I indicated to the T&aacute;naiste that there were other things to which I could probably point, but in the listing the critical significant areas were covered, which I welcomed and the T&aacute;naiste will confirm as much.  I ask the Minister to confirm something for those cross-frontier workers who qualify for a full medical card under the current arrangements.  I only use this as an example and do not intend to take up any more time than is necessary.  It was the very first matter, but I could add a number of others that I have identified in the period since.  We were able to secure some of them in our work at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, as it was then known.  I ask the Minister for an assurance that the language now employed does not offer a way to resile from them and reserve a right to say "No".  Our hope is the current situation that obtains in health services and healthcare entitlements on a North-South basis will continue under this legislation as the guarantee in the worst case Brexit scenario.  I would appreciate it if the Minister responded to that question.</p></speech>

Deputy Howlin is right to point out that healthcare is an issue citizens in the North and the Republic are watching very carefully.  While a great deal of the conversation about Brexit pertains to issues related to trade, economic well-being and growth, all of which are terribly important, health will, on a human and practical level, be the sort of matter on which, as Deputies Howlin and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in articulate so clearly, people will want to know whether the <i>status quo</i>can continue post Brexit, regardless of how it ends up being composed.  I assure not only the House but the people that it is the very clear intention of the Irish and British Governments to continue to provide health services between the jurisdictions on the North-South and east-west basis that obtains today.  Only today the Cabinet approved the signing by the T&aacute;naiste of a detailed memorandum of understanding with the UK Government to enable issues related to the common travel area to be addressed.  I also met the HSE recently as part of our own Brexit preparations and was informed by it, to answer Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question directly, that there was no cross-Border health service available which would not be available post Brexit.  That is an absolute tribute to the incredible individuals in the health services in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland who have worked so hard to ensure that is the reality.  As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will know better than many Members, owing to his geographical location and representation of a Border county, the links between the health services and our peoples run very deep and have done so for a very long time.  The commitment of all to maintain these links has been extraordinarily helpful.  I provide the assurance for which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asks and I am pleased to be able to do so.</p><p>Deputy Howlin asked a very specific question and I accept his sincerity and bona fides in raising it.  He wants to know that this is the right way to go and me to assure the House that our legal advices are robust in that regard.  I assure him that we have received advice from the Office of the Attorney General and liaised with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  All of the legal advice available to the Government is that this is an appropriate way to proceed and, in fact, is the most straightforward approach considering that it is emergency legislation.  While it is legislation we hope we will never have to implement, we want to have it on the Statute Book should we end up in a crash-out.</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that this approach and the drafting of the legislation have been fully guided by the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in providing enabling legislation in the first instance, with the detail to be provided in regulations.  We should remind ourselves why we are doing this.  We intend to do no more than maintain the <i>status quo</i>and ensure the Minister of the day will be able to continue that which is in place today.  It is about maintaining the <i>status quo</i>, hoping we will never need to use this legislation but ensuring we can if we have to do so in the case of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>I have considered the specific amendments very carefully.  I take very seriously the point made by Deputy Donnelly and the rationale he outlined in putting forward his proposal.  It is interesting in some ways that he suggests to the House that the requirement in the legislation is too onerous.  I have heard clearly why he believes that to be the case.  On the other hand, I also accept the sincerity of Deputy Cullinane who suggests for good reasons that it might be better to create more stringent provisions in providing an oversight role for the D&aacute;il.  That convinces me somewhat that the balance we are striking is right.  The balance is to ensure the provisions are as robust as is necessary without accidentally putting obstacles in place.

In that way it could be an unintentional obstacle.  The purpose of the provisions is to enable the Minister of the day to facilitate the continued provision of the services already in place on a reciprocal basis.  It is no more and no less than that.</p>  <p>  I refer specifically to the amendments in the name of Deputy Donnelly, namely, amendments Nos. 5, 9, 20 which is consequential and 21.  Section 75 will enable the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, to make the order or orders necessary to continue in being the reciprocal or other healthcare arrangements in place with the United Kingdom prior to its withdrawal from the European Union.  Such an order or orders may specify the categories of persons and the health services to which they should apply.  The current wording of the section reflects the exercise of discretion involved in the making of such orders by the Minister and will allow the Minister to make such orders, as required.  I took to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel specifically the point made by Deputy Donnelly about this construct.  As constructed, the section refers specifically to the consent required from the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and was drafted on foot of the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel which informed me that this was the conventional and established approach.  The advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel confirms that the appropriate legislative approach required to ensure there will be a comprehensive governance framework to underpin the regulations making power of the Minister for Health is in place.  The office further advises me and I advise the House that adopting the approach proposed in the amendment would have the unintended potential to dilute the robust consent arrangements currently in place in this section of the Bill.  In addition, the consequences of adopting the proposed approach outlined in amendments Nos. 5, 9 and 20 are unknown.  It may impose unintended obligations on the Department of Health and possibly the Government generally in the general legislative process.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides that the healthcare arrangements currently in place will be maintained to the greatest extent possible following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  As the Bill seeks to maintain the existing reimbursement arrangements, it is not considered that additional expenditure implications arise.  Accordingly, the policy decision has been taken that the making of the orders will require the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>In keeping with the constructive approach everybody is taking to the Bill I sought legal guidance on Deputy Donnelly's amendments and the view I received from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel was that the current wording was the conventional constructed wording and to do anything else would dilute it.  That is the advice I wish to convey to Deputy Donnelly.<br/><br/>The consequence of adopting the approach outlined in amendments Nos. 8 and 21 would be to impose an additional obligation on the Minister for Health to lay such orders before the D&aacute;il having already received that consent.  Such an approach would introduce an additional layer of complexity to the legislative process which is not considered necessary or to be required considering what we are trying to do, which is just to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  In addition, the requirement for a positive resolution of the D&aacute;il in the manner proposed would have the potential to act as a barrier and a delaying mechanism to the timely approval of the necessary legislation, for example, during times when the Oireachtas might not be sitting.<br/><br/>For the reasons I have outlined and taking into account the urgent and emergency nature of the legislation and the extremely limited timeframe for its enactment, I must decline to accept the amendments in this group owing to the legal advice available to me.</p></speech>

The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, stated unequivocally that the current healthcare arrangements between the United Kingdom and Ireland would remain in place no matter what.  That is what I heard and he is nodding in confirmation.  I hope that is true, but it is a very brave thing to say.  For example, the treatment abroad scheme is not an Ireland-UK arrangement but an EU programme.  Can it not be the case that there is a Brexit in which the United Kingdom is no longer in the EU programme?  How can we guarantee that whatever agreements are in place based on an EU programme that many Irish citizens use, under no circumstances will they not be available in the future?  If that is the level of insight and foresight the Minister has, that is fantastic, but I would be very surprised if that was the case.</p><p>It is entirely possible that the United Kingdom will change regulations post Brexit.  In fact, its parliament has stated repeatedly that it will be changing regulations in a variety of areas.  If the United Kingdom were to change regulations on product safety for pharmaceutical and medical products, procedures and protocols for procedures, import and export protocols and professional qualifications, be it for consultants, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, radiographers and the gamut of healthcare professionals, it is possible and quite likely that some combinations of qualifications, medicines, procedures, protocols, check backs, audits and so forth implemented in the United Kingdom would no longer be recognised by the European Union.  Regardless of what happens or what changes the United Kingdom makes to its regulations, procedures, training, qualifications and so forth and even where the European Union states it no longer accepts a procedure or particular professional qualification and that while a particular drug is regulated for use for a certain purpose in the United Kingdom, the European Medicines Agency has not signed off on it and it is not useable here, the Minister has made a definitive statement that post Brexit no services will be impacted on in any way.  That is great if it is true, but it does not sound right.  He did not give a caveat in any way.  Is there a caveat in that statement?  If it is true, that is fantastic, but I do not see how the Minister can make such statements at this point.</p><p>The Minister has stated the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will be needed is the legal advice he received.  Of course, there is nothing conventional or established about the legislation we are considering.  Putting aside the constitutional question about the D&aacute;il which is an important one to be resolved, if the sitting Minister for Health must make a decision on a change to regulations for the training of radiographers in Northern Ireland, for example, or the de-listing of a particular anaesthetic used in the NHS, why would that Minister ever need to ask the Minister for Finance for permission?  To me, that sounds as if the Minister should also ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport or the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  The Minister for Finance has no role in dealing with such detailed regulatory issues.  Why would the Minister need consent from the Minister for Finance before making any change to arrangements or regulations in maintaining the <i>status quo</i>in healthcare?</p></speech>

That is an important issue.</p>  <p>  I have a question about the new information the Minister for Health has given to the House that today the Cabinet approved the memorandum of understanding on the common travel area arrangements between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The CTA is about far more than common travel arrangements.  For the first time in the memorandum of understanding there is a codified body of reciprocal rights which in many instances amount to joint citizenship.  They will allow Irish people to work, live, draw social welfare payments, receive full health benefits and vote in the United Kingdom.  There will be the same rights for United Kingdom citizens living here.</p><p>It is the anchoring document.  When will we have sight of it?  Now that it has been approved, when will it be signed by the British and Irish Governments and when we will have an opportunity to forensically examine it to see what precisely will be enduring rights for Irish and UK citizens post Brexit? <br/><br/>An important point was raised by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in regard to the rights to medical cards that arise from EU membership.  I refer in this regard to, for example, seafarers working out of Rosslare Europort.  I take it from what the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has said that on the basis of the memorandum of understanding or on some other basis, UK citizens will continue to be able to access Irish medical cards if they are resident in the Republic of Ireland.  In other words, the <i>status quo</i>will continue.<br/><br/>I will return to the point I made about the constitutionality of the section in terms of the devolution of powers to the Minister for Health to alter law without reference to the D&aacute;il.  When I made my Second Stage contribution I was assured by the T&aacute;naiste that I would get an explanation in that regard.  I regret I got no explanation from the T&aacute;naiste in his closing comments, other than, as I have already put on the record of the House, that the Attorney General is satisfied.  I have been privileged to serve in a number of Governments.  I remember being told by one Attorney General that something could not happen and being told by a successor Attorney General that it could.  The opinion of a law officer of the State is just an opinion and it is challengeable.  I want to ensure that what we are doing is robust.<br/><br/>I take more comfort in the final comment made by the Minister for Health, which, if expanded on, might provide me with more security.  Am I correct that the Minister for Health is stating he is not seeking to make any primary law but, rather, that he is seeking to preserve what has already been determined by the Oireachtas, which is the <i>status quo</i>?  If that is the explanation, it is a more robust explanation.  It also is a limiting power.  In changed circumstances, it would not be replicating the <i>status quo</i>.  How do we deal in the future with changes that did not transpose what is happening now but were making something new, because of new circumstances?  I believe Deputy Donnelly circled around this issue.  If the constitutionality is explained as preserving what is already passed by the Oireachtas, then nothing new in changed circumstances could be done by the Minister for Health without reference to the House.  Am I correct in my understanding in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500036#KK00200"><p>Following on from the questions put by colleagues, I have a couple of specific questions for the Minister, Deputy Harris.  Access to healthcare across the Border in Northern Ireland or in Britain is seamless at present because we are all  members of the European Union and there are common travel area rights in regard to healthcare.  My understanding is that these rights apply to only Irish and UK citizens.  There are many EU citizens living here who are married to Irish citizens.  Will they be able to avail of the common travel area healthcare provisions of which they can currently avail?  What is the situation in regard to posted workers?  This is another area that needs clarification.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said in regard to the treatment abroad scheme, the European health insurance card scheme and the cross-Border health care directive that there will be a seamless transition beyond 29 March.  Will he clarify that this remains the position and that it applies not only to Irish and British citizens but to all people legally resident here and EU citizens?  Will he also clarify what the position will be on 1 January 2021, which is just 21 months away?  I ask the latter question on behalf of people who are currently accessing healthcare in the UK for whom ongoing treatment will be required.  For example, a young person receiving treatment in the UK for scoliosis will be returning to the UK for a number of years to access that service, well beyond 31 December 2020.  People currently engaged with the health service in the UK need reassurance that they can continue to access that service beyond 31 December 2020.  </p>  <p>  My final question is related to the cross-Border health directive in terms of liability to the HSE and the treatment abroad scheme in terms of liability to Irish and EU citizens resident here.  Currently, the HSE reimburses the health service in the UK for the cost of surgery under the cross-Border health directive.  It also reimburses EU citizens legally resident here in respect of treatment in Northern Ireland or the UK under the treatment abroad scheme.  These costs are based on the public system in the UK.  As we are all citizens from within the European Union, the billing is based on the public cost of the service, as it would be for a British citizen.  Post Brexit on 29 March 2019 or 31 December 2020, this might no longer be the position.  Will those hospitals continue to bill Irish and EU citizens resident in Ireland as they currently do, which is on the public hospital system basis, or will they charge them as overseas citizens?  If so, the cost would be prohibitive.  In practical terms, it would mean that people would no longer be able to access those services because they would not be able to make up the differential in terms of financial cost.  It would put a huge financial burden on the HSE in regard to the cross-Border health directive as well.</p></speech>

I will set out my understanding as to why this is not the issue the Deputy thinks it may be, legally.  The proposed new section states:</p><blockquote>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, make such order or orders as he or she considers necessary to continue in being [which is the same as they are today] or carry out any reciprocal or other arrangements in relation to health services which were in operation between the State and the United Kingdom immediately before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from membership of the European Union.</blockquote><p>The powers in the provision relate to continuing into being beyond Brexit or maintaining services that were in place before the UK left the European Union.  The distinction that we need to make is that it is about a Minister for Health introducing orders to maintain existing services beyond Brexit, not to add new powers or extra services beyond what is in place on the day that the UK leaves, which is why I do not think there is a constitutional issue.  My understanding, based on the Attorney General's advice I received when I asked about the matter after the Deputy raised it, is that the purpose is to maintain existing services and pass the orders necessary to do that in a post-Brexit environment, where there is no deal and, therefore, no arrangements to facilitate the existing services to remain intact.<br/><br/>That is my understanding of the basis of the Attorney General's advice and I hope it gives the Deputy some reassurance.  I can understand why maintaining the <i>status quo </i>does not involve any precedent, such as Henry VIII clauses or whatever.  We are not introducing new laws to provide new services without going through the normal procedure to pass legislation.  Rather, we are giving the Minister the power to introduce orders to maintain existing services in a no-deal, chaotic Brexit situation.</p></speech>

On the orders that the Minister would make, however, am I correct that some of those orders would also need similar arrangements to be enacted in the British Parliament or at least the consent of the British Government?  This issue permeates throughout the Bill because if we are making provisions for a continuation of services or for the <i>status quo</i>in some areas, it will be dependent on what the British Government does.  What contact has there been between the Government and the British Government in respect of these provisions?  If the Minister was forced by a hard Brexit to bring in these orders, what guarantee would we have that the British Government would do likewise, allowing the orders to come into effect?</p></speech>

We have a basis for agreement in multiple sectors to protect and maintain the common travel area, including access to work, healthcare facilities and social welfare.  Some of those commitments require primary legislation, while others can be provided through secondary legislation or ministerial orders.  We have a commitment that the UK will fulfil its side of the bargain and we will do ours, which is what we are trying to do in the Bill.  The totality of what we are doing, however, is not contained within the Bill.  In terms of legal instruments, it is a combination of the Bill and the statutory instruments, which will also be ready by 29 March, that may be needed to protect and maintain these services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.488" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500037#LL00400"><p>On Deputy Donnelly's amendments, I am following the legal advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Although I take the Deputy's point, some of the examples that he used are probably not issues for the Minister of the day.  For example, the delisting of a drug would be a matter for the Health Products Regulatory Authority, while the changes of qualifications would be a matter for the independent regulatory bodies.  The issues that I or any of my successors will deal with will be issues that will ultimately result in various charges on the State or the issue of reimbursement, hence the involvement of the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform.  While I note the Deputy's concern about the wording of the Bill, I am reluctant to deviate in the light of the legal advice.</p><p>On Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's question about abortion and women from Northern Ireland, it was not my decision not to discuss the issue in the House but rather the amendment was ruled out of order.  I have frequently discussed the matter on the floor of the House, usually with Deputy O'Reilly, and I am happy to do so again.  Separate to the Bill, I am seeking the advice of the Attorney General as to how we might address the matter.  I have certainly not given up on addressing the matter in any manner or means but, according to the House, this Bill is not the best vehicle for pursuing it. </p><p>My colleague, the T&aacute;naiste answered Deputy Howlin's question.  The Bill is about the Minister of the day having the powers to preserve the <i>status quo</i>rather than making new and future arrangements above and beyond that.  The extract from the Bill which the T&aacute;naiste read into the record is clear in that regard.</p><p>To respond to the reaction to what I said about cross-Border services continuing, I made the comments because I have listened carefully to many members of the public calling radio programmes and commenting in the media.  In particular, I remember two parents living in Northern Ireland, whose son had his first life-saving heart operation in Crumlin hospital and is due to have another shortly, ask on the radio whether their son will be able to have the operation post Brexit.  I also have heard people from County Donegal ask whether they will be able to go Altnagelvin hospital for their radiotherapy.  I want our patients and citizens to know that the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.  When I met representatives from the HSE and asked whether they were aware of any cross-Border service in place today that will not be in place post Brexit, their answer was &quot;No&quot;.  That is very different from suggesting that things may not be done in a different way or, as Deputy Donnelly has rightly pointed out, that the reciprocal arrangements we put in place may be different in their modality but the same in their impact on our patients, which is what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.  Where there is an existing service, whether it is in place due to the common travel area or due to European law, the question is how can we ensure that service continues to be provided.  My comments were based on the idea that services provided today will be able to be provided post Brexit.  I do not mean to speak for the British Government but it is its clear and publically articulated position; it is certainly the position of the Irish Government and I know it is the position of all Deputies.  </p><p>On Deputy Naughten's questions, the legislation should be seen through the prism of being emergency measures in the context of a no-deal Brexit.  Based on Brexit discussions, one would presume that we will find ourselves in a place where we are having a discussion about future relationships and how the UK interacts with the EU and so on post Brexit.  How future relationships will continue to evolve, therefore, is a question for another day, but these are emergency measures in place to fill any such gap.  The Deputy asked an important question about the cost for the health service of treating a patient, and the answer is that he or she would be treated as though it was the cost for a UK citizen.  We will recognise each other as though we were from the other country, which is an important development.  On the issue of the cross-Border directive and any successors in that regard, I am informed by my officials that it is not done on the basis of citizenship but rather it depends on whether one works in that state or receives a pension in that state.  The Deputy used an example of a Polish person living in Northern Ireland.  If he or she works in Northern Ireland or in the Republic of Ireland, or if he or she is in receipt of a pension in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland, he or she will qualify.</p></speech>

It states, &quot;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, make such order or orders as he or she considers necessary to continue in being or carry out any reciprocal or other arrangements in relation to health services&quot;.  The phrase, &quot;continue in being&quot; is the operative phrase in respect of the <i>status quo</i>.  The part I referred to in my contributions both on Second Stage and in my contribution earlier today was a later part of the same proposed new Part IVA.  It is section 75B, which is headed &quot;Regulations to give full effect to this Part&quot;.  On page 12 of the Bill, section 75B(2)(c) states that the regulations made by the Minister for Health under subsection (1) may &quot;make such adaptations and modifications to the <i>Health Acts 1947</i>to <i>2019</i>or any regulations made under those Acts as the Minister considers necessary for the purpose of bringing those Acts or regulations into conformity with this Part.&quot;  It is a debatable point but, <i>prima facie</i>, it gives authority to the Minister to amend the law under that section.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste is telling me that it is in the shadow of the first Part, which states that it can only be by way of maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  If that is the understanding of the T&aacute;naiste, I am happy to leave it at that if that has been fully tested.  The T&aacute;naiste might answer my other question about the memorandum of understanding.  When will we have sight of it so that we can look at it and ensure, to our satisfaction, that all of the rights that we understand are available to Irish citizens in the UK now and to UK citizens here will be maintained in an enduring way?</p></speech>

That memorandum of understanding has been ready to sign for some time.  It was agreed by senior officials.  For understandable reasons, we have decided not to sign it until now but I have approval now from Government to sign it with my counterpart in the British Government.  We will do that, if necessary, before the end of March.  This is a document that both Governments have contributed to so it is as much a British Government document as it is an Irish Government document.  That is why it is helpful that it has not been published until both Governments are satisfied to sign it.</p></speech>

It is a memorandum of understanding.  We made a deliberate decision not to have a bilateral treaty on the common travel area because changing a bilateral treaty means going through the legislative process, which takes months.  We have instead a memorandum of understanding which can be changed much more easily and quickly if we have missed something.  It would be useful to share it with party leaders to make sure we have not missed anything.  This is not something that we are precious about but I do not want to turn that memorandum of understanding into a series of new asks.  This represents what has historically been in place and needs to be sustained and protected in the context of Brexit.  I could not really share it with the House without sharing it with my Government colleagues first, and we only did that today.</p></speech>

There may be unforeseen circumstances and I understand that the Minister has already addressed this so I will not delay.  There are a series of amendments which relate mostly to ensuring that at every stage of dealing with the consequences of Brexit, if it happens in the way that this Bill in some ways expects it to, the Houses of the Oireachtas will have some type of oversight of it.  It is not intended to contradict the Bill.  Based on what I have heard from the Minister, I will not press these amendments.</p></speech>

Obviously, none of us wants to be here talking about this issue.  We hope a no-deal Brexit will not happen, but we have to be prepared for it in case it does.  We do not think it would be any harm for the Minister to provide us with a report &quot;one year after the United Kingdom has left the European Union&quot; to see how the provisions are working.  In fact, it would be quite sensible to do so as we are heading into uncharted territory.  We can do our work here, but much of what we have been discussing is contingent on the British Government doing its bit.  Therefore, it would be no harm to receive a full assessment of how the delivery of services is operating one year after Brexit has happened.  We are looking for &quot;a review into the effectiveness of the health services covered under [this Bill] one year after the United Kingdom has left the European Union&quot;.  Such a review would be of great benefit to policymakers, service users and medical and healthcare professionals.</p></speech>

In my earlier contribution I flagged my concerns about people who were receiving ongoing treatment for particular conditions.  I referred to the example of a child with scoliosis who was required to go back on a number of occasions to the United Kingdom under the cross-border directive or the treatment abroad scheme.  People need reassurance on the treatment that will take place between now and 31 December 2020.  They need a commitment that they will be able to continue that treatment in the same hospital or medical facility after 1 January 2021.  If we do not provide such certainty, we will undermine the principle behind the Bill.  This emergency legislation is being enacted to ensure that in the event that there is a hard Brexit on 29 March, people will continue to be able to avail of medical services of which they can avail today in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  If there is not an assurance that a medical procedure can continue beyond 31 December 2020, in effect, that particular right will be curtailed.  I accept that it is difficult for the Minister to provide for that level of clarity today.  As he has said, this is emergency legislation, but I think it is reasonable for him to be required to present a report to the House within three months to clarify the position and ensure continued treatment and support and access to the medical profession in the United Kingdom will be provided in cases which involve ongoing medical procedures which were first accessed in advance of 31 December 2020.</p></speech>

The spirit in which I am approaching this section involves not disagreeing with what they are requesting, while arguing that it should perhaps not be included in the legislation.  With my Government colleagues, I am happy to give a commitment on the floor of the D&aacute;il to provide such important information for it, the health committee or any other appropriate forum within the Oireachtas.  As Deputy Naughten acknowledged, the amendments provided for in the Bill are contingency steps that seek to minimise any disruption to current healthcare arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Obviously, the post-Brexit relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union will be negotiated beyond these contingency steps.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive, to which Deputy O'Reilly spoke, impose an obligation on the Minister of the day to publish a review of the effectiveness of the health services one year after the UK has left the European Union.  Although, without wishing to be pedantic, we have a legal concern with words like &quot;effectiveness&quot; in terms of their legal meaning and place in the legislation, I have no difficulty in providing the Deputy with what she is looking for.  I fully agree with the Deputy that it makes sense that we would be providing reports and updates to this House through the appropriate committee as well.  I should reiterate that the objective of the current Bill is the maintenance of existing arrangements in respect of health services currently in operation between the State and the UK rather than an assessment of their effectiveness.  All we are trying to do here, on which I think we are in agreement, is maintain the <i>status quo</i>as opposed to analysing the effectiveness of the <i>status quo</i>or indeed providing for new measures which we may decide, as an Oireachtas, are desirable to put in place in the future but which would not be covered under this Bill.  This Bill is about preserving the <i>status quo</i>.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 25 from Deputy Naughten seeks to impose an obligation on the Minister to present a report on the continued provision of healthcare services in the UK from 1 January 2021.  It should be noted, however, that if legislation is brought into force, there will be many opportunities for the arrangements provided for under the legislation to be reviewed.  In addition, any arrangements between Ireland and the UK in respect of continued reciprocal access to health services after December 2020 will be subject to ongoing consultation and engagement between those two states once the UK leaves the European Union.  Amendments of this nature can be considered further in that context.  In terms of the review proposed, I can confirm that I am willing to attend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  Deputies know that I enjoy attending it regularly.  I am also willing to arrange for relevant officials to provide briefings at regular intervals and to attend and report as necessary.  I fully agree with the spirit of the amendment although I am not in a position to accept it in this legislation.  I will give a commitment to the House that the Government will provide such reports and information to Deputies at the opportune moments.</p></speech>

It provides for a report to be made to the House.  I am specifically looking at medical conditions that require ongoing treatment.  The objective behind section 8 is to protect the rights people have today to access health services in the UK after the UK leaves the European Union on 29 March.  If the UK leaves the European Union on 29 March, we are providing assurance to people right up to 31 December 2020.  I accept that in the vast majority of cases, that level of clarity will be sufficient.  I accept the Minister's assurances in that respect.  However, where there are particular procedures that will require further surgery down the road, people need reassurance now that access will be continued beyond 31 December 2020 to allow them to access that service next month or the month after.  Clarity needs to be provided.  Otherwise the legislation will undermine its specific objective of providing people with cross-border access in the United Kingdom after 29 March this year.  As a Member of Parliament, I could not advise any family that a child with scoliosis who wants to avail of services in the United Kingdom should avail of those services.  If they require further surgery down the road, they might have to transfer to another jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  I accept that the Minister cannot provide this clarity today.  That is why the amendment contains the very flexible provision that the Minister present a report to this House on a specific cohort of conditions and that, if the treatment has started before 31 December 2020, there be an ongoing commitment in respect of the treatment beyond that date.</p></speech>

However, he said that at the opportune time he would provide the report.  I would be most grateful if he could firm up that proposal.  We are saying within a year because, in the event that we have to enact this legislation, we are going to be in uncharted territory.  It would be no harm, after 12 months, to have a look back at the effectiveness or otherwise of the provisions.  We are relying on the British Government to uphold its end of this, notwithstanding any commitments the Minister can give.</p></speech>

Certainly it would be within a year and indeed as the need arises in addition to that commitment.  I am more than happy to give that to the Deputy because, as she says, it is common sense.</p>  <p>  Deputy Naughten and I are not in disagreement in terms of what we want to achieve.  The only question is the insertion of the provision in this legislation in respect of the timeframe of 90 days and the like.  I want people like those whose case the Deputy outlined to know that it is the intention of the Irish Government to ensure that such services can continue to be accessed.  We are dealing with a period of time defined by emergency measures, cognisant of the fact that there will be a significant amount of engagement and negotiation in the years ahead, not just bilaterally between Ireland and Britain as neighbours and friends but also in the context of the future relationship that the UK will have with the European Union.  I am more than happy to update the House and more than happy for a report to be given within three months and the like.  I just do not wish to put those provisions in this Bill.  I am very willing to work with the Deputy and the House to provide the assurances he is seeking.</p></speech>

I do not doubt the Minister's intentions but, in my experience, when it is not written in black and white, it does not happen.  I am accepting that for a three-month period we are curtailing the right to medical services in the UK.  The Minister needs to be given that discretion.  I am admitting that curtailment in this amendment and giving the Minister 90 days to provide clarity to us.  I do not think it is acceptable for clarity not to be provided within those three months, nor is it acceptable that is it not set out in the legislation that this must be presented to the House so that we can report.  I should be in a position to reassure an individual, or their family, who is availing of a medical procedure in the UK that will require continual ongoing care for more than 22 months that they will be able to avail of it.  That is the very minimum that we need to provide if this legislation is to do what it proposes.  We cannot curtail that right.  I am accepting that we are curtailing it for 90 days but we should not be curtailing it for any longer than that while we consider our intention from 31 December 2020.  I accept that in respect of many procedures there is plenty of time.  For procedures involving a continuing commitment of care for more than 21 months, however, we need to provide clarity now.</p></speech>

Along with Members from all sides of the House, I am genuinely hoping that this legislation need never be enacted although it is important to pass it in an efficient manner.  I also point out that these Houses have an ability to order their own business, hold Members to account, request information and reports, and decide what to debate in Private Members' time, Topical Issue debates and committee hearings, and they do so very effectively and robustly.  I do not think the Government intends to stipulate for a range of Ministers to provide a range of reports within 90 days.  That is not because we are unwilling to provide such reports but because the back and forth of parliamentary accountability already deals with it.</p>  <p>  I want to end as I started, by reassuring Deputy Naughten not just of my good intentions but of the absolute policy position of the Government that it wants to make sure these services can be provided into the future for exactly the sort of cases he outlined.</p><p>This legislation is emergency legislation which is geared towards dealing with the here and now of a no-deal hard Brexit.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500042#QQ01800"><p>I move amendment No. 30:</p><blockquote>In page 17, after line 33, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Report on the provision of supports to maintain and grow employment</b><blockquote><b>8. </b>The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation shall within 90 days of the passage of this Act, present a report to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the provision of supports to maintain and grow employment in non-exporting indigenous local business.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote><p>I believe Sinn F&eacute;in is tabling a similar amendment.  The only difference in principle between the two amendments is that I am tabling this on the basis that the report will be presented 90 days after the passage of this legislation, whereas I believe the Sinn F&eacute;in amendments proposes that it is presented after the enactment of the legislation.  Of course, we hope that this legislation is never enacted.  My amendment is different because I believe these supports are urgent and necessary for businesses that are not receiving supports at the minute.  I accept that the Government has done a lot of work in engaging with businesses throughout the country.  I know that is very challenging work.  I have tried to do that myself to encourage businesses to be aware of the impact of Brexit.  I am not talking about those which are directly affected by Brexit but those which might be indirectly affected.  I made the point last week in this House that a company with ten employees or fewer will be supported by the local enterprise board.  However, a company that has ten or more employees which is not exporting and does not have the potential to export has no State mechanism available to support it.  Those types of companies are the bedrock of the business and economic activity in many smaller provincial towns in rural areas.  I can think of quite a number of such companies.  They may be providing services within that local community or providing services throughout the country.  Brexit may indirectly impact upon those companies, yet there is no mechanism in place to support them at the moment.</p><p>I am sure the Minister will come back and say that the Government will not support this amendment, even though it is a valid point.  I believe we must accept this amendment.  It is imperative that we take action now, because regardless of whether the 29 March deadline leads to a hard Brexit, we are going to have Brexit within the next 21 months.  These companies need to be prepared for that now.  I accept that the focus until now has been on companies that are trading and that are directly impacted upon by Brexit.  However, the focus must shift urgently to these companies which are the bedrock of rural communities in many parts of the country.  They need a support mechanism.  It is imperative that the Minister tells the House how these businesses will be supported.  I have suggested that the local enterprise boards could have their criteria altered so that they could help and assist those companies.</p><p>Another urgently needed support required by local enterprise offices, LEOs, is a specific Brexit support.  Enterprise Ireland has a support mechanism available to help exporting companies.  InterTradeIreland has a support to help businesses which is specifically targeted at Brexit.  However, the LEOs at the minute can offer no support for those companies that may require it in the context of Brexit.  It is not just those companies that are exporting or trading with the UK.  It might be a company that is supporting a business trading with the UK that will be indirectly affected by Brexit.  I do not expect the Minister to be able to provide details on that today, but providing him with 90 days in which to come back to the House to outline how we can support these companies is a very fair and reasonable proposal to put forward.</p><p>We urgently need to review the criteria of Enterprise Ireland.  At the moment it is involved in encouraging exporting and supporting businesses that export already or that have the potential to export.  We also need to look at import substitution, especially when our nearest trading partner is going to be outside the European Union.  If we do not look at that, there might be additional costs for businesses and on the Irish economy.  There is an opportunity to support domestic business to fill a potential void in imports that will be coming from a third country post Brexit.  The criteria laid down in the legislation for Enterprise Ireland has to be looked at now.  There is little point in looking at this on 1 January 2021.  Now is the time to do it.</p><p>I am asking that this House be presented with a report within 90 days which outlines how we are going to protect, support and grow local businesses that to date have fallen through the support nets we have, and that are outside the local enterprise and Enterprise Ireland criteria.  They might be companies servicing the local economy, the regional economy or the national economy.  They might be companies involved in import substitution, particularly from a third country, which may be the United Kingdom after 31 December 2020 at the latest.  It is important that we do not ignore those companies.  They are the bedrock of the provincial towns and rural economies throughout this country, and they have to be supported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500042#QQ01900"><p>Sinn F&eacute;in will support amendment No. 30 as well as tabling its own amendment No. 31.  These amendments concern the Brexit business supports contained in this Bill.  The supports which will come into effect in the event of a hard crash are the absolute bare minimum.  In fact, they do not even represent the bare minimum of what is necessary to support many businesses.  Exporters are suffering as we speak because of currency fluctuations and due to the strength of the euro against the pound at the moment.  There are certain sectors of the economy, including many manufacturing businesses, as well as exporters, which are also suffering as we speak because of the uncertainty of Brexit.</p><p>People are concerned about their jobs.  The agrifood sector needs support and yet there is very little in the Bill.  Rather than tinkering around the edges in respect of research and development, existing supports and increasing the thresholds and the percentages for grants, there is not much by way of real practical additional supports that are necessary for many small and medium-sized businesses.</p> <p> The Irish economy is the most exposed after Britain if there is a hard crash.  However, the so-called additional supports presented here are not what the stakeholders are looking for.  We have engaged with IBEC, ISME and the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, all of which have called for a suite of practical measures to be put in place.  However, they are not contained in this section.</p> <p> When we got the briefings from the Minister's office and we had officials from different Departments, we were astounded that some of the provisions of this section relating to grant supports were increasing the thresholds to allow the State to maximise the current state aid rules.  We were flabbergasted that for many years, the State was not even availing of the state aid rules that apply.  We were not even applying what was allowed in the state aid rules.  This was happening throughout the post-Celtic tiger years when many businesses were in very severe difficulty.  We were flabbergasted that that was the case.</p> <p> We had several discussions with the T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach on state aid rules and the need for greater flexibility from the European Union for Ireland.  Nothing in the Bill gives any flexibility from Brussels.  We can see no additional flexibility in state aid rules to apply to Ireland that do not apply to countries, such as Hungary and Poland, that will not be as affected by Brexit as Ireland will, which is outrageous.  Europe has been very good in supporting Ireland on the backstop but it has not been as good in supporting the Irish economy and the many Irish SMEs that will need a raft of additional supports in the event of a hard Brexit.</p> <p> We also argue that the provisions of this Bill and the additional supports, limited as they are, should come into play irrespective of whether there is a hard crash.  In fact, businesses need them now.  Why are we only providing for these additional supports, which are very weak, in the event of a hard crash?  It misses the point of the uncertainty for these businesses, which might continue for months if there is an extension of Article 50.  Why are these supports not being put in place now?  Our amendments to make that happen were ruled out of order possibly because there was a cost to the Exchequer.  However, the point stands that they should be in place irrespective of a soft or a hard Brexit.  We have consistently made the point that there is no good Brexit, hard or soft.  If it is hard and there is a hard crash, the impact on the economy will be more severe.  Whatever Brexit we eventually have to deal with will have a chilling effect on the Irish economy and we need to be prepared.</p> <p> The British Government announced a Brexit stabilisation fund.  Our proposals contained a Brexit stabilisation fund that allowed for additional supports in capital investment, and additional supports for business, a job subsidy scheme and a subsidy fund to support the agrifood sector, and yet the Government has not provided for any fund.  We tabled an amendment in this area to allow the Minister to set up a &euro;2 billion Brexit stabilisation fund with the money coming from the rainy day fund - in both last year and this year &euro;500 million has been put into that fund - and from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  That &euro;2 billion could be put to good use to invest in the economy in terms of capital spend and to give practical supports to businesses.</p> <p> A small number of multinational companies avail of the existing research and development credit scheme.  Many small and medium-sized businesses cannot get a look in and are not properly supported.  We have called for that scheme to be streamlined but it is not in the Bill as far as I can see.  The provisions for the Brexit loan scheme where there is some additionality is a bit of a joke when many businesses at the moment are not even taking up that scheme.  There are obviously issues with it.  Has the Minister spoken to the stakeholders such as IBEC, ISME and the businesses which need these supports?  We believe that loan scheme needs to be overhauled.  Before we start tinkering with this scheme, we need to examine why many of the businesses the scheme was designed to support have not taken up the scheme.</p> <p> We have also called for an employment subsidy scheme for many micro and small businesses.  It is not a provision in the Bill.  It was put in place after the economic crash to support vulnerable sections of the economy, which had a long-term viability but in the short term may have had to lay off staff because of difficulties.  Many businesses will now experience the same because of Brexit.</p> <p> The biggest market distortion to affect some sections in the economy in this State will be Brexit.  In whatever form it takes, it will be an enormous market distortion for many businesses.  The State seems to be taking a minimalist approach in providing state supports and aids.  It is almost as if we believe the market will sort out all of these problems.  The market will not sort out problems.  The Minister is shaking her head, but they are not in the Bill.  The provisions in the Bill are very limited and will have little impact on the many businesses that need support.  If the Minister listened to the business organisations and engaged with them as we would, she would have put much more on the table.</p> <p> I again make the point that the British Government made a Brexit stabilisation fund available.  The Irish Government made no such fund available.  It introduced this omnibus Bill with very limited supports for businesses that are concerned about the uncertainty of Brexit and the impact it will have on their businesses.  It is not good enough by any means.  We will be supporting the sections of the Bill.  We will not oppose any of the measures the Government is putting in place.  We would support any additional support, but what the Government has proposed is far too little and far too late.</p> <p> As I said at the start of my contribution, why are the provisions of the Bill only being introduced in the event of a hard crash?  Many businesses need those, irrespective of which Brexit they face.  I do not see why these measures are contingent on a hard crash.</p></speech>

I have spoken to many business groups in recent weeks and they are not exactly enthusiastic about it either.  Much more remains to be done on this issue.</p>  <p>  However, I welcome the provisions to give more power to Enterprise Ireland to assist Irish businesses exposed to the consequences of Brexit.  In the spirit of approaching this Bill on a cross-party basis, we tabled two constructive amendments in the business section.  Unfortunately one has been ruled out of order, like a lot of the others, but I will outline the aim of the other in a few moments.</p>  <p>  A large portion of the business, enterprise and innovation section is dedicated to providing new powers for Enterprise Ireland.  I note that many of these were already planned and contained in the proposed industrial development (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2017.  These changes for Enterprise Ireland will see the jobs agency being given the power to provide loans to client companies, as opposed to the current situation where they can only offer financial support through direct equity stakes or grants for specific purposes.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland will also be authorised to make research and development grants for research that is, in part, carried out abroad if its purpose is to broaden a firm's export market beyond the UK.  I ask the Minister to provide more clarity on this and give examples of how it would operate.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been an incredibly successful vehicle for supporting and creating jobs across Ireland, and helping many Irish SMEs to take the leap into exporting.  We hope these additional functions will help Enterprise Ireland build on this success and continue to grow our exports to a wide variety of foreign markets.</p>  <p>  I note the Bill aims to expand the caps on state aid that can be given to companies.  It seems this is just raising the limits for what is already permitted under EU law.</p><p>If this is the case can the Minister outline why this has not been done so far.</p> <p> I wish to ask the Minister about the current Brexit business supports.  The latest figures to date are very dismal with just three weeks to go until Brexit.  Just 81 loans with a value of &euro;17.3 million have been given out under the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme, a tiny 6% of the total pot.  Only 241 market discovery grants have been approved while one while just 156 Be Prepared grants have been sanctioned.  The Minister will have to admit that this is an incredibly poor uptake is of these Government supports.  These supports are of no help to businesses is if they cannot access them.  There is obviously a problem as to why companies are not accessing these supports which the Minister needs to address.  I have asked the Minister on a number of occasions to review these current supports, to cut down on red tape and to widen the criteria where possible.  Has the Minister done any of those things we have asked her to do in the past?  Has the Department and the jobs agencies reviewed their performance of these?  Is there any underlying reason as to why these are not performing? </p> <p> I have couple of points also on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and I appreciate that it does not come under the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, but due to the obvious job-creation role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in addition to its responsibility for the social cultural development of Gaeltacht regions, the Department must engage with the &uacute;dar&aacute;s extensively.  Jobs in our Gaeltacht areas are incredibly valuable to local communities and we must do all we can to protect current jobs located there and increase the number of businesses setting up in our Gaeltacht regions.  On this basis, can the Minister outline if an examination has been undertaken to explore how exposed &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client-companies are to Brexit?  Has &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta been contact as to whether it feels it needs any additional powers, such as the new borrowing powers that are being extended to Enterprise Ireland, or additional funds for grants?</p> <p> Amendment No. 31, a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, seeks to instruct the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to compile a report on the effectiveness of the current Brexit business supports and to present this report to the joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is clear from the data that the uptake of current Government supports is not working.  Something, as I said earlier, has gone seriously wrong - I mentioned the figures earlier.  This is a shocking and poor uptake of the Government supports.  Business supports may look good in the media and when they are announced at the Minister's press conferences, but they are no help to businesses if they cannot access them.  I have asked the Minister to review the current supports, cut down the red tape and widen criteria where possible.  As far as I am aware this has not happened to date.  If passed, the review mentioned in the amendment would include but not be limited to examining why there has been such a low uptake of these Brexit business supports to date, identify barriers for businesses in accessing these supports and offer solutions on how to make it easier for businesses to benefit from these supports.</p> <p> I ask the House to support this amendment which I will press.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.539" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500044#SS00200"><p>In addressing the amendments, I commissioned a wide-ranging review of the OECD on SME and entrepreneurship policies in March 2018.  Part of this extensive review is examining the provision of supports for indigenous businesses and how they are assisted by Government Departments and agencies to grow.  This report will examine the strategic framework and delivery system for SMEs and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  The report will be published, for Deputy Naughten's information, in the third quarter of this year and we will await its findings and recommendations.  I want to reassure the Deputy also that I am focusing on indigenous Irish companies and am very conscious that they also need to be supported on Brexit.</p><p>For that reason I take this opportunity to list the supports for non-exporting businesses.  First, there is the Brexit loan scheme which is open to all businesses.  It is a working capital facility that is available at an interest rate of 4%, repayable over three years.  InterTradeIreland has a &euro;2,250 Start to Plan voucher and one does not need to be an exporter to get this, but can be an indigenous Irish company.  Regardless of the number of employees the company has it can apply for it.  Yesterday, I launched the Start to Act voucher which is available through Enterprise Ireland which has a value of &euro;5,650.  InterTradeIreland has also received an additional &euro;1 million from my Department in budget 2019, which was without the need for matching funding from Northern Ireland, because I knew that there was going to be an increased demand for its services in view of Brexit.  For that reason it received an increase of 17% in its budget.  It also has a complete suite of advisory services that are available to everybody, be it a tariff checker, or online customs training for those that are importing which can be availed of from InterTradeIreland which is providing a broad range of services.</p><p>The local enterprise offices are also marketing the InterTradeIreland schemes.  This is available across the board, there is customs training, mentoring and business planning.  They give out consultancy grants, with no limit as to employees, to companies of whatever size.  They have lien grants and innovation supports through vouchers etc.  All of the supports are available through local enterprise offices, regardless of the number of employees a company has or as to whether they are exporting or not.For that reason I increased the budget to local enterprise offices by &euro;5 million in budget 2019, a 22% increase, to help them exactly what the Deputy said, namely, indigenous Irish companies.</p><p>There is also Microfinance Ireland which has &euro;25,000 available for lending to SMEs and the credit guarantee scheme.  There are a lot of supports available to indigenous Irish SMEs which are not exporting and I want to make them aware of these again and I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because no matter how many times this is said, people may not be aware of the supports that are available.</p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s premise as to the take-up of the Brexit supports is not correct.  In fact, my information is that take up has been quite robust.  The Brexit loan scheme was launched in 2018 and I am pleased to say that there has been a steady stream of applications so far.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, has received 462 applications under the Brexit loan scheme up to 22 February 2019.  Some 413 of those applications have been deemed eligible for a loan under the scheme, and of those, 81 have been progressed to sanction at finance-provider level to a total value of &euro;17.32 million.  It is important to remember that this scheme is not a loan for businesses to carry on as usual.  We are asking businesses to consider carefully what they need to do to address successfully their Brexit challenge through innovating, changing or adapting their business model in some capacity.  These responses may include strengthening their product offerings, developing new markets to diversify their trade footprint, changing their organisational structure or developing new capabilities.  Work continues on the longer-term future growth loan scheme, which will help eligible businesses invest strategically in a post-Brexit environment.  This scheme was announced as part of budget 2019 and is expected to launch very shortly.  In 2018, Enterprise Ireland provided approval for funding of &euro;74 million to 535 Brexit-exposed companies across a range of Brexit financial supports.  In addition, there were Brexit interventions with over 1,000 companies which have significant exports to the UK.  Over 1,000 companies have attended Brexit advisory clinics across the country, and 4,400 companies have completed the Brexit SME scorecard, and almost 1,000 have completed the Enterprise Ireland online customs insights programme since December.  Visits to the<i>prepareforbrexit.ie</i>website, which contains information on a range of Enterprise Ireland, local enterprise offices, LEO, and other agency supports, has increased ten-fold over the past 12 weeks and we have reached 90% of the SME audience with our Brexit supports communications.  My Department has also allocated &euro;8 million extra for Brexit staffing and supports across enterprise and regulatory agencies, the roll-out of new customs training through local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland, an Enterprise Ireland guide to best practice on managing currency volatility - the Deputy mentioned about customers needing to hedge their currency risk - and &euro;1 million in additional funding for lnterTradelreland.</p><p>All of our supports are kept under constant review and we have had no feedback to say there are gaps.  We have dealt with any change that has been requested.  For example, I regularly meet the business representative bodies.  I have met the retailers and food importers to ensure the security of our food supply.  I also meet all departmental agencies.  A request regarding import VAT of 23% was brought to my attention.  I raised the matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who has made changes in this Bill to address the issue of paying VAT at the point of import.  It would have had significant cashflow implications for businesses, but the change will be of major benefit to them.</p> <p> It is not necessary to legislate for a review of these supports.  We review them constantly to determine whether there are gaps.</p> <p> Regarding the Brexit stabilisation fund, we achieved agreement with the European Commission last week on increasing the rescue and restructuring safety net for SMEs to &euro;200 million.  We have close engagement with the Commissioner.  She is well aware of the challenges facing this country and has assured us that the Commission will do everything it can to assist us.</p> <p> I have covered most of the issues raised.  For the reasons outlined, I cannot support these amendments.  It is not necessary to insert in legislation the requirement to carry out a review.  We work with all of the bodies involved and I meet businesses on a daily basis.  For example, I attended an InterTradeIreland event yesterday.  A large number of businesses were there.  They are availing of the many supports that exist.  I encourage people who have not yet engaged to do so.  The Government is here to help and we want to help businesses in preparing for Brexit.</p></speech>

She did not deal with most of my points, including that on state aid rules.  She stated that the Commissioner was aware that Ireland faced challenges and gave her assurances, but we need more than assurances from Brussels and the Commissioner.  For a long time, we were told by the T&aacute;naiste and other Ministers that a suite of bespoke solutions would be made available to this State beyond what would be available to other member states, as they would not be as adversely affected economically as us, given the close relationship between the Irish and British economies and how we are more exposed than any other member state.  Nothing in these provisions strays outside of current state aid rules.  There is no additionality that any other member state is unable to avail of.</p>  <p>  The Minister is living in cloud cuckoo land if she believes that the different sectoral groups in the business community view the supports in place as adequate for a hard crash.  We have met the groups as well.  We have presented our proposals, which have been well received.  The groups have sought significant changes to state aid rules.

She stated that 430 companies had applied and 81 had been successful and would benefit.  Only 430 companies have applied.  What about those that have not?  Businesses tell us that they cannot engage with the scheme because it is too cumbersome and needs to be overhauled.  The Government has not dealt with that issue.  Only 81 out of the 430 have progressed to the point of being able to avail of the scheme.  That is not enough.</p>  <p>  I can see nothing in this Bill for the agrifood sector apart from what is available for everyone else.  There are no bespoke supports for it.</p>  <p>  I am flabbergasted that we have debated supports for the SME sector and there has been no contribution whatsoever from Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is obvious that Fianna F&aacute;il believes that the Government is doing a great job in supporting SMEs and that, if there is a hard crash, everything the Government is putting in place will be enough.  Many SMEs will be disgusted that one of the larger political parties has offered no contribution to this debate on the additional supports that business requires.  It is a dereliction of responsibility by Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  That party might be keeping the Minister in her job, but she is the one responsible for putting in place a suite of measures for businesses.  She has missed the point entirely.  She rattled off the supports that were in place.  I have already conceded that they are in place - we do not believe they are enough or adequate - but the additional supports being sought all have to do with a hard crash.  She is missing that point.  Businesses, in particular exporting SMEs that are most exposed because they have a strong trading relationship with Britain, need these supports now irrespective of a hard crash, yet the Minister is fiddling around the edges of most of these proposals without making substantive changes and is saying that these will only apply if there is a hard crash.  Wake up and smell the reality.  There are businesses that need these additional supports now.</p>  <p>  No one wants to see a hard crash and I still believe it is unlikely, but if there is a hard crash, many businesses will be very exposed.  They will be disappointed and sore that this is the best the Government can do.  It is deeply ideological.  It is Fine Gael once again saying that the market should solve these problems and interventions by the State should be as limited as possible.  That is the problem.  The Government does not see that the mammoth challenges facing the economy and businesses need State interventions and supports of a greater scale than the minimalist one it is proposing.</p>  <p>  We will press the amendment to a vote and will view it as a vote of no confidence in the Government's support for business, which is what these amendments are concerned with.  Much more needs to be done.  The Minister does not realise that.  If she believes that, by attending an InterTradeIreland event and speaking to a small number of businesses, everything is hunky dory, it is not.  There are businesses that are struggling because of Brexit.  When we meet them, they tell us that the Government is not doing enough.</p></speech>

It was underwhelming.  She stated that information had reached 90% of SMEs and then queried my figures on the uptake of business supports, yet she then cited the same figures herself.  Just 81 loans with a value of &euro;17.3 million have been given out under the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme.  That is 6%.  People might be aware that the loan exists, but they are coming away from the events - I have attended a number of them and some have been quite good - still confused and unable to access the loan.  That is clear.</p>  <p>  I do not understand why the Department cannot revert to us with a review of the loans and of why the uptake rate is so low.  That is the purpose of my amendment, which we will be pressing.  We will also support amendment No. 30.</p></speech>

I have outlined to the Minister why we need this amendment.  Local enterprise offices are calling for its provisions.  They have met the Minister.  They want to be able to support businesses of over ten employees.  They want to be able to support companies that do not fall under the Enterprise Ireland criteria.</p><p>That is the reality of it.  These businesses will struggle.  At the moment, all of the focus is on a hard Brexit in 24 days and, with all due respect, the Government had to focus on that.  I fully accept that it had to focus on exporters and importers but regardless of whether it is a soft or a hard Brexit, within 21 months we will have Brexit in Ireland.  This will not just impact on importers and exporters but also on small businesses throughout this country.  They are not exporters because they do not have the opportunity to export but they are creating a lot of jobs in provincial towns and rural Ireland.  However, they do not fall under any of the support criteria in place at the moment.  We need to broaden the definition of the supports that are available through the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  The LEOs themselves want to be able to assist these companies.  We also need to broaden the definition of support provided by Enterprise Ireland, not just focusing on exports but also on import substitution, particularly when our nearest neighbour is going to be a third country.  This will open up opportunities for import substitution and will allow Irish companies to fill that void.</p> <p> The Minister made reference to a review report in quarter three of this year but to me, that is live horse, and get grass.  These companies cannot wait that length of time.  That is why I have laid out in my amendment that the report would be presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann within 90 days, regardless of whether we have a hard or a soft Brexit.  The report should detail how we can support the non-exporting indigenous local businesses that are the backbone and bedrock of employment throughout this country.  These companies must be supported but there is a gap in the system.  As a State, we must put the mechanisms in place to support those companies in the context of Brexit.  Regardless of whether it is in 24 days or 21 months, Brexit is happening and these companies need support.</p></speech>

We are looking at providing more supports through the future jobs initiative which I will be launching on Sunday.  I have met all of the LEOs and assure the Deputy that they can provide a broad range of supports to non-exporting Irish companies.  I have read out the list of supports.  It is on the record of the House and I do not propose to go through it again.</p>  <p>  In terms of state aid, the issue is looked at case by case.  The EU's state aid approved rescue and restructure scheme is in place to deal with sudden shocks.  Funding under that scheme has been increased to &euro;200 million, which will provide an important safety net for Irish businesses.  This increased budget is prudent as part of our overall contingency plan for Brexit.  I was delighted with the recent announcement that the European Commission has given state aid approval for investment in an Irish cheese company, Carbery Foods Ingredients Limited.  The fact that this company has received such funding is an indication that the supports are there.  A wide range of supports are available and Deputy Cullinane should familiarise himself with the full range of supports that are available through Enterprise Ireland, IntertradeIreland, the LEOs and through-----</p></speech>

The list goes on and on.  In fairness, businesses are responding and seeking out these supports.  We are here to help them and want to continue to do so.  This is emergency legislation before us today but all of these supports have been in place for some time.  Since 2016 we have been helping businesses to prepare for Brexit.  Admittedly, some businesses asked initially what they should prepare for and left it until very late in the day.  However, there has been a huge take-up of Brexit supports in recent weeks as the situation has crystallised.  This legislation will give Enterprise Ireland more powers to enable it to provide more supports to businesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-03-05a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030500046#UU01100"><p>At the end of the day we must all be conscious of the fact that we do not know what will transpire in the weeks and months ahead, in terms of the legislative flow from decisions made in this House and the impact that Brexit will have on the broader economy.  While it could be argued that the non-exporting indigenous sector may not be immediately impacted by Brexit because it is not exporting, there is no doubt that there could be negative knock-on effects from a slowdown in the economy or a squeeze on credit, for example.  In that context, the proposal by Deputy Naughten has merit.  We are unsure and we must take imaginative steps to assess the potential impacts of Brexit in the time ahead.  The Deputy's provision of a 90-day limit would bring a sense of urgency to the process undertaken by the agency tasked with carrying out the assessment of the non-exporting indigenous sector to see if there are pinch points affecting it.  Credit and cashflow are issues in that regard.  We have consistently said that small and medium businesses have serious difficulties in accessing funding from the pillar banks.  Some companies may need cashflow carry over in terms of inventory, stock and so on, but the banks are very reticent about lending to the SME sector.  In that context, there is a lot of merit in Deputy Naughten's proposal and I urge the Minister to give it serious consideration, especially as it does not do anything materially to undermine the legislation's aim of ensuring that there is a legislative bulwark against a hard Brexit.</p><p>Regardless of what type of Brexit transpires, it will have an impact.  As the Taoiseach said, Brexit of whatever type is a lose, lose, lose.  Who gains from Brexit?  Nobody gains and in that context, even the indigenous, non-exporting sector could find itself in real difficulty.  I urge the Minister to give the proposal serious consideration.  Beyond that, there is the fact that Enterprise Ireland is statutorily charged with dealing with companies that are exporting and which have more than a certain number of employees.  There is a gap there in terms of indigenous non-exporting companies that may want to put out feelers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>international markets.  They may want to take that next step but there is a shortage of policy and supports in that area to enable those in the non-exporting indigenous sector to move into the exporting sector.  It is a daunting task and while I know that toolboxes are available for assessing export markets and so on, it is still a big leap for smaller companies.  This is an area that the Department should keep an eye on, given that these companies are the backbone of our economy.  They are not often flagged and heralded but they provide the majority of employment throughout this State.</p></speech>

Fair play to him for that.  He is right in saying that businesses are unsure.  We are all unsure as to what exactly is going to happen and that uncertainty is creating problems.</p><p>The Government has not done enough.  Fianna F&aacute;il has not come forward with any plan whatsoever on Brexit with regard to any additional supports needed by businesses.  I did not hear any plan in Deputy Kelleher's very short contribution.  When the Minister responded earlier it was, again, a shocking response to the positions businesses will find themselves in if there is a hard crash.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, talked of clinics and scorecards.  It is almost as if the Government is saying that businesses should Google responses.  These are desktop supports rather than practical, financial supports that are necessary to support businesses.</p></speech>

The Minister, however, misses the point entirely.  The Irish economy needs bespoke additional support.  There is no break with the state aid rules in this omnibus Bill.  We are providing nothing that any other member state in the EU cannot provide to its businesses, even though Ireland is deeply exposed as an economy.  Europe needs to step up to the plate.  I welcome the &euro;200 million rescue and restructuring fund but I ask the Minister, please, not to insult businesses by saying that businesses who go to clinics and fill out scorecards are being properly supported.  There is a whole raft of additional supports they need which they are not getting.  These businesses are experiencing real uncertainty and real challenges.  It is not every sector of the economy.  Some sectors are more exposed than others.  I challenge the Minister to read Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals and not just mine.  I suggest she read the proposals submitted to all parties by the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, ISME, and by IBEC.  The Minister should fact-check those proposals and evaluate them against what the Government does.  She will see very quickly that the Government is falling short despite what she is saying, despite her spin and despite the bluster of her responses.  It does not stack up with reality at all.  I am very clear in my analysis that the Government is not doing enough.  It is doing nowhere near enough.  I will not be coming back in again and we will press the amendment.</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister that it is a helpful amendment.  The objective behind it is to focus on this cohort of businesses, which are disproportionately represented within rural communities, in rural constituencies throughout the State and in the provincial towns in rural Ireland.  We very much need to try to focus on them and provide these companies with support.  Work has been done with regard to export and import companies but we now need to look at these businesses.  Having a report back in the House in 90 days would allow us to look at this cohort of businesses specifically, especially given that we will have Brexit at the very latest within the next 21 months.</p></speech>
