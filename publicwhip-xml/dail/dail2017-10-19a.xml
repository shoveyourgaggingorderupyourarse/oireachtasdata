As my party leader indicated, budget 2018 is modest.  There are no spectacular frills or thrills, as is evident from some of the short deliberations of some senior Cabinet Ministers.  From my party's perspective, we are in the precarious position of being tied to the confidence and supply arrangement to ensure the continuation of the Government.  Of course, I would rather be on the other benches in government, be it in complete opposition to or for everything being done, but what we in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party have done is to secure the core principle in the functioning of the Government, namely, having a spending ratio of 2:1 in terms of public expenditure and tax adjustments.</p><p>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, set out in the Budget Statement many initiatives which have to be welcomed, but in some areas there are very few finite deadlines.  Various strategies have been put in motion, but when can we expect to see their implementation?  For example, a home building finance Ireland agency has been proposed, which is good news.  Builders need access to cheap loans, but do we need another agency and, if we do, when can we expect it to be in place?  </p><p>I acknowledge the housing crisis stemming from the level of homelessness and the need for more social housing, but there is also a shortage of private housing for individuals on low incomes.  Alas, there was no mention of affordable housing initiatives in the Budget Statement for people whose income bracket is above the social housing qualification limit but below the requirement for mortgage approval from financial institutions.  This is a sector that seems to have been forgotten about.  This, in turn, is putting additional strain on the rental property sector.</p><p>The increase in stamp duty on commercial property of 200% was almost put through without any acrimony only for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Finance getting their wires crossed.  When I wrote these notes a few days ago, I was going ask that they sit down and talk, but I am delighted to hear and I am hopeful that, with the publication of the Finance Bill, there will be some adjustments to the rate of stamp duty payable on the transfer of land between farmers' relatives.  It is welcome that that is happening and it must be welcomed to ensure the agriculture sector can grow at a competitive level.</p><p>Another budgetary measure that must be welcomed is the increase in the funding allocation for the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That was one of my party's principles in the confidence and supply arrangement in facilitating the formation of the Government. <i></i></p><p>The reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools is also very much to be welcomed.</p><p>I welcome the introduction of a sugar tax which will have an impact in the context of the proposed alcohol Bill, given the increased consumption of spirits and soft drinks among young people.  We now see teenagers drinking whiskey which was unheard of a decade ago.  They are adding Coca Cola, Red Bull and other sweetened drinks to spirits.  This has led to the consumption of spirits going through the roof.  The sugar tax might, therefore, have an impact in the context of the proposed alcohol Bill in reducing the consumption of spirits. </p><p>Being my  party's spokesperson, I welcome the modest increase in funding for sport, about which there is very little in the Budget Statement.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, announced that there should be a total provision of &euro;60 million to fund sports capital grants.  It has been more than two years since the last allocation was made and the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, promised that we would have it this year, but we are still awaiting announcements in that respect.  I note that the funding seems to have been brought forward whereby we will be using next year's money to cover the allocation that I hope will be announced this year.  The increase in funding is welcome.</p><p>More money is to be allocated for the development of greenways, which has to be welcomed.  However, it is almost impossible to find a reference to it in the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe's budget briefing material.</p><p>On transport, only for the Taoiseach stepping in we would not know where we stand with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement last week various projects proposed within Dublin city.  Of the major road infrastructure projects mentioned that will be of any significance to people in the west or the south, I mention the Naas bypass upgrade and the Oberstown junction projects, as well as the improvements that will result from the Sallins bypass project.</p><p>In other ways, the budget gave nothing of significance to the people in the west and south of the country.  It is very disappointing that we had to wait until the Taoiseach came to Cork last Friday, where he was welcomed, to get a commitment on the M20.  We still have to get a commitment that the project will run from Cork to Dublin via Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville.  I am concerned that the rumour that the road being considered may go from Cork to Limerick via Cahir, which is the M8 and the N24, has not properly been dispelled.  It is a bit worrying.  I am from the north-eastern side of the constituency but I would ask that the constituency is put first when the call is being made.  I ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to instruct Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to take the more direct route from Cork to Limerick and to make the proper amount of money available to enable the project to start immediately with ground works, surveys and costings so the road is built.  Some of us thought there was very little for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There were plenty of announcements but nothing good in respect of start-up works.  The Minister was delighted to see the Gort extension of the M17 was completed and brought in on schedule but for how long was that site opened?</p> <p> I quote my party leader when I say it was a modest budget but there are good elements to it.  Fianna F&aacute;il's Deputy Michael McGrath secured the phasing out of mortgage interest relief over three years as opposed to the initial proposal for a total reduction, which is to be welcomed.</p> <p> Being involved in the sports industry, I believe we should look seriously at the issue of bringing in stamp duties and at other ways of funding.  We have a valuable sports industry that needs funding to allow for upgrades, be it in the horseracing or the greyhound industries.  I hope there will be progress with regard to housing, which is a big issue, and infrastructure.  If we do not have the proper infrastructure we cannot drive commerce in this country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1344" speakername="Eamon Scanlon" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900004#B00200"><p>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the budget.  Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward a Private Members' motion in the Chamber last night on pensions inequities and the implementation of the 2012 budget when the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, introduced the cut.  I know that people are tired of listening to the talk about this issue but I raised it last June after I was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I could see the anomaly in what was a very severe cut, and especially in a woman introducing such a cut in a budget that affected mostly women.  It was absolutely unbelievable.  We had the debate last night, we will vote on it today and I implore the Government to look at the situation.  It is very unfair on those persons who are affected.  One of the possible solutions would be to bring back the homemaker claim.  From 1994 there was an allowance for a homemaker, for women who had to give up work to mind their children and who then went back into the workforce.  As a result their pensions have been badly cut.  There is an answer to this.  If the homemaker scheme could be backdated to prior to 1994, it could be a help and would go a long way to alleviate the difficulties being felt by those affected.</p>  <p>  The young farmers' scheme from the national reserve was a fund of &euro;25 million that was introduced in 2015 to support the farming community, in particular young, trained and qualified farmers.  Based on that 2015 funding commitment many young farmers rented lands, paying very high rents, and committed to six year leases because a six year lease was required to qualify for the scheme.  In 2016, unfortunately, no funds were made available for the scheme and in 2017 &euro;5 million was made available.  This leaves those farmers in dire circumstances.  I ask the Government to look at the situation again.  There is a vision for agriculture for the future to 2025, but I can tell the House that by 2020 many of these young and qualified farmers will be bankrupt if they do not get support from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to help them stay in business.  Part of that agriculture plan looks to create 23,000 jobs in to the future.  Unless we get support for these people they will not be in business; they will be gone out of business.</p>  <p>  I will now turn to regional development.  I had a meeting recently with the CEO of IDA Ireland in the north west.  In fairness, it is trying to get employment to the regions and to get companies to move to the north west to create jobs.  It is, however, having great difficulty in this regard.  One of the main difficulties that was explained to me was the road infrastructure from Galway, and particularly from Dublin, to Sligo and that region.  This is the N4 section.  I am glad to see that the M4 was included in the Budget Statement, along with the M5 and the Macroom bypass.  The M4 extension is shovel ready, the lands have been compulsorily purchased and the deals have been agreed with the farmers and those who are to lose their houses.  Most of the people have been paid for their land and compensation and the road is fenced.  The project is shovel ready.  It is a crucial infrastructure development for the north-west region.  We need every advantage to try to get companies and foreign direct investment in to that area.</p>  <p>  I have raised the issue of decentralisation of Departments on a number of occasions.  Decentralisation was announced in the 2003 budget by Fianna F&aacute;il and while it was a good programme, one of its faults was that the three-year timeframe was too ambitious.  It just could not be done in three years.  People may like to move but because of family commitments, such as children in school or university, they cannot make that decision in a three year-period.  I believe we should look at the idea again.  Dublin city is bursting at the seams and people cannot afford to buy houses.  They can barely afford to pay the rent.  Despite the fact they are in good jobs, and this includes people working in Departments, they still find it extremely difficult to survive in the city.  We should definitely look at moving Departments out in a very programmed way over a period of ten to 15 years.  It could mean a better quality of life for many people and would probably open up more accommodation in the city, which is already stretched to capacity.</p>  <p>  We met with the credit union movement this morning.  Credit unions have &euro;10 billion in available funds.  They do a small number of mortgages but the Central Bank should be encouraged to change the rules to allow credit unions to lend money to people to buy their homes.  In Ireland, especially in urban centres such as Dublin, Limerick and Galway, people are paying more in rent than they would for a mortgage to buy a house.  This is a sad situation to be in.  People are so stretched that they will never have a hope of putting together a 20% deposit.  If a person has a good credit rating and has paid his or her rent for the last four or five years without any issues, then he or she should be considered for a mortgage, especially as the money is there.  Mortgage lending is the most profitable lending that an institution can do.  The credit unions, unfortunately, cannot lend the money.  I know from my experience in auctioneering that banks are very selective in whom they lend to.  KBC advertise night and day on television but it does not say it is only lending in Dublin, Cork or Galway.  It does not say that it will not lend to people in rural areas; it is a fact that it does not.</p><p>It is time the banks were brought to heel, of that there is no question.</p> <p> The tenant purchase scheme has been debated in the D&aacute;il.  It is wrong that people who are on social welfare are not allowed to purchase their house, despite the fact they could be in it for 25 or 30 years.  This should be looked at and these people should be given an opportunity to purchase their house.  These houses are not going to become available.  The people are there and when they go, their families will be there.  They should be given this opportunity and the money that is collected from that should be used to provide more housing.  The local authorities should start building local authority houses.  In my home town of Ballymote, County Sligo, in 1947 the Government of the day built a housing scheme of 57 well-constructed houses, which are still standing today.  All that was ever done to them was that they were painted and looked after, and Storm Ophelia earlier this week did not put a dent in any of them.  We should be building more of those houses for people.</p> <p> I recognise it is an improvement that &euro;55 million will be made available to the National Treatment Purchase Fund this year.  This scheme was introduced in 2008 by a Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  We had waiting lists at the time but the scheme definitely made a major dent into those lists and, if funding is made available next year, I have no doubt we will see a further reduction.  That we have 640,000 people on waiting lists is frightening.  We should recognise the fact that when people get into the medical system, they are very well looked after in all the hospitals.  However, getting into the system is the problem.</p> <p> The cancer strategy was very divisive, particularly in the north west, where people availing of cancer services had to go to Galway, in particular for radiotherapy.  Chemotherapy is available in the hospital in Sligo but the diagnostics and radiotherapy are in Galway.  I believe the technology currently available means this radiotherapy could be delivered in the north west, at a hospital like Sligo hospital, even though it would be administered from Galway.  This would save many thousands of people having to travel on buses to Galway or having to live in Galway for the period of their treatment, which might only be ten minutes of treatment per day for six weeks.  It would be helpful and is something that should be investigated.  I call on the Government to consider the possibility.</p> <p> The child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, is another issue in the north west, where there are serious difficulties.  There is a respite home in Sligo which catered for eight people and which was specifically built eight years ago at a cost of &euro;1.5 million to provide respite to parents by giving them a weekend or a few days off.  That service has recently closed and the building is being used for decongregation.  The people who were availing of the service now have to travel from Sligo to Monaghan, which is nearly a 350 km round trip with somebody who is probably in a wheelchair.  It is disgraceful.  A commitment was given by the Department that a new respite centre would be opened by the middle of this month but, as far as I am aware, a building has not even been identified where this service could be provided.</p> <p> Another issue that will arise next year is in regard to school transport.  While we had difficulties this year, the situation will be even more difficult next year.  Ahead of next year's programme, which will apply from early March, the Government needs to make provision to ensure the service can be run efficiently so people are not discommoded.  We were lucky that things worked out to some extent this year but I can foresee a lot of difficulties next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900005#C00200"><p>Like others, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak ahead of the Finance Bill which will give statutory effect to the budget of last week.  I welcome the positive developments that have taken place over the past five or six years and to recognise the sacrifices that have been made by the Irish people and by many in this House, in particular in regard to the crucial decisions that had to be made to stabilise the country at a time of great distress.</p>  <p>  I listened to the various issues that have come to the fore in recent times.  Critics will always ask, "What have you been doing for the past five years?"  It never ceases to amaze me why some commentators do not seem to recognise that we were broke five years ago - no money, nothing, empty coffers, increasing demands, nowhere to go, nowhere to run.  A great task had to be undertaken by the then Government, with the support of some people in this House, which is acknowledged and accepted.  However, others saw the opportunity to undermine, to second-guess and to put forward unrealistic proposals which very often are about as good as they paper they are written on.</p>  <p>  We have now reached a situation where there is at least a basis on which to build our future.  For those who say it is not coming quick enough, of course, nothing ever comes quick enough - a watched kettle is the old familiar story.  It could not come any quicker for the simple reason that it takes time to recover and recovery is an ongoing process.  We also need to be careful to ensure we do not let it slip again.  This is a warning to us all.  We were, we do not ever want to be again where we were five or so years ago.  The sacrifices and efforts that were made by the people over the past years should not have to be made again to achieve that same purpose of surviving.  I hope that lesson has been well and truly learned at this stage and we can now go forward in the knowledge that our destiny is in our own hands.  We can plan ahead for the future in a realistic way and make the necessary decisions, which we are doing, and as time goes by the country will reap the benefits.</p>  <p>  There are still many challenges, of course, including in regard to infrastructure.  I agree with the speakers who say that vital elements of infrastructure are still required, in particular in regard to roads and transport, which are hugely important.  The previous speaker spoke about the N4.  I remember travelling during the summer on the road from Castlebaldwin towards Sligo, where there are 31 crosses on the roadside marking accidents where people lost their lives, no doubt as a result of roads that are incapable of taking the volume of traffic thrust upon them by today's requirements.  I particularly welcome the spending on roads, given the vital role they will play in the future economic development of the country.</p>  <p>  There are also infrastructural challenges in regard to hospitals.  Thankfully, the Government was in a position to be able to proceed with the new children's hospital, the new maternity hospital and a number of other major hospital developments throughout the country.  The list is endless and more is always required.  It is important that the Government at all times continues to strategically select the projects that require the most immediate attention and does its best to meet those demands.  I believe it is doing that, and doing it well.</p>  <p>  I spoke on the night of the budget about the application of stamp duty to the farming community, and I know something is being done to address this at present.  I mentioned that the proposal could have the direct opposite effect to what was intended.  In the meantime, I believe considerable discussions have taken place which, hopefully, will deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  The previous speaker mentioned the necessity to spread the fruits of the economy evenly throughout the country, which is correct.  We cannot continue to develop from east to west.  We have to put in place the infrastructure that is necessary to facilitate the development that has to take place throughout the other regions.</p><p>Whether it be in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway, Mayo, Sligo or wherever, we have to proceed vigorously to encourage investment.  I hope the recent and continued hiccups in respect of the investment in County Galway can be resolved fairly quickly.  We cannot afford to say to investors that we do not really need them here and that they should go somewhere else.  We have to make up our minds.  We either want investment or we do not.  We should recognise that it is a very competitive space.  There are others who encourage investment as well and we are up against them.  It is up to us to put our best foot forward.</p> <p> In respect of health, there are many challenges that will remain for some considerable time.  We are among the higher echelons of funding for health services among the OECD countries.  We need to step back and look at how we are spending our money.  Are we getting good value?  Money thrown at a situation, as has been shown in the past, does not necessarily produce the results.  There is an urgent necessity to evaluate what exactly is happening, apart from Sl&aacute;intecare altogether.  For example, we need to examine the long waiting lists.  Why do we have waiting lists?  We can attribute some of it to the bad economic time we have come through.  However, we have traditionally had a problem with waiting lists, to the extent that we have to ask ourselves what are the reasons.  There has to be some reason to which it can be attributed.  Is it because of lack of theatre space or theatre staff?  Is it because of a lack of consultants or general practitioners?</p> <p> I had an interesting exchange with officials from the HSE at the health committee yesterday.  I asked them the same question and nobody has answered it.  The fact remains that there are facilities in the public sector that are not utilised at all.  I do not know why.  The answer needs to be found and we should not have to wait forever for it.  A consultant recently remarked that in the private sector, he can do a full day's work from morning until late evening, without interruption and with all facilities available.  In the public sector, the same consultant might get two hours and then there will be a shortage of some facility.  Something is missing, a link in the chain is not there.  Why?  Unless we come to grips with that situation, we can spend all the money we like on our health services but it will not make a jot of difference.  What is the cause of the overcrowding in accident and emergency departments?  Is it because more people go there instead of to their general practitioner?  Is it because there are insufficient numbers of general practitioners?  What is happening there?</p> <p> Our population is increasing.  There is great emphasis being placed on the cohort of older people in the country but that is not accurate.  It is being put out as an excuse for almost everything.  In fact, the cohort of younger people is greater here than in most other European countries at present.  Many of those who left the country in the past, and who did not come back, were young people.  Many of those who left more recently during the recession did so for a shorter time, and came back.  They are here now.  They are young people in productive employment who are contributing to this economy.  It is not true or accurate to say the problem is that we have a lot of older people.  The sooner the system wakes up to that, the better.</p> <p> The Sl&aacute;intecare report, to which I was honoured to contribute, will address the issues.  However, unless it also addresses the structural issues, nothing is going to happen.  I emphasise what I said on many occasions during those discussions, namely, that I believe the HSE is the incorrect structure to deliver services throughout the country.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies will not agree with me because their party abolished the old health boards.  I do not know whether they think that was a good idea now.  I do not think it was, although the health boards needed to be reformed.  The correct structure is to have about four regional bodies in which there would be local democracy and accountability and the input of professionals, be they general practitioners, consultants, hospitals or whatever.  They should be involved in decision making at local level, as well as in the responsibility that goes with it.  We would then be able to send representatives from those bodies to a national structure which could be similar to the HSE.  At present, I cannot see how it is ever going to work.  From the beginning, the HSE was not the correct structure to run the services throughout the country.  The talents and dedication of those within the health service are better tapped when responsibility is given to them at local level.  Some people would say there should be no politicians on any such body or board but that is not correct.  Politicians are elected by the public to represent them and, like everybody else, they have to be at the coalface playing a responsible role and dealing with the situations that arise.</p> <p> The other thing that, sadly and tragically, has not gone away is the housing situation.  Other speakers have referred to it.  Going back as far as the Administration that preceded the last Government, I saw what was happening, as did many others who are still Members of the House, including the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  It was quite obvious to some of us that we were heading into a major catastrophe, because we were not building on an ongoing basis.  We were not replenishing our housing stock and were not creating affordable houses for those who were in an income bracket in which they could not afford to risk borrowing above their heads.  Unfortunately, we have not addressed that yet.  I compliment the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on the work that is being done and that is still to unfold.  However, it is like the mills of God that move exceeding slow.  Unless we can accelerate the programme in a really meaningful way in the shortest possible time, this sadly is going to get much worse.  Of course we should not have people sleeping on the streets and under bridges.  However, that is not the major issue.  It is the result of the other issues of crowding and pressure in the market space.  It takes three incomes now to fund a mortgage on an ordinary three-bedroom, semi-detached house.  We can work it out any way we like.  A mortgage used to be two and a half times the income under the old system.  It is now three times the income but, either way, two people have to work full time in the household to just barely make ends meet.  After that, if anything goes wrong or if somebody falls ill, there is a problem.  There is a lot of work to be done yet.  It requires emergency treatment now.</p> <p> There are those here who suggest from time to time that nobody thought about it but themselves.  Some of us were talking about this many years ago, long before it happened and became obvious.  It was clear to us that things were not happening as they should at local level.  In my own county in the 1980s, it was deemed that there was a requirement of about 1,000 houses per annum.  There were two ways to do that.  We could have direct build local authority houses and local authority loans, and we could also develop private sites, which we did.  We made 800 to 900 houses available to people within particular income brackets on an annual basis, even through the midst of economic difficulties.  There was not a great deal of money available in the country then.  It worked very well.  We had the housing finance industry loans at the time.  They were criticised afterwards by other lending agencies, of course, wrongly so.  They made loans available to people who would not get a loan anywhere else at that time.  They gave people pride in what they were doing, in their own home and in their work and the commitment they were making to the economy.  People were delighted to take that responsibility.</p><p>We need to do much more in the context of an accelerated programme to deal with the housing issue.  Building has commenced and it is accelerating, which is welcome, but time is of the essence.  Those who have been squeezed and who have been waiting for such a long time are at breaking point.</p> <p> I would like to mention the issue that has engaged many in the past few weeks in respect of banking, that of overcharging, switching, pressure and so on with which some of us have been dealing behind the scenes for a long time.  We have been face to face with the bankers and their representatives and sometimes they were not very nice.  We witnessed at first hand the attitude in lending institutions and what they thought of their customers and public representatives.  We had to go into court time and again to plead on behalf of constituents.  Sometimes we were welcome in the banks, but we were not welcomed at all times  These issues have been arising not only in recent times but for the past eight years at least.  Many were squeezed during that period and forced out of their houses.  They suffered greatly and tragically throughout and I hope we have learned lessons.</p> <p> I am delighted that the Minister for Finance is inviting the chief executive officers of the lending institutions to visit him next week.  I hope he will speak to them in the words that need to be spoken.  A few years ago one bank official said to me and a customer I was representing, "I am a businessman."  I thought of other descriptions at the same time and told him so.  We represent the people and they are not always wrong.  When they cry out for help, we need to recognise what they are saying and tell them that we are here to help.  I also hope the Minister will extend his invitation to the venture capitalists who have taken over some distressed loans.  Some of them have been affable and willing to entertain customers, while others have not.  The only contribution they have made is causing greater distress and they appear intent on doing nothing less.  I hope the Minister will encourage them to recognise the difference between those who have struggled and paid in the past few years and those who did not pay at all because it could come to pass that those who did not pay and walked away will be thanked as well as those who struggled to make payments to the best of their ability.  I hope this will be included in his portfolio on the day.</p> <p> There are challenging times ahead.  Nothing was ever going to be easy, as stated in the advertisement.  The challenging times arise from Brexit, retrenchment in the United States and the discouragement of the international community in terms of foreign direct investment.  We have our own begrudgers in Europe.  Some speak out on a regular basis, for example, about the Apple tax.  It is now suggested Ireland should collect taxes on profits earned in other jurisdictions, which is completely at variance with the regulations.  It also represents an interference with the internal taxation regime in a particular county.  This is being done to target a country that has benefited significantly from foreign direct investment, but it is not one-way traffic.  Many Irish investors have invested freely abroad on a regular basis.  Mr. Martin Naughton was correctly honoured in recent days by Dublin City University for his work in this area.  CRH and various others have done the same all over the world.  If there is retrenchment globally, everybody will be hurt, but there are those who think the more powerful will succeed.  They might for a while, but ultimately they will not.</p> <p> I would love to air the rest of my grievances, but it would take much longer than the time I have available.  I thank the Acting Chairman</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900007#E00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budget that was announced last week.  As Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on communications, climate action and the environment, I intend to confine my remarks to my portfolio.  Many other areas have been well and truly covered by my colleagues.  </p><p>I draw the Minister of State's attention to a statement made by the Taoiseach in appointing his Cabinet.  He said:</p><blockquote>I am determined that the Government should show new ambition when it comes to tackling climate change by setting out a roadmap to a low-carbon economy.  Climate change will be the first item to be discussed at our first full day strategic Cabinet meeting.</blockquote><p>They were fine words, but, unfortunately, whatever the outcome of the discussions that took place at that meeting, they had no influence on his first budget as Taoiseach.  It does not take a rocket scientist to peruse the budgetary proposals from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for the next year.  Absolutely no ambition has been shown to address the issue of climate change.  If we were talking about climate change in the abstract, that might be okay, but a previous Government signed up to binding targets, which must be met by 2020.  We have committed to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an increase in the usage of renewables.  The Environmental Protection Agency's recent report makes it clear that we are on target to miss these targets significantly.  The projections are wide and varied regarding the fines that will be levied on the State in 2020, but they could be between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion.  It is, therefore, not good enough for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to abdicate his responsibility and ask from where the money will come to meet the targets because the next question surely is from where will the money come to pay the fines that will be levied in 2020.  If the Government somehow believes a relatively benign approach will be taken at European level, that does not gel with the contacts I have had with colleagues in other member states and within the Brussels architecture.  The Government has engaged in window dressing in suggesting it has discussed this issue, but it seems to have filed the issue of climate action on some shelf.</p><p>One of the significant drivers has to be encouraging people to use electric vehicles and the only way that can be done is through appropriate incentivisation.  I have examined the targets set in Norway and what has been achieved there.  The uptake of electric vehicles has been enormous in comparison to Ireland.  Free tolling and free parking are provided for, while bus lanes can be used by drivers of electric vehicles.  In an effort to touch base, the Minister has introduced in next year's budget the notion of a benefit-in-kind rate of zero, with a moratorium of one year and a promise to review the position thereafter in the purchase of such vehicles.  The Minister of State will understand the way companies make decisions.  Much has been made of our 12.5% corporation tax rate.  A reduction of 0.5% or 1% would not matter a damn to the companies concerned.  The reason the rate cannot be changed is that it would remove certainty.  There is certainty in Ireland about our corporation tax rate.  If a measure was to be introduced in the budget whereby the staff of companies and fleet owners provided with electric vehicles would not be charged benefit-in-kind for only one year, there would be no certainty.</p><p>As sure as night follows day, the uptake will be very limited.  I have spoken to people within the industry who own significant fleets and could make a major dent in increasing the amount of electric vehicles in the country.  They have asked why the Government would impose that on employees and then require them to pay a significant BIK the following year.  Had it been done for five years with a review thereafter, given the lifecycle of a car of four five years, at least that would give certainty.</p> <p> That measure was much heralded and trumpeted by a Minister who has come to be recognised now as almost a court jester.  Whenever there is an event not related to his Department but in some way vaguely relevant, he is there.  He is on the radio and television.  Yesterday he was there to welcome the electricity repair crews coming from Northern Ireland.  He has a host of engagements in his constituency.  He is like the court jester who is asked to open a pub and by the end of his presentation he is talking in the collective.  It is "we"; the court jester owns the pub.</p> <p> We see the same from the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on all these issues.  If somebody else is doing something, he thinks he is involved in it by association and it has happened as a result of his efforts and those of the Government.  We saw it again this morning.  Google has introduced mapping technology to allow emergency services to pinpoint the location of a caller to the 999 or 112 service.  The Minister was asked to launch it.  He has taken on a much greater role.  It is "we", "us" and "the Government"; it is amazing.  It would not matter if it was not so serious, but it is acting as a distraction from addressing the real issues.  In something like this the Minister could make a real name for himself and be able to use the collective in saying, "We, as a Government, have done something", rather than claiming responsibility as he does.</p> <p> Turning to the issue of broadband, the budget allocated &euro;15 million, which will just about pay the consultants carrying out the procurement process.  We will not achieve anything on broadband this year.  No shovel will be placed in the ground and no home will be connected under the national broadband plan.  However, I am sure the Minister will quickly issue a press release outlining the number of farms and post offices being connected every day and claiming that "We, the Government, are making all this happen".  This is another example of claiming responsibility for corporate decisions by Eir, SIRO, Virgin Media and other providers.  It is amazing that the Minister, on behalf of the Government, claims responsibility for something he has nothing to do with.</p> <p> There is an ultimate failure to address the 540,000 homes without broadband.  Nothing in the budget indicates they are any closer to being connected to a high-speed broadband service.  It does not deter the Minister running along like the court jester, believing he is part of something great.  Unfortunately it is no joke from a climate-change perspective.  It is no joke, given the need for the country to face up to the challenges associated with our targets for 2020.  It is certainly no help to the 540,000 households with no light at the end of the tunnel for a broadband connection.</p> <p> Post offices also fall under this Department's remit.  The Government initiated a process of engagement between postmasters, the Government and An Post.  Bobby Kerr, an eminent businessman and a very practical person, published a report.  At the time the Government signed up to it and indicated that it effectively planned a roadmap for the future of the post office network.  Mr. Kerr suggested that An Post should consider what kinds of services are being delivered; whether a greater number of services could be delivered in post offices; and what would help to assist the An Post network to become more commercially viable.  It was very clear that it would need Government support and intervention if the Government believed in having a widespread post office network.</p> <p> I had an opportunity to visit a post office in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  I am sure he is well aware of the importance of the retention of the post office in Old Pallas.  I met old people there, some of whom voted for the Minister of State.  They are the same kinds of people I meet in my constituency every week.  They recognise that people are not going into and out of post offices the way they did years ago.  Therefore viability is an issue.  Even if only 50% of the transactions now happen electronically, including social welfare and pension payments being transferred directly into their banks, it is not appropriate to close that post office.  What do we say to the other 50%?  Even if it goes as low as 20% of the activity that was there previously, it is not right to say to the remaining 20%, "Tough, it is no longer viable".  That is the State turning its back on people.</p> <p> The Taoiseach referenced it the other day and he knows the importance of keeping the harp over the door in those communities.  Unless the Minister, Deputy Naughten, steps into the ring at some point, post offices will close by stealth.  Every week post offices are being reviewed on a three- and five-year basis.  The number of transactions is dropping.  They are subcontractors to An Post and their money is cut because their activity has gone down.  They cannot survive and are closing the doors themselves.</p> <p> If the Minister, Deputy Naughten, believes that this somehow absolves him from responsibility, if he somehow thinks that because the contractors have made the decision themselves to close then that it is okay, I have news for him and for the Government.  It is not okay because the people who still require the service are voters and taxpayers pensioners and social welfare recipients.  They have a stake in society.  They might not gel with the Minister's friends in Google for which he is acting the court jester this morning.  These are real people who have made a contribution to the State and they deserve to be respected.  They are entitled to the same services as everybody else who might be more computer literate, and more mobile and connected.  They are real people and they deserve a service.</p> <p> I believe that the 1,000 to 1,100 post offices we have is about right.  An Post will not be able to maintain that network if it is forced to do it from current activities.  It will require intervention from the State.  I believe it probably requires between &euro;8 million and &euro;10 million a year from the central Exchequer.  That is not a number picked from the air.  The Kerr report had costings of between &euro;50 million and &euro;60 million over a five-year period.  Therefore, &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million - it might cost more if people seek to retire - would protect the network for the next five years.</p> <p> No line item in the budget allocated to the Minister, Deputy Naughten, would suggest he is cognisant of the challenge facing the post office network or that he has any intention of committing resources from the central Exchequer to support the network.  He will utter fine words.  When, a number of years ago he and the then Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ring, quibbled over who had responsibility for the post office network again, in another shouldering up or manning up, he said he would take on the network.  He took it, all right.  He took political responsibility but he certainly did not support it with any level of finance, which is very disheartening for the men and women who are attempting to keep the post offices open, who believe in their communities, and who care about the people who use the post office.  In many cases it is their only social interaction.</p><p>If we devalue that as a society, run headlong after the smart economy, of which I am a supporter, and somehow distance ourselves or become entirely dislocated from the people for whom that is not a way of life, then as politicians we will have lost our way.  We must be able, as Deputy Durkan has said, to represent all the people all the time.  That is our duty and our responsibility.  Of course I am all for technology, but the Minister is not following through on that side either.  He is dragging his heels in respect of the people living outside the areas that the commercial operators see as suitable for service provision on a commercial basis.  He has succeeded in creating the most complex tender and procurement procedure ever organised by Government.  He is right when he says this is taxpayers' money that must be protected, but surely to God it can be done in a more time-efficient way.  We are now down to two contractors, such is the cumbersome nature of the way in which he has allowed this process to develop.  He somehow believes that because it is complex and he has all the jargon, words and acronyms, that somehow confuses people.  I have news for him: it does not.  All they want to know is when the Government will treat people who live in rural areas fairly, and they are not being treated fairly.  There is no roadmap, no start date for the work to begin on the national broadband plan, no date by which contracts must be signed, no date for a contractor to start and no finish date.  Project management 101 would suggest that the first thing one does on any project, after having scoped it and understood what one wants to do, is to pick a start date and, if hiring a contractor, to put on a calendar a date by which the contract will be signed.  Even if there is a bit of mission creep and the project goes on for an extra week or an extra month, one gets over that - but one sets a target.  There must be a target date for the contract to be agreed and signed, a target date for the work to begin and a target date for it to finish.  However, the Minister is too afraid to put a date in the calendar because he would then have to accept political responsibility for failing to meet that date.  This is why I term the Minister a court jester.  He is there for the good times, the laughs and the opening of various events but not prepared to put his neck on the line, get behind the project and bring it to a conclusion.  This is so serious in terms of the impact on our climate and our post office network and, unfortunately, as I said, the Minister has failed abysmally.</p> <p> Then there is the issue of the climate change targets I talked about.  There is nothing in the budget about this.  The Minister talks about a renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, in the context of the renewable heat scheme, for which &euro;17 million is set aside.  This also includes the cost of the roll-out of electric vehicles.  This is an absolutely minuscule amount of money for that initiative.  It goes nowhere towards meeting our targets.  Yes, there is some money - I will give credit where it is due - to expand the energy efficiency programme by investing an additional &euro;35 million in the residential, commercial and public sectors for the reduction of CO2 emissions from the built environment.  This and anything else that can help in this regard are welcome because we are falling way behind in use of renewables in heat, but these are just minor amounts of money in the context of what we must achieve by 2020.  The Minister is used to saying to advocacy groups that he may not be the Minister next year.  He may not be next year or in two years' time, but some representative cabinet will have to face the fines from Europe in 2020.  If the Minister's view is so short-term that he does not believe he will be the Minister by then and, therefore, the matter does not really trouble or worry him, it shows the kind of poor ambition of the Taoiseach if he is not prepared to drive the Minister in reaching his responsibilities.  It is appalling.</p> <p> Another area, which I may not have enough time to address adequately, is public service broadcasting.  This is handled principally by RTE, but many of our local and regional radio stations carry out, under licence, a very important role in public service broadcasting.  I have a Bill which I have shared with the secretariat of the House, which I hope will come before the House relatively shortly and which I hope will get support from the other side of the House.  It would see financial support given to public service broadcasters in the independent radio sector.  There is no indication in the budget that the Minister is even considering this.  He has a consultation process around the collection of the television licence fee.  We are way behind every other country in Europe in the collection of our licence fee.  About 15% or 16% is not collected.  RTE is looking for additional money and the local radio sector is looking for money.  There is a pot of money out there if only it were collected.  This could be done through the Revenue Commissioners - simple - but the Minister has another consultation process and another procurement process and, by the time it is all resolved, I suppose he will not be Minister anyway so it will not matter.</p> <p> What we need are decisions, and usually decisions that are taken are identified in the Finance Act and the Budget Statement because decisions usually require money.  If the Minister, Deputy Naughten, representing the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, intends to take decisions, they will be of a very woolly nature because he has identified few if any changes in his budget for next year to achieve anything in an area that is crying out for action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900009#G00200"><p>I am not quite sure where the confidence and supply agreement begins and ends regarding a budget.  I am no great fan of the arrangement, like many others around the country.  If ever one needed evidence of lack of delivery on the part of a government, one need only look at this budget.  One will hear the normal clich&eacute;s trotted out - "missed opportunity" and so on - but it is clear evidence that the Government does not understand that its first obligation is to keep its people safe.  It is a clear indication to me that no imagination was shown and no vision displayed in the budget.  It is simply a budget that has been cobbled together to keep this show on the road.  That is the reality of this budget.  As a result, the big winners continue to be big winners.</p>  <p>  For example, I have seen in the newspapers over the past few days - perhaps it was just today - that the State has paid &euro;221 million in legal fees.  Let us examine that in the context of the budget.  This morning the Central Bank is before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, where the members are trying to hold the bank to account regarding the tracker mortgage issue.  That bank spent &euro;7.5 million in legal fees in one year.  How much of that was caused by the fact that the banks generally continue to drag their feet on their responsibilities, refuse to accept there is a tracker mortgage issue and refuse to deal with the full cohort of people and customers affected by the issue and, as a result, cause the bank to have to buy in expertise and legal fees?  That is the impact that private sector activity has on the budget for this country.  It forces an agency of the State to spend greater amounts of taxpayers' money on legal and professional fees.  That is what is going on.  It is a never-ending cycle, and the Committee of Public Accounts every week discovers all the inefficiencies and poor spending for the State.  The committee reports it to the line Minister, who in turn reports it to the Minister of State responsible, and one gets the normal report back, which generally gives a blas&eacute; explanation as to why it had to be done.</p><p>Were this a business, it would probably be closed down because it is inefficient, ineffective and losing money hand over fist to the private sector, which is draining the State of valuable resources.</p> <p> One need only consider the spend thereafter on, for example, education.  The universities are demanding more money and we are demanding that there be universities in, for example, Waterford in the south east.  I do not disagree with any of that, but I do disagree with the amount of money that universities are spending to achieve it, to keep their people safe and to look after their employees.  There is evidence of significant waste in that sector, with money being spent on paintings or &euro;13,000 being spent on retirement parties for individuals, while those in the sector who have made complaints under whistleblowing legislation have not been paid for three or four years.  Someone needs to hold those colleges to account.  In particular, someone needs to tell CIT that, as required by legislation, it needs to pay members of its staff when they are on leave because they blew the whistle on some scandal or other.</p> <p> The same applies to the Garda and the Prison Service.  The latter is in crisis.  Numerous prison officers are out sick because of incidents in which they were badly injured by prisoners while at work.  They have been put on suspended leave and are not being paid fully.  They must fight for their wages.  That is a scandal in itself, but when one considers the amount of taxpayers' money that is being used to prop up a system that does not work and has poor HR management systems in every sector, is it any wonder that there are problems with staff?</p> <p> I challenge the Minister of State to put in place a more responsive dedicated unit rather than the &euro;5 million on spin within the Taoiseach's office, attach that spend to the Committee of Public Accounts and take real action on reports that are being made available to various Ministers with a view towards change and reform.  They are reluctantly considering, and desperately avoiding, reform because it may bring about greater efficiencies in how taxpayers' money is spent.</p> <p> I wish to address the major issues in the budget.  I acknowledge the work that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is doing on housing, but I am afraid that he is experiencing the reluctance of local authorities to build.  How is it that large housing schemes were constructed throughout the country in the 1950s and 1960s when there was little expertise or money but there was a drastic need for public housing?  Local authorities did that work well.  They now have the expertise and vast amounts of money, yet for some reason they are unable to deliver.  They do not build houses.  They no longer collect rubbish.  They no longer have anything to do with water.  What in the name of God are county managers actually doing?  For what are they getting paid?  The Minister needs to call them in again and tell them to build or buy the houses that are necessary if the waiting lists that exist in every county are to be reduced.  There are 3,500 people on the list in Kilkenny, a number of sites that are ready to be built on and developers who are ready to construct, yet there is no appetite within the local authority to do it.</p> <p> I challenge the Minister to make available a scheme, such as the shared ownership or grant scheme, to ensure that that the block of people in the middle, who do not qualify for local authority housing because they are over the money threshold even though they do not have enough to qualify for a loan, are included on some list.  A scheme should be made available to such people so that they might buy or construct a house for their family.  I want local authorities to build extensions to keep people in their homes.  There is almost a refusal by local authorities to do that kind of work.</p> <p> I want local authorities to buy houses for the families of children with special needs.  For several years, I have raised in the Chamber a case that I have been dealing with in Kilkenny.  The Respond! Housing Association has three units that could each house a family.  It has planning permission.  However, for ten years or more that site has remained idle.  A house was constructed that could house a family with special needs but it has been vacant for at least ten years.  I have brought this matter to the attention of the Minister and Respond! but nothing has happened because the connection between the Minister, Respond! and the local authority is gone.  They no longer respect public representatives.  In fact, we are a nuisance.  I challenge Deputies to pick up the phone right now and telephone their county managers, then tell me whether they get through.  County managers pay lipservice to the legislation when meeting Oireachtas Members.  Were the Minister to exercise his authority where it was necessary to make them do their job, we would have houses on the ground.  There is no need for a further agency, just as there is no need for an agency to make cheap money available to developers.  We own AIB and have a share in another bank.  Why can the Government not tell them to loan a particular amount of money in a particular scheme?</p> <p> We are too fond of creating quangos in this country and outsourcing problems to other agencies.  That is rife within the HSE, which is essentially dysfunctional.  It does not know how many managers it has.  It knows that it has too many, that there are more managers than front-line staff and that more respect is given to managers than to front-line staff, yet the latter are the Band-Aid holding all of the HSE's services together.  Without them, their dedication and their passion, the health service would be in a worse situation.</p> <p> How capable is the management of the HSE in respect of its services and the money that the Government gives it?  The HSE still does not have a single accounting system.  Rather, there are a number of systems across the country that do not speak with one another.  As a result, the HSE does not know what is happening in the health service at any given time.  What we do know is that, in each year over the past few years, the HSE has almost tipped &euro;1 billion in overspending.  It has received an increase in this year's budget, but that will only offset what it overspent last year.  The HSE is constantly running ahead of its spend and is marching just to stand still.  It is crazy that the HSE does not have someone who will take responsibility.  I have no confidence in its management.  I have the greatest of confidence in its staff because, once someone is in their care, he or she progresses well.  However, the waiting list to get into their care incurs a major human cost.</p> <p> I urge reform of and greater accountability in the HSE, with a management structure to equal any business on the front line of best practice in this country.  That is necessary.  Change managers are needed to ensure that the reforms required to bring about a better health service are enacted.</p><p>Politicians act in good faith, now as they did in the past, and try to do their best, but they are challenged by a system that beats them down over the short period a Minister holds office.<br/><br/>It is the same with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We had a crisis in the Garda that went on for months on end and resulted in the departure of two Commissioners and a Minister, yet I have not heard the House debate the new plan and strategy for the force.  I have not heard any discussion of it.  I challenge the Government to bring its plan to the floor of the House.  A strategy is needed because no single person can manage a force with 12,000 to 14,000 members and be the Accounting Officer before D&aacute;il committees week in and week out as well as appearing before the other organisation overseeing the Garda.  With respect to those within the force, it needs a new, modern and dynamic system of management.  There is a need for education for those who want to join the force such as there is for doctors or nurses.  Why do we not have courses like that for the Garda?  Why is there no officer corps within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as there is in the Army?  Why do we not break down the force according to its responsibilities as is done in France and then make them accountable for the money they spend?  They do not have a single system of accounting within their force.<br/><br/>If I stand up to criticise the Garda, the health service or a local authority, I want to be able to do so with the intention of trying to improve their lot.  I want to see a better force.  Politicians, however, do not ensure that a better management system and a better force is provided for.  That is where we fall down.  When Mary Harney was Minister, I called for a truce around health whereby we would all buy into the same policy and try to support the Department's patient-centred initiatives.  We had it recently in the health committee, but when it brought forward its strategy, the money was not put behind it.  Nothing happened.<br/><br/>The one issue in health which we have to grasp is mental health.  We talk about it in the House and say there are millions available, but what happens on the ground thereafter is shocking.  Young people with mental health issues who turn up for care do not get it.  I know of numerous cases where people turned up for care, were refused or received the wrong care or ended up in a community setting and subsequently took their own lives.  That is a fact and we have to do something to address it.  If we do not have the fully qualified people at the front line, we must do something about it.  Our young people are being destroyed by the challenges of life for which they are unprepared, for some reason or other, and we have to reach out to them.  The services are not there, however.  The same thing happens as older people go through life and come to need support and services.<br/><br/>The single complaint that emerges loud and clear from life in modern Ireland is the fact that the banks have driven so many people to their deaths.  Many people have committed suicide because the banks have spent every single day tormenting families to collect money.  One vulture fund recently told a client that it did not care where he got the money.  He was told to ask friends, neighbours, family, his mother, his father or the credit union as long as he got the money.  &quot;We want money&quot; is the attitude of a manager in a vulture fund.  As long as we allow that to happen without regulation, the quality of people's lives will be tested day in and day out.  The Central Bank will acknowledge this morning that its does not have the powers to deal with the tracker mortgage issue.  It does not have the extended powers necessary to tell banks to pay the cohort of people who have been proven to have been put on the wrong rate and proven to have been taken off the tracker.  The Central Bank does not have the power and so it tries to cajole the banks or put moral pressure on them.  No bank, to my knowledge, understands moral pressure.  Banks understand their bottom line and the need to protect it and they ignore what we say in the House.<br/><br/>While I welcome the statement of the Taoiseach yesterday and the fact that the banks are being brought in to explain their stance, he and the Minister for Finance should beat up on the lot of them.  They should threaten to withdraw their licences or to restrict them.  There are other players in the market.  <i>Sparkassen</i>banks in Germany want their model to be permitted in this country.  Today in Germany, ten year tracker rates stand at 1.1% but one cannot get that here.  The banks are running roughshod over every well-intentioned politician and regulator because they can.  We should ensure by way of legislation and penalties of one kind or another that the day comes when the banks cannot do that.  The day must come after which headlines asking why no one will stand up to our bullying banks never again appear in our newspapers.  The banks should not be allowed to bully families or individuals.  Addressing that is the responsibility of Government and it is what I mean when I say any Government is obliged to keep its people safe.  We have not done that.</p></speech>

I welcome the prudent approach adopted as we need to learn lessons from the reckless financial management of the past which brought us to the brink of bankruptcy.  To that end, I welcome the establishment of the rainy day fund with an investment of &euro;1.5 billion.  I also welcome the capital plan which is crucial to the delivery of key priority projects in social housing, roads and schools and will be critical as we move to develop our 2040 planning framework.  I greatly look forward to contributing to that process and to proposing investment and connectivity to Offaly through access to our county town of Tullamore via a link from the N6 at Kilbeggan.</p>  <p>  I welcome the increase in HAP funding which will be very helpful for people looking to accommodate themselves in their local areas.  I welcome also the investment next year in new social housing.  There are very many working people who simply cannot provide a house for themselves.  The one thing we can do is to ensure people can get a roof over their heads as that is where they can make a great start in life.</p>  <p>  The increase in stamp duty from 2% to 6% has been a cause of concern for many, in particular those who are midway through transactions and have budgeted for the lower rate.  I hope it will be clarified that if contracts have been signed and deposits have been paid over, people will pay the 2% which they understood they had to budget for rather than the 6% rate.  I appreciate that it is 6% for new transactions.  A number of farming families have also contacted me on the age for transfers, which they feel is too low at 67.  I hope we will be able to increase it.</p>  <p>  Last year, I welcomed the investment of &euro;5 million through budget 2017 to establish the Healthy Ireland fund.</p><p>I welcome the additional investment of &euro;5 million, which underpins the commitment to the Healthy Ireland framework.  However, it is only a drop in the ocean in terms of what is needed.  I would like to see that funding increased year-on-year rather than remain at &euro;5 million because the Healthy Ireland framework is essential in preventing physical and mental illness.  Prevention should be our objective.<br/><br/>I also welcome the introduction of the sugar tax, which was flagged last year.  However, I would prefer if it had been hypothecated to be targeted specifically at tackling the challenges of obesity, be that in relation to people in need of bariatric surgery, investment in our secondary schools and colleges or ourselves to improve our own quality of life.  I appeal to the Department of Finance to reconsider its proposed use of the yield from this tax.  Prevention is not spoken about enough in relation to this area.  I welcome the investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the recruitment of an additional 800 Garda and 500 civilian staff.  I also welcome all of the other services that are being rolled out through the Department of Justice and Equality, including the additional funding for CCTV systems and community text alert schemes.<br/><br/>Brexit is the greatest challenge to our country and economy in recent times.  Our SMEs, which are the backbone of our communities, having access to the Brexit loan scheme at low interest rates is to be welcomed, as is the retention of the 9% VAT rate to support the hospitality sector, which I believe really needs assistance.  While this sector is booming in particular areas, the 9% VAT rate is vital to counties like Offaly that are still developing their fantastic tourism product.<br/><br/>I welcome the additional funding for the cultural sector, including the Arts Council, the Irish Film Board, Culture Ireland, the national cultural institutions and the creative children initiative, Waterways Ireland and many other agencies associated with our built and natural heritage.  However, as I have said time and again the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht does not get enough money.  The Minister and her officials can only do so much with the money they are given.  In Irish society, we are achieving enormously in the arts.  We should be investing more in this area by way of a capital funding programme for the arts, similar to the sports capital programme.  We are not only achieving at national level but at international level in terms of our writers, singers and actors.  We need to do more for them.<br/><br/>As stated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, climate change is the global challenge of our generation.  It was fantastic to hear a Minister for Finance acknowledging this because as a society, and individually, we are answerable to our children and grandchildren for our actions or, more important, inactions in terms of reducing our carbon footprint.  There is an onus on us to ensure a reduction in energy use in all public-owned buildings.  I welcome the allocation to facilitate energy efficiency programmes because a reduction in energy use in public buildings, commercial buildings and the residential sector will make a huge difference.  I also welcome the allocation of &euro;17 million for the renewable heat incentive.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant, the VRT relief and new 0% rate of benefit-in-kind will incentivise the uptake of electric vehicles.  However, if we are serious about moving to electric vehicles then we must address the issue of distances and the lack of charging points.  If I had an electric car, the only place I could charge it is on the far side of Merrion Square.  That is the only charging point around here.  This issue needs to be addressed in the context of new housing and commercial developments.  We need more charging points in public places.  People will not make the move to electric cars if there are not sufficient charging points.<br/><br/>I welcome the changes in the social welfare area, including the &euro;5 per week increase in all weekly social welfare payments, the telephone support allowance, about which I know many of us have received representations, the increase in family income supplement, FIS, and the &euro;2 per week increase in the qualified child payment.  There are also other changes in terms of prescription charges and so on which I believe will be of real benefit to families and individuals.<br/><br/>Taxation is a matter that exercises us all, particularly the workers who kept the show on the road when the country was in austerity and striving to manage.  They went to work every day and paid USC, the pension levy and their taxes.  It was wrong that people moved to the high rate of tax on reaching &euro;33,800.  I welcome that the threshold in this regard has been increased to &euro;34,500.  In terms of attracting home our emigrants who left in times of austerity this is a really good move in the right direction.  It will ensure that take home pay is attractive to them.  The reduction in the USC rates from 2.5% to 2% and 5% to 4.75% is also welcome and will be vital in that regard.<br/><br/>I referred to SMEs earlier.  We need to focus on them more and to acknowledge what they are doing in their communities, regardless of whether they employ one, two, five or ten people.  It is incumbent on us as public representatives to recognise the fantastic work they do in providing services in our communities and employing people.  There is often a great deal of focus on foreign direct investment and what US companies are considering locating in our towns and so on.  We need to focus on the businesses already operating in our towns.  For example, Grant Engineering in Birr and Glenisk Limited, which produces dairy products such as yoghurt, are fabulous local companies in my area which employ local people and will not up and leave when tax breaks run out.  These businesses are invested in our communities and we need to focus more on them.  The increase in earned income credit of &euro;200 which brings the overall threshold to &euro;1,150 is very welcome.  It sends out the strong message to vital people in our communities that we appreciate them. <br/><br/>I welcome the rural social scheme and the increase in placements on the scheme to 250.  The scheme is providing a fantastic service on a number of levels, socially and economically, for people in our communities.  It is important people are able to learn new skills and to meet and connect with new people.  All of this contributes to the mental and physical health and wellbeing of our people, which is the objective of the Healthy Ireland framework.<br/><br/>The increase in the number of SNAs to 11,000 is very welcome.  It is important that all children are taught in mainstream schools.  To do this successfully, we need suitably qualified people to help them.  We cannot expect principals and teachers to handle all of that.<br/><br/>The 50 cent increase on a pack of cigarettes is welcome.  I believe taxation can be used as an instrument for behavioural change.  An important element of the national cancer strategy and our tobacco strategy is a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025.  People should avail of the opportunity to give up smoking as it is now a very expensive habit.  I plead with people not to take up smoking and I encourage those who do smoke but want to quit to avail of the many fantastic services available to them free of charge, including the HSE service <i>quit.ie.</i><br/><br/>I welcome the budget, although there are many other areas I would like to have seen addressed in it.  That said, it is a prudent budget and I support it.  I thank the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the staff involved in preparing it.  I also acknowledge the role of Fianna F&aacute;il in the budget in terms of its advocation for certain elements and themes therein.</p></speech>

There are also some negatives, however, and some missed opportunities.  I will deal with this in a constructive rather than in a negative way so as to highlight the remaining issues and concerns that all of us meet on a daily basis in our constituencies and clinics.  I also want to acknowledge Fianna F&aacute;il's positive role and input in ensuring that fairness be applied in this budget and that it helps everyone across society, particularly those who are more vulnerable and more in need.  This role came about through the confidence and supply agreement and proved very important in both the 2017 and 2018 budgets.  I further acknowledge the work of my colleagues, Deputies Michael McGrath and Dara Calleary, in this regard.   When the electorate threw up the result that it did last year, matters were left very uncertain for some time.  Fianna F&aacute;il, however, did the responsible thing at the time in supporting and facilitating Fine Gael's minority-led Government rather than putting the reputation of the country at risk.  We were at a very vulnerable point at that stage and had just come through a very difficult period, so people both in Ireland and looking in from abroad needed to see maturity and common sense prevail.  It is very important that Fianna F&aacute;il's role in facilitating this minority-led Government be acknowledged positively.  We have been able to play a positive role and make a positive contribution both to this and to the last budget in the areas of concern to the people who gave us our mandate.   </p> <p> One area on which we must focus is the cost of living.  I will focus on two areas in this regard: motor insurance and variable mortgage interest rates.  There has been a missed opportunity here.  We need to be stronger in these areas so as to drive down the cost of living.  In driving down this cost we can help people and families, give them more money to spend, reduce the pressure and give them spending ability in their local communities which in turn helps the local, regional and national economy.  This is very important.  Motor insurance is, as we know, a huge issue and premiums have increased by 30%, 40% and 50%.  The recent figures from the CSO show a slight decrease but this has not been felt by many and certainly not at the scale that is needed.  It is important that we implement the recommendations from the joint Oireachtas committee so that premiums can remain static in the first instance and then be driven down.  CSO figures also show that insurance claims have collectively fallen in the last 18 months to two years, meaning that there is no real reason why premiums should be increasing at the rate that they are.  This is particularly true where individuals and families have had no change in their circumstances, be it with regard to a motor, home or business policy.  There is no justification for this.  It is wrong.  I spoke about it at the Committee of Public Accounts and I called for it to be investigated.  That investigation is ongoing.  It is fundamentally wrong to put people under pressure unnecessarily.  </p> <p> On the issue of the variable mortgage interest rates, I worked with my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, to bring forward a very good Bill which is now on Committee Stage.  The Bill looks to strengthen and give powers to the Central Bank to enforce and ensure that the commercial banks fall in line with the rest of Europe on this matter.  We are currently at interest rates which are 1.5% to 1.8% higher than the rest of Europe, which is completely unacceptable.  These rates result in a &euro;200,000 mortgage netting &euro;250 a month, money that could be back in people's pockets so as to give them a greater spend.  Bringing the areas of motor insurance and variable mortgage interest rates in line with where they should be would give the average family an extra &euro;300 a month, thus relieving a lot of pressure.  We need to focus on ensuring that we can actually deliver in these areas as this would bring immediate relief to the constant pressures stretching families at the moment.  </p> <p> Some &euro;4.3 billion has been announced for the capital investment plan for infrastructure.  Is this an announcement of a figure that has already been allocated and identified for projects?  I hear the same projects being mentioned again and that concerns me.  These are very worthy and necessary projects, such as the Sallins bypass in my own constituency, and many other examples.  I acknowledge that this is positive.  However, as this announcement has been made a number of times in 2017, I wonder whether this new funding will be going into projects already announced, or whether additional funding will be put into new projects.  This is of major importance if we are to develop and help all of our constituencies, and the country as a whole,  into the future.  </p> <p> We need to bring major capital investments in road infrastructure.  The N3, N4 and N5, for example, major roads connecting the north west with Dublin, need investment.  This will translate in turn into foreign direct investment, FDI, relocating into these areas thus moving companies out of Dublin, giving them other opportunities to bring employment into these areas and, importantly, helping those economies.  In delivering the road network we create employment and a feel-good factor.  It is also a matter of carrying out much-needed upgrade work.  We need to build on the excellent work done in the past on investing in our infrastructure.  This infrastructure has been left static for years now.  With borrowing currently at such a low level and interest rates at virtually 0%, we need to capitalise on the situation and invest in our road network so as to open up all of these areas to employment, industry, and tourism, which is also hugely important to the national economy.  We need to look at the situation critically and start serious investment in these areas.</p> <p> Public transport is also an issue.  Dublin is virtually a car-free zone because of the level of regulations and guidelines introduced to assist with public transport.  Public transport is being developed and used a lot more in my own constituency of Kildare North, provided the infrastructure is put in place.  The Dublin Bus route coming into from Dublin to Celbridge, Lexlip and Maynooth needs more capacity.  It is currently at full capacity, so much so that in the morning buses often have to pass by bus-stops without picking up passengers.  This area needs investment.  The Bus &Eacute;ireann routes 115 and 120 out to Kilcock and Clane are also at capacity and need further infrastructure and investment.  The trains on the Kilcock and on the Hazelhatch-Sallins lines are also at full capacity and need further investment to ensure that members of the public who want to use public transport can be facilitated in doing so, and do not have to turn up for services unable to cater for them. If we are serious about promoting public transport  then we must continue with aggressive investment to ensure that people are taken out of their cars and that there are services there for them to avail of.  The services are there but they need to be extended and expanded so as to offer greater capacity.  </p> <p> With regard to localised infrastructure, we are currently depending on the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which comes under the Minister of State's own remit.  This is an excellent scheme and will open things up for all of the right reasons.  I have been getting feedback from local authorities, however, that the process from sign-off to actual delivery is extremely slow.  There are different reasons for this, from paperwork to the various phases that have to be worked through.  For these reasons, LIHAF might not deliver in the way it was expected to.  I am more than happy to engage with both the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Murphy, on this matter, which I also raised with them last week.</p></speech>

It has a population of 22,000 and has needed a second bridge for the last 20 years.  I welcome the support I have received on this matter from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his officials.  The first phase of this process has commenced and this will eventually lead to a project going to tender to deliver a second bridge for Celbridge.  This is hugely important for the development of the town.  We need the funding to allow this to happen faster, however.  Clane, Maynooth and Naas all need ring roads, which would open up proper infrastructure and allow for future developments in a holistic way.  Again, however, the investment required here needs to be accelerated.  It looks like we are now depending on LIHAF to make the infrastructural improvements in those areas and many others around the country.  We need to move faster on this.  We need to look at what are the issues and how they can be overcome with a view to having projects delivered.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Dooley mentioned earlier, broadband is another serious issue that is not being addressed.</p><p>Broadband is now as important as electricity or a phone in one's home because people want to work from or are studying at home.  When children are at school and in college broadband is a necessity.  It is no longer a luxury.  We, therefore, need to accelerate the national broadband plan.  The information I have received in tabling parliamentary questions on areas in which the service needs to be upgraded is that the national broadband plan has still not been put out to tender.  That is a massive issue.  There are areas which are crying out for a service and which are being held back without it.  That is also very important.</p> <p> There are missed opportunities in the areas of health and social welfare.  While I welcome the increased investment in the National Treatment Purchase Fund, it is still not having an impact on waiting lists for the likes of adults who need spinal surgery, the waiting list for which stands at 38 months for a routine operation, and children who need orthopaedic treatment, the waiting list for which stands at two years for operations determined to be urgent.  The mental health service which was alluded to presents a major problem.  It needs to be resourced and funded properly.  </p> <p> I welcome the increase of &euro;5 in pensions and all other social welfare payments.  When the Social Welfare Bill is brought before the House, I will speak in detail to the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, about the T&uacute;s scheme and the bereavement grant.  I called for the telephone allowance to be reinstated and I am delighted that measures have been taken in that regard.  The allowance is very important to people who are living on their own and in isolation.  They need the allowance not only to contact the outside world but also to be able to use panic alarms and panic buttons to ensure their security.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Frank O'Rourke, has referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the increases in social welfare payments and the additional funding for other specific areas.  I was glad when Deputy Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy referred to Glenisk.  I had some involvement with the company a number of years ago when I was in a position to allocate an additional milk quota before it was decided to abolish quotas in 2008.  I was glad to engage in discussions subsequently with its partners in the United States.  It is a very strong major international corporation.  Its pioneering role and that of so many other small companies in counties Offaly, Cavan and Meath, among others, is of huge importance to local economies.  Before I had become familiar with Glenisk, I remember former Deputy Brian Cowen speaking to me in glowing terms about its potential.  His comments swayed me to ensure some of the much sought after milk quota would be allocated to the company.</p>  <p>  I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, is in the Chamber.  He may recall that, on a number of occasions at Question Time, I have raised with him and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government the issue of income eligibility limits for social housing.  I have highlighted the issue for him and the Ministers, Deputies Simon Coveney and Eoghan Murphy.  The limits applicable in Cavan-Monaghan are no longer tenable.  The Minister of State may recall that I highlighted the case of a young man who was an apprentice.  His partner who had, unfortunately, lost her job was in receipt of a jobseeker's payment.  They had a child and were above the income limit to qualify for social housing.  I also highlighted the case of a young single mother who was rearing three children, two of whom were in primary school and one in second level education.  She was working in a low paid job and in receipt of family income supplement, yet she was above the income limit to qualify for social housing.  The fact that she was in receipt of family income supplement demonstrates that her income was not sustainable.  </p>  <p>  The Minister of State's Department cannot continue to insist on a payment such as family income supplement being factored in in the assessment of income when someone is applying for local authority housing.  The people concerned have no hope of securing a mortgage from a mortgage provider, yet they do not qualify for social housing.  They are in no man's land.  On the day I raised this case the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, gave me a commitment that a review would be set in motion.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, then indicated to me - as I do not want to misrepresent him, I will paraphrase what he said - that a review had not taken place, or if it had, nothing had been done.  I appeal to the Minister of State that it is essential that income eligibility limits to qualify for social housing be revised.  I only know about the position my constituency, but they are much too low and need to be revised.  If they are not revised, we will deny a whole generation the opportunity to be tenants in a local authority house when they have no chance whatsoever of getting a mortgage.</p>  <p>  Deputy Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy also referred to Brexit.  I have the privilege to represent two Southern Ulster counties.  Here in the Oireachtas and also in our political work at home we are consumed by the issue of Brexit.  I have highlighted the fact that the economies of counties north and south of the Border, including Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh, Tyrone and probably Armagh, are heavily dependent on three sectors - agrifood, construction products and engineering.  They are the three sectors which are most heavily dependent on Northern Ireland and Britain for their export markets and they have already been hit because of the weakness of sterling.  I appealed to the T&aacute;naiste to ensure there would be sector-specific responses to prepare companies to meet the further adverse impacts of Brexit when we reached 2019.  She said she would give the matter every possible consideration.  </p>  <p>  I have been appealing to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to prioritise meeting the infrastructure needs of the Border region.  I mention this to the Minister of State because, by their nature, the products being exported from the area in the three sectors mentioned have to be transported by heavy goods vehicles.  As a neightbour, the Minister of State will know that the road infrastructure in Cavan, Monaghan and some adjoining counties is not up to the standard we all wish to see.  The Government has the competence to decide where resources should be allocated for infrastructural development.  I speak to companies which export to Northern Ireland and Britain.  Thankfully, many of them are large, but they started off as small indigenous enterprises.  Some of them are now multinational corporations.  They speak to me about the additional costs incurred because of the poor road infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  We know that, for historical reasons, there was no investment in the Border region.  One of the key ingredients in ensuring there was no investment was the Troubles which were inflicted on the province of Ulster and adjoining areas for many decades.  Thankfully, particularly since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, many local companies have become all-Ireland companies.  They may have started in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh and Tyrone, but, thankfully, they have become cross-Border enterprises.  I think of food companies such as Lakeland Dairies and Lacpatrick.  Lakeland Dairies has three processing sites in the South and two in the North.  LacPatrick, formerly Town of Monaghan Co-op which had its headquarters in Monaghan town, has two processing plants north of the Border and one in County Monaghan.  These companies have raw material and finished product travelling north and south and to ports and airports.  They need local infrastructure to be upgraded if they are to have any chance of remaining competitive.  We know that there is a big competitive world out there and of the particular pressures caused by the weakness in sterling.  These sectors are very heavily dependant on the British market.  </p>  <p>  I am glad that the Minister for Justice and Equality will be in a position to increase recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Again, Brexit which is looming brings the concept of the Border back to us when we had thought it had gone from our psychology forever.  The Cavan-Monaghan Garda division covers a very long land border with the neighbouring jurisdiction.  There are very demanding policing requirements to be met in the Border area.  I have appealed to the Minister for Justice and Equality to ensure, when the Garda Commissioner is allocating the additional Garda personnel throughout the country, the particular policing needs in the Cavan-Monaghan division will be given particular attention.  Unfortunately, since 2010 the number of garda&iacute; in Monaghan has been reduced by 28%.  The number of garda&iacute; in County Cavan has been reduced by 20%.  We will need to increase these numbers again because of the extra demands which will arise from Brexit.  Unfortunately, there has been a spate of crime in rural areas in both counties.  I have appealed to the Minister to ensure, when the additional Garda personnel become available, the particular policing needs in the Border region will be given the utmost priority.  We know that when criminals engage in misbehaviour in the Border region, they can get away very quickly into the neighbouring jurisdiction.</p><p>Unfortunately, the neighbouring areas north of the Border have historically been very lightly policed so I appeal for additional Garda numbers for the Cavan-Monaghan division.</p> <p> In the area of health, there is a problem in the Cavan-Monaghan area in respect of the provision of services to children with disabilities.  Not only are children not getting services, they are not even getting assessments prior to treatment.  I have appealed to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to ensure the particular needs of children with disabilities are prioritised within their allocation of resources for the HSE.  It is not acceptable that children have to wait exceptionally long times just for an assessment in respect of occupational therapy.</p></speech>

Everybody will agree that the way the banks have treated those on tracker mortgages is abominable, to say the least.  Despite the Taoiseach's sudden interest in this issue, it did not just happen today or yesterday but has happened for many, many years.  The last-minute attempts by the Government to threaten banks to fix it or face a levy will allow the banks and the Central Bank to get away with it without anybody being held accountable.  This scandal has happened on a continuous basis over many years.  Even after it was exposed and the banks were told to recompense customers, they slithered and slid away from what they were supposed to do legally, financially and morally.</p>  <p>  Since 2015 the Central Bank has conducted an industry-wide examination of tracker mortgage-related issues, including where banks wrongly denied customers their contractual right to return to a tracker rate of interest following a period on a fixed rate.  In February this year, eight months ago, the Central Bank confirmed that the total number of affected customers covered by this probe stood at a minimum of 13,000.  Some of them told their tale before the committee last week.  I do not know if the Minister has had a chance to hear it but it would stop him in his tracks to listen to the impact this has had on people's health, on that of their families, on their household incomes and on their ability to live their lives.</p>  <p>  Banks have caused enough stress in this country.  They brought the country to its knees and, given that experience, they should have woken up to their corporate responsibilities, their social responsibilities and their moral responsibilities.  Alas it seems, from the manner in which they are handling this issue, they have not.  One customer was being overcharged on their mortgage for over four years.  In May 2016 they were put on the correct rate by the bank but, 17 months on, the customer is still to be repaid the &euro;20,000 that was overcharged and the bank has yet to make an offer of redress or compensation.</p>  <p>  Given the severity of this and the impact it has had on families and homes, why is the Central Bank being so soft and so relaxed on banks, particularly the State-owned banks?  Why have the banks not been given an absolute deadline by which overcharged customers are to be repaid and compensated?  Can the Minister confirm whether the Government has any legislative plans for increased levies on banks as a result of this issue?  I am sure every party in this House will support an increased levy.  If there are any such plans, when will the legislation be introduced?</p></speech>

We have no truck with behaviour that brings people to the state of frustration and dismay we have seen.  The Taoiseach was very clear yesterday that any powers the Central Bank needs will be provided and that the Government will not be afraid to take other measures, including enhancing the bank levy which is set to raise &euro;750 million between now and 2021.  The Minister for Finance will call in the banks and will address the issues the Deputy has raised.  The Government takes this extremely seriously.</p>  <p>  Everybody hates someone who stands up in the D&aacute;il and says "I told you so" but when I was my party's spokesman on finance in 2004, when the Fianna F&aacute;il Government introduced the Central Bank Bill I said very clearly that it was a defective Bill.  It lacked the teeth for prudential regulation and consumer protection but that was the legislation that prevailed for much of the time this happened.  There are limitations in some of the current legislative machinery but the Government will not tolerate banks failing in their obligations to their customers and to those people who have been particularly affected by the tracker mortgage issue.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right to say that, given the appalling trauma in our economy and our society caused by bad bank lending and poor regulation, there is now an absolute obligation on banks to fulfil their responsibilities to their clients.  The Central Bank and the Government should and will take this very seriously.</p></speech>

The Minister has been in Cabinet since 2011 so if the legislation was defective and weak he has had six and a half years to fix it, but he has not.  There seems to be no plan to do it, although there is a vague promise on the matter.  Today's <i>Irish Independent</i>features one customer, Garreth Murphy.  The decision on his tracker mortgage is costing him an extra &euro;500 per month, an extraordinary amount of money, but no remedy is being put on the table for him.  His is one of nearly 20,000 similar accounts.  At last week's committee meeting, one gentleman spoke of how he suffered a stroke and his wife suffered a nervous breakdown directly as a result of the stress caused to them.  We cannot stand by and make false promises on this issue.</p><p>Can the Minister outline the legislative framework?  The Taoiseach told us yesterday that the Minister for Finance would meet the banks next week to admonish them over their behaviour.  What did he mean by &quot;admonish&quot;?  The people affected do not need tea and sympathy but action, compensation and, most important, justice.</p></speech>

It has made clear that it is engaging with other statutory bodies, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so there is no flinching from pursuing this.  Some of the failures occurred before the legislation giving new powers to the Central Bank came in and some of the defects were in the old legislation to which I referred.</p>  <p>  The Government will take any steps necessary, legally or by giving the Central Bank additional powers, but one cannot provide powers retrospectively as regards some of these events.  The Minister for Finance will be very clear as to the expectations of Government as regards bank behaviour.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in supported an amendment tabled by Deputy Fitzmaurice in an attempt to amend the Government's proposal, but Fianna F&aacute;il abstained when it was put to a vote and this measure therefore came into effect.  I know the Minister has read Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget, which proposed to increase the rate of stamp duty on commercial property to 4%.  As the banking inquiry pointed out, commercial real estate was one of the major causes of the banking crash.  For that reason, it needs to be monitored and taxed appropriately and that is what we had in mind in our pre-budget submission.  It was never our intention to make life even more difficult for Irish farmers.</p></speech>

This would negate the original purpose of the Government's measure, which was to incentivise the early lifetime transfer of land to the next generation and to encourage young farmers to extend their holdings.  All this is being done now to cover up for the clear mistake the Government made in the budget.  The core issue is that at a time when farm incomes are half the average industrial wage and many farm enterprises are not viable without being expanded, the Government is proposing to triple the level of stamp duty imposed on farmers who are trying to make their holdings viable.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Creed, told us in his post-budget press conference that this increase would not apply to farmland.  He said he wanted to "nail this one" and was adamant that "the increase in stamp duty [would] not apply to agricultural land".  Did the Minister or his advisers not know what the Minister for Finance was proposing, or did they get it wrong?  Fine Gael portrays itself as the farmers' party and has always had that tradition.  However, the disregard for rural Ireland in the current Cabinet is so severe that this measure was introduced without any consideration of its consequences for the farming community and without any consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  At a time of low incomes and Brexit pressures, when reduced Common Agricultural Policy payments are coming down the road, is the Government happy to stand over a threefold increase in the level of stamp duty imposed on a farmer who wishes to extend his or her holding to make it viable?</p></speech>

The Deputy has shown some understanding of this.  We have a strong commercial sector, but our housing sector is not meeting the needs of the people.  Our intention in introducing this measure is to secure a switch in activity to the housing area, where it is badly needed.  The Minister has provided for a relief that will apply to any sale of farmland that is then used for residential purposes.  He has also provided for capital gains tax measures and for a new fund that will support developers to develop land for housing.  This is part of a group of measures, the aim of which is to deliver one of the most important needs of our people.  The position in relation to stamp duty on commercial property, which includes certain categories of farmland, is that there will be an increase to the new 6% rate.  It is not going back to the 9% rate that prevailed in the past.  There are very significant exemptions, as the Deputy knows.  There are exemptions for young farmers, for transfers within families when holdings are being consolidated and for sales that result in the land being used for housing purposes within a specified 30-month period.  These significant concessions will ensure genuine farmers who are trying to transfer to the new generation and young farmers who are entering farming are protected.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy has rightly said, the finance Bill will include additional provisions to deal with some anomalies in the system, such as the provision that means people over a certain age face a higher level of stamp duty.  A period of time will be given to allow such transfers to occur.  The Deputy has also rightly mentioned that in the longer term we want to see earlier transfers.  This measure will be reviewed after a certain period to ensure our intention, which is to encourage earlier transfer, is remaining an important part of our approach to farmland.  I cannot speak for Sinn F&eacute;in's intentions in submitting its proposals.  I did not see any such exemption outlined in its document.  I am not accountable for Sinn F&eacute;in's intentions.  Sinn F&eacute;in rightly pointed out in its pre-budget submission that this is a justifiable measure.  It is now being introduced.  I think reasonable reliefs are being put in place to ensure it does not have unintended consequences for the sorts of farming transfers we want to see happen.</p></speech>

We all know farmers around the country with small pieces of land who are working very hard and struggling to survive and raise their families.  The only way forward for them is to expand when land comes up for sale beside their farms.  Many of them cannot get the money from the bank to extend their holdings in such circumstances.  The issue here is the decision to increase the level of stamp duty imposed on such transactions from 2% to 6%.  I acknowledge that this change will not apply to young farmers under the age of 35 who have green certs.  Many farmers are not in that category, particularly in the dairy industry where farmers are expanding significantly.  They will not get any exemption because they are over the age of 35.  It is clear that this measure was not thought through.  When it was introducing it, the Government did not realise that farmers were going to be caught.  Now that it has realised that, and the backlash is under way, it is attempting to do something about it.  Clearly, its attempts are not enough because they are not dealing specifically with struggling farmers who want to expand their holdings.  That is the problem we need to sort out.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to do something in the upcoming finance Bill to ensure the 6% provision does not extend to farmers in this position.</p></speech>

If the owner of a small business involved in some other activity wished to expand his or her business, it would be quite unjust if he or she were subject to a different tax regime from a farmer with a small holding who wished to expand.</p></speech>

It was an imitation of a pledge made by his good friend, Justin Trudeau.  It created great hope and expectation across the arts community.  Unlike his Canadian friend, the Taoiseach did not follow through on what he had said with a serious commitment in the budget.  The chair of the Arts Council has described next year's allocation to the arts as a "huge disappointment".  If the rate of increase set out in the budget is continued with, it will take another 21 years to achieve the Taoiseach's commitment to the arts.  There is great uncertainty among the arts community at the moment.  The National Campaign for the Arts has expressed concern about the focus in the Creative Ireland programme on publicity and marketing rather than long-term and sustainable policy change and investment.</p>  <p>  Last year, the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs published a draft national cultural framework policy, known as Culture 2025.  It horrified campaigners in the arts.  After much pressure in this House - I raised the matter on Leaders' Questions - the then Taoiseach agreed to refer the framework policy to an Oireachtas committee before it was finalised.  When the committee published its report in July of this year, it included 42 recommendations aimed at bringing about a shift in the Government's approach to arts and culture.  As the all-party committee noted, "A policy without a clear definition of its objective is blind, a policy without legislation is discretionary and a policy without the necessary resources .... is paralysed."  It is unclear whether the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, intends to pay any attention to the committee's report or to plough ahead with the initial framework she published last year.</p><p>We have no clear definition of objectives and no underpinning legislation and I see none is planned in the legislative programme.  We have no commitment to provide the required funding for its implementation.  Does the Minister accept that the paltry increase in funding for the Arts Council was already committed to and that, therefore, in real terms, it is not additional money?  Will he give a renewed commitment to double the funding for the sector over a five-year period?  Will he give us a sense of when we can expect to receive a final version of Culture 2025 and indicate whether the recommendations of the committee in that regard will be heeded?</p></speech>

It is an area in which the Government is very ambitious and, of course, it will take time to realise those ambitions.  The publication of the Creative Ireland programme was a milestone.  One of the lessons drawn from the very successful 1916 Rising celebrations was that we could celebrate and use our cultural heritage as a significant asset for the people.  In that regard, I am very pleased that we are starting in the education area.  With the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, we will start the Creative Children initiative this year, for which we have set aside money in the budget.  The Minister has also set out an ambitious capital programme for the arts and culture this year which will be enhanced in the ten-year capital programme soon to be announced.</p></speech>

On a year to year basis, as the Deputy knows, this has been a very difficult financial year.  We did not have significant sums of money available to us.  Nonetheless, the allocation to the Arts Council was increased by &euro;9 million, while funding for the Irish Film Board was increased by 9%.  Significant initiatives are being taken across the arts.  The ambition of the Taoiseach is that we should develop along the line of strategies, in particular the Creative Ireland concept, whereby we view the arts as an important asset for the people and a major part of the way in which young people are educated.  There is a commitment to the arts which has been matched on the capital side and, in so far as is possible, the current side.  It will be backed up by the ten-year capital programme for which I know the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has very ambitious plans.</p></speech>

There is no getting around the fact that the commitment to double funding over a set period raised expectations among the arts community which were dashed when no additional real money was allocated to the Arts Council.  If the Government is serious about this, it should not make commitments and then state there are particular constraints in a given year.  It should set out in clear terms the timescale over which arts funding is to be doubled.  When will the 2020 vision for the arts be debated in the House?  Will the recommendations of the all-party committee be reflected in the revised document?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the Creative Ireland programme, the context for development in this area over a number of years, sets out very significant ambitions which will be reflected in the capital programme.  They include the ambition to support new art centres, theatres, galleries, museums and heritage centres, the sort of thing which can make a difference in the use and enjoyment of our cultural heritage.  That is very much part of the Government's plan.  To be fair, since 2014 the budget for the Arts Council has increased by 20%.  I have no doubt that it uses the money extremely well to leverage activities, festivals, bursaries and so on across the artistic community.  As to when we will make money available, the Taoiseach's ambition for the arts and culture sector will be a major feature of decisions made in future budgets.</p></speech>

Coincidentally, the meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport was cancelled this week.  We were due to hear from representatives of the Irish Air Line Pilots' Association, IALPA, but for the second time the meeting was cancelled.  There are different arguments as to the reasons for the cancellations.  There was some very important evidence to be given by Ryanair pilots to the committee.  I know that the media are worried about covering this issue because a lot of advertising revenue is generated by Ryanair, but it is a very serious issue in terms of the level of public interest.  We are compromised on the question of aviation safety in this country because of the relationship between the IAA and the airlines it is supposed to regulate.</p>  <p>  Given that 700,000 passengers recently faced disruption due to the cancellation of Ryanair flights, the light thrown on the airline's activities in respect of health and safety and the irregular working hours and conditions of pilots, does the Minister think it is important that pilots address the joint committee?  Should the outcome of whatever discussions the Commissioner has with the IAA today be made public in the House?  </p>  <p>  I have very serious and genuine concerns about the protection of the public interest.  I am not trying to stir things up, but we need to listen carefully to what the pilots have to say and what they are saying about the regulatory authorities.  The chief concern is that the IAA, unlike all other authorities regulating aviation across Europe, was set up on a commercial for-profit basis.  It collect charges and other revenue from the very airlines it regulates.  It collects most of its revenue from Ryanair.  To give an idea of the amount of money involved, last year the IAA made a profit of almost &euro;40 million.  Its CEO, Mr. Eamonn Brennan, receives a salary of &euro;344,000 a year.  The IAA regulates the safety of the airlines from which it is making money.  There is a toxic relationship between the regulatory authority which looks after air safety and the means by which it collects its revenue.  As I said, such an arrangement is illegal in many European countries and there are significant implications for the working conditions of the pilots concerned, an issue I will discuss.  Is the Minister aware of this relationship?  Does he think it compromises the safety of civil aviation in this country?  Does he think it is acceptable that the IAA has been established on a profit-making basis which allows it to have what could, at best, be described as a dysfunctional relationship with the airlines it regulates?</p></speech>

I have no control over the agenda set by the committee.</p>  <p>  No doubt there are many issues of concern, not least about what will happen following Brexit and the impact it might have, as well as the safety of passengers.  It is my understanding Ryanair flights were disrupted because the safety of passengers was the priority, rather than the commercial interests of the company which were not served by the decisions taken.  The company had to put up its hand and admit to its failings.  That is an example of regulation working.</p>  <p>  On the question of whether regulators in general should be funded by levies imposed on the industries they regulate, it is common practice in the case of most regulatory bodies.  The reason for it is that while regulation is important, the general taxpayer should not pay when the industry should pay by way of registration fees for the oversight of services a regulator provides.  It is important to the reputation of the industr, which is very clearly set out in the legislation. </p>  <p>  The source of the payments in no way compromises the authority's primary commitment to safety.  It is accountable to this House and others for how it executes its mandate.  It can be called to account at any stage.  The use of levies, whether in banking or other regulated sectors, to meet the cost of regulation is a common practice across all jurisdictions.</p><p>We have used the model in most of our regulator activities.  It has never been shown to compromise in any way the exercise of the statutory obligations of these authorities.</p></speech>

It is possible to separate the authorities that collect revenue from airlines through the taxation system, for example, and the authority that regulates how the airlines operate.  This goes to a bigger issue.  The Minister states the safety of passengers was at the heart of the cancellations but that is not the case.  Pilots are exiting Ryanair in their hundreds because there is a global shortage and the structures used by Ryanair to establish the employment of pilots is illegal elsewhere in Europe.  It is highly irregular and is being investigated by two revenue groups in Britain and Germany.  The governments in Britain and Germany are investigating pilots who live there for potential tax fraud.  Imagine the stress this would put on pilots.  There is a complex reason for this as the pilots are forced to be self-employed and their work is traded between various companies.  Those companies and the pilots are being investigated.  The pilots are also being pressurised to cut down on the use of fuel.  It was denied that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport discussed that with the Irish Aviation Authority.  This is a can of worms and a dirty game.  Somebody is keeping quiet about many injustices and there is much money being made.  What the Minister says is not true.  This is highly irregular.</p></speech>

Power restoration means the numbers without public water are down to 25,000.  The number affected by electricity outages is down to 75,000.  As Mr. Sean Hogan stated on the radio this morning, the process is now becoming more difficult and time-consuming as we are getting to individual items.  The Defence Forces have been out to assist and we have called in resources from many overseas jurisdictions to assist in restoring services as rapidly as possibly.  I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, before coming here and there is an acute understanding of the threat in Cork from potential flooding.  There is very close monitoring with the local authorities of those events.  The emergency committee is still actively engaged in ensuring we maximise our protection and be prepared for all eventualities.  That work is continuing and there is a new focus on the particular incidence of potential storm Brian, which is approaching us.

One of the pertinent matters for most people living in rural Ireland, even in the context of the recent storm, is the ambulance service.  This service in many parts of rural Ireland cannot possibly even dream of reaching the target of 19 minutes to get to any incident.  Lightfoot Solutions did a report in 2014 and the recommendations were never implemented.  One of the key recommendations was to train more paramedics, provide more vehicles and revamp the management structure.  When will this be done?  When can people living in rural Ireland expect that when they call an ambulance, it will be there if not within 19 minutes then even within 40 minutes?  That would be a magnificent for many people living in rural Ireland.  Will the Minister ensure this happens?</p></speech>

Arising from that commitment, we now have four consortia of institutes of technology seeking university status.  The legislation to allow for that reached Committee Stage in January 2016.  I know some time was spent ironing out an agreement with trade unions on this matter, which I welcome, but we have still not had publication of the Committee Stage amendments.

When the Social Welfare Bill was passed last year, Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith had sought an amendment seeking a report on the inequalities faced by pensioners, which we have discussed this week.  That affects 35,000 pensioners who are being robbed of a full pension entitlement.  At the time, the current Taoiseach and then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, included an amendment indicating a report on those anomalies would be done within six months.  Deputy Smith had sought three months as the timeframe.  We are well past the period as stipulated in last year's Bill but we still have procrastination from the Government.  There are many excuses about how complicated it is but where is the report?  When will we get it?  This has gone on and on while tens of thousands of pensioners are being robbed of their full pension entitlement because of a failure by the Government to honour the promise.</p></speech>

We all want the information sought by the Deputy in his question.  My Department started last week to compile the relevant information with regard to the women, in the main, and men - they are 40% of the cohort - who are particularly disadvantaged as a result of changes in bands because of their average length in working life.  It will take us a couple of weeks to do this as the records before 1994 are all paper-based.  We need to go through each one of them individually.  I guarantee the Deputy, as I did in my speech last night, that as soon as the process is finished in a matter of weeks, I will bring this back to the D&aacute;il.

What is going on in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Road Safety Authority, RSA?  Yesterday the stakeholders, including all the farming bodies and agricultural contractors of Ireland, were told out of the blue that the RSA is implementing a new policy whereby any tractor at 40k or above that cannot travel more than 25 km/h.  This is effectively blindfolding and is hugely damaging to agriculture.  Indeed, fodder is being transported to the west because of the storms.  This came out of the blue, without consultation.  I want a moratorium placed on this, because it is going to have a huge impact.  It will force older tractors with a lower speeds, which are totally unsuitable, onto the roads.  It is madness.  The RSA has to be reigned in because it is totally out of touch and is trying to destroy rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Listening to the turmoil experienced by Siobh&aacute;n Phillips and her parents, Sean and Bronagh, in their reporting to the Garda station in the 24 hours prior to the murder of Garda Tony Golden, highlights the need for a proper protocol to be introduced immediately in order to minimise the chances of a repeat of such an event, especially where the victims of families feel under threat.  It should be addressed urgently.</p></speech>

It will fall to the new Government and the Oireachtas to agree the first statutory nation low-carbon transition-mitigation plan".  The mitigation plan falls way short.  We have international targets that we have to meet by 2020, including a reduction of 20% of greenhouse gas emissions.  The Environmental Protection Agency has said in the last few weeks that the best case scenario is that we will achieve 4% to 6%.  There was an all-day Cabinet session which met to discuss this issue recently.  We have seen the events in Donegal, on the Inishowen peninsula, in August.  We have seen the events earlier this week throughout the country.  It was felt in County Laois.  We have also seen the effects of global warming.  The national mitigation plan falls short.  It is an aspirational document.  We have highlighted this repeatedly.  There are no binding sectoral targets.  We are facing increased global warming and also fines in the order of &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million per year from the European Union.  We need to start putting that money into mitigation and not into fines.  Does the Government intend to revise that plan in the light of the new developments?</p></speech>

It is ongoing, and there is an opportunity for everyone to become involved.  We recognise, as the Deputy does, that this will require a major cultural change in our attitude to some parts of our activity.  As a first measure there were significant announcements in the budget concerning building insulation, energy efficiency and the use of electrical vehicles.  The Minister is making significant changes this year, but there is no doubt that the national consultation will require us, over the coming years, to very considerably step up our effort in this area.</p></speech>

There could not be more effort being put into restoring power at the moment, but as Se&aacute;n Hogan indicated this morning, some of these breakages involving going to each pole and identifying the fault.  That can take greater time, and that is one of the constraints that people are working under.

A request went to the Minister from the ETB in May, at the initiation of my colleague, Councillor Rena Donaghey, seeking a meeting to try and establish and prioritise the purchasing of a site to progress that three school campus.  The ETB is still awaiting a response and a meeting with the Minister.

Sligo has probably lead the field in that the Sligo Institute of Technology introduced an online delivery of apprenticeships for people working in the insurance sector.  It shows what can be done in the area of apprenticeships.  It is a level 8 apprenticeship.  We are on track to achieve those targets.  There will be 1,400 additional apprenticeships this year, and that will match an increase from last year.  There have been 77 new applications for new apprenticeships.  We will role out another 13 this year.  There has been real progress in this area, which commands support right across the House.  The development of apprenticeships as an alternative for many people is far more developed in other countries than in our own.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900031#FF01000"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I am pleased, on behalf of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to introduce the National Archives (Amendment) Bill 2017.  The National Archives is one of the State&rsquo;s most important cultural institutions and plays an essential part in the cultural life of the country by collecting, managing and preserving the public records of Ireland.  The records held by the National Archives document the historical evolution of the State and the creation of our national identity.  The archives are key to informing Government policy and assisting research into the political, economic and social forces which have shaped the nation.  The purpose of the Bill is to reduce the time limit for the deposit of certain departmental records with the National Archives from 30 years to 20.  As Members may be aware, the British and Northern Irish archives have moved to a 20-year rule for the transfer of records to the British Archives and the Public Records Office of Northern Ireland.  However, in Ireland the statutory period for transfer of departmental records remains 30 years.</p><p>The Government recognises the importance of synchronising the release of certain records between Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain, particularly those records relating to Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish issues.  The proposed legislation will allow for the early release of records if the relevant Minister, that is, Deputy Heather Humphreys, as Minister with responsibility for the National Archives, agrees that the early release of the records in question is warranted by virtue of their historical or public interest value or to facilitate fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions.</p><p>The Minister is conscious of the fact that the proposals will have resource implications for Departments and changes will have to be managed within constrained budgetary allocations.  For this reason, the changes will be implemented on a phased basis, starting with those Departments which holding significant numbers of Anglo-Irish and North-South records, namely, the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality and the Office of the Attorney General.  The intention is to move over time to a full 20-year rule for all Departments, as resources permit.</p><p>  A phased implementation approach will assist in dealing with the inevitable resource implications for Departments, while providing flexibility for the early release of records, where appropriate.  To facilitate progress in dealing with this issue, the director of the National Archives is chairing an implementation group which is developing an implementation plan which will be finalised shortly.  As part of the process of implementing the 20-year rule, the director of the National Archives will write to all Departments to ascertain the number of files over 30 years old being stored by Departments, offices and the courts and the cost of so doing.</p><p>It is clear if the need for offsite storage was reduced, savings could be made across the entire system.</p> <p> As I stated, the National Archives is one of the State&rsquo;s most important cultural institutions, housing some of our most important historical State records.  The Minister is only too aware of the limited physical capacity that the National Archives has to store our archives.  However, there are exciting developments ahead for the National Archives in that regard.  The Minister was delighted that as part of the decade of centenary commemorations, the Government provided &euro;8 million in funding to commence the National Archives redevelopment plans.  As the centenary of the destruction of the Public Records Office approaches in 2022, the new National Archives building, which will house the State archives, will be an appropriate response to the loss of so much of our cultural heritage in that destructive fire in 1922.  The Office of Public Works has appointed a design team and is working with the National Archives to finalise the design plans for the Bishop Street building.</p> <p> The lack of a records management policy is also an issue when it comes to the accumulation of records in Departments.  The Minister is very pleased to have been in a position to provide the National Archives with &euro;150,000 in 2016 and &euro;300,000 in 2017 to assist in the work the office is doing on a public sector records management policy in conjunction with the office of the Government&rsquo;s chief information officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This policy aims to provide universal guidelines for the public sector in the management of records and, in particular, digital material.  Crucially, it will also scope out the requirements of the National Archives in starting to accept digital records from Departments and the task of making digital records available to the public.</p> <p> I will now turn specifically to the Bill and its main provisions.  Sections 1 and 2 deal with general provisions such as definitions of words and terms in the Bill.  </p> <p> Section 3 amends the National Archives Act 1986 by inserting a definition for "relevant records", or those records to which the National Archives (Amendment) Bill 2017 applies in order to provide for early release of a particular class or classes of departmental records.  </p> <p> Section 4 provides the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with the power by order to have records transferred to the National Archives from a Department after 20 years rather than the current 30-year transfer limit.  An order will only be made under this section once the Minister has approval of the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the relevant Minister to whose Department the order will apply.  It will also come after consultation with the director of the National Archives.</p> <p> Section 4 also provides the policy and principles under which the Minister would make such an order.  These are if the records concerned are of significant historical or public interest such as to warrant their transfer to the National Archives; the transfer of the records concerned to the National Archives will facilitate the balanced and fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions; and the arrangements for such transfer are adequate.  </p> <p> Section 4 also provides that the Minister may make an order where he or she is satisfied the arrangements for the transfer of all departmental records more than 20 years old to the National Archives are adequate.  This will remove the need for further legislation in the event that the Government decides to move to a 20-year rule for all Departments at some point in the future.  Section 4 also provides that if a Department had already transferred records between 20 and 30 years of age to the National Archives, it will not be required to do so again.</p> <p> Sections 4 and 5 also provide for the amendment of section 8 of the National Archives Act 1986 to insert the term "relevant records" where necessary.  Section 5 also provides for the deletion of section 10(6) of the National Archives Act 1986 as this section is no longer necessary.  </p> <p> Section 6 provides for the amendment of section 11 of the National Archives Act 1986 to insert the term "relevant records" where necessary.  Section 7 provides for the Short Title and commencement of the Bill.</p> <p> Given our shared history with the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, the Minister believes it is important that the synchronised release of official records should, to the greatest extent possible, be restored where appropriate.  The Minister is satisfied the Bill provides the flexibility to do so when a record set is of sufficient historical or public interest value.  I am pleased to bring the Bill before the D&aacute;il and I look forward to hearing the contributions from Deputies throughout Second Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

The National Archives is very important for the heritage and history of this country.  Our heritage officers on councils play a pivotal role in the protection and promotion of what we have to offer in this country, with our national institutions such as the National Library of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland which have so many fantastic displays.  We are delighted to see so many developments in these national institutions.</p>  <p>  Heritage officers play a major role within local authorities in the protection of our culture and heritage, as well as the archives within our local libraries and authorities.  They do this from an education perspective and programmes are run in collaboration with other sectors in local authorities, including libraries and arts offices.  The "Golden Mile" is a particular scheme being rolled out by heritage officers and I have observed it as being very successful across the country in promoting and protecting our natural and architectural heritage.  In the past we may have been less aware of this so it is very important that it is promoted within our schools and at a local and national level.  That is happening now with heritage officers doing terrific work during heritage week, which will see major promotion of those historic ventures around the country.  We are happy to the support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900032#GG00300"><p>Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the functioning of a democracy and the release of state papers is a valuable mechanism whereby we can scrutinise decisions made behind closed doors.  They offer a valuable insight into the shaping of the State's predominant political narrative.  The importance of transparency came to light a number of weeks ago when 14 years of footage of Oireachtas debates up to 2014 were removed from the Oireachtas website.  I am thankful that footage has been restored to the web after public outcry.  This demonstrates the importance of the public having access to these records.</p>  <p>  I welcome the move to reduce the period after which these documents can be released from 30 years to 20.  I have a few misgivings which I will outline, but this is a progressive act that will see the eventual alignment of the release of Irish State papers with those of Britain.  The British Government began its move towards releasing records after 20 years in 2013, and it will release records in batches covering two years each year until 2022, when the gap will be narrowed from 30 years to 20.  The Bill intends to operate broadly along the same lines but it will have to catch up on five years in order to attain parity in the release dates.  Currently, the difference between the two countries is problematic, particularly in the area of Anglo-Irish relations.  With the earlier release of British state papers, we will only get one side of the story and a distorted view of history.  In the next five years, for example, documents pertaining to the Good Friday Agreement will be released in Britain, but they will not be released here for another ten years.  Naturally, Sinn F&eacute;in is supportive of the need to speed up the release of documents from the Irish Government so as to add a full and more balanced outcome.  However, the delay in releasing our documents will be a problem.</p>  <p>  In future debates on the Bill I would like the Minister to elaborate on what is deemed to be a "relevant record".  There seems to be much additional power given to the Minister in the Bill as to determine what is of significant historical and public interest.  Could this ever be ascertained in an objective manner?  I fear political motives could obscure the truth in this regard and items of major historical importance could be simply locked away in order to save the blushes, or worse, of a former political colleague, for example.  There are other details within the Bill about which I have reservations, and these will be scrutinised in further detail on Committee Stage.  I will summarise them.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach will have the power to amend or revoke an order designating records to be "relevant records".  What are the criteria in making this decision?  As the Bill does not refer to the existing scheduled bodies, will they now be beyond the scope of the legislation?  What will happen to these records?</p><p> The transfer of records to the National Archives will be made by ministerial order following consultation with the director of the National Archives.  This reduces the power of the director to appraise records and decide whether they should be retained or disposed of.  We have concerns about this.  The Bill includes a provision to transfer by ministerial order records which are less than 30 years old but more than 20 years old which will then have to be voted on by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This provision has the potential to politicise the designation and transfer of public records.  There is no set date in the Bill for the transfer of records.  When will this occur and on what basis will it occur?  The Bill states the transfer of records will occur when arrangements for the transfer of all departmental records are in place for items that are more than 20 years old and when the National Archives are adequate.  What is meant by "adequate" and who will make these decisions?  The Bill states a decision to review the status of closed records or records that are not deemed to be relevant, subject to transfer, will be made.  Will the Minister state precisely when that might occur?  Will there be sanctions against Departments if they do not transfer records?  </p> <p> I am hugely concerned about capacity issues in the transfer of records.  They could be a hindrance to the objectives of the Bill.  Many Departments are struggling to meet the 30 year rule; therefore, without additional resources the execution of the Bill will be impossible.  The Government has implemented devastating cuts to the Arts and Heritage Bill and there was no additional provision in the recent budget for the resourcing of the National Archives, although we are yet to see the Estimates.  However, this is an indication that the National Archives are going to be denied the funding required to implement the measures outlined in the Bill.  </p> <p> Even though the Bill seeks to bring about greater transparency, the irony is that it is the concept of Government accountability at its worst.  The Minister says the vaults of the National Archives will be opened up in the interests of the people of Ireland, but, in reality, what is actually going to be unleashed is more boxes to understaffed Departments and under-resourced areas.  They cannot handle the paperwork they have to do now, yet the Minister wants to double it in the next few years.  Unless the Minister and the Minister of State are willing to provide the necessary resources, this is a pointless exercise.  It must not amount to the passing of laws which will lead to standards that cannot be maintained.  If the Minister was serious about this, she would put money into the National Archives.  I appreciate that &euro;8 million is to be put towards the development of a building which will house the archives, but this is a capital investment in necessary infrastructure and is not related to providing the increased manpower necessary to honour the aims of the Bill.  </p> <p> The problems which arise are not just to do with storage.  They are also to do with the preservation and documentation of our past.  This is done by allowing people to access the documents of the past.  The National Archives is open from 9.15 a.m. to 5 p.m.  For most people working normal hours, the documents are literally inaccessible to them.  Furthermore, few of them are digitised.  If people cannot gain access to them, it creates massive problems for local historians and the type of person who undertakes the research that actually shines a light on our past.  Access to our history allows us to lift the lid on the secretive, closed culture of the State.  We support the passing of legislation that opens the archives, but we entreat the Government to provide the necessary funding to enable people to access them.  The National Archives can only function if what is stored therein can be accessed easily.  If the files cannot be obtained easily owing to a lack of resources, it is the worst type of gesture politics.  </p> <p> Is g&aacute; d&uacute;inn agus don Rialtas taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo agus cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh acmhainn&iacute; cu&iacute; ag an gCartlann N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900033#HH00200"><p>Decisions we make today can have implications for how our history will be told into the future.  How that will manifest itself is unpredictable.  Many records are now held digitally and have been for the past 20 years or so.  As the formats in which records are held sometimes become obsolete, we are faced with many additional challenges that we have to overcome.</p>  <p>  I will reiterate some of the points made by the previous speaker about some aspects of the Bill.  In section 2 the term "relevant records" is introduced.  "Relevant records" are defined as records more than 20 years old but less than 30 years old where an order has been made.  Other than that, it does not give a clear definition of what the records are.  That is very important.  Section 2 of the 1986 Act states all of the different formats in which departmental records can be kept and that will remain.  However, there is no clear direction as to who will decide what is a relevant record, aside from it being 20 years old as opposed to 30.  The current legislation is easy to implement as it encompasses all records created, regardless of age.  They are transferred to the National Archives when they are 30 years old.  Relevant records are a subset of departmental records as defined under 1986 Act..  </p>  <p>  The Bill does not refer to the existing scheduled bodies.  Does this mean that they are outside the scope of the legislation?  What will happen to their records?  Is the Government relying on the 1986 Act in that regard?  Will that Act be superceded?</p>  <p>  The transfer of records to the National Archives will be made by ministerial order following consultation with the director of the National Archives.  This removes the power of the director to appraise records and decide whether they should be retained or disposed of.  There are many records and it is a question of a good archivist being able to decide which ones are relevant.  Directors are civil servants and should have no political allegiances or agendas.  They should make impartial appraisal decisions based on the evidence provided for them.  In making this change we are potentially politicising access to public records which would be contrary to the spirit of openness and transparency.  The Minister will now have the power to make an order for transfer if records are of significant historical or public interest to warrant their transfer.  Who will decide what records are of significant historical or public interest?  Who will advise the Minister in making that decision?  </p>  <p>  The Government currently does not get involved in the selection or appraisal of records for transfer.  That work is carried out by civil servants who carry out their obligations under the 30 year rule as set out in the 1986 Act.  There is a danger that selective appraisal will take place based on individual interests or bias.  That is quite dangerous.  The same clause states: "The transfer of the records concerned to the National Archives will facilitate the balanced and fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions".</p><p>That is a clear statement that the 20 year rule is to facilitate the release of records relating to Northern Ireland to balance out the release of information from the United Kingdom.  The Bill includes the provision that transfers of records less than 30 years old, but more than 20 years old, by ministerial order will have to be voted on by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This has the potential to politicise the designation and transfer of public records.  These are serious issues for the future.  </p> <p> There is no set date in the Bill for the transfer of records.  The 30 year rule automatically means all 30 year old records have to be transferred, if records over 20 years old are not put forward for appraisal, when will they be transferred to the National Archives?  The Bill states the transfer of records will occur when "arrangements for the transfer of all Departmental records which are more than 20 years old to the National Archives are adequate."  There is major work going on in the building.  I have looked for that for a long time and welcomed its announcement.  I have been there to see how it is proceeding.  It is a big warehouse.  The last time I asked about cataloguing of records there were approximately 70,000 boxes that were not catalogued.  That was a few years ago.  There will always be a challenge in that respect.  It could mean that older records are put even further back.  It is all very well saying we have them but getting them and being able to select the ones we want to look at is very challenging when they are not catalogued.  What does the Bill mean by "adequate"?  Who makes the assessment and judgment that the situation is "adequate" and the transfer can take place?</p> <p> The Bill does state the decision to review the status of closed records, or records which are not deemed "relevant records" and subject to transfer, will take place but it does not say when.  The current legislation states this review will happen every five years.</p> <p> Section 10(6) of the 1986 Act which allows a Minister to transfer records less than 30 years old is being removed.  The existence of this clause would allow a 20 year rule to be implemented without changing the current Act.  Is this section being removed so that individual Ministers cannot take decisions which would conflict with those of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht?  The Taoiseach will have the power to amend or revoke an order designating records as "relevant records", but no criteria for this decision are given.  That needs to happen.</p> <p> Reading the Bill it appears that there will be no sanctions against Departments if they do not transfer records.  While no sanctions are currently imposed on Departments or agencies of State if they have not transferred records more than 30 years old, they are aware that they are in breach of the legislation and can face public criticism for this.  There is an expectation that 30 year old records are transferred.  We should hear something from the Minister on that issue.  We believe the current drafting of the Bill introduces uncertainty into many of the functions carried out by the National Archives at present and leaves open the possibility of the politicisation of decisions in the selection of records for permanent preservation. </p> <p> If we spend money now, we can save later.  If there are enough people in the National Archives who can whittle down the records to the key ones that are appropriate to retain, we would reduce storage costs and the cost of digitisation.  It would make a lot of sense to invest in staff for cataloguing.  There are probably more than 70,000 boxes that have not been catalogued. </p> <p> Catriona Crowe, the former director of the National Archives, is speaking on this issue in Maynooth tonight.  She wants to open the administrative records of the mother and baby homes, industrial schools and Magdalen laundries for journalists and scholars.  The records can be anonymised when digitised and only people who need to see the individual record or have a personal interest in it can see it.  We all know people struggling to find material on themselves.  That should be taken on board as a matter of goodwill.  The historical adoption records held by Tusla need to be digitised and catalogued as a matter of urgency.  They are very personal and it has to be made simpler for people to find records.</p> <p> I was in the National Archives recently.  The work has some way to go to conclude.  When we compare them with the new Public Record Office of Northern Ireland or the National Archives (Public Records Office) in Kew in England, we realise the risk we have taken until now with the records held by the State.  That work cannot happen quickly enough because the records are at risk of damage by fire or water.  It is important that work is moving towards its conclusion.  There should be no spoiling the ship for a ha'pworth of tar.  We must make sure the records in the National Archives are protected from fire and water.</p></speech>

I welcome the interlinking of databases and the digitisation of the records.  As a pastime I spend a great deal of time looking at these archives.</p><p>I met a Member of the Welsh Assembly last week and when he told me where his grandfather had come from, I was able to find the 1901 and the 1911 censuses and other items within two minutes.  It is very important to protect whatever archives we have, but also to increase our expenditure on the National Library of Ireland and the county libraries which do a fantastic job.  Other archives are important such as the records of baptisms in the Catholic Church.  My people came from County Kerry and I can get church archives dating back to 1828-29.  They are photocopies rather than digital, but it is amazing what one can find out.  They are very useful.  One of the biggest growth industries in Ireland and the world is <i>www.ancestry.com </i>.</p><p>Somebody from my street is married to one of its senior executives, but I will not mention their name and embarrass them.  I refer to the reach of the website, the work it has and how it has reunited people from a nation who have emigrated far and wide but particularly to the United Kingdom and America.  The American records are particularly good.  In fact, I traced a relation of mine from whom nobody had heard since they emigrated in 1914.  We were able to trace them, where they lived, including the different addresses, and what they did.  The American archives are really remarkable.<br/><br/>In terms of education, local history topics are hugely important such as the place one lives, as are photographs of one's family, including photographs of one's grandparents and great-grandparents.  We all like to look at the Lawrence collection of photographs and other photographs from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  I am not a researcher in this area but we should encourage more people to upload images of their towns.  For instance, there is a Drogheda in the Past group on Facebook.  I am sure many people enjoy going on Facebook and looking at images of their own towns.  There is a huge respect for, and interest in, the past and how things were and how they never more shall be.<br/><br/>It is good to be able to look back and see the poverty from which we came.  We note the way people dressed, their small holdings and perhaps the tenements in which they lived.  That is all part of our history.  It is not just about the history of lords and ladies, the great and good and the wealthy; it is about the ordinary people and our social history.  These are the things that count.<br/><br/>Some years ago when I was a member of a local authority - I think I was first elected in 1974 when few people in the House were born - the local court house was being demolished because it was dangerous.  Before its demolition, I went into the building to see where, during the 18th and 19th centuries, judges gave rather difficult rulings against those who ended up on the wrong side of Australia.  Under the dias, the elevated platform where the judges sat, I discovered many old records, including indentures of apprentices going back to 1700.  When looking around other parts of the old court house, I found records on housing.  In the 1920s and 1930s when the county doctor visited a family, he would write about the conditions of the house and the people in it and the illnesses from which they may have suffered.  These records were a wonderful historic and social commentary.  The individuals named were special and I would not mention them.<br/><br/>Keeping archives is about keeping alive where and what we have all come from.  It is about what our ancestors did, how great they were, how poor they were and what little education they had.  In the case of my own family, I have found records going back to the 1830s, but I am able to look to the 1901 census, as can everybody in this House.  In the 1901 census I can see that my great-great-grandfather was unable to read or write and was unable to speak English.  He spoke only Irish, which was also the case with his bean ceile.  One can discover so much.  I love the work that is being done.  This legislation is empowering and improves the keeping and the collection of these records.  This is hugely important.  This is wealth from our past that we must keep.<br/><br/>Our Facebook today is our archive of tomorrow.  What people post on Facebook is there forever in its own way.  Perhaps, in many respects, it is the modern archive, which is one reason people must be very careful about what they post on it.  <br/><br/>This is hugely important work with great benefits for everybody.  We all need to know where we come from, who we are and what we are, and the collection and keeping of the archival material is a wonderful task.<br/><br/>I attended an event in Cooley, timpeall coic&iacute;s &oacute; shin.  Bh&iacute; &oacute;c&aacute;id mh&oacute;r ann le P&aacute;draig&iacute;n N&iacute; Uallach&aacute;in.  T&aacute; cnuasach m&oacute;r eolais bailithe aici faoin gceol, faoin ngn&aacute;thshaol agus, ach go h&aacute;irithe, faoi na daoine a bh&iacute; ag maireacht&aacute;il le c&uacute;pla c&eacute;ad bhliain anuas san &aacute;it ar a dtugtar Oriel n&oacute; Oirialla.

Canadh an ceol seo den ch&eacute;ad uair le 200 bliain anuas.  &Oacute;c&aacute;id iontach a bh&iacute; ann.<br/><br/>The archives which P&aacute;draig&iacute;n N&iacute; Uallach&aacute;in has collected in the area of Oirialla, or Oriel in English, which includes north Louth, south Down and part of Monaghan, records a wonderful, rich, beautiful, fabulous heritage, but it is more than that, it is historic.  P&aacute;draig&iacute;n N&iacute; Uallach&aacute;in has put together a magnificent collection without pay or favour from anyone, with some support from the Arts Council.  She is dedicated to it.  On the night in question, as I said as Gaeilge, we heard the most wonderful, fabulous music which had not been heard in over 200 years.  Imagine going into a room where a man stands up and sings a song, a beautiful air that no one has heard in over 200 years.  This is the material being collected.  The P&aacute;draig&iacute;n N&iacute; Uallach&aacute;ins and all those like her up and down the country are fantastic in all the work they do.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an deich n&oacute;im&eacute;ad beagnach caite.<br/><br/>I refer to the wealth, the wonder and the beauty of the fantastic and wonderful traditions that we have in Ireland.  It is one thing to collect them and hold them dear in our hearts and minds, but it is another to collect them in order that everybody, no matter where they live not only in Ireland but all over the world, may access them and to make them digitally available in order that they may be kept forever is wonderful work.  It holds far greater truth and value to me than many of the speeches people like me make in here all the time.  It is our past but it is also our future from which we can all learn.  It makes us all humble.<br/><br/>In <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>Proust wrote of the certainty that the past is never over, it is always present; all one needs to do is look for it.  If one looks for one's own past, one will live alongside one's ancestors in their times and places.  They were no different from us, although their lives may have been shorter and tougher.  The collection of this material is wonderful.<br/><br/>I support this legislation.  I do not know how much funding is going into the National Archives, but I would like to see it increased by a multitude.</p></speech>

I have listened with interest to the input of Deputies on all sides of the House.  The various issues raised will be considered further by the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys's Department as the Bill makes its way through the Houses.  Issues of relevant costs are being dealt with and have been looked at by the Minister.</p>  <p>Ireland&rsquo;s unique and varied culture is a source of immense national pride that gives us a common sense of purpose.  The Minister and I believe it is crucial that we provide an accurate reflection of our history and our journey to the modern Ireland of today and that the National Archives is one of the State&rsquo;s most important national cultural institutions.  The records held by the archives document the historical evolution of the Irish State and the creation of our national identity.  For this reason the Minister firmly believes that, notwithstanding the challenges it is important to provide the flexibility for records to be released after 20 years if there is strong case regarding their historical or public interest value.</p>  <p>  Our shared history with Great Britain and Northern Ireland cannot be underestimated and the Government is of the strong view that we must provide for the protection of the Irish perspective on that shared history.</p><p>The Minister has considered carefully moving to a 20-year rule and is of the opinion that, notwithstanding the significant resourcing issues involved, it is important to provide for the early release of records of significant historical or public interest value.  If we do not change the legislation by 2023 Great Britain and Northern Ireland will be releasing records ten years ahead of the Republic of Ireland and that would lead to an incomplete version of our shared history.</p> <p> We have listened to all the points made and will report back to Deputies.  The Minister's officials have taken note of what has been raised and they will examine what has been proposed.  I have a word of caution.  If Members have any amendments they want to table on Committee Stage, it would be of good value if they consulted the Department before doing so as it would help to speed up the process and make sure we had understanding of the amendments.</p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

We are agreed that it is crucial that a deliberate and considered recruitment process takes place in order that the best possible candidate is appointed following a selection process.  We are also agreed that an overly long delay in the appointment of a new Commissioner would not be optimal for the organisation in terms of performance or morale.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to say the authority has commenced the ground work for the recruitment process in advance of the formal triggering of the statutory process by Government.  I see this process taking a number of weeks during which the authority will engage with my Department and the Public Appointments Service, which will undertake the competition on behalf of the authority.  Importantly, it will also allow the Policing Authority to explore with the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland how it sees the future role and responsibilities of the new Commissioner.  As the Deputy is aware, the commission is undertaking a comprehensive review of all aspects of policing in the State and has considerable experience and expertise around the table in that regard.  I very much welcome the willingness of the commission to share its perspective with the Policing Authority in advance of completing its work, which is scheduled for September 2018.  This will assist in ensuring potential candidates will have as much information as possible on the future direction of policing in the State.</p>  <p>  Subject to the progress the authority makes in the coming weeks I expect the Government to be in a position to formally approve the authority to invite the Public Appointments Service to conduct the selection process in the coming weeks.  Once the process is triggered I anticipate that it will take between four to six months to identify and appoint a successful candidate.</p></reply>

In the immediate aftermath of the retirement of the former Commissioner, the chairperson of the commission on the future of policing stated she believed it would be appropriate that a new Commissioner would not be appointed until such time as that commission had concluded its work.  That caused concern among a number of people, particularly since it is envisaged that commission may take a considerable period of time to complete its work.  At the time, there was talk about a period of delay of perhaps up to 20 months or so.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I was there when the chairperson of the Policing Authority came in and she answered questions in respect of the appointment also.  As the Minister mentioned, the Policing Authority has an invaluable role to play in this respect.  She indicated she thought that would be too much of a delay.</p>  <p>  The Government also has a very important role to play since itt appoints the person, on foot of the nomination of the Policing Authority.  In particular, as the Minister is aware, under section 9(2) it is the Government that has to provide specific approval to the Policing Authority inviting it to allow the Public Appointments Service to commence the competition.  When does the Minister think that role will be commenced by the Government?</p></speech>

In that regard, let me assure the Deputy the selection of a new Garda Commissioner is a priority for me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, but also for all of my Government colleagues.  It is, however, vital, and I invite the Deputy to agree with me, that we ensure the selection process put in place is one that will be capable of delivering the best possible candidate.  The chair of the Policing Authority and I agree that the process must be approached in a careful and considered manner.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the point the Deputy makes on the Commission on Future Policing in Ireland and the comments of the chair thereof.  I again point out that the commission is not due to complete its work until September 2018.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would not be in the public interest, or in the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as an organisation or its members, to allow a state of uncertainty to surround the leadership of the national police service for such a lengthy period of time.  I am pleased to say from my engagement with the chair of the commission, Ms Kathleen O'Toole, that I know she shares my concern that a careful and deliberative approach is taken in the recruitment process in order that the best possible candidate will be selected and my concern that the process should not be prolonged beyond a reasonable timeframe.  I welcome the willingness on the part of the chair to bring the commission's wealth of experience and expertise to the process being undertaken by the Policing Authority and I share the Deputy's view that we should not allow an inordinate period of time to pass before filling this important position.</p></speech>

I also agree with him when he says the selection process should be designed in such a way that it will result in the best possible candidate being selected.  However, when we look at the legislation, it gives some cause for concern.  The legislation introduced by the former Government in 2015 provides that there must, first of all, be a competition run by the Public Appointments Service to identify who is the best candidate.  The Government sees great merit in competitions being run by the Public Appointments Service.  They are of questionable benefit and sometimes competitions do not result in the best and most appropriate candidate.  What does the Minister believe should be the basis of the competition being run by the Public Appointments Service?  Is the Government or the Policing Authority going to have any say in respect of that competition?  Is it the case the Public Appointments Service is simply going to come back stating it ran a competition and here is the winner and then the Policing Authority and the Minister will be bound by that decision?  We need greater selection appraisal than simply running a competition before we appoint the highest police officer in the State.</p></speech>

I also made it clear that as far as the Government is concerned we are not ruling in or not ruling out anybody in the course of the selection process for the next Garda Commissioner.  The selection of the next Commissioner is a job for the Policing Authority.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that what is essential is that we can ensure the best possible candidate is appointed, whether he or she a candidate internally or externally from the international stage.  The Government is supportive of the authority in that regard.  I am in agreement with the Deputy when I say that simply to rush matters at this stage to have a person in the post would be mistake.  I believe it is important that we allow the authority adequate time to complete its own preparatory work, including, as I said, the engagement with my Department and the Public Appointments Service which, as the Deputy has pointed out, is an important part of the process.</p><p>This will take a matter of weeks.  I envisage that we will be in a position to trigger the formal process in a few weeks, but I do not believe this timeframe is unduly long by comparison with the time normally taken to fill top-level posts across the public service.  I will be happy to keep the Deputy fully informed of the developments in that regard.</p></speech>

A courts process is under way to ensure wrongful convictions are set aside, with the first tranche of such cases resulting in the appeals being successful.  A dedicated team within the Garda is working with the Courts Service to expedite the process to rectify these fixed-charge notice or summons errors.</p>  <p>  All motorists wrongly issued with summonses will have their cases appealed, but it will take time to track down those who have changed address in the meantime.  Legal fees should be at a minimum as garda&iacute; are progressing the cases themselves where they can.  If motorists do not respond to the first contact, they will be further contacted, including through home visits, if necessary, to ensure that all appeals are finalised.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that, to date, there is no indication that people have suffered imprisonment as a result of a summons issuing instead of an fixed-charge notice.   In the majority of cases, where an incorrect summons was issued, it was done in conjunction with summonses for other offences that were tried at the same time and regarding which penalties were applied correctly.  </p>  <p>  Since these matters came to light earlier this year, the Government, including me on numerous occasions, has made it clear to the Garda that this is a most serious matter and that the behaviour in question is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  The Garda report and the actions under way to address these serious errors are welcome but it is important to note that, at the Government's request, the Policing Authority is producing its own report, and it will deal with these issues comprehensively.  That report is due to be concluded in the coming weeks.  I am looking forward to the early receipt of that document.</p></speech>

At a meeting of the justice committee some weeks ago, I put this question to the Garda.  Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn told us that as many as 119 solicitors had contacted the Garda about adverse consequences for clients.  As the Minister said, nobody was imprisoned solely owing to a summons being issued instead of a fixed-charge notice.  I am aware, however, of cases of individuals having been arrested.  Such a case in County Kerry was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  The arrest entails a loss of reputation.  There are many reported cases.  Perhaps the lost penalty points led to a loss of a licence, which might have led to lost employment, among other implications.  Considering the 119 cases raised by solicitors, there clearly are  people who believe their circumstances are more severe than those encompassed by the current process being dealt with.  The correspondence the Garda is sending to people is largely administrative and does not deal specifically with circumstances beyond the reimbursement of the fine and the relevant process in that regard, nor does it deal with making good any loss other than the fine.  There seems to be no process.  When I put this to Ms Josephine Feehily, she stated she was not aware of any process to deal with this issue.</p></speech>

If he has any information that might be helpful, he should remain in contact the appropriate authorities.  I am not aware of any instances of imprisonment solely as a result of being a conviction following the issuing of a summons where a fixed-charge notice should have been issued instead.  In 96% of the 14,700 cases identified, the persons concerned had committed other offences in respect of which issuing a summons was justified.  I am aware, however, of recent media reports on individual cases and acknowledge what the Deputy has said in that regard.  I am not going to comment on an individual case that was the subject of media attention, but I can reiterate that any case of which I have been made aware involved other offences which were correctly punished by way of the issuing of a summons.  Therefore, the penalties imposed may well have been imposed.  There may be individual cases - again, I acknowledge what the Deputy said - where people received more severe punishments solely as a result of not being afforded the opportunity to pay a fixed charge.  I believe, however, that such cases comprise a very small minority.  As I said, no such cases have been brought to my attention.  I will be happy, however, to communicate further with the Deputy.  If he has information he feels backs up what he says, he has an appropriate avenue available to him, which I trust he will use.</p></speech>

Obviously, this still has serious implications for their reputation.</p>  <p>  My question, which has not been answered yet, is whether the Minister is aware of any specific process the Garda is undertaking to quantify the number of cases in which the aforesaid circumstances apply.  As I said, Assistant Commissioner Finn has said 119 solicitors have contacted the Garda specifically in regard to this.  Therefore, there are at least 119 people who believe that, on foot of the process as outlined by the Garda in terms of correspondence received, an administrative remedy and the possibility of reimbursement, they require further recompense, which may require an additional process.  Is the Minister aware of any proceedings that have begun against An Garda or his Department regarding this matter?</p></speech>

Even if it were, I would be most reluctant to comment on it, particularly if it were before the courts.  What I can say is that, in the meantime, while all these appeals are being dealt with, every effort is being made by An Garda to ensure each case is examined individually.  There are cases in which there may have been a change of address and there are instances where the places of residence of people who got a court summons were not immediately identifiable.  Every effort is being made by the Garda to deal with these matters individually.  While the appeals process is being engaged in, the outstanding issues can take their course in terms of whatever follow-up action may be required, if any.</p></speech>

Sometimes those criminal assaults are by other teenage boys.  These issues do not receive any recognition in newspapers or the national media, but the events have a very significant and negative impact on young teenage boys.  Are there measures Deputy Charles Flanagan, as Minister for Justice and Equality, can take to prevent these criminal assaults which have such a negative impact on the young person, particularly in mind of the extra difficulty that, in most circumstances, the assailant is also a teenage boy.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900038#NN00200"><p>The Deputy will be aware that there is a range of robust legislative provisions in place for dealing with criminal assaults generally.  The law in relation to assault is not defined by age.  The general law relating to assault is contained in the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 which deals comprehensively with a wide range of assault provisions, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties, as the Deputy will be aware.  That Act provides for penalties of up to five years in prison for an offence of assault causing harm and for a penalty of life imprisonment for an offence of assault causing serious harm.</p>  <p>  While the main area of law which deals with assault is the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, section 18 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 created an offence of aggravated assault with intent to cause bodily harm or to commit an indictable offence.  A person convicted of this offence could face a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years or both.</p>  <p>  The general approach in Irish law is for the Oireachtas to set a maximum sentence in statute and to leave the precise sentence in any case to the discretion of the sitting judge who can have regard to the relevant principles and the circumstances of each individual case, including such factors as the age and vulnerability of the victim and the seriousness of the offence.  An Act of the Oireachtas which arbitrarily required that an assault on a person in one age category be treated differently from an assault on a person in another age category could fall foul of the constitutional requirement to treat all citizens equally.</p>  <p>  I advise the Deputy that the legislation in this area is kept under constant review by my Department in collaboration with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, if he wishes to make specific proposals, I will be happy to examine them in the context of what he has just said.</p></speech>

As a result he required significant dental reconstructive work but, worse, it also had a significant impact on his self-confidence, in particular as the incident occurred in the area in which he lives.</p>  <p>  When the boy's mother contacted me I suggested she contact the Garda, which she did.  She said the garda&iacute; were doing their best, but as the Minister is aware, they can only respond on the basis of evidence that is available and prosecutions can only take place if there is evidence available.  In the aftermath, I contacted other people and was astonished by the extent to which such assaults are happening on a very frequent basis.  We do not see it in the newspapers or hear about it on the radio, but these events occur regularly to young men.  In a way because young teenage boys are affected, it is regarded as being acceptable and part of growing up.  It is not.  No young boy should be subjected to such violence.</p>  <p>  Since it is the case that such assaults are being committed to a large extent by teenage boys, what can be done with young offenders to prosecute them and ensure there is some deterrent in respect of these matters?</p></speech>

I agree with what he said.  It is essential that we continue to do everything in our power to protect the most vulnerable in society.  It seems that the case which has generated the question in the House does involve a vulnerable person, namely a young defenceless individual.  As I stated, a range of robust provisions at statutory level is in place to deal with criminal assaults.  I repeat that we always keep legislation under review.</p>  <p>  A person who has been the victim of an assault as described by the Deputy, whether they have been assaulted by a stranger or by someone they know, the best way to ensure their safety is to report the incident to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The decision to report the assault is entirely that of the person concerned.  In addition, there is a number of bodies who are able to provide assistance to victims of assault such as the Crime Victims Helpline.  The Deputy is aware we are at an advanced stage of completion of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) legislation.  I acknowledge the point made and I believe society needs to be vigilant in order to ensure that the most vulnerable are protected.</p></speech>

If I am assaulted or the Minister is assaulted there will be issues in respect to that but it appears to be different when the assault is perpetrated on young teenage boys by young teenage boys.  I read a report recently in <i>The Sunday Times</i>which said there had not been prosecutions in respect of young persons who had been arrested on criminal charges.  We need to look again at this issue.  As the mother who telephoned said to me - perhaps I am entering dangerous territory - that if this was happening to young girls in the area there would be uproar about it but for some reason society seems to tolerate gratuitous criminal assaults on teenage boys.  We have to send a message that this needs to stop, that it is unacceptable and it is not simply part of growing up.  It is a criminal assault on young people and we need to deal with it.</p></speech>

I agree that it is an issue that requires attention.  Of course, there are difficulties experienced by communities and individuals due to the anti-social behaviour of some youths.  One of the ways in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na tackles these issues is through behaviour warnings and behaviour orders.  A member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may issue a behaviour warning to a child who has behaved in an anti-social manner.  A behaviour warning is very much a preliminary step which must be taken before an application can be made to the courts.  Many superintendents in charge of districts are convening meetings on anti-social behaviour in order to ensure every effort is made to inform both parents and young people as to the legal situation.  A considerable number of behaviour orders have been granted.  Fines are imposed in respect of the breach of a behaviour order.</p>  <p>  Since 2007 a total of 3,564 behaviour warnings have been handed out and a number of behaviour orders have been issued by the courts.  That demonstrates that early intervention on the part of the Garda does have a positive effect.  I take very seriously the point raised by the Deputy and do not disagree with the issue he raised.</p></speech>

I am more accustomed to engagement with him in the foreign affairs arena.  I also welcome his question.  I should say the distribution of garda&iacute; is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  I can say, however, that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance for citizens and deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress in achieving the Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p><p>I am pleased to say budget 2018 will support the continuation of the high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 will remain firmly on track.  A further 800 new Garda recruits will enter the Garda College and an additional 500 civilians will be recruited to fill critical gaps throughout the organisation to facilitate the redeployment of garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new reserves expected to commence training early next year.</p> <p> Notwithstanding the Commissioner's responsibility for the distribution of the garda&iacute;, I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested by Deputy Darragh O'Brien in tabular form.  The tables set out to the number of garda&iacute; allocated to each Garda station in the Dublin metropolitan region as of 31 August this year, the latest date for which figures are readily available.  The Garda divisions referred to show that the Garda strength of the region on that date was 3,467.  There are 181 Garda reserves and 208 civilians attached to the region.  Where appropriate, the work of local garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, all of which are active in the region.</p></speech>

The Minister has said it is a matter for Garda management.  I understand that.  However, the reality is that stations such as the one in Malahide were downgraded by the previous Government.  In north Dublin the number of garda&iacute; is down by 20%.  Areas in which there is not a great Garda presence do not seem to be getting an allocation of new Garda recruits and I am concerned about this.  I hope there is a whole-of-government approach in so far as the Department looks at how resources are being distributed throughout Dublin.  The tendency is for many of the new recruits to go to the areas which are more visible, that is, the cities.  While new recruits and additional resources are needed in the centre of cities, the suburbs and outlying areas of Dublin cannot be forgotten.  That is my great concern.  Let us consider the figures for community policing, in particular.  For example, the entire area of Balbriggan with a population of almost 50,000 has only two community garda&iacute;.  For the whole of the Malahide district, the number of community garda&iacute; is down from six in 2014 to zero.  There has also been a decrease in Swords and there are no community garda&iacute; in the Lusk area.  These are examples of where it is obvious that we need to fill the gaps.  Community policing has been decimated, but it is crucial for good policing in any area, especially my area of Dublin Fingal.</p></speech>

They include areas of importance to the Deputy, including Balbriggan, Lusk, Skerries, Ballymun, Dublin Airport, Santry, Coolock, Malahide, Swords, Raheny, Clontarf and Howth.  I am happy to be able to make the information available immediately.  It is important in the context of policing for reference to be made at all times to the importance of community policing.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern in that regard.  He made a point about recruitment, with specific reference to Garda recruitment.  The numbers I have given indicate a doubling of the Garda Reserve in the coming period.  Moreover, I advise the Deputy that there are in the region of 2,000 civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My target is to have 4,000 civilians which would effectively double the current figure.  That represents a medium-term target of 20% for the level of civilian participation by 2021.  Currently, the figure is 14%.  Therefore, this will bring the force more into line with international norms and ensure trained garda&iacute; will not be engaged in administrative work or technical duties that could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  I will be happy to keep the Deputy informed of the detail, although I know that he will keep me under observation as far as these figures are concerned.</p></speech>

I wish to set out some examples.  Let us consider the Malahide district which includes the Garda stations in Malahide, Portmarnock and Kinsealy.  The population is 27,000 as per the last census.  There are no community garda&iacute; in the district.  The Swords Garda district covers the size of a city, an area larger than Limerick.  As per the last census, the population was a little less than 50,000 and it had ten community garda&iacute;.  Balbriggan is larger than most regional towns and larger than some cities.  It has a population of a little less than 40,000 and has two community garda&iacute;.  In Lusk the number is zero.  In Rush the number is also zero because the Garda station has been closed.  the number is also zero in Skerries.  I am highlighting this issue because Garda senior management needs to look at these areas where it is obvious that numbers are down, in particular the numbers of community garda&iacute;.  I welcome the Minister's comments to the effect that he supports the concept of community policing, but it has been decimated in large swathes of the country, including my constituency of Dublin Fingal.  I would be happy to work with the Minister and Garda management to ensure it is brought back to the fore and made a priority in areas throughout the country.</p></speech>

I have given the Deputy the tables.  In addition, a further 200 trainee garda&iacute; are scheduled to be attested later this year, which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to the 13,500 mark by the end of the year, representing an increase of 500 since 2016.  I am keen to ensure the points raised by the Deputy will be considered in respect of the assignment of garda&iacute; in the Dublin region.  We must have regard to the serious challenges An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na faces on a daily basis in the Dublin metropolitan area, with particular reference to the tackling of organised crime.  I am keen to acknowledge the success of the continuing Garda operation in response to gang-related crime, Operation Hybrid, and the need to ensure we continue to facilitate the Garda in every way we can to ensure the provision of adequate and proper resources.  The results of the additional resourcing provided can be seen on a day to day basis in the Deputy's constituency.</p></speech>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order offences.</p>  <p>  I recently published the second interim report of the Garda Commissioner which recommended that the former Stepaside Garda station in Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis.  It indicated that, subject to further analysis, the Commissioner was likely to recommend in the final report the inclusion of the former stations at Leighlinbridge, County Carlow and Donard, County Wicklow in the pilot scheme.

There are also agreed standards and specifications for Garda detention areas and custody suites which would have to be incorporated into the refurbishment.  Once the specification has been agreed to, the works will go to tender and commence once the contract has been placed.</p></speech>

The Minister might want to tell his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to send a tweet that perhaps it might never happen, certainly if the rate of progress of work on Sligo regional Garda station is anything to go by.  In Sligo an existing, functional Garda station and regional headquarters responsible for policing in counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, with 140 garda&iacute; working in it, with an assistant commissioner, a superintendent and a chief superintendent, does not have running water, cells or shower facilities, despite the fact that towards the end of the summer many heroic garda&iacute; jumped into the Garavogue river and averted disaster by saving four lives.  Will the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross' Garda station in Stepaside join the queue behind the station in Sligo which is so dysfunctional, notwithstanding the difficulties for existing serving staff in not having appropriate working conditions, and from where prisoners have to be sent 15 miles.  The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, has pointed to the standards required to be met in holding prisoners.  By contrast, there are probably umpteen Garda stations within 15 miles of Stepaside with umpteen showers, drinking water and active cells.  Will the Minister give a commitment that while Stepaside Garda station is at the beginning this process, since work on Sligo Garda station is surely at a much more advanced stage, we can look forward to having a new station there before we press ahead with the reopening of the Garda station in Stepaside?</p></speech>

The Garda station building and refurbishment programme 2016 to 2021, an ambitious five-year programme that will benefit over 30 locations throughout the country, includes an investment of over &euro;60 million of Exchequer funding as part of the capital plan and a major public private partnership project.  The new Garda station will be provided in Sligo.  The OPW placed advertisements in local and national newspapers earlier this year to secure a suitable site for the Sligo development, seeking expressions of interest from property owners and developers.  Returns were received in the spring.  The OPW, together with Garda estate management, reviewed the proposals submitted earlier this year.  A number of suitable sites have been identified as possible options for the development in Sligo.  The OPW is actively progressing the acquisition of a suitable site and it is understood the aim is to reach agreement on the purchase shortly.  This may not need to be said from my perspective, but, as somebody who is on the ground locally on a regular basis, the Deputy may well be in a position to assist the State authority in reaching agreement on the purchase of a suitable site.  I assure him of my interest in the matter.  It is important that we advance the project in Sligo having regard to the fact that funding is in place.</p></speech>

It arises from a concern I have about Syrian refugees based in Greece who have looked to be assigned in Ireland and who have been told that they cannot come here because we do not have accommodation.

To date, 1,406 persons have arrived in Ireland under the relocation and resettlement strands of the EU relocation programme.  I expect a further 738 to have arrived in Ireland under both programmes by early 2018.  Under the relocation programme, Ireland has pledged to accept 1,089 asylum seekers from Greece.  Ireland was the only EU country that chose voluntarily to participate in the programme.  It will meet its full commitment to Greece.  Some 621 persons of the allocation of 1,089 are already in the State and a further 390 have been assessed and are awaiting transportation from Greece.  By early 2018, we will have admitted our entire cohort from Greece under the relocation programme.</p>  <p>  Under the resettlement strand, refugees located in countries such as Lebanon are brought directly to Ireland with the help of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR.  Ireland originally pledged to resettle 520 refugees, double the amount the European Commission had proposed for Ireland, and we subsequently voluntarily doubled that number again.  I recently announced that our overall pledge would increase again, to 1,385.  Some 785 of these refugees are already in the State building new lives.  On the current locations of those who have already arrived, 602 persons are housed in emergency reception and orientation centres.  A total of 797 persons have been settled in 14 counties nationwide - Clare, Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Louth, Limerick, Mayo, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Westmeath and Wexford.</p></speech>

Will he update us on the position in bringing refugees here from Italy?  I know from the replies to previous questions that the former Minister had articulated a concern that the nature of our relationship and work with the Italian authorities had slowed down the arrival of refugees.  Will the Minister provide an update of how that section of refugees have been catered for under the programme?</p>  <p>  The numbers the Minister has given are interesting.  Some 602 persons are in emergency reception centres, while 709 have been resettled.  Is the Minister happy with these figures?  Having visited some centres, I am concerned that the time taken to get people from resettlement centres into the community has been longer than the ideal and that while the centres are doing a good job and the people running them are doing their best, support services in providing language training and for orientation have not been as rigorous and as intensive as they should be.  Will the Minister update me on whether he is happy with how the emergency centres are working and the speed at which people are being settled in the community?</p></speech>

There are 602 refugees living in four reception centres in counties Kildare, Roscommon and Louth in which they receive orientation support.  They also receive integration and language training support while waiting for housing to be sourced.  I agree with the Deputy that it is important that there be no undue delay in the transfer of refugees from reception centres to long-term housing in both urban and rural settings throughout the country and that the full range of services should be available to them while awaiting relocation to ensure their other needs are met.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the programme was slow to become operational in the case of refugees from both Greece and Italy.  This gave rise to delays earlier this year.  National security is, of course, a competency that remains the sole preserve of each individual member state.  Ireland already had arrangements in place to allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to travel to Greece to interview refugees which had been assigned to Ireland.  However, the position was not the same in Italy where, for various reasons, there were difficulties in allowing police officers from member states to carry out this important function on Italian soil.  The IRPP is working actively and positively to bring as many refugees from Greece as possible here by the end of the year.  This, of course, is dependent on a number of factors, including the provision of housing by local authorities for persons currently in reception centres.  There is the full and active engagement of the appropriate agencies involved.</p></speech>

I will go back to the Department about what is happening in Italy.  On how we will reallocate refugees into local communities, it is my understanding the reallocation will be towards areas there there is not a large social housing waiting list, which makes sense.  By definition, it is likely that these communities or towns are not exactly thriving, not the busiest or most popular.  Is the Minister looking at the integration of refugees from the point of view of completely turning around these towns, not merely from the point of view of supporting the refugees, in order that they will not feel they are dumping grounds with the least successful towns ending up taking refugees?  If we were to invest in the towns at the same time, it might change the whole attitude to how the programme works.  Would the Minister support such an initiative?</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that Dublin will not be used in the resettlement programme, unless there are essential and specific needs that cannot be met elsewhere.  Certainly, from my experience of speaking to community leaders, for example, in Ballaghadereen, on the border between County Mayo and County Roscommon, there are challenges.  However, I am pleased to say these challenges are being met head-on by dint of the welcome received and a large measure of local leadership, as well as by the State agencies, be they in the areas of health, education, sport and recreation, the arts and culture.  People are ready to assist in order to ensure the stay of refugees in the commencement of their new lives in rural Ireland will be as comfortable and as welcoming as possible.</p></speech>

Minutes of all its meetings are available on its website at <i>www.lsra.ie</i>.</p><p>In tandem with the ongoing and essential work leading to the authority starting its key complaints and regulatory functions, the authority has been deeply engaged in the conduct of public consultations and the making of five reports on a series of structural reform issues under sections 118 to 120, inclusive, of the Act which were also commenced.  It has been obliged to complete these reports within strictly set deadlines running from its day of establishment on 1 October 2016.</p><p>Having delivered on this substantive programme of consultations and reports, the current working focus is very much on the managed roll-out of the authority's remaining functions.  They include the matching development of its organisational capacities and office and staffing resources which are essential, as the Deputy will agree, to effective delivery.  Following these steps, the key structural reforms of Part 6 of the 2015 Act relating to public complaints, professional conduct and the appointment of the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers will be commenced.</p><p>In a key development, the authority has recently completed its public recruitment of a full-time chief executive, Dr. Brian Doherty, who took office in mid-September.  Having operated a modest executive office, it has recently secured larger office premises in support of the coming into operation of its respective functions.  Matters are ongoing with a view to having the authority reach full capacity at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

It is difficult for Deputies to get answers unless we table questions to the Minister, being the appropriate Minister.  In the case of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na we were perfectly within our rights to ask questions, notwithstanding the fact that the Garda was also independent in carrying out its functions and operational duties.  The reason I ask this question is that there is a certain degree of public disquiet about the fact that the authority was established, as I stated, 15 months ago.  It is the case, it has to be said, that members of the legal profession are being regulated using the old method used prior to the passage of the Act, but it is a cause of disquiet among members of the public that the new body which promises so much and which was greeted with such fanfare is not up and running.  It is regrettable that it is not up and running 15 months after it was identified that it had been commenced.  I asked a question about this in February and the answer I received was that the then Minister hoped it would be in substantive regulatory mode later this year.  The Minister is not responsible for this, but he has to be able to tell members of the public when the body will be up and running in order that they can make complaints.</p></speech>

That allocation is in the course of being drawn down.  A similar amount has been set aside this year in the justice Vote and any funding advanced from the allocation will strictly be on a recuperable basis.  The Deputy will be pleased to learn that the authority is working on several projects that will assist in identifying the staffing needs and resources required to allow it to support the ongoing roll-out of its functions to a structured and achievable timetable.  I had the opportunity shortly after my appointment as Minister to meet the chairperson.  I will be meeting the chairperson and members of the authority again before the middle of November to further discuss the authority's medium to long-term plans.  I have written to the authority to emphasise the importance I attach, as Minister for Justice and Equality, to the objective of getting it to open for business, in terms of the public complaints function, as quickly as possible, while also bearing in mind the risks and complexities which must be carefully managed in order to bring this about.</p></speech>

I still do not know when the Legal Services Regulatory Authority will be operational.  I note that there are very important provisions in the Act.  Part 6 will set out the new regulatory regime and the basis on which complaints can be made by members of the public.  I do not know when it is going to be up and running, but members of the public should be informed about it.  They have not been given any information by the Minister in his reply today.  It is very important, from the point of view of the legal profession, as well as the public, that this body be up and running promptly.  The impression may be spreading abroad that the legal profession is not regulated.  The Minister knows that that is not the case, as do I.  However, the public may not believe it to be the case when they see that a new regulatory body has been established but is not up and running.  I appeal to the Minister not to adopt a passive approach to this statutory body.  It is one of the many quangos that has been set up by the Government.  I urge him to get out and ask the authority to become operational as soon as possible in order that members of the public can be assured that they are protected and that the legal profession is being regulated by an independent statutory body.</p></speech>

The authority, in turn, is working to progress, in conjunction with my Department, the identification of and elaboration on the more specific delivery dates concerned.  I expect these to apply to the respective functions involved during the remainder of the year and into the early part of 2018.  I do not wish to pre-empt the authority's independent planning and the completion of its commencement programme, but I do expect the relevant details to become available very soon.  If there are members of the public who have a concern, as outlined to the House by the Deputy, about the public workings of the authority to date, I remind the public through the Deputy that information is available on the authority's website at<i>www.lsra.ie</i>.</p></speech>

I am very concerned about the very serious public safety and anti-social issues associated with the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.  Tackling these issues, as the Deputy said, requires a multi-agency approach.  To better facilitate this, I have written to the relevant parties, including the Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, as well as the Garda Commissioner and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, in order to ascertain whether there are additional legislative or other solutions which could assist us in dealing with this issue in a more comprehensive way.  More recently, I have also written to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, given that the National Parks and Wildlife Service falls within its remit.  Responses have now been received from the majority of bodies.  As a next step, when all responses have been received, I intend to convene a meeting of all interested parties in order to identify more effective possible solutions and assign responsibility and timeframes for them.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is already aware that, under the road traffic Acts, any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is empowered to stop a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place and demand production of a driver licence or learner permit.  In addition, garda&iacute; may inspect a vehicle for compliance with vehicle standards legislation which makes it an offence to drive without reasonable consideration or to drive carelessly or dangerously.  The Garda authorities also have powers of seizure, detention, storage and disposal of vehicles under road traffic legislation.  I am further informed that the use of quad bikes and scramblers in public parks and open spaces is strictly prohibited by the local authorities under the parks and open spaces by-laws of 2011.</p>  <p>  Despite the road traffic and other relevant legislation available in this area, the Garda authorities have indicated that there are issues of safety involved in the enforcement of these laws which are best addressed through a multi-agency approach.  I am informed that garda&iacute; are working with local authorities, including park authorities, to examine other solutions, including engineering solutions.  Enhanced fencing and bike gates are examples of engineering measures which may be taken in order to restrict access to parks.  However, we must do this in a way that will ensure our parks, particularly those in Dublin, can be used for the recreational purposes for which they have been designed.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that garda&iacute; have seized vehicles, but there appears to be a legal vacuum because I have anecdotal evidence of parents picking up quad bikes or scramblers that have been seized.  There appears to be an inconsistency or contradiction in terms of the legislation or its interpretation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is an issue of health and safety at play.  I acknowledge that in some instances local authorities and garda&iacute; have found it extremely difficult to intervene when there are a number of vehicles on a particular green.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on some of the responses he has received.  Has any of the relevant agencies proposed legislative changes?  We know that engineering solutions are an option for greens and parks, but they are not going to address the root of the problem.  These vehicles are being purchased across the board and green spaces in Dublin and elsewhere are out of bounds at times, when no State agency could safely intervene or interrupt the activity that is ongoing.  I ask the Minister to outline whether any of the responses he has received includes proposals for legislative changes.</p></speech>

The road traffic Acts empower An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine or seize vehicles.  All members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully enforce the legislation in the seizure, storage, release and disposal of vehicles.  However, there may be one issue worth looking at in that context.  As the Deputy said, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have the power to retain a seized vehicle where the person concerned produces satisfactory evidence of ownership and has paid the relevant charge.  It should also be noted that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have any legislative power to deal with scrambler or quad bikes being driven on private land.  However, local authorities have the power to introduce by-laws as they have done in respect of many parks.  My colleague at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, has similar powers to control off-road vehicles in certain areas.  Unauthorised use of off-road vehicles is prohibited, for example, in certain national parks.  </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross that scramblers, quad bikes and other vehicles fall under the road traffic legislation when used in a public place.  I am further informed, however, that the legislation does not extend to the use of such vehicles on private property or in public parks which are under the jurisdiction of local authorities or in national parks.  In the case of the latter two, however, local authorities and the Minister Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are empowered to introduce appropriate by-laws.  </p>  <p>  These are the issues I am anxious to discuss with all of the agencies in order that we will be in a position to ensure best practice is applied across the board.</p></speech>

He mentioned the problem I have heard most about in the feedback I have received.  When seized and retained, the power of disposal is not there when an ownership certificate is produced.  Lots of parents are collecting scramblers and quad bikes and the cycle continues.  Not many children own these bikes and we should address the legal vacuum, at the very least, in order that they can be disposed of.  It is the same people who create havoc on greens and parks and if garda&iacute; had the power of disposal, it would quickly address the issue.</p></speech>

I am sure he would agree that we need to raise awareness of the dangers of quad bikes and scramblers and I acknowledge the role of the Road Safety Authority, which has invested in interventions targeting those most at risk.  According to the Road Safety Authority, education and enforcement are key measures and are both appropriate and necessary.  The authority collaborates with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the matter or motorcycle and quad safety issues and it is important that it builds on a recent campaign which targeted parents considering these vehicles as Christmas gifts.  Joint information and awareness programmes are important and I would be happy to hear of any ideas Deputy Jack Chambers has that might provide solutions to the issues.</p></speech>

I have concerns about the fact that the Minister is investing resources in larger facilities for women prisoners.  While everybody agrees that there needs to be a new facility in Limerick, why does it have to be so big?  Why are we putting resources into step-down facilities and where is the evidence that this is the best way forward?</p></reply>

This commitment was acknowledged in the report on the strategic review of penal policy, which also recommended a greater focus on step-down facilities, supported accommodation, the use of more community-based open conditions for female offenders and the provision of an open centre for women.</p>  <p>  A joint Irish Prison Service-Probation Service working group considered an open centre for women and recommended that, rather than developing an open centre, a more practical and cost-effective way to address the deficit would be to pursue step-down facilities for women.  I am delighted to be able to support this very important initiative and the Deputy will be aware that I announced additional funding for the Irish Prison Service in 2018 to advance the project.  Significant progress has been achieved already to advance this initiative.  Approval was given to the heads of the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to proceed to scope the possibilities for the development of a step-down unit in Dublin.  In July 2016, an expressions of interest document was approved and issued, the first step in establishing a step-down facility for women in the Dublin area.  As a positive response was received from relevant service providers, it was then decided to proceed to tender.  The Irish Prison Service and Probation Service are currently advancing the tender documentation with the assistance of the Office of Government Procurement.  As part of this contract, the service provider will be required to provide accommodation for ten women.  The provider will co-ordinate individualised care plans for this vulnerable group with complex needs, linking women to a variety of community-based services and equipping them with skills to move towards independent living.  I recently had the very enlightening opportunity to meet some women prisoners and hearing, at first hand, of their experience of being in prison in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Building works on a new development for females in Limerick Prison will commence in early 2018.  When completed, it will provide 42 single-occupancy rooms and an additional eight independent living areas.  This stand-alone facility within the prison, with all the required ancillary services, will enhance the regimes and supports available to women.  I am satisfied that in light of the above, and the thorough consideration of the issues involved, the correct course is currently being pursued.</p></reply>

This is particularly so in the case of women because the crimes for which they are incarcerated are often very different from those for which males are incarcerated.  We know that 90% of women are jailed for short-term sentences for non-violent and minor offences, at a cost of almost &euro;70,000 per year.  Over 80% are sentenced for non-payment of fines and there is an average of 140 women in our prisons, the vast majority of whom do not belong there.</p>  <p>  The Minister has suggested the step-down facility is an alternative to prison.  If it is, I am delighted to hear it and maybe I am barking up the wrong tree because my understanding was that it was an exit route out of prison.  If it is instead of imprisonment I welcome it because women exiting prison need support, not with a paternalistic step-down facility but with independent living and supports to deal with drug issues, mental health issues and poverty, which are the reasons most women end up in prison in the first instance.</p></speech>

It is supervised but not institutional and it is an option as a residence for female prisoners, mainly those in transition from custody back to the community.  I agree that a prison should be a place of last resort.  To put it in context, there are 133 spaces for female offenders within the prison service.  The D&oacute;chas Centre can accommodate 105 women, in good quality accommodation, and 20 of them are for women preparing for their release.</p>  <p>  I referred to Limerick Prison.  This has accommodation for 28 women but I have to acknowledge that this accommodation is of very poor quality.  A new prison build on the Limerick site will allow for 50 new spaces for women, which will greatly assist in eliminating overcrowding in our two female facilities.  A snapshot of the female prisoner population as of earlier this week confirms that there are 143 women in custody and a further 15 on temporary release.</p></speech>

They are generally victims of abuse and poverty and have drug issues.  It is very worrying that the report of the investigative team in Northern Ireland found that, while there have been thousands of drug seizures in Irish prisons, the budget to deal with drug treatment in prisons has been cut by &euro;1 million every year.  Best practice states that women should be accommodated in open care centres.  The Minister seems to have said that step-down facilities are not an alternative to incarceration but an exit route after incarceration.  These women really need support for independent living.  This is a paternalistic, patronising attitude to what they need and other countries say women should not be imprisoned at all.  When a man goes to prison nothing really happens to his kids and the woman tends to go and visit but when a woman goes to prison it affects the whole family, in terms of accommodation and other issues.  It is incredibly destabilising and it should not be used.</p><p>I forwarded the Minister's previous reply about the size of Limerick Prison to organisations, such as the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, that are at the forefront on this issue.  They were shocked to hear that it is planned to build a bigger prison for women.  Rather than building larger prisons for women, we should be reducing prison sizes and investing in resources.</p></speech>

The proposed facility will replace the very poor services provided to a small number of women - I think the figure is less than 50 - in Limerick.  I agree with the Deputy that we should continue to identify appropriate alternatives to custody.  I acknowledge that legislation in this regard was passed recently.  Neither I nor the Department of Justice and Equality hand down custodial sentences to anybody; it is entirely a matter for the courts to do so.  As Minister, I would never interfere with the running or jurisdiction of the courts.  It is important for female prisoners to access the structural temporary release arrangements.  It is important for us to provide sentencing judges with a range of options, including the imposition of community service, when custodial sentences of 12 months or less are under consideration.  I acknowledge the work of the Probation Service in this regard.  On any given day, the service works with approximately 1,500 female offenders on a range of probation-type orders to ensure they are adequately assessed and supervised.  Many of the women in question are undertaking community service or are under post-release supervision.  I agree with Deputy Clare Daly's assertion that as legislators, we should be looking to give the courts a range of options.  Ultimately, the courts make decisions on sentences on the basis of the facts of each individual case.</p></speech>

As those of us who cover the justice and equality portfolio and are members of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality are well aware, the breadth and jurisdiction of the Department of Justice and Equality is enormous.  Its remit extends to areas like equality, disabilities, property rights, gambling, data protection and immigration.  This question seeks to ascertain whether the Department will publish a new statement of strategy in 2017 in order to deal with some of these issues.  If this question is answered carefully and correctly, it could result in a reduction in the Minister's workload.</p></reply>

This question relates to a new statement of strategy.  The current strategy statement for the Department of Justice and Equality covers the period from 2016 to 2019.  In accordance with section 4 of the Public Service Management Act 1997, the Department is preparing a new strategy statement to cover the period from 2017 to 2020.  This process will be completed by the end of this year.  The strategy will then be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published.</p>  <p>  The strategy statement will set out the key strategic objectives of the Department of Justice and Equality and the priority actions needed to achieve those objectives, including actions to support access to justice, gender equality, crime reduction and a fair and balanced immigration and protection regime.</p>  <p>  The consultation process that is under way will inform the development of the new strategy for the period 2017 to 2020.  I acknowledge the role of this Parliament in the public consultation process.  The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has participated in the process, as it did when previous strategy statements were being compiled.  Correspondence with respect to the strategy statement was sent to the joint committee earlier this year.  I have not seen the response, but I look forward to receiving it and giving appropriate consideration to any recommendations or observations that might be made.</p></speech>

It is worthwhile for the Department of Justice and Equality to take time to consider issues and to assess how it should make progress.  For far too long, the Department has operated on the basis of the next crisis on the list, such as an issue pertaining to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the prisons.  As a result, many important issues do not get dealt with, unfortunately.  I have been my party's spokesperson on justice and equality for almost 18 months.  We have dealt with very few equality issues during that time.  We need to recognise that equality was previously part of a different Department.  I think disability also gets lost in the Department of Justice and Equality.  There is an argument to be made that responsibility for disability should be given to the Department of Social Protection.  The Department of Justice and Equality is also responsible for the rights and regulation of charities, gambling, property services and data protection.  Perhaps responsibility for gambling could be transferred to the Department of Finance.  I am not making a definitive commitment in this regard, but I am suggesting that we should consider transferring these areas to other Departments.  If we do not do so, they might get lost in the morass of issues in the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

They undertake a huge amount of work on certain aspects of the remit of the Department.  I remind Deputy O'Callaghan that I have responsibilities to the obligations and commitments in the justice and equality areas that were made under the programme for Government last year.  I am keen to see those obligations and commitments implemented in full.  The Department of Justice and Equality has commenced an external and internal consultation process to identify any additional strategic and cross-agency issues that need to be addressed in the new strategy statement.  A number of questions here this afternoon have referred to the relationship between the Department and a range of other Departments, including the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I assure the Deputy that a number of responses have already been received on foot of the ongoing consultations.  All of them will be considered as the strategy is finalised.  I look forward to receiving a formal submission from the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

This should not be done to reduce the workload - that is the wrong expression - but to ensure all areas within the Department are given thorough and full consideration.  I note what the Minister said about his "active and constructive" Ministers of State.  I will not make any comment on that other than to say that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, does a great deal of work when he comes before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  We need to give full consideration to where we should go from here.  I suggest that the Minister should attend a meeting of the joint committee to hear the opinions of members on whether some issues within the jurisdiction of the Department could be moved to other Departments.  The Minister said that much of his time is spent dealing with the contents of the programme for Government.  I am afraid Fine Gael is partly responsible for that because of its decision to give in so significantly to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who wrote a large part of the justice section of the programme for Government.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is a victim of that now.  He has to implement the Ross agenda, but he should not become a prisoner of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He should ensure that he is allowed to introduce his own policy proposals in areas covered by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

The strategy statement is a high-level document and it is important that there are appropriate mechanisms for monitoring and implementation.  That will be managed through the annual strategic implementation plan which will be published and will detail the full range of actions to be taken in order to achieve the objectives of the plan. </p> <p> Progress will be monitored on a monthly basis by the management board.  Progress updates will be published regularly on the Department's website and in the annual report.  That does not account for the very important engagement I will have with various with various committees of the House, as well as the plenary engagement we are having today.</p></speech>

While the rate of payments for children living in State-provided accommodation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these payments have increased twice in the past two years, from &euro;9.60 to &euro;15.10 per child in January 2016 and to &euro;21.60 from September of this year.  All children or adults within the protection process who are resident in State-provided accommodation are now paid the same rate of allowance.</p>  <p>  These payments should be considered within the context that the families living in State-provided accommodation do not have the same level of expenses which other persons who are dependent on social welfare may have, such as rent, utility bills, food costs, prescription costs and so on.  Such costs are covered in full by the Government for persons living in the direct provision system.</p>  <p>  In regard to children who may be vulnerable, I take the issue of child welfare and protection very seriously.  It is important to outline that parents and guardians who live in State-provided accommodation centres have primary responsibility for the care and welfare of their children.  Unaccompanied minors in the State fall within the remit of Tusla.  </p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of my Department has a child and family services unit.  Its role is to manage, deliver, co-ordinate, monitor and plan all matters relating to child and family services for all persons residing in centres and to act as a conduit between RIA and the Tusla.  The unit is headed by a manager seconded from the Tusla.</p>  <p>  The unit's main functions and responsibilities are to monitor and implement the RIA child protection policy, working in close partnership with the child protection and welfare service of Tusla nationally.  It works in partnership with many NGOs and Tusla on important issues.</p></speech>

Their parents are not allowed to work and they do not have cooking facilities or live in an ordinary family environment.  They are being institutionalised from a young age, potentially for quite a long time.  According to the 2015 HIQA report, 14% of children have been referred to child protection services compared to a national average of 1.6%.</p>  <p>  I do not think more money is the answer.  However, when the direct provision charge payment amounts to &euro;93 per month compared to &euro;140 for child benefit - two-thirds of the payment - one has to ask why they are being treated differently.  Are they being treated as though they are equivalent to two-thirds of the children entitled to child benefit?</p>  <p>  Speaking in the Seanad recently, the Minister said he had not heard a credible alternative.  The credible alternative is to abolish direct provision, give people the right to work and allow people to access homes on the same basis as anybody else in the State.</p></speech>

I reject that.  Of course I accept that the conditions are not ideal, but they are being continually enhanced and improved.  I want to acknowledge the contribution of former judge, Bryan McMahon, and his comprehensive report and recommendations.  He carried out consultation with young people.  The reports are being implemented.</p>  <p>  Self or communal catering facilities are now available in Mosney, St. Patrick's in Monaghan, Ballyhaunis and Clonakilty, and will shortly be implemented in Millstreet and in State-owned centres in Clones, Kerry, Limerick and Cork.</p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the voluntary contribution of the friends of the centre group which include representatives of youth clubs.  Other youth organisations were established in all of the centres.</p>  <p>  I can cite the important role of For&oacute;&iacute;ge, which has a club in the accommodation centre in Mosney.  I want to acknowledge the role of many voluntary sporting organisations, in particular the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, which is actively encouraging the participation of young people in Mosney.</p>  <p>  While the conditions are not ideal, I wish to assure Deputy Murphy that we are continuing with the progressive implementation of the McMahon recommendations in order to ensure that the centres provide as comfortable an atmosphere and engagement as possible given the circumstances.</p></speech>

On receipt it was immediately forwarded to the Attorney General for consideration and advice.  This was done in the context of the development of proposals to take account of changes in European law in this area.</p><p>While the review was initially commissioned to look at issues concerning access by statutory bodies to the communications data of journalists held by communications service providers, Mr. Justice Murray also undertook a very detailed analysis of the law in this area, including recent and significant judgments of the European Court of Justice.  I published the report on 3 October and it is available on my Department's website.  I thank Mr. Justice Murray for his work on the review which, I would note, he carried out <i>pro bono</i>.  His report provides very valuable advice in this complex and dynamic area of law which is rapidly evolving.</p><p>As Deputy Wallace will be aware, on 3 October I also published the general scheme of a communications (retention of data) Bill.  This proposed legislation responds to the judgment of the European Court of Justice and will update the current law in Ireland.  In particular, I am proposing prior judicial authorisation in all cases where certain State agencies seek access to meta data in the context of investigations into serious crimes and safeguarding the security of the State.</p></speech>

Digital Rights Ireland has also repeatedly warned about the possibility of convictions being overturned in legal action being taken against the State.  In April 2014 the European Court of Justice utterly rejected the validity of the EU data retention directive.</p><p>This evolution of the law to which the Department has referred happened three years ago.  The European Court of Justice decision was based on a case brought by Digital Rights Ireland that specifically questioned the constitutionality of Ireland's data retention law, the Communications Act 2011 that implemented the EU directive in question.  Official communication from the Department of Justice and Equality has completely ignored this reality as to acknowledge the Digital Rights Ireland case would be to admit its failings for the past three years and beyond.  We have a good bit to go on this and Digital Rights Ireland has done this State a great service.  The Department should acknowledge that.</p></speech>

I have also forwarded a copy of the Murray report to the committee and would be happy to engage with it in due course once the legislation completes Second Stage in this House and goes to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  I say for the benefit of the Deputy that Mr. Justice Murray specifically examined safeguards in the accessing of journalist traffic and location data so as to protect, as far as possible, the identity of journalist sources.  I know we are running out of time but for the benefit of the Deputy and the record of the House, it is important to say I am of the view that judicial approval is desirable.  I am proposing that the system of prior approval by a judge should apply in all cases, not just for journalists but for everybody.  Mr. Justice Murray considered that High Court approval would be suitable where journalistic sources were in question and I am proposing that approval by a District Court judge would better facilitate the prior approval for all requests for access to communications data.  We need a robust and effective additional safeguards in this area.  I will ensure there is proper and adequate balance between having complete regard for the right of citizens and also having regard to the security of the State.  I look forward to receiving the contribution of the justice committee and engaging with Deputy Wallace on the matter in the not-too-distant future.</p></speech>

It is part of the new regional divisions.  In 2014 there was a preliminary design sign-off on the refurbishment of Newcastle West Garda station and it was welcomed that in 2015 it was to be part of the capital plan for 2016 to 2021.  The station requires refurbishment as it was built in a time when fewer people used it.  More people will use it now because of the amalgamation.  Refurbishment is also required to meet the needs of modern policing and customer service for people who use the station, particularly with regard to concerns about privacy and dignity.</p>  <p>  I have put down a number of parliamentary questions on this matter trying to get some sort of start date or estimate of when the refurbishment will be completed.  In May I received replies from my parliamentary questions indicating a design team was being appointed in order to further advance the project.  I took that in good faith.  I was told construction work would take 18 months and in a reply to a written question in July, I was told the Office of Public Works architectural and quantity surveying services have been assigned to advance the procurement and appointment of other design team members and progress the full design of the project.  Following the necessary planning and tender procurement processes, it is envisaged the construction works will take approximately 18 months.  In those questions I sought timelines and a breakdown of how designers would be appointed, the tendering process, the completion of the tendering process and the move to the construction phase.  I also asked when the envisaged construction phase will start, as we can assume an approximate duration of 18 months for the refurbishment.</p>  <p>  I have nothing but the highest respect and regard for the Garda in County Limerick and how they conduct its duties.  I have interacted with many of them over the years and I know garda&iacute; have had to work in challenging times.  I welcome the fact that the previous Government re-opened the Templemore training college in 2014 and we are now starting to see garda&iacute; come back on stream from a recruitment process.  The facility at Newcastle West needs upgrading as soon as possible, given the divisional changes that have taken place and the restrictions it currently has for the public and staff who use it.  It is imperative we get these timelines.</p>  <p>  I understand the Minister might be constrained in giving a specific start date but could we be given some sort of scheme of work or timeline for the design process?  When will designers be appointed and how long will be the design and tender processes?  Could the processes take place simultaneously?  Could a start date be deduced from these?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities, working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works.  As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters but I acknowledge the importance of this to Deputy Neville in the Limerick area.  The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must at all times have the modern technology and other resources, including fit-for-purpose buildings necessary to do the job.  I note in this regard that the capital plan for 2016 to 2021 secured resources in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the significant efforts being made by the Government to enhance the working environment generally for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and of the major investment that has been committed under the capital plan to upgrade Garda premises, the Garda fleet and Garda ICT infrastructure.  This is evidenced by the Garda station building and refurbishment programme for 2016 to 2021, which is an ambitious five- year programme that will benefit over 30 locations around the country and includes over &euro;60 million of Exchequer funding.  It is a major public-private partnership project.  The programme includes the major works in respect of replacement station at Newcastle West.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the Office of Public Works has completed a feasibility study on the existing Garda station site with regard to the brief of requirements for a district headquarters station.  Office of Public Works architectural services are currently reviewing that study from a health and safety, building efficiency and compliance perspective prior to the preparation of tender documents for the procurement of external civil and structural, mechanical and electrical consultants.  I note the Deputy's comments on timelines and that the Deputy wishes to have certainty on the matter of this proposed building.  I understand it is currently envisaged that the tenders for both of these services will issue between now and the end of this year, which is in the next few weeks.  I am further advised that, at this early stage of the project and until the full design team is in place, it is difficult to estimate the precise timeline for the completion of the works.  However, it is hoped by all involved that the necessary planning and procurement processes will take place by end of next year.  Following these, it is envisaged the construction will take approximately 18 months.</p>  <p>  With regard to the existing accommodation at Newcastle West, pending the refurbishment, I understand that minor remedial works continue to be progressed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with the Office of Public Works as the need arises.  I reassure the House that the Government is fully committed to proceeding with its major investment programme that aims to provide new stations and to modernise older stations at key locations around the country, ensuring a safe, modern working environment for garda&iacute; as well as fit-for-purpose facilities for visitors, victims and suspects, as well as the people in the Newcastle West and surrounding areas of County Limerick in general.</p></speech>

He has put some meat on the bones regarding the timeline for refurbishment.  I ask the Minister to keep a close eye on this and that efforts be made to push it through as quickly as possible, given the timelines there in respect of next year.  It will help if we can bring it forward or prioritise it to any degree, even perhaps by a number of months.  The refurbishment was announced in 2014.  I recognise the Minister's input and thank him for his reply and his prioritising of this issue.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the Garda in County Limerick in general, I welcome the recruitment that is taking place and recognise that Templemore was opened by the last Government.  We want to see that recruitment continue and to ensure the force is beefed up to the level outlined in the programme for Government but I must also put in my own spake for Limerick.  I hope that rural Limerick is not forgotten but will be recognised, particularly given the challenges rural areas have had to face in recent years.  The county will be complemented by the city region as well.  We are trying to get the resources for the city but are keen to ensure the rural areas are not forgotten.  </p>  <p>  I have nothing but the utmost respect for the Garda in County Limerick and how it conducts itself.  A superintendent in Newcastle West has retired.  I wish him well and hope that his replacement will be brought in as soon as possible.  I thank the Minister for replying to my question.</p></speech>

I assure him that I am very keen that this project will be completed but I do not believe there is any necessity for me to keep a close eye on matters, having regard to the close eye Deputy Neville himself keeps on this and other important issues in the Limerick constituency.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the matter of Garda recruitment.  I am committed to ensuring a strong and visible Garda presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, to provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is tangible progress towards achieving the overall vision of this Government to have an overall Garda service of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprised of 15,000 garda&iacute;, 2,000 members of the Garda Reserve and 4,000 civilians.  I am pleased to say that last week's budget will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and will ensure that our targets are firmly on track.  Deputy Neville will be aware of the recent graduation of 180 Garda recruits and trainees from Templemore, with a further 200 expected to complete their training course prior to the end of this year, which will bring numbers in the Garda service, having regard to retirements, to approximately 13,500 by the end of this year.  Many of these new recruits have been given responsibilities in the Deputy's constituency of Limerick.  </p>  <p>  On the specific issue of Newcastle West, I assure the Deputy that the works on the Garda station in Newcastle West is a key component of the Garda station building and refurbishment programme, which is an ambitious five-year plan which will benefit Newcastle West, Limerick and other areas.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of Public Works, OPW, are working closely to progress the works and to ensure adequate accommodation for the Garda in the meantime, considering the challenge of being a member of the force.  The works are estimated to take 18 months following the completion of the tender and procurement process.  They will be completed at the earliest opportunity throughout 2018 and I am sure that we will have the opportunity of revisiting this issue as the works progress.</p></speech>

The hospital opened in June 1989 and since then the number of patients presenting at the emergency department has grown substantially.  That particular debate, to which the then Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, replied at the time, highlighted the need to provide appropriate resuscitation and isolation facilities at the emergency department and in particular the need to provide more examination cubicles.  I also highlighted the benefits that would accrue from having a minor operating theatre within the emergency department.</p>  <p>  The layout of the department is not suitable due to the numbers presenting nowadays.  That has been accepted by the HSE and by all medical and nursing clinicians as well.  There has been an increase in the population of the Cavan-Monaghan area, which I very much welcome.  When I raised this issue in 2014, the population of both counties at that time was 133,500 people.  Today, thankfully, it has reached 137,562 people.  I raise the point about population because there is a high proportion of older people in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  It is well above the national average.  As the hospital also provides services for our friends and neighbours from counties Meath, Leitrim and Longford, it has a major catchment area.  Over the years, thankfully, there have been major developments at the hospital and I welcome the provision in 2009 of a medical assessment unit.  A paediatric assessment unit was also provided.  In 2014 an outpatient facility for paediatric cystic fibrosis patients opened and that occurred with huge input from the local community as well.  From 2000 to 2011, a major capital programme was in place in which more than 20 additional beds were provided for the hospital, as well as a magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, unit, a computed tomography, CT, scanner, oncology services and a major expansion in renal dialysis services.  Thankfully, today services are provided at Cavan General Hospital that once one could only access in the tertiary hospitals in Dublin.  </p>  <p>  We welcome the provision of additional services but they pose additional demands on the emergency department.  When capacity is expanded - which I was very glad to support and to work towards achieving - that creates an extra demand on the emergency department.  In the meantime the investment has not taken place in upgrading existing facilities or providing additional facilities.  A number of years ago, the HSE brought the design plans to a very advanced stage on three or four occasions.  There was going to be a major capital investment but each time, it did not happen.  It would have been a very substantial project with additional facilities that everyone would have welcomed.  In the meantime, plans were put in place to have a more minor investment that nonetheless would be very important.  It was a programme that had advanced through planning.  We were told the money was in place but unfortunately it still has not happened.  The smaller project, which would be very welcome, would provide eight more cubicles.  That would be extremely important.  People with family members who have attended and people who have worked in the hospital over the years have told me the extra accommodation - comprising of examination cubicles - would be key in providing a better service to the patients presenting.  I have been told, via replies to parliamentary questions, correspondence with the HSE and meetings with successive Ministers and senior representatives of the HSE, that a resuscitation area is being developed.  Nothing has happened on that, to my knowledge.  I would appreciate if the Minister could give me an outline of what is proposed at present, because nothing has happened so far.  The numbers presenting are increasing on an annual basis.  That is a clear fact.</p><p>The HSE is fully aware that in 2016 approximately 35,000 people presented at an emergency department which lacked adequate facilities to deal with such patient numbers.</p></speech>

I will reply to the issue as tabled and then maybe pick up on some of the Deputy's concerns.  The emergency department in Cavan has been performing well this year.  Performance information from the HSE shows a 51% reduction in trolley numbers at the hospital in comparison with the same period in 2016.  This is a positive performance especially when we consider that the overall public hospital system is seeing growing demand for emergency care.</p>  <p>  This year emergency department, ED, attendances are up nearly 2% overall that is over 15,000 more patients attending EDs nationally as compared to 2016.  In addition, Cavan General Hospital has been performing well in terms of patient experience times in the ED.  Up to the end of August, 72% of all patients completed their episodes of care in the ED within six hours.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, Hospital Group has identified the need for development of the resuscitation area in Cavan emergency department.  Future investment in Cavan General Hospital will be considered within the overall acute hospital infrastructure programme, the prioritised needs of the hospital groups and within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.</p>  <p>  The HSE will continue to apply the available funding for hospital development in the most cost effective way possible to meet current and future needs of the health service.  The new capital envelope announced last week in the context of budget 2018 will be used by the HSE to revise the capital plan for 2018 and will form the basis of the Department's submission for the forthcoming ten-year national investment plan.  Community health organisations and hospitals are all currently in the process of planning for increased demand for health services.  They are developing integrated winter plans to cover the period October 2017 to March 2018.  These plans, including the plan for Cavan General Hospital, have been submitted to the HSE and will be approved before the end of October.  As part of budget 2018 an additional &euro;40 million was announced for 2017 to prepare for and manage the expected peak in demand for our health services over the upcoming winter period.</p>  <p>  A bed capacity review is also ongoing within the Department of Health.  This review is examining key elements of hospital capacity.  The findings of this review will provide a basis for determining the capacity requirements over the next 15 years.  It will also identify the type of capacity needed at a national and regional level with regard to acute hospitals, primary care and community care.  A final report will be published before the end of the year.</p></speech>

If the small project I mentioned were to be provided eight more cubicles and minor surgery could be provided in that accommodation.  That would cost less than &euro;1 million.  That would ease the pressure considerably on the staff in the emergency department and provide better facilities for the patients who are our number one consideration.</p>  <p>  Poor accommodation and inadequate facilities place a huge additional burden on staff.  It saps morale.  I compliment all the staff in all the different disciplines in the emergency department in Cavan General Hospital and throughout the hospital.  They work extremely hard and provide a very good service under very difficult conditions.  A few years ago the HSE stated in a report that the emergency department was not fit for purpose.  In the meantime it has not invested.  The need is urgent.  I would settle tomorrow morning for the smaller project if it got the go ahead and the additional accommodation could be provided.</p>  <p>  It is not acceptable that when people come into hospital and speak to the reception staff, who are under pressure too, the next person in the queue can hear what they are saying.  When we present at an emergency department we do not want to know the name or the details of the person ahead of us or why that person is there.  The least that can be provided to patients is privacy.  It is not possible for the staff to provide that privacy because of the lack of accommodation.  The staff in that department and throughout the hospital are working under tremendous pressure, providing a very good service.</p>  <p>  I have raised separately the need to appoint additional nurses to the hospital.  I hope the Minister will tell the RCSI Hospital Group of the need to have more nurses appointed to Cavan General Hospital.  I had the opportunity to meet him privately on this issue.  Could the Minister of State bring back to him the clear message that I am trying to impart here this evening, namely, the need for that additional accommodation to provide people with the service they need when they present at the emergency department?  The number of patients presenting at the emergency department is increasing annually.  They are not just repeat patients.  That is a significant factor in the assessment of the demand on the hospital.  My colleague and good friend, Deputy Breathnach, who was a very prominent and active member of the old north eastern health board, the HSE forum for the north east and a great advocate for the development of services in Cavan, Louth, Monaghan and Meath shares my concerns about the inadequate provision of emergency departments for the four counties concerned.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would speak to the Minister about my concerns and ensure that the HSE moves to provide additional upgraded accommodation and new facilities at Cavan General Hospital's emergency department.</p></speech>

It is not acceptable that people entering an accident and emergency department do not have a proper room where they can speak one-to-one without everybody else listening to their business.  I have never been in Cavan General Hospital, so I am not sure of its lay out.  I will, however, relay this to the Minister.  I will take on board what the Deputy said about capacity there to build extra cubicles that could assist in the overall administration for people who come into the accident and emergency unit.  With regard to what the Deputy said about the increased population in Cavan, I know people who have moved from Dublin to the Cavan area.  That is happening weekly or monthly.  I have taken detailed notes of what the Deputy said and I will make sure the Minister responds to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I have had a few conversations with him about housing and he has earned my respect.  This is a very problematic area.  The problems are not easily fixed but sadly they have got worse in the six and a half years since I have been here.  I do not agree with the Government's approach.</p>  <p>  My topic is the need to ring-fence all State land currently available throughout Ireland for social and affordable housing.  In certain parts of the country, especially in Dublin and other major cities, there is a lot of land under the control of the State and of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  I do not understand why we would, for example, allow NAMA engage developers to build housing, and finance them to sell units that are unaffordable.</p><p> I do not understand why the State is not proactive about supplying affordable housing.  I am very disappointed that the amount of social housing coming down the line is not enough.  We need about 10,000 social housing units per annum for the next ten years.  We also need a minimum of 10,000 affordable units per annum for the next ten years.  We will not achieve that under the current policy.</p> <p> We face two big problems, the price of land and developers' profit - that is a developer as distinct from a builder.  As the then Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Simon Coveney, told us in December 2016, the local authority on State land in Dublin could have built a three bedroom house for &euro;205,000, that might be &euro;230,000 now, while the figure outside of Dublin was &euro;154,000, which might be &euro;170,000 now.  The truth is that we will not get units through a major developer who has been funded by NAMA on State land for less than &euro;400,000.  It is not happening and it will not happen.  Why will the Government not ring fence the land?</p> <p> I have looked at what happens in Europe.  In Germany, local authorities can freeze the value of the land after it decides to specify an area for residential construction.  The freezing of land values means that the local authority effectively acquires the land at use value.  That is not rocket science.  Our site levy which was invented in 2015 is a joke.  It is too easy to get out of it.  It will not catch anyone with a brain in his or her head.  It is no good for the Minister to increase it from 3% to 7% because it will not catch the developer.  If I had a land bank I guarantee I would not have to pay a penny in tax because I know exactly what I would have to do to avoid it and so too do the developers.  If one has borrowed more than 75% of the money one can avoid most of the tax, which is also the case if one is using the land for anything.</p> <p> This week I was at a launch of a report by Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice and I will mention a couple of relevant points made at that event.  First was that the housing crisis was a direct result of Government policies and second that Rebuilding Ireland failed to address the financialisation of housing.  It said that the market failure must be recognised, the market does not deliver when it should and the prices are too high.  The report says that three out of four homeless people will end up in private rented accommodation.  We are moving towards the private rental market but we have designed it in such a way with REITs and vulture funds that rent is too expensive here.  The average rent for two-bedroom apartment in Dublin is now &euro;1,800, where it is &euro;400 in most cities in Italy or Germany.  I ask the Minister of State, please can we have a change of direction and ring fence land so that State land can be used to provide housing - social and affordable - for the people of Ireland?</p></speech>

He might not realise it but we are actually on the same page on much of this.  People seem to keep missing that.  Himself and many others who are not in government keep mentioning this magic target of 10,000 social houses annually.  We agree on this and have set aside the money that will get us to that point.  Over the next four or five years we will deliver 10,000 social houses annually and we will continue to do so thereafter.  Some Governments might do more, and we might do more ourselves if the taxpayers' money is there, but we are agreed on that figure yet people keep talking as though we are not.  It was recommended by the committee on housing and homelessness, we adopted it, the funds have been set aside for coming years and have been ring fenced in order to deliver, as a minimum, 50,000 social houses.  We are on the same page.  That is separate to affordable housing.  Deputy Mick Wallace wants 10,000 affordable houses also, but we are on very similar territory there too.</p>  <p>  We agree about the use of State landbank and the very important role that it can play in delivering housing, increasing and accelerating its delivery especially in the social and affordable area.  That is what we are trying to do.  The plan places a particular focus on maximising the output of housing on landbanks owned by local authorities, the housing agency and the broader public sector.  This is what we want to do.  We also want to maximise taxpayers' money and its use to drive housing activity for social and affordable housing but also to get private housing back going too.  If we are to solve the problem it must be across all tenures.  The first task was to map the land and track what we had because all the land that was owned by the State was not known, we had to go find it.  In April 2017 we published a list of 1,700 ha of land belonging to the State, 770 of those sites belong to local authorities and about 30 belong to other State agencies.  In total all those sites could accommodate up to 50,000 houses.  This land bank is under the control of housing authorities and given their broader role as planning authorities they are crucial in operationalising social and affordable housing delivery from the sites.  Importantly, in addition to that, local authorities are already working on 11,000 social houses which are part of 700 construction projects.  There are 11,000 social houses in the pipeline which is not enough.  We would like to treble that and add to that further.  A sum of &euro;6 billion has been set aside to drive this and deliver these houses.  Once again, the number of houses which Deputy Wallace seeks and which I seek and which we need are the same and we want them in a hurry.  I wish that we could produce them tomorrow, but we cannot.  The Deputy will see much more social housing being delivered in the coming years.  We have gone from 75 social houses two years ago to 500 last year, to 2,000 social houses built directly this year and nearly 4,000 next year.  Those are figures for direct build.  When one adds in Part 5 acquisitions and other houses, there will be around 6,000 social houses built next year and that does not include leases under the HAP scheme.  It is steady progress.  We all want to get to the figure of 10,000.  I agree with Deputy Wallace.  We will get there but it cannot happen with a switch.  We had to put the plan in place, make it happen and provide the money to do that.  I have also set aside LIHAF funding to open up sites which will deliver social, affordable and private houses.  We have set aside an extra &euro;75 million of funds for LIHAF, which consists of a fund of &euro;50 million for LIHAF and &euro;25 million specifically to open local authority sites in order to deliver housing.</p>  <p>  Anyone who builds houses on State land will have to sign up to a reduction in the price of those houses to the market.  Naturally, if they are being given access to a free site or a low cost site belonging to the State, there must be a pay back in the price of the house which will be passed on in the cost to the customer or in providing access to affordable housing.  We will try to get the maximum from those sites.  We have set aside &euro;6 billion but in order to stretch that it makes sense that when we open these sites we would allow a combination of social, affordable and private housing, by which we can get a lot more houses for everyone which will bring prices down.  We are on the same page.</p>  <p>  NAMA has to work with its debtors.  They have debts to repay.  Everyone knows about those situations for the builders and developers with those debts.  They have to repay those debts and NAMA cannot force them to deliver social housing and sell them for free.  They are entitled to work out their debt on their sites and lands which is what they are doing.</p>  <p>  Regarding NAMA, people with skills will be used in relation to the loan of &euro;750 million.  That is other money that will be used to deliver housing.  Naturally, if that housing is delivered on State sites, there will be payback to the State.  They will not go in and deliver a house which will be sold on the private market without any payback to the State or any nod towards affordability.  It will be dealt with on a site-by-site basis.</p>  <p>  Regarding all the sites which I mentioned, the local authorities have all been asked to bring forward their plans by the end of September so over the coming weeks they are expected to come back to the Department with their plans for each site, showing how they will be developed for affordable and social housing with some private units too.  Those plans have been submitted and are currently being analysed.  There will be much more in this area in coming months and it is a positive development.</p></speech>

In Wexford this year, three local authority houses will be built.  That is three, with a waiting list of 3,700.  The Minister of State needs to give us a break.  It is nonsense.  The Government is still totally dependent on the private market to deliver.  The Minister of State says that no one gets to build on State land without providing affordable housing.  Anyone to whom NAMA has given land has not provided affordable housing.  They are selling four bedroom houses in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for &euro;700,000 each on land that NAMA provided and financed.  NAMA did a deal on loans belonging to the developer Harcourt, known as Project Abbey.</p><p>It sold it, but it took the residential land out of it and boasted to us at the housing committee last year it they would ring-fence it for Government housing.  What did it do with it?  It went back to the same developer a couple of weeks ago and did a deal with him.  There is no way there will be a unit in it for less than &euro;400,000.  They will be a lot more.  We are not going in the right direction.  There is no affordable housing policy at present and there was none in the budget.  Will there be one?  I would like to see it.  There is no way NAMA should be allowed to fund the building out of State land, because every bit of land NAMA has is State land.</p></speech>

That is how we will increase the supply of housing.  We will only tackle the housing crisis by increasing the supply of housing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy listed people whom he said were experts on housing.  They might understand homelessness, but they are not experts on housing, no more than any of us are.  All of us put together have the right solutions.  We are on the same page because we all want to deliver 10,000 social houses a year.  I understand, and the Deputy might not understand, that it takes a little bit of time to get there.  We cannot just say we want it tomorrow and have it.  We have to put in place a plan, allocate the money and make it happen.  That is what we are doing, and we will use State land to do it.</p>  <p>  In the short term, we are rebuilding our housing stock and, trust me, the Government and I are committed to making local authorities central to delivering local authority housing.  That is what they are doing.  They were stopped by other parties, not by Fine Gael, the Labour Party or Independents, but a different party which is not in government now.  We are putting the capacity back in the system to do that.  Deputy Wallace and I agree on that much, but I disagree with him because the NAMA sites are not State lands.</p></speech>

We work with NAMA on key sites and we will use NAMA's skills, but there is a difference in the State-owned lands I am speaking about and those which the Deputy claims are State-owned lands.  NAMA has a duty to the people who have debts to pay back as much debt as possible and that is a separate issue.</p>  <p>  We should try to work together and deliver more social housing where we can.  There is a commitment on the NAMA sites to deliver 20,000 houses.  Some of them are under Part V and some will have more houses.  On some of the sites, more than 10% is being given for social housing.  Either way, what we badly need is more housing in the system because the supply of housing will help us solve this.  We have to rely on the private sector through the housing assistance payment scheme and lease schemes in the short term.  We do not have a choice in the matter if we want houses today and if the Deputy wants me to solve the housing situation today.  We cannot solve it only with social housing, so yes, we will have to use private housing in the short term.</p></speech>

The issue I am raising is about green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments.  The 6,000 or more farmers waiting for their GLAS money are waiting for their 2016 payments, and we are now nearly at the end of 2017.  I am given to understand that a lot of the reason for this is to do with nutrient management plans which have not yet been submitted or have been delayed in being submitted.  There are a couple of issues in this, and one of them that certainly comes to mind for me is there were huge difficulties over the summer and last spring with the portal and computer system the Department was using for accepting these nutrient management plans.  This seems to be one of the main reasons for the delays in getting this done.  This brings me back to an issue we have often raised here, which is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine seems to have some problem with its IT systems and what is happening in this respect.</p>  <p>  We also have coming up very soon the issue of the commonage framework plans, which also are supposed to be submitted or people will not get their money.  As the Minister of State knows, because he lives in a mountainous part of the world in County Wicklow, a lot of farmers on commonage will have to do up this framework plan and submit it.  The plans have to be in by 31 October and yet the portal to submit the plan only opened up on 1 October.  We understand there is a bit of a row going on between private planners and Teagasc, as there was in regard to the nutrient management plans, because the private planners have to get access to it through Teagasc.  There are a lot of problems there, the reason for which is poor foresight, because they were not sorted out in the beginning and worked through.</p>  <p>  I draw the Minister of State's attention to the commonage framework plans.  I am delighted the Minister of State is here because he has a greater understanding of this than the Minister.  With all due respect to the Minister, Deputy Creed, he is from a part of the world where commonage plans are not as common.  As the Minister of State knows, one of the things required for the framework plans is that if, for example, there are ten parties on the commonage they have to come up with a plan, they work together.  They may not all have the same planner, but only one planner has to submit the plan, so they have to co-operate to do that.  Several parties to the commonage may not be in GLAS at all.  There may also be adjoining much of the commonage land big tracts of forestry because the commonage is on a mountain,.  Certainly, in my part of the world that is one of the major problems.  The forest companies will not fence the mountain, so we end up in a situation where people are in a commonage plan where one of the conditions is they must graze the mountain to a certain level.  The people have to put sheep on the mountain to graze it, but the sheep do not stay on the mountain because they go back down through the forestry and away with them.  Despite this, the forestry companies will not fence the area concerned.</p>  <p>  These practical problems are coming up for farmers, and while the plan may look very well on paper, implementing it in reality will be very difficult and many of the farmers are fearful.  They put in these plans and everything looks great, but when it comes down to it, they may not be able to manage it the way it is set out in the plan because much of the mountain is outside of their control.</p>  <p>  The issue which I raise regarding the GLAS payments is a reflection of this.  If, because of the nutrient management plans, we have this hold-up, what kind of a hold-up will we have in future with the framework plans?  The whole GLAS situation is a bit of a mess in this regard.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 50,000 farmers in GLAS and there is an average payment of just under &euro;4,000 per farmer.  This shows an underspend last year of more than &euro;50 million, because &euro;1,000 by 50,000 farmers is &euro;50 million.  What is the possibility of reopening the scheme to new applicants to use up this underspend, which clearly will be there this year again?  We find very few farmers reach the &euro;5,000 spoken about in the beginning as the average payment, and it clearly is not.  The average payment is under &euro;4,000 per farmer.  There is space to open up the scheme to more farmers and allow them in to enhance their income.</p></speech>

It is important to point out with regard to the Deputy's final point, that GLAS is the most heavily subscribed scheme ever run under a rural development programme in Ireland.  The original target of 50,000 participants has been well surpassed such is the popularity of the scheme.  GLAS has a maximum annual payment of &euro;5,000 under the general scheme, with provision for payment up to &euro;7,000, known as GLAS+, where the farmer is required to give exceptional environmental commitments in a limited number of cases.</p>  <p>  GLAS, like previous agri-environment schemes, provides valuable support to participants who deliver public goods and environmental benefits that enhance Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture sustainability credentials.  The scheme delivers overarching benefits to the rural environment and also addresses the issues of the mitigation of the impacts of climate change, the improvement of water quality and the enhancement of biodiversity.</p>  <p>  The scheme supports participants in improving their agricultural productivity and practices in a sustainable manner.  Applications under the first two tranches of the GLAS scheme resulted in almost 38,000 farmers being approved into the scheme in its first year of implementation.  This represented an unprecedented level of participation in the first year of an agri-environment scheme in Ireland.  A further 13,500 participants have been approved under GLAS 3.  Last year, 2016, represents the first full year of payments under GLAS.  To be very clear, only GLAS tranche 1 and 2 participants are eligible for a payment in respect of 2016.</p>  <p>  The scheme is co-funded by the national Exchequer and the European agricultural fund for rural development.  As required under EU regulation, two payments issue in respect of each year, with the advance payment being followed at a later stage by the balancing payment.  In 2016 and again in 2017, the advance payment represents 85% of the annual payment, with the balancing payment being 15%.</p><p>In 2016, advance payments commenced in December and continued to be made on an ongoing basis as cases were cleared.  Over 99% of 2016 advance payments have now been issued and, to date this year, we have paid out almost &euro;150 million under the scheme.  In the majority of the remaining cases, applicants have been advised on a number of occasions of the steps they must take before the Department can process their payment.  In most cases, this relates to outstanding documentation they must submit.  As soon as this is received and assuming everything is in order, my Department will move immediately to make the payment.  After the advance payment, the remaining 15% is paid out at a later stage, and this is known as the balancing payment.  The 2016 balancing payments commenced on schedule during the summer and are also being issued on an ongoing basis.  We have been paying out almost &euro;1 million per week in payments since these payments commenced, and this week expect to pay out almost &euro;1.2 million. </p> <p> The main issue with these payments is the need for advisors to submit a farm nutrient management plan to the dedicated online system.  A plan must be submitted on behalf of each GLAS 1 and 2 participant before 2016 balancing payments and any future GLAS payments, including 2017 advance payments, can be issued.  Plans have now been submitted on behalf of over 80% of all GLAS 1 and 2 participants.  Just over 6,000 plans remain outstanding.</p> <p> This specific figure of 6,000 is what was raised by the Deputy.  These are not delayed payments, as has been suggested.  It is simply not possible for my Department to make these payments because the 6,000 applicants have not met the requirements by not submitting their nutrient management plan.  Over 30,000 applicants have submitted the plan and, hence, received their balancing payment immediately.  We are keenly aware of the need to process these cases and issue the balancing payments without delay.  We have regularly communicated the importance of submitting the plans to participants, the farm representative bodies, the advisers and the media generally in order to generate as much awareness as possible.</p></speech>

I would like the Minister of State to try to deal with it.  The system was to take in the nutrient management plans before March 2017.  The deadline was extended until the middle of June.  It then had to be extended a second time, into July, because the system was not able to take them.  That is what I was told was the reason.  The Minister has not dealt with that.  He is putting the blame on the farmer again.</p></speech>

There will always be somebody who is a little late.  Everybody does not get every wisp of hay home; that is life but farmers have been waiting for their money for a very lengthy period as the Minister of State will acknowledge.  What needs to be acknowledged is that there is a problem in the Department in regard to the IT systems it uses.  I am not blaming the Minister of State, the Minister or anyone else at present but the problem needs to be acknowledged and a solution needs to be found to deal with it.  Every year, some issue or clash arises, or the independent advisers have a row with Teagasc because they do not have access to this or that.  It is the same with the commonage framework plans that are due shortly.  Could the Minister of State acknowledge the problem and assure the House, farmers and advisers that an effort will be made to deal with the matter.</p>  <p>  There is a bit of a hotchpotch within the Department.  Many different people are coming in as consultants working on the computer system and there is no overall system working effectively and efficiently and able to deal with what we all acknowledge is a massive volume of payments.  Farmers are very grateful for the payments.  The system would work very well if we could get it to work better, but there is currently a hold-up.  Blaming the advisers or farmers is not really the way forward.  The Government needs to acknowledge that there is a problem and that it needs to be fixed.</p></speech>

I attended the Agricultural Consultants Association annual conference and was asked about this matter at the end of it.  It was just coming up to the deadlines for area aid applications, in May.  Those to whom I spoke said the workload at that time made it very difficult for them to get nutrient management plans in.  They said everything was running to deadlines of 31 May, 12 May, 15 May or otherwise.  They asked for an extension.  This was nothing to do with the Department's system at that time.  The deadline has been extended several times.  One can see the point on trying to spread the workload.  What has happened since the time in question is that the money is ready to be paid to the 6,000 people in respect of nutrient management plans.  The button, if it is pressed, will not issue a payment until there is a management plan.  It has nothing to do with consultants or the IT system.  It is a matter of acknowledging the problems earlier in the year.  I hope there will be a far higher percentage dealt with when the advance payments for 2017 are being made, assuming everything is right.  The 6,000 need to get the plans in so they can get the balancing payment of 15% and be in a position to receive the advance payment for 2017.</p>  <p>  With regard to the commonage management plans, the portal opened only a month ago.  The target is 31 October to enable the making of the payments and future payments.  Any activity beyond that deadline will cause a delay.  Even if there is an extension of the deadline, the payments cannot be made until the commonage management plans are submitted.</p>  <p>  It is fair that the Deputy acknowledges that the GLAS is huge, including over 52,000 farmers.  The moneys will be fully drawn down over the lifetime of the programme.  The moneys may not all be drawn down on the date the programme ends because of the way payments naturally follow.  We have done everything possible to communicate with all stakeholders the need to get the nutrrient management plans in so payment can be issued.  It is not in the Department's interest to hang on to money any longer than it has to.  I can assure the Deputy of that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900051#AAA00700"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to present this Bill to the House and hope it receives broad support in terms of what we are trying to achieve.  Its purpose is to make it a legislative requirement that there be a statutory declaration by consultants, clinicians and other medical practitioners who receive gifts or donations from pharmaceutical and other companies involved in the health care sector.  These could include medical devices and other technologies.  The purpose is to bring transparency.  Medical practitioners may, at times, receive a gift or some other service from a company that might be providing medicines, therapies or technologies either to the clinician or broader health care sector.  It is a meaningful and purposeful Bill.  I am not alleging that there are diminished standards among the health care professions but I believe it appropriate for gifts worth over &euro;600 to be declared statutorily and that they be registered with the Medical Council.  That would bring transparency and openness to the system.</p>  <p>  As we know, in the years ahead there will be major changes and advances in technologies and medicines, including fourth-generation medicines and orphan drugs.  There will be a major increase in the State's requirement to fund these.  Of course, with that comes a need to ensure full openness in how we assess and prescribe medicines across the health care sector.</p>  <p>  There are some guidelines, including ethics guidelines, in play but they are all voluntary.  If a clinician decides he or she does not wish his or her name to be published, it does not have to be.  Pharmaceutical companies have a code of conduct but if the clinicians decide they do not want to have their name included, that is the way it is.  That is not good enough.  There needs to be full accountability and a proper register established whereby people who receive a gift or another service from a company would have to declare it on a statutory basis, as with Oireachtas Members and others.</p><p>When one looks at health care systems across the western world, significant increases in health spending are evident, in both the public and private health care sectors.  The percentage of GDP spent on an annualised basis will increase substantially in the future.  There are a number of reasons for this and they include advances in medicine, fourth generation medicines, orphan drugs, new technologies and medical devices and the fact that the population demographics in many countries in the western world indicate that there is an ageing population.  With it comes greater costs and, accordingly, a greater requirement for the taxpayer to invest in and fund the health care service.  At the very least, taxpayers should be entitled to know who is receiving a gift or a service from a company that may benefit from the State's investment in purchasing services from it.<br/><br/>Eminent consultants and clinicians who are internationally recognised and may be carrying out wonderful research work in a health care setting carry enormous weight in terms of their influence on the medicines that are prescribed, used and recommended across the western world.  Their endorsement could have a significant impact on a company's profitability.  For that reason, there is always an incentive to induce or encourage by means of supporting a person, either through soft supports, be they gifts or donations, or harder supports such as research funding.  In some cases medical posts in this country are funded by pharmaceutical or medical device companies.  I welcome the philanthropy, given that the State is at times financially stretched.  The posts funded in full include physiotherapists, junior doctors and nurses in some hospitals and health care settings.  There is nothing wrong with this in cases where it is a purely philanthropic endeavour by a company, but it does place people in a very invidious position, not only the individual whose salary is being paid by the company but also the health service in general because the staff are provided by the company.  This issue needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>We must ensure there are clean lines of demarcation and that there is no overlapping or greying of the ethical barriers critical to health care provision.  The Bill will act for the good of health care provision, openness and transparency and ensure medical practitioners will not be subject to suspicion about how they are funded.  There were reports recently that the Health Service Executive had warned that it might stop buying medicines from pharmaceutical companies which do not name the individual doctors and health care organisations in receipt of multimillion euro payments from them.  The HSE recently proposed including clauses in its contracts with pharma companies that would obligate them to identify all payments made.  The head of the HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit wrote to the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, expressing concern about hospitals and relevant agencies &quot;claiming not to know about payments to health care organisations, HCOs, which then feeds into public discomfort or media controversy around the issue.&quot;  There is concern among professionals who are dealing with the companies on behalf of the State and spending vast sums of taxpayers' money for the benefit of patients.  He also warned that the refusal of &quot;individual health care professionals, HCPs, to allow themselves to be identified&quot; made it &quot;easy for the media to point to a lack of transparency.&quot;  It also makes it easier for me to bring forward this Bill and show that it is needed and deserves support.<br/><br/>The head of the HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit also indicated that agreement was needed to ensure companies would no longer be able to make payments to health care professionals who refused to disclose moneys they had received.  He outlined: &quot;The HSE could obviously consider doing this unilaterally but my preference would be to agree the optimal solution and avoid any unnecessary conflict.&quot;  If my Bill is put on a statutory basis and a register is established, compliance will be required and that will resolve all issues and remove potential conflicts of interest in the context of the State negotiating with pharmaceutical or medical device companies to purchase services and products from them for the benefit of the health service in general.  It will ensure a very open and transparent system.<br/><br/>Late last year following an investigation by <i>The</i><i>Sunday Business Post</i>it was claimed that drug companies were funding dozens of medical and nursing posts in some of the biggest hospitals in the country, while almost one third of the HSE's most senior doctors were receiving money from pharmaceutical firms.  The investigation also found that hospitals were unable to account for millions of euro that pharmaceutical companies stated they had paid them.  Hospitals stated they had no sight of many of these payments which were sometimes made to individual departments and organisations controlled by groups of doctors.  <i>The</i><i>Sunday Business Post </i>claimed that more than &euro;17 million had been paid out in 2015.  This figure excludes funding for research and development or clinical trials.  Drug and health care organisations stated they could not disclose what some of the payments were for, citing &quot;contractual obligations and associated confidentiality clauses&quot;.  Some companies are also said to be paying millions of euro in fees to doctors to cover education, travel, speaking fees and payments to sit on advisory boards for pharma and medical device companies.  This issue needs to be addressed.  I hope that with support from all sides of the House the Bill can move through the legislative process and provide certainty.  There is a significant pharmaceutical and medical devices industry in this country and it sits very easily and is compatible with the broad industrial policy of the country in attracting foreign direct investment, as well as major investment and incentives for research and development.  The close symbiosis between universities and industry in general in research and development and scientific trials is all very welcome, but if it is to have international recognition, there must not be any suspicion of involvement in funding trials, clinicians or consultants.  An air of suspicion is enough to cause concern in that regard.<br/><br/>The Bill will require some things to be done by the Minister, including, for example, the establishment of a register by the Medical Council, which is something we would like to see happen.  As the Bill moves through the legislative process, I hope it will not be unduly delayed, given the large sums the taxpayer is spending on drugs, medical devices and other pharmaceutical products from companies located in Ireland and across the globe.  I hope we will proceed in a timely fashion.<br/><br/>Drug firms are paying salaries in children's hospitals.  Earlier this year the <i>Irish Independent</i>reported that drug companies were paying the wages of a significant number of staff in the country's children's hospitals.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin which has been in the eye of the storm over waiting lists for scoliosis patients confirmed that pharmaceutical companies paid for a nurse and a health and social care worker who are doing wonderful work.  I welcome the philanthropic approach of companies, but we must ensure no suspicions are raised about the companies in question.<br/><br/>A spokesman for Tallaght Hospital which incorporates the National Children's Hospital has also confirmed that there are three junior doctors and two nurses whose salaries are funded by drug companies.  He has said they are involved in research and that some of the doctors also participate in the regular on-call rota.  The companies are Merck, Pfizer and Sanofi.  All of the staff are paid according to HSE pay scales.  This shows an intertwining and an interdependence.  For that reason, we must address the issue.</p><p>Children's University Hospital, Temple Street has indicated that three posts are funded by drug companies.  They include a senior physiotherapist, a consultant and a research nurse at the national centre for inherited metabolic disorders.  All the part-time posts are research-based, according to the spokesperson.  The part-funding of the senior physiotherapist post is for assessment and input into treatment of children undergoing enzyme replacement therapy.  It has contributed to research nationally and internationally.  This is critical.</p> <p> I am attributing nothing to any of the posts in the sense that there could be any conflicts of interest.  However, what is most important is that no one else could.  A statutory register would address all those issues.  That is why I am presenting the Bill.</p> <p> I am also presenting the Bill because clinicians approached me and asked me whether I would sponsor a Bill.  They were concerned that the situation was undermining their professional integrity and the integrity of research and development.  I am seeking clear stated lines of demarcation, barriers that cannot be greyed or frayed away at the edges.  We need full confidence in our clinicians, in prescribing and in research and development.  That is why I brought the Bill to the House.  I was asked by eminent principled consultants to do so.  These medical practitioners expressed concern that this could undermine the integrity of the profession if it were allowed to continue and evolve over the years.</p> <p> Another issue that will have to be addressed is the way we fund all these drugs, including orphan drugs, fourth generation drugs and other high-tech advances in years to come.  That is for another day but it has to be done soon.  Otherwise we will have a situation whereby we will continue to have patient advocacy groups lobbying - begging, effectively - for the State to fund drugs that could have a major impact on their lives.  We have to discuss those issues with the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics as well as how we assess and fund drugs now and in future.  That is for another day but it has to happen quickly.  In the meantime, I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900053#CCC00300"><p>The Minister for Health will be here shortly.  On behalf of the Minister, I wish to thank Deputy Kelleher for introducing this important legislative proposal.  The Minister supports the reading of the Bill for a Second Time.  He agrees with the overall objective of the Bill, which is to provide transparency regarding any funding or supports to medical practitioners by either medical device suppliers or pharmaceutical companies.  Such transparency is ultimately aimed at protecting the public.</p>  <p>  My Department has examined the Bill, as drafted, and on the basis of this examination the Minister has some concerns.  He believes it needs considerable rewording to fully achieve our shared objectives.  Primarily, he believes that the provisions should not only apply to medical practitioners but to other health care professionals, including nurses, pharmacists, dentists and other health and social care professionals.  He believes they should also apply to health care organisations, especially hospitals.  We wish to develop the optimum legislative solution to achieve our shared objectives.  The Minister and the Department will work with Deputy Kelleher to achieve the best result for the public, one that provides transparency on the transactions between medical device suppliers or pharmaceutical companies with all health care providers.</p>  <p>  The ongoing collaboration between industry and health care providers through research and clinical trials has delivered numerous innovative medicines and has changed the way diseases impact on patients and their lives.  This has been achieved through the continued sponsoring of research and clinical trials by the industry and through supporting the development and understanding of new treatments for the management of diseases.  Government does not want to negatively impact on such partnerships.  Rather, the main objective of the legislation is to ensure that there is full transparency on transactions, in turn ensuring that industry and health care providers adhere to the highest standards of ethics, with the public interest and patient safety being central at all times.</p>  <p>  The OECD in report from January this year, Tackling Wasteful Spending on Health, noted that more transparency in the financial relationships between industries and health care providers is increasingly promoted by self-regulation.  Initiatives include the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations code of conduct, to which the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association subscribes.  Some countries have introduced so-called sunshine-type regulations, which require that payments by industries to stakeholders be systematically reported to authorities.  In the United States, for example, industries must report relationships between pharmacists, physicians and teaching hospitals.  In France, disclosure under similar legislation, covers ties with all health professionals and associations representing them, scientific societies, patients' associations and the press.  The broader approach which addresses industry supports to all health care professionals and health care organisations could be the ideal solution for Ireland as well.</p>  <p>  The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations requires disclosure by its member companies for prescription pharmaceuticals.  As a member of the federation, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, which represents 44 international research-based companies, has adopted a transfers-of-value voluntary pharmaceutical code.  Since 1 January 2016 the code obliges members to make publicly available information relating to donations, grants and sponsorships to health care organisations and health care professionals.  The association provided &euro;30 million to Irish health care organisations and health care professionals in 2016.  However, health care professionals may refuse to allow disclosure of their details under the code pursuant to data protection legislation.  In such circumstances, pharmaceutical companies disclose only aggregate data, but this does not provide transparency.  Each company is, however, required to indicate the number of health care professionals included in the aggregate disclosure.  Given that data on financial and other supports to all health care professionals and health care organisations is in the possession of the pharmaceutical companies and medical device suppliers that provide the supports, it would be useful to investigate whether it would be possible for data protection problems to be overcome in the interests of the integrity of the industry, the public good and patient safety.  It is important that industry transactions with providers of health care meet the highest standard of integrity that patients, governments, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders expect.  We must assure the public that such relationships do not influence clinical decisions and that patients can trust their health care provider to recommend treatment or administer appropriate care, based solely on clinical evidence and experience and in the best interests of the patient and patient safety.</p>  <p>  The advertising of medicinal products is already governed by a combination of legislation and self-regulatory codes of practice.  The principal regulations are the Medicinal Products (Control of Advertising) Regulations 2007, which implement parts of the European Pharmaceutical Directive 2001/83/EC.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority is responsible for monitoring the advertising of medicinal products and enforcing these regulations.  The authority is increasingly active in pursuing cases arising out of breaches of the advertising regulations.  Increasingly, the authority monitors advertising practices through social media.  In addition, the general laws concerning advertising and commercial practices are set out in the Consumer Protection Act 2007 and the European Communities (Misleading and Comparative Marketing Communications) Regulations 2007.</p>  <p>  We must ensure that all proposed new legislation works in harmony with existing legislative provisions.  Under pharmaceutical legislation it is prohibited to supply, offer or promise gifts, advantages or benefits-in-kind to health care professionals in the course of promoting medicinal products.  Health care professionals are also prohibited from accepting such items.  The prohibition does not apply to the transmission of information or educational materials or to items of medical utility, which will be permitted in certain circumstances.</p><p>A pharmaceutical company may provide support in the form of educational, research or employment grants and donations or sponsorship of medical equipment for the betterment of patients.  The provision of such support must not be conditional on the prescription, supply or use of the company's products or be linked in any way to promotion.  The support must be modest, reasonable and in proportion to the scale and scope of the institution receiving it.  Given that strong legislation is already in place, we need to consider carefully whether enhancing pharmaceutical and medical device legislation may be a better approach to achieving our shared objectives.</p> <p> The HSE does not centrally hold information on transfers of value.  However, under its code of standards and behaviour, the consultant contract and the ethics Acts are the bases under which individuals must refrain from any activity which causes a conflict of interest.  It has noted, however, that it would welcome full transparency on transfers of value.</p> <p> The Medical Council's Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics sets out the standards for the conduct for doctors regarding gifts or payment by pharmaceutical companies.  The guide states that if doctors are paid directly or indirectly by pharmaceutical, medical device or other commercial companies or organisations to conduct medical research, they must make sure that the payment does not influence their study design or interpretation of research data.  They must also address any potential conflict of interest and disclose the payment in any publication of research results.  It also states that doctors should not accept gifts, including hospitality, from pharmaceutical, medical device or other commercial enterprises.  This does not prevent doctors from attending educational meetings or receiving payment of reasonable fees for professional services to commercial enterprises.  If they are involved in any way in promoting or endorsing specific health care products or services, they must declare any financial or commercial interest they have in the organisation or company providing the products or services.  It is important that any legislation is aligned with current oversight by the Medical Council.  For this reason, the definition of gift and the value given in the proposed Bill of anything in excess of &euro;600 should be especially scrutinised.</p> <p> We must ensure that this proposal does not place an unnecessary administrative burden on the Medical Council or indeed on other professional regulators if it is decided that the legislation should be extended to other health professionals making annual declarations.  The Medical Council has a challenging role in regulating almost 21,800 medical practitioners and in promoting good professional practice among doctors in the interest of public health.  It also deals with complaints which may be escalated to its fitness to practise committee, which may result in medical practitioners being removed from the register.  It currently has difficulties managing the volume of complaints received.  The council must enhance its role in relation to professional competence of doctors and it must also, with the enactment of the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Act 2017, check that all medical practitioners, on application, are placed on the council's register and have minimum levels of indemnity cover on annual renewal of registration.</p> <p> There are no costs to the Exchequer in the proposal.  However, additional resources will be required by the Medical Council to administer these new functions.  Since the council is self-funding, it will have to generate any costs required to implement this proposal from the fees paid by registrants.  It may need to increase fees, therefore, subject to ministerial approval, to introduce a system that collects and processes the information received.  Some of the other regulators which are not self-funding would require Exchequer funding to implement the proposals.</p> <p> The definitions and terminology in the Bill will need considerable amendment to avoid misinterpretation and to be consistent with current definitions in legislation.  For example, we are unsure whether the term "medical equipment" is meant to cover medical devices only, which are already clearly defined in existing legislation, or if it is meant to cover something broader than medical devices.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, has just arrived.  While he is supporting the Bill being read a Second Time, he is also pointing to the significant work that needs to be undertaken before the Bill proceeds further.  We should first explore whether the data protection provisions currently preventing pharmaceutical companies from publishing data on transfers of value can be overcome in the interest of the public good.  If not, a similar problem may arise for regulators with this current legislative proposal.  We also need to check whether pharmaceutical and medical device legislation would provide a better route to achieving our objectives.  We are committed to working with Deputy Kelleher on this important proposal to curb ethical violations in the health sector and to contribute to patient safety.  We look forward to keeping the House informed of developments in addressing our shared objectives.</p> <p> I apologise for my husky voice.</p></speech>

I am glad to say that Sinn F&eacute;in will support it.  I have not been in this line of work for long but I am learning that a short Bill can do more than a very lengthy Bill.  This is the case with this legislation.  It is a good and fair idea that medical practitioners declare any income or gift received from medical suppliers, pharmaceutical companies or any other source.  I think Deputy Kelleher was very clear that this is not, and I do not believe, that this is meant to punish practitioners.  It seeks to ensure transparency for gifts or bursaries provided to medical practitioners in order that the Medical Council and public can be aware of a situation which may arise wherein certain medical suppliers or pharmaceutical companies are overly generous, for some reason, if we can use that term.  Any measure which improves transparency can only be considered progressive, especially when it comes to transparency regarding gifts, moneys etc.</p>  <p>  Given the sensitive nature of health care, we must ensure that it is open and transparent at all times and that there is no perception of conflicts of interest.  It is particularly important for the public and other medical practitioners to know that no conflicts of interest are at play.  In March, Deputy Kelleher said that he tabled this Bill because some eminent clinicians had come to him and expressed concern that the issue of pharmaceutical companies interacting with clinicians and supporting them in a meaningful way is becoming more pervasive not only in this country but across the western world.  I agree with Deputy Kelleher, and since this Bill passed First Stage, a number of clinicians have raised concerns about the granting of gifts as a possible problem with regard to medical suppliers and pharmaceutical companies.  There need to be clear lines of demarcation and no overlapping or greying of ethical barriers critical to health care.  The fact that this is being supported and driven by medical practitioners themselves is worth noting.  Health care must be administered in an ethical manner where there is trust between both parties.</p>  <p>  Both Sinn F&eacute;in and I support this Bill and its aims.  However, we will seek clarity in areas on Committee Stage and we may seek to make some amendments, although the intention would be to improve the Bill where we can in a spirit of collaboration.  A problem I have is that the amount specified is &euro;600, but it may be the case that an individual receives multiple gifts, bursaries or whatever the term might be, each to the value of &euro;599.  We could have a problem in that regard, but I am not convinced that it is one we cannot overcome.  I think it would be easy enough for us to get over that.  There may be a need for some amendments, which we will table.  The legislation may defeat its own purpose if gifts in excess of &euro;600 in one year could be given as long as no single gift exceeded &euro;600 by itself.  We can keep an eye on that and, given that we all intend to work together to ensure that this can be done, I do not think that any of those problems are insurmountable.  We will table amendments and work together as is appropriate.</p>  <p>  I hope that something can be done for medical practitioners who have to attend countless conferences and purchase numerous different pieces of equipment from year to year to ensure that they do not suffer, are able to upskill and have access to the most modern equipment.</p><p>However well intentioned the pharmaceutical companies are, and nobody is ascribing anything other than an altruistic motive them, it is not acceptable that they would be funding posts within the health service or, indeed, that they fund doctors, nurses and medical practitioners to avail of important conferences that they need as part of continuing professional development, CPD.  There is a role for the State in that regard and we should be supporting our clinicians and medical practitioners more.</p> <p> I go back to the earlier point that this is being driven by clinicians and they would not be raising this issue in order to effectively hamper themselves.  Clearly, they need access to CPD and to conferences.  They need access to interaction with their peers, which is extremely important.  If that is being facilitated by outside sources we need to look at how best we can support medical practitioners outside of the help that they get from pharmaceutical companies.  The State will have to step up to the plate in this regard.</p> <p> Overall this is a good Bill and we in Sinn F&eacute;in are happy to support it.</p></speech>

I also welcome the positive response from the Minister and from Deputy Louise O'Reilly on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.  With collaboration, we can get this legislation passed.  It is meaningful in that it seeks to clear up the relationship between drug companies and medical practitioners to ensure that there are no beneficial rewards going to drug companies from clinicians.</p>  <p>  Clinicians themselves would greatly welcome this.  Statutory declarations are nothing new.  We have been subject to them for many years.  It has very much helped clear up the understanding that politicians in receipt of donations declare them and get on with their work without being beholden to anybody.  The medical profession would welcome this clarity as well, particularly when a person such as Profession Michael Barry expresses concerns.  Professor Barry believes that it influences prescribing patterns at present and he also has great difficulty where clinical leads are in receipt of any payments.  I do not have any issue with drug companies making philanthropic donations to fund doctors or nurses, or whatever they want to fund, as long as it is upfront, declared and is for a hospital body as opposed to a specific clinicians who may have influence on prescribing patterns.</p>  <p>  While I have the opportunity and while the Minister, Deputy Harris, is in the House, I would like to raise the issue of biosimilar projects, which I mentioned last week in the Minister's absence.  I was under the impression that we needed a legislative change but the Minister has written to me since to clarify that there is no need for it.  However, I would draw the Minister's attention to two products that are available at present.  Enbrel is used for arthritis.  There are 14,000 boxes a month being prescribed.  It is a useful and effective drug.  In recent times, there have been two biosimilars.  One, Benepali, is available in this country.  There are 56 boxes of that prescribed a month, versus 14,000 Enbrel.  The different in cost at present is approximately &euro;120.  Multiple &euro;120 by 14,000 by 12 and one will get the figure of a potential saving in the system.  This morning I met the PKU Foundation trying to approve the use of the drug KUVAN and the cost is infinitesimal compared to that.  We are looking for savings.  We are looking for money to fund new endorphin drugs and maybe the solution is before us if we investigate it thoroughly.  As the Minister will be aware, I am a practising pharmacist.  A similar process happened with generic products many years ago.  It was resisted repeatedly and now generic products are part and parcel of prescribing and pharmacy.  They have brought about significant savings and that is as it should be.  The companies that said they would go out of business have not done so and they are competing and maintaining their market share.  That is something that we should be mindful of.</p>  <p>  In working to pass this Bill, transparency, good prescribing practices and good value for money should be to the fore.  It is the taxpayer who is paying for it.  It is the HSE, using taxpayers' money, that is paying these bills and therefore they should be fully transparent and open to scrutiny.  Everybody would be happy with a situation where there was a guarantee that this was happening.</p>  <p>  I accept that there are issues with the Bill as drafted that need to be amended and my party will work with the Minister along with the other parties to ensure this happens.  I commend this Bill, along with my colleague, Deputy Kelleher, to the House.  I look forward to a speedy resolution and getting the Bill into Committee Stage and getting it passed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2017-10-19a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017101900055#EEE00300"><p>I thank Deputy Kelleher for bringing forward this important legislative proposal.  I commend the Deputy on his work in this area and assure him that I and Government will support the reading of this Bill for a Second Time.  In doing so, I caution that, as has already been recognised by Deputy Kelleher, we need to do a good bit of work to tease through the Bill before it proceeds to the next Stage.  I note the Deputy is open to having a kind of pre-legislative scrutiny stage at the Committee on Health where, I think, we can work through the detail.  That would be important.</p>  <p>  The Government fully subscribes to the objectives behind the Deputy's Bill, which are primarily to protect the public.  I am committed to working with Deputy Kelleher, Deputy Brassil and Members of this House to come up with more workable solutions to achieve full transparency in funding and supports provided by either medical device suppliers or pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers and healthcare organisations.  That phrase "full transparency" is appropriate.  Nobody here is trying to shut down a source of funding or support.  It is about ensuring that any funding or support received is fully transparent.  Deputy Brassil correctly stated that those of us in this House are rightly subjected to that level of transparency.  Many in public office and positions of public influence are rightly subjected to a degree of transparency.  It is important that such transparency which, as Deputy Louise O'Reilly correctly stated, is so often wanted by clinicians, is clearly put in place in a consistent manner.</p>  <p>  As I am obliged to do, I will outline some of the areas that we need to clarify as we further scrutinise the Bill.  We need to look at the Bill being clearer in its definitions so that we have a definite idea of its scope.   For example, does "medical equipment" mean "medical devices" or is it broader?  As the Bill is currently drafted, its scope relates to medical practitioners only.  However, we know that dentists and some nurses also prescribe medicines and that pharmacists play a key role in the delivery of healthcare.  We can have that debate and tease out those issues.  The inclusion of other professional regulators will be required for this purpose and the logistics and costs of that will have to be assessed.  Furthermore, healthcare organisations also receive funding and support from industry and in order to be comprehensive and equitable, the Bill should also deal with these recipients.  Therefore, while I support the general thrust of the Bill because I agree with its overall objectives, I believe there is potential to broaden its scope to achieve full transparency.</p>  <p>  We must aim for full transparency on all transactions between industry and healthcare providers in order to assure the public that the relationship between the respective parties does not influence the clinical judgment or clinical decisions.  The public must have full confidence that healthcare providers prescribe treatment or administer appropriate care based solely on the clinical evidence before them and that they do so also with patient safety and the health and welfare of patients as the overall motivation.  I have no doubt that is the overall motivation for the overwhelming majority of those working in the health service.</p>  <p>  The Medical Council and other professional regulators are already working to protect the public.  In addition to complaints and fitness to practice their role has already expanded in terms of the development of professional competence schemes and providing assistance to individual medical practitioners to ensure that their practice meets the highest standards.  Enforcement of this current proposed legislation will add a further challenging workload to the council, when there may be an alternative route to achieve the same end-point through other legislation.</p>  <p>  Legislative scrutiny, as I have said, needs to take place on the Bill to investigate what is the best form of legislation to achieve our overall shared objectives.  While the OECD reported that most countries rely significantly on self-regulation to prevent inappropriate business practices between the industry and providers, there are some examples of countries, such as the USA and France, where legislation has been successfully enacted to address these issues.</p><p>Other countries have done this already and it is for that reason that I support Deputy Kelleher's Bill.  However, I have cautioned that we need to collectively examine it carefully, to explore how best the legislation can be framed to achieve the ultimate aim of full transparency in relation to the transactions between industry and the providers of care.  We owe it to the public to develop robust legislation.  The efforts of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association in relation to voluntary disclosure of transfer value should be acknowledged but this has only been partially achieved due to data protection impediments.  Legislation in other jurisdictions should also be examined in order to ensure that we achieve the absolute optimum outcome.</p> <p> I sincerely thank Deputy Kelleher for bringing forward this Bill which moves on this process.  We have been talking in this House about doing something in this area for a long time and Deputy Kelleher's Bill is an honest and decent attempt to do so.  I look forward to it being scrutinised by the Oireachtas Committee on Health and then seeing this legislation progress through both Houses.  I hope we can work in the spirit of co-operation and collaboration to bring about the best legislation and to arrive at a point where we can inject full transparency into this area, which is what we all want.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, Deputy Louise O'Reilly from Sinn F&eacute;in and my party colleague, Deputy John Brassil, for their contributions to this discussion.</p><p>It is important to point out that when we bring forward legislation, we do so in the interests of the public good.  This debate has focused on the issue of how clinicians, medical practitioners and prescribers interact with the broader industry.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  It is a good and healthy situation that we have a critical mass of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies in this country which interact with universities, colleges and hospitals in the context of research and development.  That has brought about a transformation in both medical technologies and medicines.  If one takes the research conducted across the globe in recent years into cancer, we can now treat some cancers that were untreatable only a few years ago.  The same is true of treatments for HIV, hepatitis and so forth.  Profound changes have been brought about by pharmaceutical companies interacting with colleges and research institutes across the globe.  Such interactions have resulted in the development of transformative medicines that can change and save lives.  It is a positive thing and all we are asking for is transparency to ensure that nobody could have suspicions or undermine the credibility of the research and innovation that is taking place across the globe.  Obviously, in the Irish context, we can only address it legislatively here.</p><p>This Bill was prompted by clinicians who approached me, asked me to raise this particular issue, sponsor legislation and bring it to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  They wanted to get the debate going and I thank the Minister for his contribution to that debate.  If we could shepherd this Bill through the legislative process by commencing the pre-legislative scrutiny process and using the resources and knowledge within the Department as well as in the Attorney General's office to improve the Bill, I would be delighted and will be happy to assist in any way.</p><p>As I said earlier, philanthropy is a good thing.  Just because a company is sponsoring a nurse or doctor does not mean that there is anything untoward happening.  However, it should be up-front and declared.  To move away from the legislation slightly, I wish to refer to the advances that have been made in medical technologies and medicines and the great challenges facing the State in the coming years in terms of funding those medicines.  In that context, we will have to broaden our discussion of how we assess and fund new medicines and medical technologies.  While the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCP, under Dr. Barry does its job, we need to look at the assessment of drugs for rare diseases.  Other countries seem to use a different system of assessment and funding and there is a European dimension to this that we must begin to embrace.  I know that the Minister is examining that concept but we must be more proactive in how we embrace advanced, innovative medicines and in terms of how we assess and reimburse them.  That is an area where we are beginning to drift.  That is not a criticism but an observation.</p><p>I know the State has limited resources.  Decisions on reimbursement are made by the NCP which has its own guidelines.  Reference must also be made to the HSE's corporate pharmaceuticals unit which enters into negotiations with pharmaceutical companies and may or may not reimburse.  Then we have advocacy groups who literally have to come to the gates of this D&aacute;il to try to prise the system open to allow certain drugs to be reimbursed.  We have to be more open in how we conduct that assessment process.  We need meaningful assessments that can be viewed in an open way.  I will always accept that there are commercial sensitivities involved but it seems that other countries can do this in a more meaningful way that allows them to deliver drugs to patients in a more timely manner.  If countries which have a smaller GDP<i>per capita</i>than ours can fund these drugs, why can we not do so?  We are cutting edge in many areas but in recent years we have slipped back to a certain extent in embracing new, modern, innovative technologies and drugs.  It is an issue for another day but it relates to this legislation.  We need to have openness and transparency in the context of clinicians, prescribers and those who are recommending medicines in our health system.  Equally, we must have openness on the other side in terms of how we assess and determine what drugs are reimbursed and made available in the health system.</p><p>I thank the Minister for his remarks on the Bill.  I have already referred to the reasons for bringing the legislation forward, some of which would certainly cause concern.  As I said, however, I do not want to suggest that any clinician has engaged in untoward activity.  I simply want to bring openness to the area and some of the professional bodies have also recommended that something be done on this issue.  If the Minister could help us to move this Bill through the legislative process, that would be a good day's work not only for the State and the public purse, but also for the integrity and credibility of our clinicians, the research they undertake, the clinical trials in which they are involved and the prescribing patterns in our health service.</p></speech>
