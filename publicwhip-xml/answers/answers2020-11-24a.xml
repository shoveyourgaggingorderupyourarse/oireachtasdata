The legislation sets out the process to be followed when a development is considered to have been satisfactorily completed, as well as where it has not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority.  </p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2018 made some amendments to the relevant provisions to further strengthen and streamline the taking-in-charge process.  This included that planning authorities are required to have specific regard to previous developments by a developer which have not been satisfactorily completed as well as any previous convictions against the developer for non-compliance with the Planning Act, the Building Control Act 2007 and the Fire Services Act 1981, when assessing and determining new applications.  Furthermore, section 35 of the Act - which relates to refusal of planning permissions for past failures - has been strengthened to empower the refusal of planning permission in situations where a developer has previously left an estate unfinished under one company name and then applies for permission for a new development under a different company name. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to make further amendments to the section 180 taking-in-charge provisions of the Act at this time.</p></reply>

This statement builds on policy for the housing of older people as outlined in the National Planning Framework 2040. It sets out forty actions incorporating six principles from which the strategic planning for housing for our ageing population are derived.  </p>  <p>  An implementation Group, which is representative of the relevant stakeholders, was established to oversee these actions. In addition, four subgroups were established to examine actions from the policy statement under specific work streams.</p>  <p>  The first progress report of the implementation group is published on the websites of both Departments and the Group's second report will be published shortly. </p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;915,000 has been allocated by my Department for 2021 to fund current and capital expenditure on actions arising from this programme and I will be in a position to consider further funding into the future once I have seen the final recommendations from the group.</p>  <p>  The implementation group was scheduled to provide its final report to both Ministers by the end of 2020, however, it was agreed at its meeting in October 2020 to extend the group until March 2021, to take note of the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has had on completing various actions.</p></reply>

For example, The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, that has responsibility for over 70% of all homeless persons nationally has Standards and Facilities Teams to oversee all emergency accommodation and seek to ensure that all relevant guidelines, policies and procedures are complied with. </p>  <p>  The DRHE has an inspection regime in place to deal with complaints and to ensure accommodation is appropriate and safe. This includes engaging with homeless families and individuals on issues arising in their accommodation.</p>  <p>  I understand that since January 2020, the DRHE has carried out 126 unannounced inspections of privately operated emergency accommodation facilities.  Monitoring and inspections are also carried out in accommodation facilities by other key stakeholders such as the HSE and Tusla.</p>  <p>  Guidelines for Service Users in Emergency Accommodation were recently reviewed by the DRHE and issued to clients in private emergency accommodation. The DRHE has assured me that it has a thorough complaints procedure in place, and that each complaint is fully investigated and addressed in a timely manner.</p>  <p>  Separate to the service standards expected of providers via service level agreements, all homeless service providers must meet the requirements of statutory codes, in particular the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and the Fire Services Acts.</p></reply>

In the first instance, it is a matter for housing authorities to bring forward optimum proposals for the delivery of housing on their sites maximising the potential from the suite of delivery mechanisms and Exchequer funding streams available from my Department. </p>  <p>  Supporting these commitments, Budget 2021 provides a record &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing programmes.  This represents an increase of &euro;641m or 24% on 2020. Overall 50,000 new social homes are planned for delivery over the next 5 years, 12,500 of which are targeted for delivery next year including 9,500 new builds. </p>  <p>  I am also providing Capital funding of &euro;468 million specifically to cover affordability measures including two new affordable housing schemes - the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme and the Cost Rental Equity Loan Facility.  These will build on existing schemes to provide more affordable homes to purchase and rent in 2021.  The Services Sites Fund is also being expanded and accelerated to help local authorities deliver up to 6,200 more affordable homes from their land. </p>  <p>  Taken together, this will see a fundamental refocusing towards the delivery of social and affordable housing working with local authorities and other delivery partners.</p></reply>

In providing Capital of &euro;468 million towards programmes that will support affordability, Budget 2021 backed up our intentions to deliver on these commitments.</p><p>From this sum, &euro;110 million was ring-fenced for two new national schemes to designed to deliver more affordable housing the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme and the Cost Rental Equity Loan facility<b></b>to help deliver Cost Rental homes. Both of these programmes will begin in 2021. </p><p>&euro;75 million will be allocated to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage. </p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme. </p><p>In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) facility to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver approximately 350 Cost Rental homes at scale from next year.  This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units.  It will allow cost-covering rents to be set a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants. Further details on the scheme will be announced in due course. </p><p>In addition to these new schemes, I will also progress and accelerate the local authority led scheme to deliver more affordable homes for purchase and rent on public land.  The statutory basis for the delivery of affordable new housing for purchase on local authority lands is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.The broad parameters of this scheme will be as follows:  aimed at first-time buyers who are low to middle households; homes will be subject to a maximum statutory discount of 40% (relative to the market price), and the local authority maintains a repayable equity share in the properties equivalent to the percentage discount given</p><p>Furthermore, &euro;310m is available to local authorities for Serviced Sites infrastructure funding that will support the delivery of up to 6,200 new homes that will be made available under this scheme.  The first SSF project that will be deliver affordable homes will be Boherboy Road in Cork City in early next year.</p><p>The precise eligibility conditions are currently being developed in light of the on-going policy analysis outlined.

This year, we are seeing a reduction in the numbers of people in emergency accommodation. </p>  <p>  Homelessness is complex and causal factors and family circumstances vary considerably as do the responses needed. Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and indeed with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery. Therefore, a whole of Government approach is required in dealing with this ongoing challenge.</p>  <p>  In terms of my own Department's areas of responsibility one of the key issues to be addressed in dealing with homelessness is to increase the supply of housing, particularly for those on the lowest incomes. To this end, the Programme for Government commits to the increased supply of public, social and affordable homes.  In particular, we commit to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000 homes with an emphasis on new builds.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also recognises that many households experiencing homelessness have additional support needs and includes specific measures to address these needs. These include measures to help rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation, the continued expansion of Housing First, with a focus on the construction and acquisition of one-bed homes, and, importantly, ensuring that there are dedicated funding and resources to deliver the necessary health and mental health supports required to assist homeless people with complex needs.</p></reply>

The Act modifies the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2020 to prevent any notices of termination served by landlords, in all but limited cases such as anti-social behaviour, from taking effect in geographical locations and during periods specified by the Minister for Health in Regulations made by him under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 in respect of which a restriction applies on the movement of people outside a 5 km radius of their place of residence.</p><p>The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 8) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 448 of 2020) came into effect on 22 October 2020 and are expected to expire on 1 December 2020.</p><p>The enhanced tenancy protections under the Residential Tenancies Act 2020 are designed to operate when most needed by tenants during times of the most severe restrictions on people's movements. Guidance and Frequently Asked Questions documents - Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants is available on the RTB&rsquo;s website -<i>www.rtb.ie</i>.</p><p>Separately, the provisions of the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 which came into effect from 1 August 2020, provide enhanced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears due to Covid-19 and, as a result, are at risk of losing their tenancy. If a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections under that Act apply. Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021. </p><p>My Department has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords. This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears.

Both of these programmes will begin in 2021. </p><p>&euro;75 million will be allocated to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage. </p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme. </p><p>In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) facility to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver approximately 350 Cost Rental homes at scale from next year.  Added to the 50 Cost Rental homes that will be delivered in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside in Q3 2021, it will accelerate delivery in this new sector in advance of the Land Development Agency's planned future output and the work of local authorities. This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units.  The CREL scheme will allow cost-covering rents to be set at a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants. Further details on the scheme will be announced in due course. </p><p>In addition to these new schemes, I will also progress and accelerate the local authority led scheme to deliver more affordable homes for purchase and rent on public land.  The statutory basis for the delivery of affordable new housing for purchase on local authority lands is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced in June 2018.  Following engagement with the local authority sector, it is my intention to bring forward a number of legislative amendments to underpin this scheme in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill. </p><p>The broad parameters of the local authority led Affordable Purchase Scheme will be as follows</p><p>- aimed at first-time buyers who are low to middle households;</p><p>- homes purchased under the scheme will be subject to a maximum statutory discount of 40% (relative to the market price), with the final price of the affordable homes to be linked to the cost of provision, on a site by site basis, and</p><p>- the local authority maintains a fully repayable equity share in the properties equivalent to the percentage discount given</p><p>Furthermore, &euro;310m is available to local authorities for Serviced Sites infrastructure funding that will support the delivery of up to 6,200 new homes that will be made available under this scheme.  The first SSF project that will be deliver affordable homes will be Boherboy Road in Cork City in early next year.</p><p>It is envisaged that the homes delivered under all of the above schemes will be made available to applicants who meet defined eligibility criteria. The precise eligibility conditions are currently being developed in light of the on-going policy analysis outlined. I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill which will be brought to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) will play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of more affordable housing, as promised in the Programme for Government. The LDA is currently developing 9 sites that have near-term delivery potential for 3,600 new homes, the majority of which will be for Cost Rental and affordable purchase. It is also engaged in the progression of a number of other sites with potential for significant housing output.  In the longer term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which will bring essential long-term stability and sustainability to the Irish housing system.</p><p>Other measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable. </p><p>An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021.

Because of the nature of the URDF programme the proposals are very complex, and each will require detailed assessment.  </p>  <p>  The assessment process is presently under way.  It is intended that a new tranche of approved proposals, which will augment the existing pipeline of projects from Call 1 and contribute to the achievement of Programme for Government commitments and the objectives of the National Planning Framework and Project Ireland 2040, will be announced before the end of the year.</p></reply>

The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing, including the development of a Cost Rental model.</p>  <p>  Cost Rental is housing where the rents cover only the costs of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes. It represents a new form of rental tenure for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Cost Rental is intended to complement social housing in building mixed, sustainable communities. Work to outline the consistent and sustainable delivery of Cost Rental at scale has been undertaken through an inter-departmental multi-agency Cost Rental Working Group.  It is also being assisted by an external research project sponsored by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2021 some &euro;35m was allocated to the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver approximately 350 Cost Rental homes next year. The CREL will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units.  Added to the 50 Cost Rental homes that will be delivered in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside in Q3 2021, this scheme will accelerate delivery in this new sector.  This is in advance of the Land Development Agency's planned future output and the delivery of local authority Cost Rental homes. </p>  <p>  The initial Cost Rental pilot projects currently under development are located in densely populated urban centres where rental affordability pressures are particularly acute and where State resources can have the biggest impact in assisting people who are paying highest rents.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that these homes, supported by Government investment, will be made available to applicants who meet defined eligibility criteria. The precise eligibility conditions are currently being developed in light of the on-going policy analysis outlined. Any Cost Rental conditionality will be set in advance of the completion of the first projects, and any necessary legislative provisions to underpin the sector will be incorporated in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p><p>As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of European Union Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p><p>As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link:<i>  .</i></p><p>The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are extremely detailed and technical in nature.

The Department, in consultation with DECC, is endeavouring to finalise and publish the revised Guidelines as quickly as possible.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.

To this end, the Programme for Government confirms that the Government will prioritise the increased supply of social and affordable homes.</p>  <p>  Delivering on these commitments, Budget 2021 provided for an overall investment of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing programmes.  This represents an increase of &euro;641m or 24% on 2020 and the single biggest annual spend on housing by any Government. 50,000 new social homes are planned for delivery over the next 5 years; 12,500 of which are targeted for delivery next year including 9,500 new builds. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 also provided for two new schemes; the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme and the Cost Rental Equity Loan facility.  These will build on exiting schemes and provide more affordable homes to purchase and rent in 2021.  Furthermore, the Services Sites Fund is being expanded and accelerated to help local authorities deliver up to 6,200 more affordable homes from their land.</p>  <p>  Taken together, this delivery sees a fundamental refocusing towards the delivery of social and affordable housing. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commitment is to increase the social housing stock by more than 50,000 over the next 5 years.  Local authorities will play a key role in delivering on this commitment. </p>  <p>  Louth County Council has a strong pipeline of projects projected to deliver 771 new homes in 2020 and 2021. My Department will continue to provide funding and other support to Louth County Council to further develop this build pipeline on lands in the ownership of the Council. My Department will also continue to engage with the Council on the development of new project proposals.</p></reply>

In setting the standards a balance is struck between initial capital costs, reasonable life expectancy and foreseeable maintenance costs during the lifetime of the dwelling. The document also sets out guidance on completion of tender documents, for best cost and programme control.</p>  <p>  Separately and in addition, my officials are compiling standard internal layouts for social housing. This involves the development of quality economic design guidance and sample internal layouts for a variety of house types and apartments that meet the target floor areas.

One of the earliest priorities of Minister O'Brien and I was to secure funding to provide a waiver of commercial rates for businesses impacted by the pandemic, while simultaneously supporting local authorities.</p><p>&euro;600m was allocated by Government to fund the cost of a six-month waiver of rates from 27 March to 27 September 2020. The Government subsequently announced a three month extension of the waiver until 27 December 2020, at an additional cost of &euro;300m.  This brings to &euro;900m the financial support to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates, which is an unprecedented measure that offers support to businesses and certainty to local authorities.</p><p>Full details of payments to date are available at the following link:</p><p><i>  </i></p><p>The local authority budget process for 2021 is now underway. In that context, Minister O'Brien and I recently wrote to each local authority to advise that, in light of the fact that the future trajectory of Covid-19 is unclear, it is not currently possible for Government to make open-ended commitments in respect of commercial rates or other income pressures that may arise in 2021. However, as has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department will continue to engage regularly and constructively with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic and other matters arising. </p></reply>

To strengthen this support, and in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future' to set out how rates would be treated for the remainder of 2020, Government subsequently extended the waiver until 27 December 2020, at an additional cost of &euro;300m.  This brings to &euro;900m the financial support to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates, which is an unprecedented measure that offers support to both businesses and to local authorities. </p>  <p>  The local authority budget process for 2021 is now underway. In that context, Minister O'Brien and I recently wrote to each local authority to advise that, in light of the fact that the future trajectory of Covid-19 is unclear, it is not currently possible for Government to make open-ended commitments in respect of commercial rates or other income pressures that may arise in 2021. However, as has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department will continue to engage regularly and constructively with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic and other matters arising.</p></reply>

With regard to the safeguarding of protected structures, Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 gives primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect architectural heritage by including particular structures on their respective Records of Protected Structures (RPS). Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with any development proposals affecting them.

Paragraph 5.24 of the guidance committed the Department to monitor the emerging shared accommodation sector, with a view to issuing further technical updates of the Sustainable Urban Housing guidelines document with regard to co-living, given the relatively new nature of this form of accommodation.</p><p>Accordingly, my Departmental officials have completed a report on co-living development, which I have carefully considered, having regard to the broader context.  Further to review of the report, my preferred approach is to update the 2018 Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments, Guidelines for Planning Authorities  , to restrict future commercial co-living development with a Specific Planning Policy Requirement (SPPR) for a presumption against grant of permissions for Co-Living/Shared accommodation.  I have now issued a circular advising local authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Office of the Planning Regulator (23/11/20) advising them of this, noting in particular that given:-</p><p>- the scale and location of co-living developments permitted and proposed to date;</p><p>- the need for a local authority-led evidence-based approach, to guide any further provision of this form of accommodation, which may be informed by the Housing Need and Demand Assessment (HNDA) process, which is currently being developed;</p><p>- potential impact on land values if the number of proposals were to continue to increase in the current housing market conditions; and,</p><p>- Government policy and priorities as set out in the new Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo;, with a strong emphasis on expanded social and affordable rented housing sectors;</p><p>I am of the view that there is now a sufficient quantum of co-living units either permitted or subject to consideration within the planning system, to demonstrate and prove the co-living concept, without impacting housing provision generally. </p><p>My officials are now preparing a technical update of the Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments, Guidelines for Planning Authorities 2018,document, solely in relation to the &lsquo;Shared Accommodation&rsquo; (Co-living) aspects of the guidance.  This process will also include requisite environmental considerations.  When this process is complete, the updated document will be issued as Ministerial guidance under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) and will replace the previous 2018 apartment guidelines document.</p><p>Planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are required to have regard to ministerial guidelines in the course of carrying out their functions, and are required to apply certain provisions of the guidelines, that may be stated as Specific Planning Policy Requirements.  The report prepared by my officials is currently available on the Department&rsquo;s website at: <i>www.housing.gov.ie</i>and when complete, the updated apartment guidelines document will be issued to all planning authorities and to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  </p></reply>

This includes &euro;1.3 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to supporting the take-up of Irish Water&rsquo;s Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme   which is intended to provide water and wastewater growth capacity in smaller settlements which would not otherwise be provided for in its Capital Investment Plan.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that Irish Water is subject to independent economic regulation by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities &ndash; the CRU &ndash; which determines the revenue required by Irish Water to meet its efficient operating and capital costs to ensure that Irish Water operates in an efficient manner in delivering its services to customers.</p>  <p>  Therefore, Irish Water brought forward proposals for a Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme, as part of its Capital Investment Plan 2020-2024 to the CRU for consideration. The Programme is intended to support of a number of the National Policy Objectives and National Strategic Outcomes under the National Planning Framework.</p>  <p>  I understand from Irish Water that an allocation of &euro;97.5m for this programme was approved by the CRU. I also understand that projects are now commencing design, and that investment under the Programme will begin to deliver in the coming years. Irish Water is working with local authorities across the country in ensuring the investment supports the growth of identified settlements where these are prioritised in line with the local authority development plans.</p>  <p>  In addition to the major investment delivered by Irish Water, my Department also funds rural water investment under the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme. This Programme supports investment in community based Group Schemes as well as supports for the improvement of wells and septic tanks. The current investment programme is based on recommendations from the Working Group established in April 2018 to conduct a review of rural water services. There is a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group. Strand 1 considered the composition and distribution of funding for under the Rural Water Programme, while Strand 2 is considering the long-term future resourcing of the rural water sector more generally. The issue of wastewater infrastructure in villages not serviced by Irish Water is a matter which the Working Group will consider as part of its work. The Department expects a further report from the Group in 2021.</p>  <p>  It may be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. The team can be contacted via email at Oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

Key to this was the publication of the National Vacant Housing Reuse Strategy  , published in 2018, which contains a range of objectives and key actions to be pursued in partnership with stakeholders and agencies across the housing sector to address vacancy in our housing stock.  The Strategy is underpinned by a number of supports available to owners to bring vacant housing stock back into use including:</p><p>- The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS)assists private property owners, local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in utilising existing vacant housing stock throughout the country.  The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental property.  I have recently announced an increase in the funding limit for the refurbishment of properties from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000. Since its introduction the scheme has facilitated 185 homes being brought back into use and tenanted; and </p><p>- The Buy and Renew initiative particularly focuses on older vacant homes to help tackle the problem of dereliction and improve the appearance of the community with the added value of delivery social housing units.  It provides the option for suitable properties to be purchased rather than leased. Since its introduction it has facilitated local authorities to deliver circa 600vacant properties for social housing purposes.</p><p>In addition, in December 2018 my Department published the Bringing Back Homes Manual for the Reuse of Existing Buildings.Revitalising our main streets through well designed refurbishment of residential units, particularly above shops, could help to rejuvenate smaller town centres and city streets as well as produce more houses. The Bringing Back Homes manual is available to download on the Department's website at:<i></i></p><p>To support this work at local authority level, the Department has secured funding for each local authority to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. The provision of central funding reinforces the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority.

Subject to the suitability of the dwelling for social housing, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or an AHB with the cost of the repairs being recovered from the property owner by offsetting it against the lease payment.</p>  <p>  At end Q2 2020, a total of 185 dwellings had been brought back into use under the scheme across a range of dwelling types, including over the shop properties, former bedsits, city centre terraced houses, and one off rural dwellings.  </p>  <p>  Given the value of the scheme to local authorities and its role in tackling vacancy, it is a key objective to increase delivery under the scheme. I have therefore, increased the current RLS funding limit of &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000 for all properties. I am confident that the increase in the maximum funding available will result in additional output under the scheme as well as having additional benefits in terms of regeneration, employment and investment in local areas.  </p>  <p>  The budget allocation for RLS in 2020 is &euro;10.7 million, targeting the delivery of 150 homes.

The Government has provided a strong national policy response through The National Planning Framework (NPF) and the Action Plan for Rural Development, which identify the need to reverse these trends and revitalise rural towns and villages by attracting new residents. </p>  <p>  Under the NPF, National Policy Objective 15   fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas. It seeks to encourage growth and arrest decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while also highlighting the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns that are under strong urban influence and under pressure from uncoordinated and ribbon-type development.  This is crucial to avoid over-development of those areas. </p>  <p>National Policy Objective 15 is supplemented by National Policy Objective 19  , which aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant overspill development pressure from urban areas, particularly within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, and other remoter and weaker rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining. </p>  <p>The NPF acknowledges that rural settlements are not suitable for a suburban or a high density approach to development and tailored design approaches are needed. The NPF also recognises that in rural Ireland many people seek to have an opportunity to build their own homes.  Under National Policy Objective 18b   my Department is committed to developing a programme with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies such as Irish Water and local communities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages. </p>  <p>  Some local authorities have developed their own guidance, tailored to their own specific circumstances, in respect of clustered development in working towards delivering on the NPF, and in line with objectives outlined in Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies. For example, in 2018, Tipperary County Council published Design and Best Practice Guidelines for Cluster Housing Schemes in Rural Ireland, which   seeks to address difficult challenges faced in providing new viable housing within rural villages that are experiencing population decline and reduced access to services and community facilities. </p>  <p>  Under the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing 2005, planning authorities are required to frame the planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way that ensures the housing needs of rural communities are met, while avoiding excessive urban-generated housing.  Given developments in the interim, including inter alia  , the publication of the NPF in 2018, the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines require updating, in a broader rural development and settlement context. Clusters are one of the key areas for consideration in the context of rural settlement patterns and the viability of Ireland&rsquo;s towns and villages, and provide an alternative to the dispersion of single housing in rural areas.  It is intended to examine clustered developments as part of this review.  My Department has commenced scoping this work and I expect a draft by the end of this year.</p></reply>

In the first instance, it is a matter for housing authorities to bring forward optimum proposals for the delivery of housing on their sites maximising the potential from the suite of delivery mechanisms and Exchequer funding streams available from my Department. </p>  <p>  Dublin City Councillors voted last week not to support the transfer of lands required to progress the proposed development of 853 homes on the Oscar Traynor Road site. The proposal included 253 social homes to be funded under the Department&rsquo;s capital programme. In addition to this, Serviced Sites Funding of up to &euro;8.6m was available to the Council to assist in the delivery of 172 affordable homes on the site. </p>  <p>  This site, together with O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Emmet Road in Inchicore has long been prioritised for housing development by the Council via its &lsquo;Housing Land Initiative&rsquo; and the  approach and tenure mix for the delivery of these homes had been agreed by the Council previously. </p>  <p>  I note that the Council rejected a proposal by members to defer the vote on the issue and to first consult with my Department, the developer selected by the Council and DCC's consultative Group.  Given the decision I requested, and received a report on the matter from the Council Management. It has confirmed that, in light of the decision taken, they will now engage further with councillors as to how this site should be developed. The Council has highlighted that given the complexity and scale of the site it could take some time to develop a new agreed approach. </p>  <p>  It is critical, particularly given that this area has the highest social housing waiting list in the State, that the delivery of a large number of homes on this key site is progressed as soon as possible.  I have encouraged the Council to make every effort to put plans to deliver housing on this key site back on track.</p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of social and affordable housing, five months ago, we launched the Programme for Government, which includes a range of commitments including to increase the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds and to progress a state-backed affordable home purchase scheme to promote home ownership. </p>  <p>  The Government has since backed these objectives in Budget 2021, with &euro;3.3 billion in total funding being made available for the delivery of housing programmes. This overall investment will see the social housing needs of over 28,500 households being met in 2021 - this includes 12,750 new social homes to be delivered through build, acquisition and leasing programmes.</p>  <p>  Capital funding of &euro;468 million was specifically provided to cover affordability measures including a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, accelerated and expanded delivery of Cost Rental and accelerated delivery of affordable housing on Council sites using Services Sites Funding.</p>  <p>  Taken together, this will see a fundamental refocusing towards the delivery of social and affordable housing. </p>  <p>  I would urge Dublin City Council to bring forward realistic and deliverable proposals for the delivery of much needed homes from this site as quickly as possible. My Department will support Dublin City Council in this endeavour.</p></reply>

In making decisions on a planning application the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received from the public and the statutory consultees, and any relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.</p>  <p>  Under Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (the 2000 Act), I, as Minister, am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned.</p>  <p>  Since the new SHD arrangements came into operation up until end October 2020, the Board had received 265 SHD applications and had decided 230 cases. The Board had granted permission in 168 cases in respect of a total of 44,042 housing units (comprising 12,229 houses, 24,839 apartments and 6,974 build to rent), as well as 195 shared accommodation units and 11,934 student bed spaces under the SHD arrangements. Student accommodation, for which there is a pressing need, accounts for just 21% of housing units and bed spaces granted permission with the vast majority of permissions granted relating to housing units.</p>  <p>  Strategic Housing Developments are subject to the social housing obligations as required under section 96 the 2000 Act.</p>  <p>  In relation to housing affordability generally, the total funding being made available for the delivery of housing programmes was &euro;3.3 billion in Budget 2021.  From this sum, &euro;468 million has been specifically provided to support housing affordability measures.  This includes the Serviced Sites Fund, the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and the Land Development Agency (LDA).</p>  <p>  In addition to these programmes, and to deliver on our Programme for Government commitments to provide measures for good-quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, &euro;110 million has been ring-fenced for a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme and a new Cost Rental Equity Loan facility to help deliver Cost Rental homes both of which will begin in 2021. </p>  <p>  &euro;75 million will be allocated to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage. </p>  <p>  To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme. </p>  <p>  In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) facility to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver Cost Rental housing at scale from next year.  Added to the 50 Cost Rental homes that it is projected will be delivered in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside  in Q3 2021, it will accelerate delivery in this new sector in advance of the Land Development Agency's planned future output and the work of local authorities. This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units.  </p>  <p>  The CREL scheme will see financing made available to AHBs on favourable terms to cover 30% of the costs for Cost Rental homes. CREL funding will be provided on similar terms to the existing Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) model which is extensively used by AHBs for social housing. In terms of the remaining 70% of capital costs, subject to appropriate conditions, it is anticipated that long term competitive financing will be made available to the AHBs by the Housing Finance Agency. This will allow cost-covering rents to be set a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants. Further details on the scheme will be announced in due course. </p>  <p>  It is intended to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill.</p></reply>

The National Planning Framework is endorsed in the current Programme for Government, which also includes a commitment towards a &lsquo;town centre first&rsquo; principle, in support of more balanced regional and rural development.</p>  <p>  Rather than introduce new or increased requirements, both the NPF and the Programme for Government underpin pre-existing requirements for residential density.  The National Planning Framework restates the commitment to implement statutory planning guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas, published by my Department in 2009.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas generally require densities in the range of 35-50 dwellings per hectare (dph) on outer suburban/greenfield sites.  The Guidelines also provide scope for densities below 35 dph on more peripheral sites, specifically in smaller towns and villages, in particular to assist in delivering more sustainable alternatives to dispersed rural housing.  These requirements have been established Government policy for a significant period of time, dating back to the late 1990&rsquo;s. </p>  <p>  Given that individual county development plans prioritise key towns, including county towns and many larger towns, for future development with significant population growth targets, achieving densities of 35 dph and over is important in such locations generally. Not achieving such densities means that such towns will become even more spread out and car dependent, with negative implications for tackling climate change and for promoting and sustaining public transport systems or even for the provision of cycling and walking networks.</p>  <p>  Moreover, achieving densities of at least 35 dph is essential in providing housing choice for the more diverse range of smaller households presenting today, including couples who may wish to downsize, creating the flexibility for households to stay in their neighbourhoods/towns as their housing requirements change. Such densities are achievable through a mix of some individual homes, coupled with a significant level of semi-detached and some terraced housing.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to have ongoing engagement with the Local Authority sector, including individual local authorities, on a wide range of policy issues, including those relating to planning, which may include residential density.  While there is scope to further examine density requirements in the context of sustainable settlement, it is my view that current policy is not a disincentive to the provision of appropriate housing developments in our towns. </p></reply>

This legislation requires all local authorities, as a reserved function, to make an allocation scheme which specifies, among other things, the manner of, and the order of priority for, the allocation of dwellings to households on the housing and transfer lists.</p><p>Local authorities assess an application for housing supports from people with disabilities in the same manner as other applications but take account of the specific needs outlined by that person in their application for supports. If specific adaptations are required to accommodate an applicant for social housing supports the applicant submits a report from an Occupational Therapist. There is no system of quotas or statutory based ratios for the allocation of housing to people with disabilities.</p><p>The National Housing Strategy for people with a Disability (NHSPWD) 2011-2016 and associated National Implementation Framework were jointly published by my Department and the Department of Health. They set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities and were developed as part of a coherent framework in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy and congregated settings report. Building on the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to meet the housing needs of people with disabilities, the NHSPWD has been extended to 2020 to continue to deliver on its aims.</p><p>One of the key measures achieved in 2016 under the NHSPWD was the establishment of Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) in all<b></b>housing authorities, to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability at local level.  These are chaired by Directors of Housing in each authority and include HSE and disability representative organisations.  Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local strategies to meet identified and emerging need over the next five years. These Plans, along with the annual Summary of Social Housing Assessments, will allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and will support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing supply mechanisms. </p><p>This is a more targeted and responsive way to meet any actual housing adaptation need identified rather than, for example, designating a specific number of new social housing builds for people with a disability that may need further or different adaptations based on the individual need of the person allocated the home. </p><p>My Department does not collate the information on the waiting list requested by the Deputy. However, details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority area is provided in the annual statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA). The most recent summary, from June 2019 shows that 68,693 households were qualified for, and in need of, social housing support.  Of this number, 4,126 households or 6% were those who had a specific need for housing based on disability. According to figures collated by the Housing Agency, in 2019 there were 2,389 allocations of social housing to households with disability as a primary basis of need. This represents 12% of total allocations for 2019. This demonstrates that local authorities are making progress in meeting the needs of persons with disabilities on the social housing waiting list.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered. </p></reply>

This scheme was limited to providing financial support for homeowners where septic tanks had been subject to inspection by the relevant local authority in accordance with the EPA's National Inspection Plan for Domestic Waste Water Treatment Systems. In particular, the income limits for support under the scheme were abolished and the grant rates increased.</p>  <p>  The Working Group also recommended introducing two new grant schemes to support the attainment of water quality objectives in 'prioritised areas for action' and &lsquo;high status objective catchment areas", as identified in the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021. </p>  <p>  These revised and new grant schemes were introduced by my Department earlier this year.</p>  <p>  In implementing the revised arrangements the Department has undertaken to conduct a review of the grant schemes after one year of operation to ensure their alignment with policy objectives. </p></reply>

This includes the delivery of new social homes through local authority and Approved Housing Body led build, acquisition and leasing schemes and also the provision of key supports to maintain people with disabilities within their existing homes. </p>  <p>  In respect of construction funding, over the period 2016-2019, my Department provided almost &euro;2.1 billion to local authorities to deliver new social homes, including new homes for people with disabilities.  I will arrange for my officials to provide the Deputy with this breakdown by local authority.  The detailed breakdown of housing funding in 2020 will be finalised at year-end. Prior to 2016 housing expenditure was reported on a programme basis, which encompassed multiple delivery streams.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000. Budget 2021 has made available &euro;3.3bn towards the wide range of housing programmes, which will deliver 12,750 new social homes next year, including a record 9,500 new Build homes. These new homes are designed and planned using guidelines, build standards and planning regulations supported by my Department. </p>  <p>  The Capital Assistance Scheme also provides for the delivery of homes for persons with disabilities. In addition, my Department also provides a range of specialised grants, including the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability scheme (up to &euro;30,000) and the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme (up to &euro;6,000).  These grants assist people with disabilities to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out and to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for local authorities to ensure that the number and specific types of dwellings provided in their social housing developments meet local needs. My Department does not hold specific details in relation to the number of individual houses built or procured for persons with disabilities in each local authority during this period.  However, this information should be available from the individual local authorities.</p></reply>

The Government decided on the nomination of the person to whom the Deputy refers at its meeting on 15 July 2020.</p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, shortly prior to the Government being formed Minister Ryan and I, as party leaders, were notified by the T&aacute;naiste that the person to whom the Deputy refers had been recommended as a suitable candidate by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) and would likely be recommended to be nominated by the Government for appointment to the Supreme Court.</p>  <p>  The important point in my view was that the person in question had been recommended by the JAAB which is an independent board, established under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 to identify persons and inform the Government of the suitability of those persons for appointment to judicial office.  The JAAB, which is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes the Presidents of the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court, conducts its procedures independently under the Courts and Court Officers Acts 1995 and 2002.  The JAAB forwards information on candidates to the Minister for Justice who brings a proposal for nomination for appointment to the Government.  The practice is that the Minister for Justice makes one nomination per vacancy to the Government.  </p>  <p>  In the case of the vacancy to which the Deputy refers, the Memorandum considered by the Government at its meeting on the evening of 15 July 2020 was submitted by the Minister for Justice, in the normal way, earlier that day.</p>  <p>  As I have said previously, I was not aware that there were other applicants for the vacancy and, therefore, I could not and did not discuss with the T&aacute;naiste or with other Ministers that there were other judges or the identity of those other judges who had applied for the position.  </p>  <p>  My Department was not made aware of the existence of or the identity of other applicants for the vacancy to which the Deputy refers prior to the appointment a person to that vacancy.  It is not the practice that information on the details of applicants for ordinary judicial vacancies in the Courts are made known to my Department.  My Department would have become aware that there was a recommendation from the JAAB for the appointment in question &ndash; but not the identity of the individual &ndash; when the Memorandum for the Government on the proposal for appointment was circulated for inclusion on the Government&rsquo;s agenda.</p></reply>

The EU-Mercosur Agreement is the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date.  The Agreement covers a population of over 770 million with trade in goods and services valued at &euro;122 billion.  It aims to reduce and, in some areas, eliminate trade tariffs between the EU and the Mercosur region.  </p>  <p>  The Agreement, once ratified, would see a significant reduction or elimination of tariffs and barriers to trade that would enhance trading and investment opportunities between Ireland and the rest of the EU, and the Mercosur region.  It would make exports from Ireland more attractive and potentially increase the demand for Irish product.  In that regard, Ireland exported approximately &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region in 2019 and Irish goods exports to Mercosur have grown on average by 2% annually with Mercosur accounting for 0.3% of total Irish goods exports last year.  It is anticipated that this Agreement would allow Irish exporters to expand faster and open opportunities across a wide range of sectors &ndash; in business services, chemicals, machinery, medical devices and processed food and dairy.</p>  <p>  In January 2020, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, commissioned independent consultancy firm, Implement Consulting, to undertake an Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the EU-Mercosur Agreement following a competitive tender process.  The ESIA will consist of two equally important and complementary components, namely a comprehensive analysis of the potential economic benefits as well as a robust sustainability impact assessment (including social, human rights and environmental impacts) that the trade Agreement could have in Ireland and the Mercosur countries. Wide-ranging stakeholder engagement by the Consultants is a key part of the Impact Assessment.  </p>  <p>  While the European Commission works to finalise the legal texts of the Agreement in a process known as "legal scrubbing", many Member State Parliaments, including our own, have debated the terms of the Agreement as announced in June 2019.  A lot of the debate has concerned the sustainable development elements of the Agreement, and I and colleagues have indicated that enforceable guarantees which strengthen environmental protections, particularly with regard to the Amazon rainforest and climate action, are one of the priority considerations in assessing Ireland&rsquo;s position on the Agreement.</p>  <p>  In this regard, Commission Executive Vice President and Trade Commissioner, Valdis Dombrovskis has stated that the EU is engaging with the Mercosur countries to negotiate an additional text on climate and deforestation as there must be: &ldquo;lasting solutions for the Amazon region&rdquo; before the Agreement is proposed for ratification.  Accordingly, any additional text on the issue of strengthening climate and deforestation provisions within the Agreement will be assessed, and along with the overall ESIA report, will assist our decision-making on the Agreement ahead of the European Commission presenting the Member States with the final text of the Agreement which we anticipate will be in Spring 2021.  I have been clear that additional safeguards are needed for my support.</p></reply>

The COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme makes funding available to eligible businesses that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. </p><p>This scheme was developed in cooperation between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is operated by the SBCI through participating finance providers. Loans under the scheme range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5m for terms of up to three years and are offered at favourable terms compared to otherwise similar lending in the market. These loans are offered at a maximum interest rate of 4% and there is no requirement for security on loans of up to &euro;500,000. </p><p>The scheme features a two-stage application process. Businesses must first apply to the SBCI to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. If successful, they are issued an eligibility reference number, which they can then use to apply for lending with a participating finance provider. Loans under the scheme are subject to the banks' own credit policies and procedures. </p><p>Some of the details requested have not been included as they may include commercially sensitive information or fall outside the scheme's reporting.  The total number of applications for eligibility under the scheme to date (20 November) is 3,999, of which 3,562 have so far been deemed eligible. Of those, 930 have so far progressed to sanction at bank level, to a total value of &euro;119.54m. </p><p>More granular data, including a per-county breakdown, is provided by the SBCI as part of its quarterly reports.

While the Government cannot interfere with the High Court-overseen liquidation process, Ministers have sought at all times to ensure that the concerns of workers are heard and that the State&rsquo;s employment and training services are responding to the needs of workers.</p><p>It is disappointing that the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) facilitated talks did not succeed in agreeing a way forward.  I would urge both sides to re-engage in a constructive manner with a view to finding a mutually acceptable resolution.  </p><p>The Government is supportive of the best outcome that is possible for the workers, within the legal framework available.

There are a range of formal procedures and control mechanisms in place to try to ensure compliance with all relevant national and EU procurement guidelines. The Department, where possible, will try to avail of various centralised procurement frameworks put in place by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) as well as utilising the e-Tenders website and advertising in the EU Journal where applicable.  </p><p>It is the case however, that each year a small number of contracts will be awarded without being able to conduct a competitive process. Reasons for this typically include instances involving sole suppliers, timing issues between the expiry of an existing contract and a new contract being available through the OGP or where a critical and urgent need for service provision arises, such as the purchase of laptops to enable staff to work from home during COVID-19 restrictions. </p><p>Under the Department of Finance Circular 40/2002 all Departments are required to provide a Report annually to the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General and to the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform indicating continued expenditure on contracts valued above &euro;25k excluding VAT, which have been awarded without holding a competitive process. </p><p>In 2019 my Department and its Offices awarded 4 contracts to 3 companies with a value of &euro;25k or more without entering into a competitive tendering process. The overall amount of these awards was &euro;615k inclusive of VAT.  The companies awarded these contracts in 2019 were:</p><p>-  Oracle EMEA, two contracts with a total value of &euro;422k for software licences and maintenance. The original license purchases were by way of competitive tender and the maintenance contracts in question can only be provided by Oracle. </p><p>-  Microsoft Ireland with a contract with a total value of &euro;82k for software licences which are not provided by any other service provider.  </p><p>-  The Sword Group with a contract with a total value of &euro;111k for IT licensing and systems maintenance support for the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland IT system. It relates to a proprietary software system developed by Sword and therefore cannot be maintained or developed by a third party.  The original contract for the supply of the system which Sword won, was competitively tendered.</p><p>For 2020 to the end October, 2020 my Department and its Offices has awarded 7 contracts to 5 companies with a value of &euro;25k or more without undertaking a competitive tendering process.  The overall amount of these contracts is &euro;982k inclusive of VAT. The companies awarded these contracts were: </p><p>-  Evros Technology Group with two contracts and a total value of &euro;131k for critical and urgent purchase of laptops to enable staff to work remotely during COVID-19 restrictions.  </p><p>-  Oracle EMEA with two contracts with a total value of &euro;528k for software licences and maintenance support. As previously indicated the original license purchases were by way of competitive tender and the maintenance contracts in question can only be provided by Oracle. </p><p>-  Arkphire with a contract extension totalling &euro;50k. This Citrix remote access licencing contract was extended for one additional year due to the critical importance of remote access during COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>-  McCann Fitzgerald with a contract value of &euro;133k for legal services in respect of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. The awarding of the contract without undertaking a competitive process was in compliance with the OGP information note on &lsquo; Covid-19 (Coronavirus) and Public Procurement&rsquo;.</p><p>-  The Sword Group with a contract value of &euro;139k for IT licensing and systems maintenance support for the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland. As previously stated this is a proprietary software developed by Sword and therefore cannot be maintained or developed by a third party.</p></reply>

This Bill provided the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine with the necessary powers to enter into a Mandate agreement with the European Investment Fund for a 64% counter-guarantee as part of the Future Growth Loan Scheme, which is a significant part of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit mitigation measures. This application was made given the need for the Bill to be enacted by the end of 2018 so that a longer term investment scheme could be put in place as soon as possible to support Brexit impacted businesses.</p>  <p>  A similar application to waive pre-legislative scrutiny relating to an amendment to this Bill in May of 2020 was also granted by the Committee. The amendment was to allow for an increase in the limit of the aggregate liability in respect of contributions committed by the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This application was made given the need for the Bill to be enacted immediately so as to allow for a &euro;500 million expansion of the Future Growth Loan Scheme as a response to supporting businesses impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Ireland.</p>  <p>  On 29th June 2020, the Standing Business Committee agreed to a request to waive the requirement in relation to pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme/draft heads of the Credit Guarantee Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2020, as amendment to the legislation was urgently required to support businesses to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  An application for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny on the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act 2020 was granted by the Committee on 17th July 2020. This application was sought due to the fact that legislation was urgently required to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the operation of business.

Our response to COVID-19 will continue to assist those businesses affected.</p><p>Budget 2021 provides a significant additional package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. </p><p>These measures are in addition to the July Stimulus, which was a substantial financial package to stimulate our economy worth more than &euro;5 billion, including &euro;2 billion in loan guarantees for the new Credit Guarantee Scheme. </p><p>Budget 2021 is unprecedented in terms of its scale at almost &euro;90 billion. Its purpose is to protect lives and livelihoods of everyone in the state.</p><p>A six-month reduction in VAT was introduced, going down from 23% to 21%, and from 13.5% to 9% which will benefit the hospitality, entertainment and hairdressing sectors, together with a range of additional public capital investment measures to support the domestic economy.</p><p>Also in Budget 2021, the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme was launched through Revenue, offering a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID. As with all support schemes, in designing the CRSS and providing for it in legislation, it was necessary to set appropriate anchor points for eligibility.</p><p>We are investing in a range of working capital and longer term funding options for SMEs, with strong demand for medium and long term finance through Credit Guarantee Scheme and Future Growth Loan Schemes, at interest rates of below 4% p.a. </p><p>The level of assistance now being provided to businesses across all sectors is unprecedented and ahead of that available in other jurisdictions. In moving to the level 5 restrictions, we ensured that we had an appropriate mix of measures in place to support workers and businesses, so businesses can reopen and restore employment as we suppress the virus.</p><p>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about businesses that might not be eligible for the CRSS or other measures announced in the budget, such as the &euro;50 million fund for live entertainment. I have asked my officials to conduct work along with officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, regarding how many businesses might be in this position and to report back to me with proposals.</p></reply>

I am aware that these closures can have secondary effects impacting landlords and I recognise that many landlords have debt repayment obligations as well as other ongoing costs.</p>  <p>  The issue of commercial rents is primarily a contractual matter for the parties involved. However, the Government has urged landlords and tenants to talk to one another and come to some arrangement, as it is in everybody&rsquo;s interest that terms are amicably agreed. Landlords should be willing to do what they can to help their tenants to continue to operate rather than facing the risk of a vacant premises and inability to obtain new tenants.  Equally, tenants should pay what they can and speak with their landlord when difficulties arise.</p>  <p>  On 1st October, I published the Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants for commercial rents, which was developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders based on examples from other jurisdictions. The aim of the voluntary Code is to facilitate discussions between landlords and tenants impacted by COVID-19. </p>  <p>  However, this Code should not be seen in isolation. To date, over &euro;24 billion had been made available in support measures for businesses, including a package of over &euro;7 billion worth of measures as part of the July Jobs Stimulus, and a total budgetary package of over &euro;17 billion announced in Budget 2021 to help those impacted by COVID-19 and related public health restrictions. This further demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the country through this crisis.</p>  <p>  The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) announced as part of Budget 2021 will allow the Government to provide targeted support for those sectors and businesses that have been significantly impacted by the public health restrictions. It will help businesses to meet ongoing costs such as commercial rents, utilities or insurance. It offers financial assistance to businesses that have either been forced to temporarily close their premises or only been able to trade at significantly reduced levels as a result of restrictions introduced in response to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  The relief will operate as a cash payment equal to 10% of the average weekly value of the 2019 business&rsquo;s turnover up to &euro;20,000 and 5% thereafter, subject to a maximum weekly payment of &euro;5,000, for the same number of weeks as the restricted period. The intention of the scheme is to recognise the challenges experienced in particular by sectors that have been most affected by restrictions since the onset of the pandemic in March.</p>  <p>  The full list of supports to help businesses impacted by the COVID-19 crisis is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

I am pleased that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has developed guidelines that can be used for the organisation of wedding functions.  These are available on F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s COVID-19 Business Support Hub at: www.failteireland.ie.</p><p>Budget 2021 provides a significant package of tax and expenditure measures to build the resilience of the economy and to help vulnerable but viable businesses across all sectors. The measures in the Budget include the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme, cash for businesses, low cost loans, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities.</p><p>We have also announced a six-month reduction in the VAT, going down from 23% to 21%, a reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9% which will benefit the hospitality sector.</p><p>The New Covid Restrictions Support Scheme, operated by Revenue, offers a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID.  We are making changes to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the EWSS increasing the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. </p><p>As announced in the July Stimulus, the Enterprise Support Grant was extended to assist eligible self-employed, including sole traders, who exit the PUP or jobseekers schemes to re-start their business. A self-employed person who closes their PUP should send their grant application to their local Intreo Centre to be processed.  Further information is available at www.gov.ie.</p><p>Any person who is experiencing financial hardship may be eligible for other financial supports from the Department of Social Protection. Information on the supports available are at www.gov.ie.  </p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. I announced the reopening of MFI lending on 31st August and I launched the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme on 7th September. </p><p>These measures are supplementary to the wide range of existing loan and voucher schemes available to assist businesses affected by COVID-19 provided through the July Jobs Stimulus and other Government initiatives. My colleague, Minister Catherine Martin T.D., Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, may be able to provide more specific details on a roadmap to recovery for the events and hospitality industry, for which she has lead responsibility.</p><p>I am aware that there are certain businesses which might not be eligible for the CRSS or other measures announced in the budget, such as the &euro;50 million fund for live entertainment. I have asked my officials to conduct work along with officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, regarding how many businesses might be in this position and to report back to me with proposals.</p></reply>

A statutory audit provides stakeholders such as creditors, investors and employees, with an independent opinion on the accuracy of the company&rsquo;s accounts.</p><p>Under the Companies Act 2014, all companies are required to undertake a statutory audit of their financial statements.  However small companies may avail of an exemption from the requirement to carry out an audit. </p><p>The Companies (Accounting) Act 2017 simplified and reduced the financial reporting obligations on small and micro sized companies. It also raised the thresholds for qualification as a small company, so more companies can now qualify for the audit exemption. These upper limits are the highest permitted under EU law.</p><p>To qualify as a small company it must satisfy two of the following 3 criteria</p><p>-  Balance sheet total not exceeding &euro;6m </p><p>-  Turnover not exceeding &euro;12m </p><p>-  Employees not exceeding  50</p><p>Where community co-ops and social enterprises are registered companies then they would be required to adhere to the rules of the Companies Act 2014 and this includes being able to avail of the exemption from statutory audit on the basis of their size. </p><p>If community co-ops and social enterprises do not fall within this segment and there are specific statutory obligations arising for them deriving from responsibilities they assume on foot of receiving public funding from Government Departments and agencies, then the streamlining of audit requirements in this case would be a matter for the relevant Department overseeing the funding concerned. </p></reply>

The total funding allocation of &euro;6.057million represented a 20% increase on the previous year.  This increased funding allocation was provided again in 2020 with &euro;3,740,000 allocated in respect of pay and &euro;2,317,000 allocated in respect of non-Pay. The resources sought and allocated for 2021 remain unchanged.  </p><p><b>Office space</b></p><p>The ODCE resides on three floors of a shared building in Parnell Square. The office space available is at capacity for current staffing levels. </p><p>In consideration of issues arising on the establishment of the ODCE as a stand-alone agency and in preparation for this change, the Director and staff of the ODCE have been working with my Department and the OPW on necessary accommodation arrangements that will likely be required following transition to the Corporate Enforcement Authority.  </p><p><b>Capacity to work from home</b></p><p>The equipment available for remote working comprises a mix of encrypted mobile remote access devices and encrypted desktop PCs enabled for remote working and ensures that all that all staff are fully equipped for working from home. </p><p><b>Vehicles</b></p><p>ODCE does not have any vehicles; the Garda Unit however has vehicles available to them which are provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p><b>IT Hardware and Software</b></p><p>The ODCE is in the process of finalising a contract for IT hardware for its forensics laboratory which will fulfil the hardware requirements of the laboratory. </p><p>All other general IT hardware is sourced through a Departmental contract and a supplementary order is currently being processed on behalf of the Office which this will fulfil the IT hardware requirements of the Office for general use. General use software is similarly sourced though Departmental contracts. Where additional and specialised software is required, the Office is fully funded to source it through procurement procedures.</p><p><b>Requests made by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement for additional allocation of resources and staff in respect of 2020 and 2021</b></p><p>As I said previously, in 2019 an additional &euro;1 million was provided for the ODCE to reflect the costs associated with the transition of the ODCE into a stand-alone Agency.<b></b>In 2020 a total allocation of &euro;6,057,000 was provided for the ODCE, &euro;3,740,000 allocated in respect of pay and &euro;2,317,000 allocated in respect of non-Pay. An additional &euro;1,874,000 had initially been requested by the ODCE for 2020 for non-pay purposes to cover potential legal and rental costs. These costs did not materialise in 2020. </p><p>With respect to Garda resources, while the Companies Act 2014 provides for the secondment of Garda&iacute; to the ODCE, the Director and the Garda Commissioner are independent in their functions and the assignment of Garda&iacute; to the ODCE is an operational matter for both the Director and the Commissioner.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement engages directly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding Garda resourcing of the ODCE.  The Department is aware that a request for Garda resources has been made and 6 officers are expected to be assigned by year-end. </p><p>In terms of civilian staffing resources, as part of the work underway to progress the transition of the ODCE to the Corporate Enforcement Authority, the Department and the ODCE are working closely in assessing and identifying the specific posts that will be required for the future operation and governance of the proposed new agency. </p></reply>

These actions, which are further underpinned by the Programme for Government, include developing the electric vehicle charging network necessary to support the growth of EVs and to ensure the supply of infrastructure stays sufficiently ahead of demand. The development of a strategy to meet these objectives is currently underway.     </p>  <p>  Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and Government policy is to promote home charging in order to maintain this current high level of charging. To support home charging the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department, continues to administer an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit for those with access to an off-street parking space which can be connected to their domestic supply.  </p>  <p>  Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV Home Charger Grant to include shared parking in apartment blocks and similar developments. However, there are a number of complex planning and legal issues to address first. My Department is working closely with the SEAI and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address the issues involved.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2018/844/EU) requires Member States to ensure that appropriate charging infrastructure is installed in all new residential and non-residential buildings with more than 10 parking spaces. It is intended that this EU requirement will be transposed into Irish law by end 2020. </p></reply>

It will also help Ireland to move towards 70% renewable electricity, a commitment made in the Programme for Government. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland&rsquo;s economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p>  <p>  I welcomed the decision in September by Minister Mallon to grant full planning consent for the project. The project was also approved by An Bord Pleanala in Ireland in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The option of undergrounding the line has been assessed on several occasions over the years. Most recently, my Department published an independent study in October 2018 on undergrounding the interconnector which found that an overhead line remained the most appropriate option for the proposed interconnector. This study was the latest in a series of studies that reached the same conclusion. The estimated cost of undergrounding the line was &euro;680 million versus an estimated cost of &euro;230 million for the overhead option. It is important to point out these estimates do not include provision for additional associated construction costs for terminals and substation connectivity.  The estimates also do not include costs of landowner compensation.</p>  <p>  EirGrid and ESB Networks, as our electricity system operators, always seek to work in close collaboration with landowners and stakeholders in the delivery of electricity infrastructure. Both companies are engaging with those living closest to the route of the interconnector. In that regard I note that EirGrid has already set in place a variety of engagements locally, including the appointment of community liaison officers and a mobile information unit active in the area. I expect such engagements to intensify in the coming weeks and months, subject of course to national public health guidelines on Covid-19.</p>  <p>  In regard to a suggested meeting between Monaghan County Council officials and departmental officials,  it is important for me to point out that my Department does not have any role in the delivery of electricity infrastructure on the ground. This is consistent with the 2012 Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure which states: &lsquo;The Government does not seek to direct EirGrid and ESB Networks or other energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies&rsquo;.  </p>  <p>  I believe that this important new cross-Border infrastructure will significantly facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the power system, will bring economic benefits to the region and can address our climate objectives on the island of Ireland. </p></reply>

This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products, local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is designed to encourage communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p>  <p>  With regard to the community banking model a project team comprising officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Finance was established to progress that particular commitment.  The final report was published by the respective Ministers on 4 July 2018. The report indicated that the Department of Finance would continue to engage in dialogue with Irish Rural Link and other stakeholders and that it would commission an independent external evaluation of the possibility or otherwise for promotion of the local public banking concept in Ireland.  That further report was published by the Department of Finance in December 2019 and concluded that there is no business case for the State to establish a public banking system in Ireland, supporting the outcome of the July 2018 report.</p>  <p>  The importance of the post office network has been clearly demonstrated throughout the pandemic where we have seen a range of initiatives through our post offices which have helped support local communities, the elderly and vulnerable.  </p>  <p>  The serious decline in the volume of mail and the impact of Covid on footfall through post offices, has had a severe impact on the postal network and I am aware of the concerns of the Irish Postmasters Union. I am also aware of the findings of the most recent Grant Thornton Report commissioned by the IPU, which are being considered by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  </p>  <p>  While it is longstanding Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government recognises that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise, as part of our commitment to a sustainable nationwide post office network. </p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. With an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services.  We will work closely with An Post to see if there is scope to channel additional services through the network. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government is clear that the Government does not support the importation of fracked gas and commits to developing a policy statement to establish that approach. </p>  <p>  My Department is developing the policy statement which includes consideration of any necessary legal/regulatory provisions. This includes detailed examination of the European energy and environmental frameworks, in which our national laws operate, to ensure the policy statement will be legally robust. Once finalised, I intend to bring the Policy Statement to Government for approval. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems which is focusing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to 2050. The review will include a detailed technical analysis and a public consultation. A request for tender for the technical analysis has recently been published.  </p>  <p>  The review will inform future policy in relation to natural gas supplies, gas storage, electricity interconnection, emergency reserves and other measures that would enhance our security of supply. This will be done in the context of the doubling of the electricity generated from renewable sources to 70% of Ireland&rsquo;s final consumption and the achievement of net zero emissions by 2050. </p>  <p>  I expect that the review will be completed by the end of 2021.</p></reply>

The overall purpose of the Platform is to assist EU countries and their coal (and fossil fuel) regions with networking, knowledge sharing, and technical and advisory support. Membership of the initiative enabled the Midlands Region to apply for assistance under its START programme (Secretariat Technical Assistance for Regions in Transition) to develop a Holistic Plan for Just Transition in the Midlands Region, to assist with the development of strategies and projects for the region, focusing in particular on the employment challenges faced by workers affected by decarbonisation.Under the Commission&rsquo;s EU Green Deal proposals, the initiative has now become part of the Just Transition Platform. This objective of the platform is to provide a single access point for participating regions for support and information related to funding opportunities, relevant regulatory updates, or sector specific initiatives.</p><p>I am informed that the Midlands Regional Transition Team (MRTT), under the auspices of the Midlands Regional Enterprise Plan, has undertaken a programme of work over the last year, with the technical assistance of START, to inform wider work on just transition within the region, which has delivered the following outputs:</p><p>-  a Midlands regional profile, setting out analysis of the socio-economic and industrial context;</p><p>-  an inventory of project proposals for the Midlands region, focusing on identifying key, credible, considered projects to facilitate a just transition. An open call for projects under this process registered over 150 projects, which served as the first phase of project identification for the Just Transition Fund; </p><p>-  a report on &lsquo;Future employment and skills in the Irish Midlands&rsquo; published in August 2020; and</p><p>-  a report on &lsquo;Midlands Pathway to Transition&rsquo;, which maps a process for transition in the Midlands in the short and longer term, through the MRTT and involving other relevant government actors.</p><p>These outputs are available on www.midlandsireland.ie and .</p><p>As recommended in the Just Transition Commissioner's first progress report, published in May 2020, the MRTT, established by Offaly County Council to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the acceleration of Bord na Mona's 'Brown to Green' decarbonisation strategy, has been expanded to include other impacted local authority areas. The MRTT aims to pursue funding opportunities and actions to mitigate the impact of Bord na Mona job losses, and to position the region to develop alternative forms of employment, attract investment and maximise existing opportunities. The Commissioner's report also recommended the establishment of a number of working groups within the MRTT, with membership drawn from the local authorities and State agencies operating in the Region. Four working groups will address the following areas:</p><p>-  Education/Training/Research</p><p>-  Employment Generation </p><p>-  Employment Continuity Pathways</p><p>-  Community Assistance Programme/Social Enterprise Interventions</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s call under the Just Transition Fund for innovative projects that will contribute to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the wider Midlands region, and which have employment and enterprise potential, has identified a number of possible opportunities for collaboration between public bodies and private enterprises.  </p><p>The Department published an initial list of sixteen successful projects on 9 September 2020 and I announced forty-seven further successful projects today, details of which are available on www.gov.ie. Unsuccessful applicants will be offered a further opportunity to engage with the MRTT to progress project concepts, develop partnerships and/or identify further sources of funding.  The MRTT will also provide support, where appropriate, to projects that are successful in securing funding from the Just Transition Fund. </p></reply>

The first item of legislation was the Radiological Protection Bill 2018 and the second item of legislation was the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017.</p>  <p>  Pre-legislative scrutiny was waived on 2 occasions for the Radiological Protection Bill 2018, in May 2017 and January 2018.  The application for an exemption was on the basis that the new provisions contained in the Bill were of a technical nature and did not alter the principles or policies set out in the Radiological Protection Act 1991. The Bill dealt with &ldquo;Mulcreevy type&rdquo; issues with the Radiological Protection Act 1991 which the Attorney General's Office had identified and advised required early resolution. </p>  <p>  An exemption from pre-legislative scrutiny for the Inland Fisheries (Amendment) Bill was sought to address an issue in the Inland Fisheries Act 2010 concerning the power of IFI to prosecute in relation to offences under the Fisheries Acts. It was essential that the 2010 Act could be amended without delay to ensure that Inland Fisheries Ireland, as a statutory prosecutor, could continue to enforce the Inland Fisheries Acts which underpin the protection, management and conservation of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fisheries and sea-angling resource.  </p>  <p>  The exemption requests were granted in both cases.</p></reply>

A key objective of the Fund is to provide support for  projects and initiatives that contribute to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate and energy targets, and for projects and initiatives in regions of the State, and within sectors of the economy, impacted by the transition to a low carbon economy.    The Climate Action Fund is resourced from proceeds from the levy paid to the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) in respect of relevant disposals of petroleum products, after the funding requirements of NORA have been met. In the region of &euro;500 million is expected to accrue to the Climate Action Fund to 2027. This will ensure that substantial funding is available to progress a series of funding calls.   </p>  <p>  The recently published Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, 2020 proposes that projects and initiatives that seek to increase climate resilience, and the removal of greenhouse gas, particularly nature-based solutions that enhance biodiversity, can also be supported by the Climate Action Fund. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing proposals to provide a second round of support from the Climate Action Fund which will be launched shortly.

The Government is committed to the rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and will take the necessary action to deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030. </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan included a commitment to deliver at least 3.5 GW of offshore wind by 2030, up to 8.2 GW of onshore wind and up to 1.5 GW of solar; the Programme for Government commits to a further increase in offshore wind deployment to 5 GW by 2030.The National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) (Table 6 of the Plan) sets out estimated trajectories by renewable energy technology in order to achieve the overall and sectoral trajectories for renewable energy from 2021 to 2030. These technology levels are indicative and for electricity the level of each technology will be driven by technology costs and competitive auctions under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) as well as major private sector funding through Corporate Power Purchase Agreements</p>  <p>  There are approximately 25,000 electric vehicles under taxation at this time. The Climate Action Plan set a target of 936,000 electric vehicles to be on the road in Ireland by 2030. The plan also includes a range of actions to support the uptake of electric vehicles. EirGrid&rsquo;s long-term view of the electricity transmission system is detailed in its Tomorrow&rsquo;s Energy Scenarios 2019 report (published in October 2019) and chapter 6 includes different scenarios for electric vehicles uptake. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and an annual reduction of 7% in overall greenhouse gas emissions to 2030, including through maximising the amount of renewable energy on the grid. Future advances in system flexibility, storage technologies including batteries and green hydrogen as well as regional and international interconnection will enable very high levels of renewable electricity on our grid. </p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.  My Department is in regular contact with the SEAI at official level in relation to the operation of the Warmer Homes scheme and I emphasised the need for a strong focus on delivery across all of the SEAI retrofit programmes during a recent meeting with the incoming Chair of the Authority.     There are currently over 7,000 homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor, or are awaiting the initial survey of their home. Eligible homes are allocated on a first come, first served basis, and the average time between application and survey is now 21 months.  The wait time is a result of strong demand for what is an extremely popular scheme. The work programme was also negatively impacted by Covid-19, particularly between March and June when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines.  </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides &euro;109 million in capital funding to support lower income households to retrofit their homes with &euro;100 million of this funding allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme. This is the largest budget ever for this purpose. It is expected that this funding will support free energy efficiency upgrades for up to 5,800 lower income households, in line with the programme for Government. Capacity by the industry to deliver increased activity will also be increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works commencing this month. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will also be finalised shortly.</p>  <p>  Another important announcement made as part of Budget 2021 was the designation of SEAI as the National Retrofit Office and the allocation of additional resources to drive delivery of our retrofit targets.  SEAI has already commenced a recruitment process in that regard.  Improvements to the processes that apply to individual schemes are made on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

The Strategy set out a number of actions to alleviate the burden of energy poverty on the most vulnerable in society. The focus of the strategy was on high impact actions which aimed to make a real difference to the lives of those in energy poverty.    Good progress has been made under the strategy including:</p>  <p>  -  Free upgrades were carried out in over 23,000 lower income homes under the main SEAI energy poverty schemes;</p>  <p>  -  A consultation on energy efficiency in the rented sector has also been completed with recommendations to follow in 2021;</p>  <p>  -  Funding for SEAI energy poverty retrofit schemes has increased dramatically over the period from &euro;15 million in 2015 to over &euro;109 million in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  -  The allocations for retrofit of social housing have also increased significantly with an allocation of &euro;65 million for 2021. </p>  <p>  At the time of its launch, the Strategy was accompanied by a report on the level and extent of energy poverty in Ireland. This study looked at what the typical household has to spend on energy to keep their home heated and compared that to household income. This report found that in 2016, 28% of households in Ireland could be in or at risk of energy poverty.  The ESRI carried out an assessment in 2019, using the same methodology, and found that the proportion in or at risk of energy poverty had reduced to 17.4%. These rates align closely to the level of basic deprivation experienced in Ireland.  A separate ESRI study suggested that energy poverty is primarily a function of inadequate resources to cover living costs rather than simply an energy issue.  In addition, the proportion of people who report that they are unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm, has fallen from 9% in 2015 to 4.4% in 2019.   </p>  <p>  Looking forward, the Programme for Government commits to providing &euro;5 billion to part fund a socially progressive national retrofit programme targeting all homes but with a particular focus on the midlands region and on social and low income tenancies. As mentioned above, Budget 2021 provided &euro;109 million to support lower income households to retrofit their homes and participate in the transition.  This represents an increase of &euro;47 million on the 2020 allocation for energy poverty schemes and means that almost half of the total residential and community retrofit budget will support people vulnerable to energy poverty. The funding will mean that more households can receive free energy efficiency upgrades making their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, in line with the Programme for Government. Recommendations aimed at improving the targeting of energy poverty schemes at those most in need will be finalised soon. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to ensuring that increases in the carbon tax are progressive by spending &euro;3 billion on targeted social welfare and other initiatives to prevent fuel poverty and ensure a just transition.  My colleague Minister Humphrey&rsquo;s announced as part of Budget 2021 that the Fuel Allowance will increase by &euro;3.50 to &euro;28 per week.  </p>  <p>  A review of the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty will be completed in 2021.  Alleviating energy poverty will also be a key consideration for the National Retrofit Plan which will be published next year.</p></reply>

The Map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The High Speed Broadband Map  is available at and is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode.Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high speed broadband through the State led Intervention under the contract with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so.

The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. </p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of 18 November 2020, over 131,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company.  Surveys have been completed in County Clare in the areas of Cratloe, Ballycannan, Ballyglas and Cloghrea and further surveys have recently commenced in the areas of Kilkishen. </p><p>Surveying is the first step towards delivering the new fibre network and involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network to each and every premises in the surveyed area and leads to detailed designs. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir for the area, where Open eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. </p><p>Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers, and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence. This involves deploying fibre overhead on poles and in underground ducts, splicing of fibre, and unblocking of ducts. Once the main construction works are completed and the appropriate level of testing has been undertaken, the fibre network can be commissioned and end users can order their connection.Further details are available on specific areas within Clare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 6 November, 147 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. Cree Community Centre, Loop Head Lighthouse and Michael Cusack Visitor Centre are BCPs which are now connected in Co. Clare. A further BCP at Loughraney has had infrastructure installed by NBI and will be connected in the coming weeks. </p><p>Some 48 schools throughout Ireland have now had infrastructure installed by NBI, with 22 schools already connected to high speed broadband. In Clare, a number of schools including Shragh, Ennistymon and Stonehall National Schools are now connected as part of this initiative. Further details can be found at . My Department continues to work with Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP.</p></reply>

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.  I am advised by NBI that, as of 16 November 2020, over 131,000 premises across every county in Ireland have been surveyed, which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The first fibre to the home connections are expected next month in Carrigaline, Co Cork and they will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from the end of January retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.  </p><p>In County Westmeath, I can advise that surveys have been carried out in the areas around Mullingar, Sonna, Stonehall, Taghmon, Jamestown, Hopestown and Athlone. NBI advise that surveys are due to start in areas around Devlin in early 2021 with an indicative date of summer 2021 for scheduled commencement of build works in the Mullingar area. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Westmeath through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of November, some 190 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of these are now connected with high speed publicly accessible broadband through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development. A further 22 are connected with high speed broadband, for educational access only, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Education and Skills. Further details can be found at .</p><p>In County Westmeath, NBI has installed the necessary infrastructure for BCPs at Streete Parish Park and Community Hall, Whitehall and Milltown Emper Community Centres and Ballycomoyle GAA Club, and connection will be provided by retail service providers in the coming weeks.</p><p>Scoil N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Bhride has been connected to high speed broadband, for educational access only, as part of the BCP initiative, with Scoil Naomh Michael to be connected in the coming weeks. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP. </p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises remain unconnected, although close to premises that are passed by eir&rsquo;s fibre network. eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. </p><p>Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focused on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. I appreciate it can be frustrating when citizens are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is well under way.</p></reply>

The report contains</font>important recommendations. The Government is already acting on a number of these and is committed to preparing an implementation plan to address the remainder, which I intend to publish in the coming weeks. The recommendations and associated actions will support job creation efforts and create new opportunities for Bord na M&oacute;na workers in the Midlands. The recommendation of the  <font color="#212121"> Commissioner that a study be undertaken in relation to the future potential of the ESB power stations at both Lanesborough (Lough Ree Power) and Shannonbridge (West Offaly Power) for the establishment of a dedicated Energy Hub in the Midlands was subsequently included as a commitment in the Programme for Government. </font></p><p>While the management of ESB-owned facilities is the responsibility of the Board and management of ESB, the decision of the ESB, in November 2019, to close West Offaly and Lough Ree Power stations followed an extensive review of all options and was based on the key planning, climate and commercial factors associated with generation at the sites. My Department has been informed by the company that the current planning permissions for the two sites include an obligation to decommission the power plant and to remediate the sites by the end of 2022 and that, prior to any development opportunity taking place, ESB must satisfy the legal obligation to remediate the existing sites. In addition, I understand that the power plant equipment cannot be used for any purpose beyond December 2020 as neither the planning consents nor environmental licenses cover any such use. </p><p><font color="#212121">A feasibility study into the establishment of a Green Energy Hub using the existing infrastructure at the West Offaly and Lough Ree sites has now commenced.  This study is being overseen by a steering group chaired by the ESB, and includes representatives of my Department, relevant Local Authorities, and other stakeholders. I expect that the work of the group will conclude by the end of this year, having regard to the timelines required to meet the company&rsquo;s planning permission obligations in relation to both sites. </font></p><p>Responsibility for determination of the PSO levy is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which is an independent regulator.</p><p>The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Public Service Obligations Order 2002 (S.I. 217 of 2002) under which the CRU is assigned responsibility for the calculation of the levy each year. </p><p>The CRU&rsquo;s decision papers are published and publically available on their website and provide the ex-ante allocation of payments. </p><p>Aside from what is put in the public domain by the CRU, I do not have access to information about the total value of electricity consumers&rsquo; contribution through charges towards the capital cost of these facilities.  Generators obtain revenue to cover their costs from a number of sources, including from the electricity market and related auctions.  These latter elements in turn are ultimately paid by retail consumers, through various standing, network and variable electricity charges, depending on the type of consumer.</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them raise questions directly to the CRU, including on the CRU's annual PSO decisions, at <i>oireachtas@cru.ie</i>for timely direct reply.</p></reply>

The additional money is primarily directed toward increasing the rate of Exchequer funding support available for projects already approved.  The increased support means that these projects will now be 100% funded by allocations from my Department, and it is provided in recognition of the difficulties caused by COVID-19 on local authority funding streams. The increased funding levels will ensure these already-approved projects are delivered as proposed. </p>  <p>  The Deputy is likely aware that earlier in the Summer I also announced allocations being made available as part of the Carbon Tax Fund. Amongst those allocations Meath County Council was successful in relation to the Boyne Greenway and Boyne Navigation Restoration Scheme, which will be a 26.5km route from the Oldbrige Estate to Navan. The &euro;750,000 allocated to the Council is designed to bring the scheme through the design and planning processes and once that work is complete I expect Meath County Council will be well-placed to submit an application under future funding calls to support actual construction. </p>  <p>  I do expect further funding calls to be announced next year and Meath County Council, like other local authorities, will be able to submit applications in line with relevant eligibility criteria at the appropriate time. I understand that the Council previously applied in 2018 for funding in relation to a proposed Navan to Kingscourt Greenway, which was ultimately not successful at that time; however, it is open to the Council to consider the issue again for future funding calls. I think it important that local authorities consider the role that greenways can play in improving active travel options for local communities as well as their potential in the area of leisure and / or tourism focused walking and cycling, and I look forward to seeing that reflected in next year&rsquo;s process.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. </p>  <p>  As a consequence of the local authority restructuring process in 2014, my Department reviewed the approach to allocating funding to local authorities to take account of the changes. The conclusion reached was that the best approach was to add the mileage of the former Town and Borough Councils, which used to receive Block Grants, to the mileage figures for the relevant county and the result would determine each county&rsquo;s share of road programme allocations.  This is now the basis for grants to each local authority. A factor taken into account in adopting this approach was the anomalies that had arisen over time in relation to the treatment of different towns and urban areas.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to revise the existing arrangements. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the start of year grant allocation to Monaghan County Council in 2014 was &euro;6.9 million as compared with &euro;14.5 million in 2020.</p></reply>

If a licence is not renewed after 10 years, the licence holder is no longer considered a qualified driver. Irish driver licensing law operates within a framework of European Union law. An Irish driving licence can only be issued to a resident of Ireland.  Nationality is not a consideration. It is important to remember that driver licensing law exists to ensure that people licensed to drive on our roads meet high standards of safety. The standards for testing drivers are set at EU level.</p>  <p>  All EU driving licences are exchangeable when a person moves from one Member State to another.  In the case of non-EU jurisdictions, we may make bilateral agreements on licence exchange.  These are not a straightforward matter. They can be made only when the relevant authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the two licensing regimes, so that each side can be satisfied that they are compatible.  On the Irish side, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).</p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchange licence, we have no option but to require them to go through the process of obtaining an Irish licence. This is a matter of public safety. While many may have a safe driving record, we have no way of measuring this.  </p>  <p>  At present, people with a full but non-exchange licence go through the normal driver learning process but can avail of the shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons instead of the usual 12, and do not have to wait the usual minimum of 6 months before taking a driving test.

As a consequence, the service is closed, effective from midnight on Wednesday 21st of October, and for the duration of level 5 restrictions.  All appointments during that time have been rescheduled to the next available appointment date.</p>  <p>  As I am sure you are aware, the Theory Test service was temporarily suspended in March 2020 due to the Covid 19 emergency. When the service resumed in June, there was an increased level of demand and a significant backlog developed. This was coupled with the need to significantly reduce normal daily capacity to comply with occupational and public health requirements.</p>  <p>  When the Driver Theory Test Service  closed on the 21st of October due to the latest restrictions, the majority of testing centres had almost full bookings up to end December and some into January too as it worked its way through the initial backlog. The decision was taken by the service provider that those whose appointments were cancelled due to the latest restrictions would be rescheduled to the next available appointment date.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints for when services are resumed. This will help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog.</p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance.

The applicable dates for periodic testing are provided for by national legislation. Under Regulation 3(2) of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2017 (S.I. No. 415/2017), the initial test due date for a vehicle is determined using the date of registration of that vehicle and subsequent test due dates fall on anniversaries of that date.  Accordingly, all test due dates are predetermined based on the date of registration of a vehicle.</p>  <p>  The NCT certificate relates solely to the condition of testable items at the time of testing and does not constitute a warranty for their future condition. Earlier in the year, problems with vehicle lift equipment used by NCT Test Centres meant that, in certain cases, partial NCT inspections were undertaken with the omission of an underbody inspection. In general, when drivers presented their vehicle for the subsequent underbody inspection later in the year, and thereby completing the NCT inspection, the items tested as part of the initial NCT inspection were not retested.  Accordingly, it is inappropriate, and indeed potentially unsafe, to attest to the roadworthiness of items inspected earlier in the year at the time the latter inspection took place.</p></reply>

For this reason the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement schemes.

As the Deputy is aware, the new <i>Programme for Government: Our Shared Future</i>sets out an ambitious and wide-ranging set of commitments in relation to walking and cycling, supported by an increased multi-annual budgetary allocation amounting to some &euro;1.8 billion over the lifetime of the Government.</p><p>I am determined that an element of this increased funding will be made available to local authorities outside of the five cities and would hope that this year&rsquo;s allocations under the July Stimulus demonstrated my intent in this regard.</p><p>Next year, local authorities will be able to access funding to help develop active travel network plans to assist with the roll-out of infrastructure in the years ahead, and they will also be able to apply for funding to deliver improved infrastructure next year. Details of this funding package will be made available shortly and I very much look forward to working with local authorities as we look to deliver fundamental change to the nature of transport across Ireland.</p></reply>

I would like to thank both public and commercial operators and their staff for their continued dedication to providing this vital service in such challenging times.</p>  <p>  The Government's "Living with Covid" Plan sets out capacity guidance for public transport at each of the 5 risk levels identified in the Plan.  Due to the rising incidences of Covid-19 in the community, An Taoiseach announced that for a period of six weeks from midnight on Wednesday 21st October, the whole country would move to Level 5 of the Plan.  At current levels of risk, public transport operators are restricted to using only 25% of the passenger-carrying capacity on their vehicles.  Importantly, the Plan's guidance on working from home where possible and on the closure of social, leisure and other facilities has reduced the demand for public transport well below normal levels.  The advice is aimed at ensuring public transport is safeguarded for those who need it most, including frontline workers and students.  Both my Department and the NTA are closely monitoring public transport demand and will continue to be guided by public health advice.</p>  <p>  Since the move to Level 5, the NTA and bus operators in Dublin (Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland), have re-allocated a number of vehicles and drivers across the network to enhance the capacity in areas where they were experiencing capacity issues.</p>  <p>  Approximately 43 buses have been redeployed by Dublin Bus since October 22nd to help mitigate the impact of the capacity restrictions and reduce the number of passengers being left at stops. Where possible, these vehicles are being deployed during peak demand times, particularly for school travel.  These measures have also assisted in reducing passengers' wait times at stops. Currently, all available vehicles are in use, so whilst the re-allocation has eased the situation, it remains the case that there may still be instances of people having to wait for another bus.</p>  <p>  The NTA continues to monitor the effects of the reduction in capacity very closely in conjunction with public transport operators.</p></reply>

State grants, where applicable, are intended to supplement the funding allocated to the maintenance and improvement of roads by local authorities from their own resources.</p>  <p>  The National Development Plan (NDP) does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement schemes.  In this context 12 regional and local road improvement projects were identified for development, subject to necessary approvals, in the NDP and the construction of a Coonagh to Knockalisheen Distributor Road is one of those schemes.  </p>  <p>  Under the Public Spending Code, capital projects are subject to review and approval at a number of stages. As required under the Code Limerick City and County Council has submitted a recommendation regarding the award of a contract for the construction of the main scheme and I am considering the project at present. </p></reply>

As a consequence, the service is closed, effective from midnight on Wednesday 21st of October, and for the duration of Level 5 restrictions.  All appointments during that time have been rescheduled to the next available appointment date.  </p>  <p>  As I am sure you are aware, the Theory Test service was temporarily suspended in March 2020 due to the Covid 19 emergency.  When the service resumed in June, there was an increased level of demand and a significant backlog developed.  This was coupled with the need to significantly reduce normal daily capacity to comply with occupational and public health requirements. </p>  <p>  When the Driver Theory Test Service  closed on the 21st of October due to the latest restrictions, the majority of testing centres had almost full bookings up to end December and some into January too as it worked its way through the initial backlog.  The decision was taken by the service provider that those whose appointments were cancelled due to the latest restrictions would be rescheduled to the next available appointment date. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority has advised my office that it is engaging with its service provider to examine ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints for when services are resumed.  This will help reduce and, over time, eliminate the backlog. </p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused, public safety is of paramount importance.  My officials and I are working hard to ensure the resumption of services as soon as Level 5 is lifted.</p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised that it understands the key facts as as follows:</p>  <p>  -  A parent gifted their child a house in 2016;</p>  <p>  -  The house was deemed unliveable by an engineer and had to be demolished (no date provided for when the house was demolished);</p>  <p>  -  The child has paid the Local Property Tax (LPT) on this house since 2013; </p>  <p>  -  The child applied for planning and a mortgage around 2018/2019.</p>  <p>  Based on the facts outlined above, Revenue considers there are two key principal conditions that need to be considered:</p>  <p>  1. Is the child a &ldquo;first time purchaser&rdquo; for the purposes of HTB scheme;</p>  <p>  2. Is the property a &ldquo;qualifying residence&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Revenue further advise in relation to these issues:</p>  <p>  Section 477C TCA provides a definition of a &ldquo;first-time purchaser&rdquo; for the purposes of the HTB scheme. A &ldquo;first-time purchaser&rdquo; is an individual who, at the time of making a claim under the scheme, has not, either individually or jointly with any other person, previously purchased or previously built, directly or indirectly, on his or her own behalf a dwelling.  </p>  <p>  In a case where an individual who received a gift of or inherited a house previously, the individual may still be considered a first-time buyer for the purposes of the HTB scheme subject to all other conditions being satisfied, on the basis that they have not previously purchased a dwelling, as the wording of the legislation provides.</p>  <p>  Section 477C(2) TCA defines a &lsquo;qualifying residence&rsquo;.  The legislation is very specific as to the definition of a qualifying residence.  It must be a new building which was not, at any time, used or suitable for use as a dwelling.  Renovation or refurbishment of old houses to either upgrade or reinstate them for habitation does not qualify for HTB.  In the circumstances where the house was previously used as a dwelling but fully demolished and a new house built, then it is &ldquo;new&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  For Revenue to make an assessment that the dwelling being built on the site is &lsquo;new&rsquo;, sufficient evidence is required which shows that the previous dwelling was demolished and replaced as opposed to being extended/refurbished.  Revenue also require as much evidence as possible from the builder, engineer or other professionals working on the project, about the condition of the former dwelling which made it uninhabitable or unsound and required that it was demolished (and the extent of demolition involved).  If there is any other information (photos, etc.) that&rsquo;s relevant in helping Revenue understand that the property meets the criteria in the legislation, this should be included.</p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue in relation to LPT that any property that is in use as, or that is suitable for use as, a dwelling house is chargeable to LPT.  Therefore, the state of dereliction of a property is not relevant where the property is actually occupied as a dwelling house.  However, a property that is derelict to such an extent that it is not suitable for occupation (or not actually occupied) is not taxable. For further details please see the Revenue website link www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/is-your-property-liable-lpt/is-your-property-uninhabitable.aspx.</p>  <p>  The payment of LPT on a property that was gifted to an individual would not prevent the individual from availing of the HTB scheme, where the individual satisfies all other conditions of the HTB scheme.</p>  <p>  Given the limited details outlined by the Deputy in relation to this case, the applicant should contact Revenue via MyEnquiries outlining the specific facts and circumstances of their case and Revenue will consider whether the property would satisfy the conditions for the HTB scheme. </p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations.  In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal.  Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.  </p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC.</p>  <p>  A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC.  The judgment found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.</p>  <p>  On foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments.  In such circumstances, PMC assessments were discontinued until a revised basis for such assessments could be established.  The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation.  While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  In order to allow for the PMC assessments to recommence I have brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill to provide for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation.  When the Bill is enacted, this will allow for assessments to recommence in circumstances where the legal basis for such assessments is clarified.</p>  <p>  I consider this to be an interim solution only.  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this House and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.  With this in mind I have asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.</p></reply>

When determining if a company is a qualifying company regard must be had to both the activities of the company itself and also of the other businesses within its Relief for Investment in Corporate Trade (&lsquo;RICT&rsquo;) Group. The RICT Group is made of a qualifying company and all of its partner businesses and linked businesses. Details of what constitutes a partner business and a linked business are set out in Annex 1 of the General Block Exemption Regulations (&lsquo;GBER&rsquo;). The company and the RICT Group must be an SME and the qualifying company in which the investment is made can be carrying on a trade itself, or it can be the holding company of a trading company.</p><p>The company wishing to avail of EII must use the amounts raised by EII for &lsquo;relevant trading activities&rsquo;, which includes most trades. While there are no specific restrictions for companies engaging in solar activities, the following trades are excluded;</p><p>i. Once-off trades,</p><p>ii. Dealing in commodities, shares or other financial assets,</p><p>iii. Financing activities,</p><p>iv. The provision of professional services, which means:</p><p>I. Services of a medical, dental, optical, aural or veterinary natures,</p><p>II. Services of an architectural, quantity surveying or surveying nature and related services,</p><p>III. Services of accountancy, auditing, taxation or finance,</p><p>IV. Services of a solicitor, barrister or other legal services and </p><p>V. Geological services,</p><p>v. The occupation of woodlands</p><p>vi. Operating or managing hotels, guest houses etc, unless the activity is a tourist traffic undertaking</p><p>vii. Operations carried on in the coal, steel or shipbuilding sectors, and </p><p>viii. The production of films.</p><p>Finance Act 2018 introduced some changes to the administration of EII. From 1 January 2019 qualifying companies can self-certify their eligibility in relation to EII investments rather than requiring advance approval from Revenue. Revenue has published detailed guidance on EII, which will assist companies in determining whether, on a self-assessment basis, they qualify for EII.  That detailed guidance is contained in the following Tax and Duty Manuals: Part 16-00-02, Part 16-00-03, Part 16-00-10 and Part 16-00-11, all of which are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/starting-a-business/initiatives-for-startup-businesses-and-smes/relief-for-investment-in-corporate-trades/qualifying-company.aspx.</p><p>If, after a review of the Revenue guidance, a taxpayer company seeking EII investment is unsure whether it fulfils certain eligibility criteria, an application can be made to Revenue for an advance confirmation.

Preparations are already underway in this regards and next month it is proposed to launch a consultation process where stakeholders will be invited to submit their views and suggestions to the Department in writing with a particular focus on the following: </p><p>-  improved support for start-ups,</p><p>-  the potential to attract capital from a broader range of investors, and</p><p>-  the potential to include certain energy-related projects, including RESS projects, within the remit of the scheme. </p><p>The intention is that this will facilitate further engagement and discussion with stakeholders leading to the development of proposals for my consideration by end Q1, 2021. </p></reply>

The fact that the sale happens after a death does not change this position.  </p><p>In some circumstances an exemption from stamp duty or a reduced charge applies. However, as the Deputy hasn&rsquo;t supplied any details about the particular situation involved, it isn&rsquo;t possible for Revenue to say whether or not the full stamp duty charge would apply in this case. Some details about the potential exemptions and reliefs that can apply where agricultural land is purchased are set out below. </p><p><b>Exemption for &lsquo;young trained farmers&rsquo;</b></p><p>Stamp duty is not payable where a purchaser is under the age of 35 years, obtains a recognised agricultural qualification and satisfies other conditions in relation to the use of the land following the purchase. These conditions include the requirement for a purchaser to spend at least 50% of his or her normal working time farming the land and to retain ownership of that land for a period of at least five years from the date of execution of the deed transferring the land. </p><p><b>Farm consolidation relief</b></p><p>Where a Teagasc-approved consolidation of farmland takes place, involving both a sale and purchase of land, stamp duty at a reduced rate of 1% applies to the excess of the value of land purchased over the value of land sold. The purchase and sale must take place within a 24-month period of each other.</p><p><b>Consanguinity relief</b></p><p>Where agricultural land is purchased from certain relatives (such as parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles) stamp duty is chargeable at a reduced rate of 1% on the value of the land. Certain conditions must be satisfied such as the requirement for the purchaser to farm the land or to lease it to someone who farms the land. </p><p>Information about the available stamp duty reliefs and exemptions can be found in the &ldquo;Property&rdquo; section on the home page of the Revenue website (www.revenue.ie) by following the &ldquo;stamp duty&rdquo; link.  </p></reply>

The details are set out in Finance Bill 2020 and guidelines on the operation of the scheme, including the eligibility criteria, are available on the Revenue website: </p><p>(www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/press-office/budget-information/2021/crss-guidelines.pdf).  </p><p>The registration system for CRSS was released by Revenue on 1 November 2020 and eligible businesses have been able to register for the scheme on the Revenue Online Service (ROS) since then. As part of the registration process the business is required to provide certain information, including details such as the location of the business and the average weekly turnover of the business in 2019 (or in 2020 in the case of a new business).  Up to 23 November 2020, 8,300 businesses have registered for CRSS in respect of 8,900 business premises. A further 4,300 applications are currently being processed by Revenue. </p><p>Since 17 November 2020 an eligible business that is registered for CRSS, and which carries on a business activity from a business premises located in a region that is subject to COVID-19 related restrictions, can make a claim for payment under the CRSS via the eRepayments system on ROS provided it meets the eligibility criteria for making a claim under the scheme.  </p><p>CRSS applies as regards restrictions in place from 13 October 2020 and eligible businesses that have been subject to restrictions since that date may make a claim covering the period from 13 October 2020 up to the expected end day of the current restrictions, which is 1 December 2020.  One payment will be made to eligible businesses covering this restrictions period, with payments made by Revenue within 3 days of the submission of a qualifying claim.  Up to 23 November 2020, Revenue has processed &euro;33.5 million CRSS payments relating to 5,400 premises.</p><p>The support is available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  Generally, this refers to Covid restrictions at Level 3, 4 or 5 of the Government&rsquo;s Plan for Living with Covid-19 but certain businesses may qualify for the support where lower levels of restrictions are in operation.</p><p>The CRSS applies to businesses carrying on trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, which requires the business to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises and as a result, is operating at less than 25% of turnover in 2019.</p><p>The scheme will not apply to a business in the events industry or in other sectors, which does not ordinarily operate from a fixed business premises located in a region subject to the restrictions, but rather supplies goods or services to a business that does qualify for support under the CRSS because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close or significantly reduce its activity.  Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.</p><p>The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions.<b></b>Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that the Finance Bill is currently progressing through the  Houses of the Oireachtas, and I have no plans to extend eligibility of the scheme. </p></reply>

Qualification for the scheme also provides access to the Fuel Grant Scheme and for a waiver of motor tax. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for the scheme, the person with the disability must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC). The awarding of a PMC is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and Revenue is not involved in the process. However, any information available to Revenue potentially impacting on a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a PMC may be passed on to the HSE for review. Revenue may also request the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal to review a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a PMC in accordance with Regulation 7 of the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, SI No. 353 of 1994, where there are concerns regarding eligibility for the DPD scheme. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the person in question was issued with a PMC by the HSE on 29 June 2007. The most recent vehicle that was registered under the scheme by the person was on 14 February 2019. Revenue requested the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal to review the person&rsquo;s entitlement to a PMC in October 2019 following an examination of his eligibility for the scheme.  Following the completion of the review by the Board of Appeal the person was deemed ineligible for a PMC, and the certificate was withdrawn (by the Board of Appeal) with effect from 12 March 2020. Revenue understands that the person was informed of this decision by the Board of Appeal on 18 March 2020.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the person&rsquo;s vehicle was removed from the DPD scheme by Revenue and because the required minimum two-year period of usage was not reached, a portion of the tax relief became repayable. Revenue has confirmed to me that it wrote to the person on 15 May 2020 informing him of the position and requesting repayment.  </p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I can assure the Deputy that insurance reform is a key policy priority as reflected in the Programme for Government. This lays out commitments that are aimed at addressing consumer and business concerns on the cost of insurance.  In this regard, a Sub-Group of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment was established by Government to oversee insurance reform implementation.  This is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, and also includes as standing members, Ministers McGrath, McEntee, O&rsquo;Gorman and myself, together with Ministers of State Troy and Fleming. This &lsquo;Whole of Government&rsquo; approach provides the best opportunity to address the cost and availability of insurance and will build and expand upon previous commendable work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG).  The Cabinet Sub-Group is due to meet again this week and it is expected that it will shortly publish an Action Plan on insurance reform.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that both I and Minister of State Fleming have had extensive engagement with motor insurers and other key policy stakeholders throughout 2020. In this respect, in January, I met with the main insurance companies to relay to them the importance of their responding to reforms by reducing premiums. Subsequently in April in a meeting with Insurance Ireland, I called on insurers to be proactive and generous in relation to their treatment of motor insurance customers during the COVID-19 crises. Most recently as part of a comprehensive engagement on the Government&rsquo;s new insurance reform agenda with a wide range of stakeholder interests, including Insurance Ireland, Minister of State Fleming concluded a series of meetings with the main insurers in the Irish market. He again raised the need for them to respond to reforms by lowering premiums, to continue to offer forbearance measures, and to expand their risk horizon in the market (such as providing more cover for younger drivers).</p>  <p>  Finally, I believe it is important to acknowledge that the reforms already introduced by the Cost of Insurance Working Group have had a considerable impact in stabilising the cost of motor insurance and indeed many consumers should be seeing decreases in the cost of their motor insurance premiums.  These developments have been confirmed in respective data from the CSO and the Central Bank of Ireland.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-24a.617.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112400082#WRO05300"><p>The following table sets out all primary legislation for which my Department was responsible, other than the annual Finance Acts, enacted or initiated since the 1/1/2017. The table sets out whether pre-legislative scrutiny occurred in respect of each piece of legislation concerned. The annual Finance Acts are not subject to the pre-legislative scrutiny process so those acts are not included in the table. Similarly pre-legislative scrutiny is not routinely conducted in respect of secondary legislation so the table sets out the position with respect to primary legislation only.</p><p>In most cases my Department has written to the relevant Oireachtas Committee, asking whether the Committee wished to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny in respect of the legislation concerned. My Department would not ordinarily specifically apply for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny but would ordinarily set out the anticipated course of the legislation and ask the Committee whether they wished to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislation or not. </p><p>However I would draw your attention to the following pieces of legislation in respect of which a specific application for the waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny was made for the reasons set out below:</p><p>1. Home Building Finance Ireland Act 2018</p><p>The Home Building Finance Ireland Act 2018 was presented and selected for pre-legislative scrutiny, so no formal application to waive pre-legislative scrutiny was made. However in the end the Committee was unable to hold pre-legislative scrutiny in time. My Department submitted the Bill in February 2018, and by May 2018 my Department then requested to press ahead without pre-legislative scrutiny as time for the pre-legislative scrutiny had not been scheduled by the Committee and we needed to meet our deadline for having the agency operative by year end. The Committee agreed to the request, so no pre-legislative scrutiny was conducted.</p><p>2. Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Act 2020</p><p>The Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Act 2020 provided for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the EIB pan-European Guarantee Fund and the SURE Guarantee Agreement. Ireland could not participate in the EIB pan-European Guarantee Fund until the legislation was enacted. In relation to SURE, it was necessary for all Member States to sign the Guarantee Agreement before it came into effect. At the time, indications were received that most Member States planned to complete their parliamentary procedures by the end of June. Our Legislation was therefore required as soon as possible so as not to delay access to the SURE instrument across Europe. Given the urgency of both matters, permission was sought from the Business Committee under<b></b>Standing Order 173 not to refer the General Scheme for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p>3. Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 </p><p>The Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Act 2020  was part of a package of measures put in place to stimulate and support the economy as it resumed activity in line with the Government&rsquo;s plans for the phased re-opening of the economy following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Act contained measures which sought to address the urgent challenges facing businesses as they re-opened and resumed activity in accordance with public health advice and Government decisions in the most effective way. The measures were necessary to ensure that businesses would be in the strongest position possible to respond to the re-opening of the economy. The measures had positive impacts on employment and ensured that as many people as possible would return to work and that they would return as early as possible. Given the urgency of the matters the subject of the Act, my Department applied for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Title of Bill</th>       <th>Year initiated</th>       <th>Pre-leg scrutiny occurred?<br /><br />Y/N</th>       <th>Application to waive pre-leg scrutiny made?<br /><br />Y/N</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act 2017</td>       <td>2017</td>       <td>Y</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Act 2017</td>       <td>2017</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>Y</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Markets in Financial Instruments Act 2018</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>Y</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Home Building Finance Ireland Act 2018</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>Y (see below).</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Finance (African Development (Bank and Fund) and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) Act 2019</td>       <td>2018</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Credit Union Restructuring Board (Dissolution) Bill 2019</td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Investment Limited Partnership (Amendment) Bill 2019</td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Finance (Tax Appeals and Prospectus Regulation) Act 2019</td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>Y</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Migration of Participating Securities Act 2019</td>       <td>2019</td>       <td>Y</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Act 2020</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>Y</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>Y</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Investment Limited Partnership (Amendment) Bill 2020</td>       <td>2020</td>       <td>N</td>       <td>N</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Under existing rules, when the UK becomes a third country, visitors from Britain will be able to avail of the scheme.  No minimum threshold currently applies in respect of expenditure on which VAT relief may be claimed.</p>  <p>  The Bill as published provides that the value of qualifying goods must exceed &euro;175 in order to be eligible for a refund under the scheme. This change is fully compatible with EU law and is in line with the EU VAT Directive. The Bill also introduces a requirement of proof of importation of the goods into the UK and the associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties, for the goods purchased under the scheme in order to qualify for a refund.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the difficulties facing retailers, especially businesses in the tourism sector, I am bringing forward an amendment at committee stage to reduce the threshold to &euro;75. This reduction retains protections for the exchequer while also acknowledging the potential impact that not making this change would have on retailers across the country at this difficult time.</p>  <p>  With regards to extension of the scheme, there is no application or authorisation process involved in the scheme, as it is a self-assessment system. Retailers may operate the Retail Export Scheme in their own right or in conjunction with a Value-Added Tax (VAT) refund agent.</p></reply>

Over 66,500 employers received a subsidy under the TWSS with payments worth just under &euro;2.9 billion paid out to over 664,000 workers.  </p>  <p>  It was introduced as an emergency income support for employees of vulnerable firms (where turnover had reduced by at least 25% during Q2 while the strictest public health measures were in place) and was paid via the employer so as to maintain employment links between the employee and employer insofar as was possible.  The level of income given for each individual employee was based on previous wages received in January and February 2020. </p>  <p>  Under the TWSS, in relation to multiple employments, earnings from all active employments were combined thereby ensuring that the overall position of each employee was taken into account when calculating the employee&rsquo;s subsidy entitlement. This meant that if a person was employed part-time by an ETB and part-time by a private sector employer, the subsidy paid through the private sector employer would reflect that employment only.</p>  <p>  Questions relating to an individual employee&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, what wages an employer may be legally obliged to pay employees in respect of their employment contract, hours worked and an employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are all matters that are outside the remit of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  Since 1 September, the TWSS has been replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which is an employer subsidy to help support viable firms and encourage employment.  The level of subsidy given to the employer is based on the number of paid workers on the payroll per week, applying prospectively and, unlike the TWSS, is not determined on the basis of previous pay.</p></reply>

The scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee to use, in whole or in part, to travel to work. Safety equipment includes helmets, lights, bells, mirrors and locks but does not include child seats or trailers. The scheme requires that the employee must mainly use the bicycle and safety equipment for qualifying journeys. This means the whole or part of a journey between home and the normal place of work.</p>  <p>  The Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 made some changes to the scheme, increasing the exemption limit from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,250 or, in the case of electric bikes, to &euro;1,500 for employer expenditure on the provision of bicycles and associated safety equipment, and also enabling employees to avail of the scheme more frequently.

The amounts shown as &lsquo;Employer Gross Pay&rsquo; in the table comprise of both top-up payments and wages where employees were no longer supported by TWSS. The figures do not include the TWSS subsidy amounts. I am advised by Revenue that because any week within a monthly cycle can include a variety of pay frequencies, for example weekly, fortnightly, twice monthly, monthly, (table 8 refers), the most appropriate measure of the level of top-up payments is for a month as a whole. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s request for a breakdown of top-up payments as a percentage of gross pay, I am advised by Revenue that this is not possible to provide due to the way in which gross pay was recorded during the operation of TWSS. For TWSS inclusive payslips, employers only reported the top-up payment amount in the &lsquo;gross pay field&rsquo; of the payroll submission.

The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) must be complied with as a matter of law and the Central Bank has the power to take enforcement action against any regulated entity who does not act in compliance with the CCMA. </p>  <p>  Whilst no public enforcement actions have been taken relating to compliance with the CCMA to date, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Enforcement division liaises closely with supervisors as and when issues arise, and a credible threat of enforcement underscores the Central Bank&rsquo;s powers to protect consumers. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank takes robust enforcement action aimed at promoting principled and ethical behaviour by and within regulated entities and consumer protection is core to that work. As the Deputy will know, it has taken a number of actions in these areas since 2016 in furtherance of its consumer protection mandate, including the two largest monetary sanctions imposed to date by the Central Bank &ndash; Permanent TSB plc sanctioned &euro;21 million in 2019 and KBC Bank Ireland plc sanctioned &euro;18.3 million in 2020. </p>  <p>  In addition to enforcement actions such as the Administrative Sanctions Procedure, the Central Bank uses a wide range of other tools to take action against regulated entities which fall short of its expected standards of behaviour. These include ensuring that firms and individuals seeking to access the market meet high regulatory standards, requiring firms to have robust risk management processes in place to address all risks to consumers, directing firms to put things right when they have made errors or caused consumer harm and making sure firms compensate consumers for losses in appropriate cases. The toolkit also includes the refusal and revocation of authorisations and the refusal and prohibition of individuals as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank assures me that it will continue to assertively supervise compliance with the CCMA and will investigate any issues that arise, including patterns of behaviour which suggest that the CCMA process is not being followed. </p></reply>

The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  </p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the EWSS already contains sufficient flexibility to take account of changes in business circumstances and is targeted at employers across all sectors who are most in need of support.  </p>  <p>  For those who may not be eligible for the EWSS, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

A four-year time limit for repayments is also provided for in other tax legislation.</p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s power to raise or amend assessments, or make inquiries, is generally limited to no later than four years after the end of the chargeable period to which a tax return relates.

An individual can choose the rate at which they contribute to an AVC.  Tax relief is available on the amount the individual pays, subject to statutory age-related and overall income limits per tax year. </p>  <p>  An individual can only make AVCs into a pension scheme if the rules of the particular scheme permit them.  Alternatively, a Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) product should be made available by the employer for the purposes of making AVCs. </p>  <p>  Where AVCs are paid, the benefits are subject to the rules of the individual&rsquo;s scheme and the Revenue limits applying to occupational pension schemes.

The amount drawn down was subject to income tax under Schedule E, PRSI and USC, which was collected under the PAYE system.

The scheme was not intended as a support to domestic employers nor was it ever implied that it applied to them.</p>  <p>  The TWSS operated on a self-assessment basis with the onus on applicants to satisfy themselves that they fully met the eligibility criteria for the scheme and to self-declare to Revenue that they correctly qualified. To assist employers in determining their eligibility, Revenue published very extensive guidance, which clearly set out the qualifying conditions, including the requirement that a minimum 25% decline in business turnover had occurred due to COVID-19 related restrictions. Revenue also deployed very significant resources to a TWSS Helpline to ensure employers were supported to the greatest extent possible through telephone and written (including e-mail) engagement.</p>  <p>  The provision of domestic duties by an employee within a private household, where the employer is the owner or occupier is not a business activity for the purposes of the scheme. A relevant business in the context of the TWSS generally includes manufacturing, buying, selling or supplying goods or services with a view to making a profit, none of which can be associated with employing domestic staff. It is also not possible for a domestic employer to meet the &lsquo;25% turnover&rsquo; eligibility test as there is no turnover associated with engaging a domestic employee.</p>  <p>  In the event that any employers, including domestic employers, received TWSS payments to which they were not entitled, it is very important that they engage with Revenue and agree repayment arrangements. Where this does not happen, it may result in Revenue raising assessments and deploying debt collection sanctions to secure the repayments.     </p>  <p>  From the perspective of the employee, questions relating to an individual&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, what wages an employer may be legally obliged to pay employees in respect of their employment contract, hours worked and an employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are all matters that are outside the remit of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The question in relation to applications for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-24a.677.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112400084#WRQ01300"><p>As you will be aware, both officials and I have engaged and will continue to engage extensively with the Banking and Payments Federation (BPFI) and the banks directly in relation to supports for personal and business customers affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Officials in my Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is important to highlight that, as Minister for Finance, I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Furthermore I am specifically precluded from intervening in the case of any individual customer with any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the banking crisis we faced over ten years ago was fuelled by unsustainable lending. There are now thankfully far firmer regulatory controls and restrictions on lenders. Speaking on this particular issue, on 7 May 2020 the Governor of the Central Bank publicly noted that if an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed such that doubt is cast over the sustainability of potential borrowing, it is in the best interests of the borrower and the bank if the situation is reviewed.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) apply here. These mandate that before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness. That assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement. The CMCAR also provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement. The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders. Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.</p>  <p>  This overall regulatory framework means a decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Where a formal loan offer is made by a lender, the loan offer may contain a condition that may allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the loan offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  These overlapping and complimentary regulations are designed to protect consumers, prevent risky unsustainable lending, protect the integrity of the financial system and preserve competition in the market.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department did request a comment from Bank of Ireland on the impact of Covid-19 on the processing of mortgages and received the following response:</p>  <p>&ldquo;At Bank of Ireland we are very conscious of the potential impact of COVID-19 on income levels and we assess each application carefully taking individual customer circumstances into consideration. Where customers are progressing mortgage applications and have affordability to do so, the Bank continues to support those applications.</p>  <p>  Where income has changed or where we are aware of potential challenges to a customer&rsquo;s income as a result of COVID-19, we are liaising with customers to understand their circumstances and assess if these are expected to change again in the future. This process has always been followed as it wouldn&rsquo;t be responsible to provide somebody with a mortgage at a level that they may struggle to afford now or in the future.</p>  <p>  We engage closely with our mortgage applicants on an ongoing basis to ensure we fully understand their circumstances. As part of this engagement we ask employers to confirm if their employee&rsquo;s income is supported by a Government scheme due to COVID-19. The Bank does not seek any information about financial support that may be provided to the employer.&rdquo;</p></reply>

A regulated entity is required to make a decision on a mortgage application within 10 business days of receipt of all documents or items of information necessary to assess the application. If the regulated entity cannot make a decision on whether it will grant or refuse the application within 10 business days, it must inform the consumer of the reasons why the assessment of the application will take longer than 10 business days and the expected timeframe within which a decision will be made.</p>  <p>  If the mortgage application is refused, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 require that the regulated entity must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. Where the refusal is based on the result of the database consultation, the creditor shall inform the consumer of the result of such consultation and of the particulars of the database consulted. The Code also requires that, where a credit application is refused, the regulated entity must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and must offer to provide this information on paper or another durable medium to the consumer.</p></reply>

This strategic plan includes the National Planning Framework (NPF), which sets the overarching spatial strategy for the next twenty years, along with the National Development Plan (NDP) 2018-2027, which sets out the ten year capital and infrastructure investment strategy of &euro;116 billion.</p>  <p>  Ensuring close alignment between the two is necessary in order to accommodate a projected 1 million additional people by 2040 across Ireland's three regional assembly areas. The plan aims to ensure that 75% of growth takes place outside Dublin. One of the objectives of the review of the National Development Plan, which I announced recently, is to ensure the alignment of investment with that strategy in order to promote regional development as planned.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 provides an opportunity to successfully accommodate that growth by refocusing investment in our rural towns and villages through the support of the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, and by ensuring the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford grow at twice the pace of Dublin through the support of the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund. By delivering compact growth within our rural villages, our towns and our cities it will become possible to deliver more infrastructure to more people e.g. public transport, broadband, housing, health and a broad range of social, cultural, sporting and community services.</p>  <p>  The three Regional Assemblies are responsible for co-ordinating, promoting and supporting the strategic planning and sustainable development of their regions, by formulating Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES).  The strategy for the Northern and Western Region provides the opportunity for the priorities from the County Development Plans to be integrated into a regional investment plan which is expected to be a major driver of the implementation of the NPF.</p>  <p>  A regional report on the North West has been published on the Project Ireland 2040 website.  The report  details the specific regional projects and programmes which are being planned and delivered in the North-West as part of the public investment detailed in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department publishes a major capital projects tracker, which sets out details of the key projects and programmes being implemented under the NDP, including the location of the projects where possible.  The Tracker includes a number of major projects directly related to the Northern and Western region.  The tracker currently focuses on projects and programmes with costs greater than &euro;20 million.  While it does not provide an exhaustive list of all capital expenditure, the list of projects serves to highlight the diverse range of infrastructural demands competing for the resources of the State.</p></reply>

National policy currently requires all contracts with a value in excess of &euro;25,000 to be published on the eTenders website (as per Circular 10/14) whereas for contracts to which the EU procurement directive applies, Article 50 of the directive requires a contract award notice to be published in the OJEU within 30 days of the award of the contract.

An ambiguity around the measurement standard used as a basis for the rent calculation in Miesian Plaza was first identified during the course of an OPW internal review and subsequently in a Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General examination of the lease process in early 2018.  The variance in annual rent payment arising from the different measurement standards amounts to &euro;279,827 plus VAT.</p>  <p>  Since the issue was identified the Commissioners have engaged with the Landlord in relation to the measurement standard applied with a view to mitigating the impact of this ambiguity.  While an agreement has not yet been reached with the Landlord communications are ongoing in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Commissioners&rsquo; processes have been reviewed and strengthened to ensure a similar situation cannot arise in future.  A thorough examination of the final version of all leases is carried out by OPW staff who have not been involved in the lease negotiations, prior to execution of the lease.  This is to ensure that the final lease accurately reflects what was agreed during negotiations.</p>  <p>  Miesian Plaza is one of Dublin&rsquo;s most significant Government accommodation locations and one of the first LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design &ndash; a third party verification system for green buildings) Platinum buildings in Ireland, meeting best international energy efficiency and environmental standards for office buildings.  It provides modern, energy efficient, 4th generation office space with almost 950 workstations. It has allowed the occupying Departments to move from a highly cellular working environment to one that is modern, open plan and efficient in supporting collaborative working. It also has allowed for the release of other property in the city for potential redevelopment.</p></reply>

The guidance precludes any indoor gathering takings place at Levels 3, 4, and 5 and to date no exemptions have been made for stage schools, drama classes, exercise classes, gymnastics classes, artistic activities, athletic activities or any type of dance class whether jazz, or ballet or step-dancing.  </p>  <p>  Given the current epidemiological situation, it has been necessary to put in place very significant restrictions to arrest the current trajectory of COVID-19 and break transmission chains. This means asking people to stay at home and eliminating as much activity and contacts as is possible to ensure that opportunities for the virus to transmit are minimised, while allowing essential activities to continue. It also means minimising discretionary activities including cultural activities. Information on the public health measures currently in place in relation to the different Levels can be found at the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A-Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.8) Regulations 2020 give effect to level 5 restrictions under the Plan.  The Regulations list essential retail and essential services which may operate under level 5 restrictions.  This list does not include private or commercial dance classes.  Under the Regulations, essential education encompasses primary and post-primary schools, and higher and further education where remote learning is not possible. Where a service provider considers that they fall into the essential education category e.g. as part of the national curriculum or as part of a specific, state-sponsored course of study, they should refer to the Department of Education&rsquo;s guidance in relation to the operation of education services under Level 5 restrictions. </p>  <p>  Similarly, The Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (No.7) Regulations, which applied when the country was under Level 3 of the Plan for Living with COVID-19, did not allow any exercise or dance classes, regardless of the form e.g. Irish, ballet, jazz etc.  </p>  <p>  I fully understand the benefits that activities such as dance bring to people's overall health and well-being. The measures in place to suppress the disease transmission are intended to minimise the risks to public health while striking a balance in prioritising and protecting some activities over others. </p></reply>

The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the live performance sector while also complying with public health protection measures.  Grants ranged from &euro;10,000 to &euro;400,000. The funds will support a variety of live events planned including concerts, pantomimes, theatre productions, festivals, outdoor performances and comedy events. </p><p>In many cases, parts of grants to promoters and producers of live events would be used to hire from services from SME event companies such as those supplying sound and lighting technical expertise.</p><p>The following eligibility and criteria  applied to this pilot scheme :  <b></b></p><p>- Established commercial producers and promoters that create live performances and have a proven record of accomplishment in the live performance sector</p><p>- Proven track record of live performances undertaken in the past 3 years (2017-2019), </p><p>- Planning to hold a live performance event that will commence in 2020,</p><p>- Provide three years of financial accounts (from 2016), </p><p>- The applicant must be tax compliant,</p><p>- Not ordinarily funded by the public sector since 2017 (excluding Covid-19 supports),</p><p>- One application will be considered, initially, for each project promoter.</p><p>The scheme was heavily oversubscribed with over 100 applications seeking funding of over &euro;16m for events which would be staged in the lead up to and during the 2020 festive period.  </p><p>This was a pilot scheme and it was the first of its kind which was developed following consultation with the sector.  The operation of this scheme will inform any future similar schemes.  The Department is engaging with successful and unsuccessful applicants to assess the operation of the scheme in 2020 with a view to informing future schemes.  It is expected that a scheme of this kind will be provided in 2021 as part of a suite of measures to be funded from the &euro;50 million announced as part of Budget 2021.</p></reply>

This was in addition to a waiver on the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for Q1 and Q2 2020 which saved the sector &euro;1m.

In light of the ongoing challenges faced by the sector, I secured an additional &euro;2m in exchequer funding for the Sound and Vision Scheme under the July Stimulus Package. This greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round of the Scheme this year (round 37), bringing its total value to &euro;4.5m.  This funding round is open to those elements of the radio sector that were not eligible for the rounds to commercial and community radio earlier in the year, namely public service radio and independent audio producers, working in partnership with commercial, community and public service radio stations. In addition, the round is open to independent audio-visual producers, and commercial, community and public service television stations<b>. </b></p><p>I was pleased to note the impact the Government horizontal supports are continuing to have on substantially reducing the cost base for the commercial radio sector during the restrictions. A total of &euro;4.3m has been received across the industry from the Government&rsquo;s COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Support Scheme.Local radio has also been included in the Government&rsquo;s current advertising campaign on resilience.</p><p>The BAI continue to report to me quarterly on the Impact of COVID-19 on Commercial Radio Sector.  I recently received the quarter 3 report and I am pleased to note the small growth in advertising revenues in that  quarter.  However, I recognise that the current lockdown has again had a severe impact on the sector, especially at local level. The BAI will continue to report to me on a quarterly basis and the Q4 report will help give a picture of the overall impact on the range of supports for the year.</p><p>The BAI is currently finalising the most recent round and no decisions regarding 2021 rounds have been made as yet.  It must be recognised that the BAI is a statutorily independent body.  However, I am aware the BAI will be meeting with representatives of the commercial radio sector to discuss the approach to Sound and Vision in the New Year and I very much welcome that. I will continue to work closely with the BAI to see how we can best support the sector in the coming period.</p></reply>

Allocations were announced in January, May and November of last year with a total of over &euro;56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects. All unsuccessful applicants were given the opportunity to appeal the Department&rsquo;s decision. In relation to the capital grants announced in November, a total of 122 appeals were submitted by the December deadline.

I  intend to publish the guide to making an application and to launch the programme before the end of this month. This will include the specific details of when applications will be accepted and I expect this to be from early December. To take account of travel and other restrictions arising from the Covid pandemic I intend to give applicants until early February to complete the application process.

A fundamental aim of the Government&rsquo;s National Sports Policy 2018 -2027 is to increase the levels of participation in sport and physical activity across the population over the period of the policy, with a specific focus on less represented groups including women and girls. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, including the allocation of funding under its various programmes. It also has responsibility for the development of strategies for increasing participation in sport, including participation by women and girls.  In 2019, Sport Ireland launched its Policy on Women in Sport. The policy expresses Sport Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to women in sport. It builds on the significant work that has already been undertaken in this area within the sport sector to date and, in recognising the opportunity to make a significant impact on the lives of women through their involvement in sport, it provides a blueprint for Sport Ireland&rsquo;s future work. </p>  <p>  Sport Ireland does not provide funding direct to clubs but channels its funding through the National Governing Bodies of sport (NGBs).  In additional to funding allocated to NGBs under core grants and high performance programme, Sport Ireland also allocates funding to NGBs under the Women in Sport (WIS) programme. The WIS programme was established in 2005 and has provided funding support of over &euro;20 million to a broad range of programmes aimed at increasing participation by women and girls. </p>  <p>  As part of the new Women in Sport Policy, a revised Women in Sport investment programme was launched last year with an investment of &euro;3 million over the two years 2019 and 2020. This doubled the funding for the Women in Sport programme.   The two year funding will enable NGBs to make significant progress in their strategic objectives for women in sport. </p>  <p>  Insofar as media coverage of women&rsquo;s sport is concerned, although the current situation represents an improvement the case for further improvement is compelling. The Federation of Irish Sport's 20 x 20 campaign has highlighted the important association that media coverage has with  driving increased participation amongst the female population. Whilst coverage decisions are ultimately matters for the media organisations concerned, whether in the print or broadcast setting, I fully support greater visibility being given in all sections of the media to our many exceptional and talented female athletes. The more these are lauded, valued and respected in the public arena, the more likely it is that young girls will be inspired to follow suit.</p>  <p>  The Irish Times and Sport Ireland support women in sport with The Irish Times Sport Ireland Sportswoman of the Year Awards which recognise the abilities and achievements of women in Irish sports. Through their partnership they have highlighted the tremendous achievements of Irish Sportswomen across a range of sports, and they are committed to continuing to raise the profile of Irish Sportswomen. </p>  <p>  I am arranging for Sport Ireland to provide the Deputy with a comprehensive outline of its strategies and initiatives in place to increase participation by women and girls.  Please contact my private office if you do not hear within ten working days. </p>  <p>  In relation to Sports Capital Programme, one of the key criteria in scoring applications has always been whether the proposed project will increase participation and in this regard the scoring system for the most recent round of the SCP specifically references the likelihood of increasing female participation. A full Review of the 2018 round of the SCP has now been complete and the terms and conditions of the next round of the programme will be announced before the end of the month.  I expect that projects likely to increase female participation will continue to be prioritised when these terms and conditions and the scoring system are finalised.</p></reply>

This funding will be administered by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and focused on those strategic businesses.  In addition, the Budget provided for an additional &euro;5m investment in training and support to businesses to improve their web and digital presence.  Combined with the COVID Resilience Support Scheme (CRSS), the VAT cut and the rates waiver, the Government is helping to sustain businesses that have been most severely affected by the necessary public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  The Tourism Recovery Taskforce, which reported to me in October, undertook a comprehensive analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the sector and drew up a Recovery Plan containing over 30 recommendations across a number of areas designed to help the sector to survive and recover from the crisis out to 2023. Its short-term recommendations informed the sector-specific measures adopted in the Budget. To help inform the ongoing response to the pandemic, I will shortly appoint an Oversight Group which will monitor the implementation of the Recovery Plan as well as the recovery of the tourism sector in general.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to inter-county travel and any plans to amend related restrictions, this is a matter for consideration by the Government and no decisions have yet been made in this regard.  </p></reply>

The judgment ruled against Ireland and imposed a lump sum fine of &euro;5m and a daily fine of &euro;15,000 until compliance is achieved, plus legal costs. The &euro;5m lump sum penalty was paid in January 2020. In October 2020, &euro;2,745,000 was paid to the European Commission in respect of daily fines accrued to date. </p><p>The court judgement will be complied with when the Derrybrien Wind Farm, which is owned and operated by a subsidiary of ESB, is subjected to a retrospective Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) - otherwise known as substitute consent.</p><p>On Friday 21<sup>st</sup>August 2020, the ESB submitted a substitute consent application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board). I understand that the Board have set an indicative decision date of 4<sup>th</sup>January 2021. However, in accordance with Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be concerned.</p><p>In this regard, it would be a matter for the Board, in terms of issuing a decision on the substitute consent application, as well as for the ESB, in terms of carrying out any associated works which might be required to comply with the Board&rsquo;s decision.</p><p>Concerning the issues raised with the substitute consent legislation by the Supreme Court in the judgment referenced in the question, the judgment and its implications has been examined and my Department is working with the Office of the Attorney General to bring forward measures to address the findings of the judgment as expeditiously as possible. It is envisaged that these measures will be in place by the end of 2020 and will address substitute consent applications currently before the Board. </p><p>My Department is working closely with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, which is a shareholder of ESB and has corporate governance responsibility for same, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with respect to the resolution of the judgment and payment of the related fines. Discussions between the three Departments are ongoing.</p></reply>

In that context, Minister O'Brien and I recently wrote to each local authority to advise that, in light of the fact that the future trajectory of Covid-19 is unclear, it is not currently possible for Government to make open-ended commitments in respect of commercial rates or other income pressures that may arise in 2021.

The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme. To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions. The Minister is precluded by housing legislation from intervening in relation to the procedures followed, or decisions made, by local authorities in relation to the operation of the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provides for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living.  </p>  <p>  Local authorities may, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.

In addition, the Programme for Government commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their own home with some changes to eligibility. The review and the commitments in the Programme for Government are being examined as part of the work on the broader social housing reform agenda.

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Acts apply to dwellings let by approved housing bodies (AHBs) to social housing tenants since 7 April 2016, making the RTB dispute resolution service available to the sector and providing tenancy protections.  </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 made provision to enhance the rental data to be provided to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), including provision for the annual registration of tenancies. The aim is to gather more accurate and detailed tenancy and rental data on an annual basis to improve the information available to assist with policy formulation in the residential rental sector. </p>  <p>  The amendments to sections 137 and 137A of the Residential Tenancies  Act 2004, as amended, update the RTB tenancy registration fee in the context of the move to annual registration - providing a &euro;40 fee per tenancy registration by private providers and &euro;20 per tenancy registration by an Approved Housing Body (AHB).  Under the new annual registration requirements, a fee can only be charged in respect of the same dwelling once per year and a discounted single registration fee (&euro;170 for a private landlord, &euro;85 for an AHB landlord) can be applied where the same landlord registers up to 10 tenancies of dwellings comprised in the same property.   </p>  <p>  The key change from the existing tenancy registration fees is that AHBs will be charged fees that are half those applicable to private providers &ndash; currently, all landlords pay the same registration fee. The reduction in AHB fees is provided in recognition of the public service that they provide in meeting the housing needs of those in receipt of social housing supports, and of AHBs'  charitable (or similar) status. </p>  <p>  The legal provisions requiring the annual registration of tenancies have not yet come into operation. Preparations are underway in the RTB to roll out a simple online registration system to cater for annual registration.</p></reply>

The 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/migrated-files/en/Publications/DevelopmentandHousing/Planning/FileDownLoad%2C1620%2Cen.pdf.</p>  <p>  The National Planning Framework (the NPF) provides an important strategic basis for interpreting the 2005 Guidelines.  National Policy Objective 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.</p>  <p>  The 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines are framed in the context of the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) 2002.  Given the many changes in policy and in wider society since 2002/5, the superseding of the NSS by the NPF in 2018, together with other factors, there is now merit in updating the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines in a broader rural development and settlement context.  My Department has commenced scoping this work.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas.</p></reply>

These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF). Both schemes would accept applications for works to conserve protected structures on the grounds of schools or other institutions, provided they fulfil the eligibility criteria.  Eligible structures would normally be on the Record of Protected Structures of the relevant local authority. In the context of a particular protected structure on the grounds of a school or other institution, the best advice for the owner may be to contact the Architectural Conservation Officer in the Local Authority. They will be able to advise on the various types of funding available to assist with the building.</p><p>In 2020, 450 heritage projects across every county in the country were awarded a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under these schemes. In addition a further &euro;1m was announced for 52 built heritage projects under the Government's July Jobs Stimulus Package. The funding will supplement 28 projects already approved under the BHIS and HSF, as well as 13 new projects categorised as urgent built heritage works. The funding will also support one project under priority actions identified in the Climate Change Sectoral Adaptation Plan for the Built and Archaeological Heritage, and will assist with the progression of 10 projects with a climate change element at properties managed by the Irish Heritage Trust.</p><p>I recently announced details of funding for the 2021 grant schemes, under which &euro;3m is being made available under the BHIS and a further &euro;3m under the HSF.

Of that sum, &euro;468 million will be specifically provided to support housing affordability measures.  This includes the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF), the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan and the Land Development Agency (LDA).</p><p>In relation to the delivery of more affordable homes to purchase or rent by local authorities, the Serviced Sites Fund is available to support the cost of facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites.  The purpose of the SSF is specifically targeted at those local authorities where an affordability challenge has been clearly identified and where the provision of affordable homes is economically viable.  To support this process, local authorities were invited to submit economic assessments and Mayo County Council indicated, at that time, that the delivery of affordable housing at 10% below open market value was not considered economically viable.  Should that situation change, the Department is happy to consider updated economic assessment from local authorities.</p><p>In addition to the Services Sites Fund, Budget 2021 ring fenced &euro;75 million for a new national Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme.  I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home in private developments but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage.  To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. I intend to introduce this scheme in 2021, and intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders to inform the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme.</p><p>Other measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.As part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus plan, an enhanced version of the Help-to-Buy scheme was announced, which Budget 2021 has extended to December 2021. This will allow first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available at .</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build.

They set out the Government&rsquo;s broad framework for the delivery of housing for people with disabilities and were developed as part of a coherent framework in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, A Vision for Change (2008), and the report of the working group on congregated settings, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings (2011).  In 2016, under Rebuilding Ireland the Strategy was extended to allow it to continue to achieve its aims. </p>  <p>  The vision of the nine Strategic Aims of the Strategy is to facilitate access, for people with disabilities, to the appropriate range of housing and related support services, delivered in an integrated and sustainable manner, which promotes equality of opportunity, individual choice and independent living. Along with promoting access by people with disabilities to independent living across the full range of housing options, they provide for frameworks and protocols for effective interagency cooperation; good practice in design, coordination and delivery of housing and related supports; improved collection and use of data for evidence based implementation; research and development of universal design standards; access to appropriate advice and information in respect of housing need; and a framework to support the delivery, monitoring and review of agreed actions.</p>  <p>  The Implementation Framework for the Strategy, developed by a high-level implementation planning  group, is comprised of 18 priority actions, supported by a number of key measures with responsibility for these assigned to key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  Progress under the Strategy is reported in the annual report of the Implementation Monitoring Group for the Strategy. Five reports of the Implementation Monitoring Group for the Housing of People with a Disability have been published to date.

All five reports are available at the following link:</p>  <p>  www.housing.gov.ie/housing/policy/people-disability/housing-people-disability.</p>  <p>  The sixth report for 2019 will be published shortly.</p>  <p>  The National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability will be reviewed by my Department and the Department of Health in 2021 in consultation with all stakeholders.

This review particularly highlighted that while the arrangements had generally been a success in providing a fast-track development consent process for developers of large-scale housing developments, the number of SHD permissions that have commenced development is less than might have been expected. </p>  <p>  The status of individual developments which have been granted permission under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, is not routinely maintained by my Department given that some 30,000 planning permissions are granted nationally on an annual basis. My Department has conducted periodic research on the activation rate of SHD permissions and the most recent data in this regard would indicate that works have commenced on 29% of SHD permissions granted to date since the arrangements came into operation. There can be some delay, for various reasons, in the activation of housing developments post the granting of permission. In this regard, if permissions granted in 2020 are excluded from the calculations, the data indicates that works have commenced on 45% of the SHD permissions granted in 2018 (when the first permissions were granted) and 2019.</p>  <p>  While obtaining planning permission is an essential step in any project, there are other factors at play that may impact on the commencement of any project, such as phasing of development (having to complete an existing project before commencing on another), finances, economic factors etc.</p>  <p>  However, given the benefits that the SHD arrangements provide, it is considered appropriate that developers should be sufficiently motivated to commence development on foot of an SHD permission in a timely manner, given the efficiencies that the SHD arrangements provide and in order to ensure the objectives of the SHD arrangements are more clearly met.</p>  <p>  In this regard, with a view to influencing the earlier activation of housing related planning permissions, the new Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future commits to introducing a "use it or lose it" condition for all planning permissions of ten housing units or more.  My Department is presently progressing the drafting of the necessary legislation providing for the introduction of the proposed new "use it or lose it" housing-related planning arrangements. This will be progressed over the coming months.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to not extending the SHD arrangements beyond their legislative expiry of end December 2021, which has now been extended to February 2022 arising from Covid-related shutdown of the planning system for 8 weeks, which extended all planning timelines by 8 weeks. The process for winding up the SHD arrangements will be considered by my Department over the coming months.</p></reply>

However, details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority area is provided in the annual statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA). The purpose of the SSHA is to capture the total number of households qualified for social housing support across the country whose social housing need has not yet been met, in order to better inform policy and plan for the delivery of the right types of housing support.</p><p>The most recent summary, from June 2019 shows that 68,693 households were qualified for, and in need of, social housing support.  Of this number, 4,126 households or 6% were those who had a specific need for housing based on disability. Below is the link to the summary report for 2019 which includes breakdowns by each local authority, across a range of categories. Details on the length of time spent on the record of qualified households (waiting lists) can be found at tables 2.8 and A1.8 of the report.</p><p><b>Report 2019</b></p><p>https://www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/sha_summary_2019_dec_2019_web_1.pdf. </p><p>According to figures collated by the Housing Agency, in 2019 there were 2,389 allocations of social housing to households with disability as a primary basis of need. This represents 12% of total allocations for 2019. This demonstrates that local authorities are making progress in meeting the needs of persons with disabilities on the social housing waiting list.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of new social homes through local authority and Approved Housing Body led build, acquisition and leasing schemes and also the provision of key supports to maintain people with disabilities within their existing homes.</p>  <p>  In respect of construction funding, over the period 2016-2019, my Department provided almost &euro;2.1 billion to local authorities to deliver new social homes, including new homes for people with disabilities.  I will arrange for my officials to provide the Deputy with this breakdown by local authority.  The detailed breakdown of housing funding in 2020 will be finalised at year-end. Prior to 2016 housing expenditure was reported on a programme basis, which encompassed multiple delivery streams.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000. Budget 2021 has made available &euro;3.3bn towards the wide range of housing programmes, which will deliver 12,750 new social homes next year, including a record 9,500 new Build homes. These new homes are designed and planned using guidelines, build standards and planning regulations supported by my Department. </p>  <p>  The Capital Assistance Scheme also provides for the delivery of homes for persons with disabilities. In addition, my Department also provides a range of specialised grants, including the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability scheme (up to &euro;30,000) and the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme (up to &euro;6,000).  These grants assist people with disabilities to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out and to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household. </p>  <p>  It is a matter for local authorities to ensure that the number and specific types of dwellings provided in their social housing developments meet local needs. My Department does not hold specific details in relation to the number of individual houses built or procured for persons with disabilities in each local authority during this period.  However, this information should be available from the individual local authorities </p></reply>

With a view to giving effect to this commitment and the actions outlined in the PFG, a TCF inter-Departmental Group (IDG) has now recently been established to consider the regeneration of our towns and villages with the first meeting held earlier this month.</p>  <p>  The IDG is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development and aims to progress the commitment and associated actions in relation to the Town Centre First approach in the Programme for Government. This will involve both the Terms of Reference for the IDG and an initial scoping of the policy proposal with recommendations to be developed over the next six months. </p>  <p>  As outlined above, a TCF policy is at the very early stages of development which will require both a scoping of high-level objectives through the forum of the IDG with many strands to be considered including that of appropriate stakeholder engagement and public consultation.</p>  <p>  In parallel, I am in the process of establishing a Town Centre First advisory group, to enable the experiences of a broader group of stakeholders to be brought to bear in informing the process of policy development. I will be chairing  the TCF advisory group myself, with the first meeting to be held in December.</p></reply>

The need for online technology in the planning system has been particularly highlighted during the measures introduced to mitigate against Covid 19 when travel restrictions prevented the public from travelling to view files in local authority planning offices and generally participating in the planning process.  Arising from this, the ePlanning Project Board was requested by my Department to consider the accelerated the development and rollout of ePlanning nationwide with a view to bringing the system onstream as speedily as possible. The LGMA is currently preparing a schedule for the rollout of ePlanning nationwide to all local authorities on a phased basis, which is expected to commence in Q1 2021 and with a view to completion by Q2 2022.</p></reply>

The existing legislation would be entirely replaced by the proposed Monuments and Archaeological Heritage Bill.</p>  <p>  The intended purpose of the proposed legislation inter alia, is to streamline the current multiple systems of monument protection into a single Register with two levels of protection for monuments and to harmonise the system for protection of underwater cultural heritage with that for archaeological heritage on land. The introduction of a statutory reporting scheme, with associated automatic legal protection, for new discoveries of archaeological sites will represent a major strengthening of legal protection for archaeological sites. The various forms of licenses and consents that exist under current legislation would be replaced with an integrated licensing system for works and other activities regulated under it.</p>  <p>  The proposed Bill represents, therefore, an important measure of regulatory reform to the benefit of all whose activities are regulated under the existing Acts (including landowners, developers and heritage professionals) while at the same time enhancing protection for the archaeological heritage itself. It also provides for clear civil enforcement powers in relation to contraventions of the legislation. Under the existing Acts, criminal prosecution is the only statutory option for dealing with statutory breaches. This will be combined with modernised prosecution and evidentiary procedures so that prosecution will also remain a viable option where merited.</p>  <p>  Consultation in preparing the proposed Bill has taken place with Government bodies and other key stakeholders and it is now at an advanced stage of progress. I look forward to engaging with other key interest groups in due course in order to broaden public knowledge and awareness of this very significant piece of proposed legislation.</p></reply>

The Acts allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk. </p><p>Responsibility for management and maintenance of historical buildings and sites in State ownership, and management of related visitor facilities, rests with the Office of Public Works (OPW) which also maintains a significant ongoing programme of conservation works. This year, my Department has allocated &euro;350,000 to the OPW for the maintenance of historic buildings and sites and we expect to allocate a further &euro;400,000 before the end of the year. </p><p>My Department provides financial support for the protection of heritage buildings and historic structures through two grant schemes which are, in the main, administered by the local authorities. These are the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) and the Historic Structures Fund (HSF). This year some 450 heritage projects across every county in the country are benefiting from a combined sum of over &euro;4.3m under these schemes. </p><p>An extra &euro;1m in funding was secured for built heritage projects under the July Jobs Stimulus Package 2020, which aims to offset some of the effects of Covid-19. This funding supplemented 28 BHIS and SRF projects and supported 12 new ones, in addition to capital works by the Heritage Council and the Irish Heritage Trust.</p><p>I recently launched the BHIS and HSF for 2021, with a combined allocation of &euro;6m, an increase of nearly 40%. Full details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and on the website of each local authority. </p><p>My Department announced a call for projects in September under the Community Monuments Fund (CMF) for investment in our archaeological heritage, which is being funded under the July Jobs Stimulus Package. The CMF is prioritised for local authorities, private owners and custodians, and community groups for the care, maintenance, protection and promotion of local monuments and historic sites and the provision of any required measures to ensure safe access during the Covid-19 pandemic. Total funding available for the scheme in 2020 is &euro;900,000 and 69 projects nationally are being supported this year.  I hope shortly to announce a continuance of the scheme for next year.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, preparation is well advanced in my Department on <i>Heritage Ireland 2030</i>, Ireland&rsquo;s new national heritage plan. It will be a coherent, comprehensive and inspiring framework of values, principles, strategic priorities and actions to guide and inform the heritage sector over the next decade. <i>Heritage Ireland 2030</i>will be published in the new year and will address priority issues for heritage that are identified in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

This represents a decrease of 3,165 households or 4.4% on the last assessment in June 2018. Since 2016, the numbers have decreased from 91,600 to 68,693, a reduction of 25%.</p><p>Following is the link to the summary report for 2019 which includes breakdowns by each local authority, across a range of categories, including the Main Need for Social Housing Support which captures needs that a household may have based on a disability. </p><p>In relation to the questions posed by the Deputy regarding the number of families that have in the year to date applied for local authority or special needs housing, information of this specific type is not held by my Department. It should be noted that the SSHA is a point in time snapshot of the demand for social housing support in each local authority area and does not necessarily reflect the dynamic nature of entry to and exit from the housing waiting lists.</p><p>  </p><p>While the SSHA is normally conducted in or around June, given the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on local authorities and nature of the work involved in conducting the SSHA, the SSHA for 2020 was deferred to allow local authorities to continue to focus their resources on immediate priorities. However, recognising that the SSHA is a very important part of the evidence base for housing policy at both local authority and national level, I have directed local authorities to carry out the SSHA 2020 in November 2020.</p><p>Local authorities assess an application for social housing supports from people with disabilities in the same manner as other applications but take account of the specific needs outlined by that person in their application for supports. If specific adaptations are required to accommodate an applicant for social housing supports the applicant submits a report from an Occupational Therapist.</p><p>One of the key measures achieved in 2016 under the National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability was the establishment of Housing and Disability Steering Groups (HDSGs) in all housing authorities, to achieve a coordinated and integrated approach to meeting the housing needs of people with a disability at local level.  These are chaired by Directors of Housing in each authority and include HSE and disability representative organisations.  Each HDSG has prepared a local Strategic Plan for its own City/County area, to develop specific local strategies to meet identified and emerging need over the next five years. These Plans, along with the annual Summary of Social Housing Assessments, will allow local authorities to plan more strategically for the housing needs of people with a disability and will support the delivery of accommodation using all appropriate housing supply mechanisms.</p><p>In relation to affordable housing, the first project that will deliver affordable homes via the Serviced Sites Fund will be Boherboy Road in Cork City next year.</p><p>I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin the provision of affordable housing in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill which will be brought to Government in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

The first SSF project that will be deliver affordable homes will be Boherboy Road in Cork City in early next year at prices ranging from &euro;200,000.</p><p>Details of all SSF projects that have received approval in principle under both SSF calls, and the number of more affordable homes whose delivery will be supported by SSF funding are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following links: </p><p>Call 1: </p><p>Call 2: </p><p>The selling price of homes that will be made available for purchase under the local authority affordable dwelling purchase arrangements will be influenced by a number of factors which will vary significantly from individual development to development.  This includes the overall development cost of each particular development the housing type/tenure mix involved and the local housing market.  The majority of the projects approved for funding under the SSF are at the planning and design stage. As such, the final sales prices will not be fully determined until planning permission has been obtained and after the procurement process for construction of the development in question has been completed.</p><p>In Budget 2021, &euro;75 million was ring-fenced for the national affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage. </p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme. </p><p>It is envisaged that the homes delivered under this scheme, supported by Government investment, will be made available to applicants who meet defined eligibility criteria. The precise eligibility conditions are currently being developed in light of the engagement outlined. </p><p>Other measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable. </p><p>An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021. This allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available on the Revenue website. </p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build.  This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan.  Full details of the scheme are available on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website.</p></reply>

The Government has provided a strong national policy response through the National Planning Framework (NPF) and the Action Plan for Rural Development, which identify the need to reverse these trends and revitalise rural towns and villages by attracting new residents. </p><p>In this context, the Programme for Government (PFG) has committed in outline to the development of a Town Centre First (TCF) policy.  With a view to giving effect to this commitment and the actions outlined in the PFG, a TCF inter-Departmental Group (IDG) has now been established to consider the regeneration of our towns and villages.  Both my Department and the Department of Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands are currently formulating this joint approach which will involve both the IDG and a wider Advisory Group of stakeholders, that I will chair, in advancing an initial scoping of the policy proposals. As part of this, measures and proposals to support more serviced sites closer to urban settlements will be examined, within the broader context of the issues effecting such places as already outlined. It is anticipated that any recommendations forthcoming from the TCF approach will be developed over the next six months.</p><p>The National Planning Framework (NPF) acknowledges that rural settlements are not suitable for a suburban or a high density approach to development and tailored design approaches are needed. The NPF also recognises that in rural Ireland many people seek to have an opportunity to build their own homes.  Under <b>National Policy Objective 18b</b>my Department is committed to developing a programme with local authorities, public infrastructure agencies such as Irish Water and local communities for the provision of serviced sites for housing to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages.</p><p>Consideration will also need to be given to the expansion of towns and villages in a sustainable manner.  Such development will be incremental, small scale, walkable (including to and from the town/village centre) and will occur on sites that have access adequate water supply and provision for disposal of domestic effluent.  Such extensions should also be guided by responsive design principles so that they appear as a natural extensions to the town/village with a close visual relationship to the prevailing vernacular.  My Department is addressing this in the context the development of &lsquo;sustainable settlement guidance&rsquo;, work on which will be progressing over the coming months.</p></reply>

Full details of the approvals are available online at www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF.</p><p>Of the 30 projects, 2 projects will not proceed. Kildare County Council has confirmed that the Naas Inner Relief Road will not progress and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has confirmed that the Clay Farm project will now not proceed. </p><p>Currently, 5 LIHAF projects have completed infrastructure construction. Up to the end of October 2020, 12 projects are at infrastructure construction stage or have been approved to move to same.  Of the remaining 11 projects, one is expected to have a tender approved in Q4 2020 and go to construction in Q1 2021.  </p><p>10 are not yet ready to go to infrastructure tender stage, a precursor to receive approval to proceed to construction. Of these ten, five are advancing through the detailed design and planning stage and the remaining five projects are currently under review. My Department while reviewing these projects will consider requests from local authorities for extensions to the funding agreements as and when they arise.</p><p>In terms of LIHAF funding drawdown, thus far, most infrastructure projects have been at the design, planning and procurement stages, and the bulk of expenditure will arise during the construction phase.  This is reflected in the level of expenditure to end October 2020, with approximately &euro;52.279 million in Exchequer funds drawn down (matched by a further 25% local authority funding bringing the total expenditure to &euro;69.705m). The table below details the exchequer funding drawn down up to end of October 2020. <table>    <tr>       <th>Local Authority  </th>       <th>Project Name  </th>       <th>Drawdown of LIHAF funding   Exchequer Contribution to end of October 2020 (&euro;)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare  </td>       <td>Claureen, Ennis  </td>       <td><div>157,919</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City  </td>       <td>Old Whitechurch Road  </td>       <td><div>7,439,757</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City  </td>       <td>South Docks  </td>       <td><div>2,300,316</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork City </td>       <td>Glanmire </td>       <td><div>606,240</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County  </td>       <td>Midleton (Water-rock)  </td>       <td><div>388,645</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork County  </td>       <td>Carrigaline</td>       <td><div>450,000</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City  </td>       <td>Dodder Bridge  </td>       <td><div>637,480</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin City  </td>       <td>Belmayne and Clongriffin  </td>       <td><div>415,421</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown  </td>       <td>Cherrywood</td>       <td><div>2,939,404</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown  </td>       <td>Woodbrook Shanganagh  </td>       <td><div>0</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown  </td>       <td>Clay Farm  </td>       <td><div>0</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal  </td>       <td>Donabate Distributor Road  </td>       <td><div>10,780,000</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal  </td>       <td>Oldtown Mooretown  </td>       <td><div>4,020,000</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Fingal  </td>       <td>Baldoyle Stapolin  </td>       <td><div>2,199,322</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Naas  </td>       <td><div>470,190</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Maynooth</td>       <td><div>430,620</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>Sallins</td>       <td><div>654,584</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>Ferrybank</td>       <td><div>350,000</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>Western Environs  </td>       <td><div>5,577,215</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>Mungret</td>       <td><div>2,131,399</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth  </td>       <td>Newtown Drogheda  </td>       <td><div>88,577</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth  </td>       <td>Mount Avenue Dundalk  </td>       <td><div>172,945</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath  </td>       <td>Ratoath</td>       <td><div>1,297,186</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath  </td>       <td>Farganstown, Navan  </td>       <td><div>3,743,972</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin  </td>       <td>Kilcarbery/Corkagh Grange  </td>       <td><div>883,846</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin  </td>       <td>Clonburris SDZ  </td>       <td><div>31,053</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>South Dublin  </td>       <td>Adamstown</td>       <td><div>2,072,178</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City and County Council  </td>       <td>Gracedieu</td>       <td><div>112,234</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford City and County Council  </td>       <td>Kilbarry</td>       <td><div>1,845,714</div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>Brawny Road, Athlone  </td>       <td><div>82,500</div></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The Government subsequently announced a three month extension of the waiver until 27 December 2020, at an additional cost of &euro;300m.

In that context, Minister O'Brien and I recently wrote to each local authority to advise that, in light of the fact that the future trajectory of Covid-19 is unclear, it is not currently possible for Government to make open-ended commitments in respect of commercial rates or other income pressures that may arise in 2021. However, as has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department will continue to engage regularly and constructively with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic and other matters arising.</p></reply>

On foot of the restrictions introduced by the Government on 21 October last, I understand that the PRA implemented its Business Continuity Plan Level 5 response for the continued provision of essential services, which continues to facilitate physical/social distancing and meets public health requirements.   </p>  <p>  I understand that the current number of staff employed by the Property Registration Authority (PRA) is 571, representing 528 full-time equivalents (FTE).  There are currently 245 (258 FTE) staff working from home in addition to the continuation of temporary alternative arrangements for 307 (279 FTE) staff attending the work premises, though this can vary week-to-week depending on business needs.  Home working is a balanced with the requirement to continue to provide the most effective and efficient services to the public.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the current arrangements are temporary and are in line with the Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19 and with the Guidance and FAQs for Public Service Employers during COVID-19.</p></reply>

At the same time, I understand from that Department that while tree trimming may arise in a very limited number of cases, it is not typically needed for a connection as the fibre can often be threaded through overhanging trees. Nor is this matter viewed as in any way impeding the rollout programme. </p></reply>

This represents an increase of &euro;641m or 24% on 2020 and the single biggest spend on housing by any Government, and will be the largest build programme in the history of the State. </p><p>From this sum, &euro;110 million was ring-fenced for two new national schemes to deliver more affordable housing: the Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme, and the Cost Rental Equity Loan facility<b></b>to help deliver Cost Rental homes. Both of these programmes will begin in 2021. </p><p>&euro;75 million will be allocated to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  I intend to target the scheme at first time buyers, who are seeking to buy a new home but who cannot quite secure the full mortgage amount to do so at the present time. Subject to the final qualifying criteria, the scheme would see the State take a limited equity stake in a property, in order to help more people meet the cost of buying a new home with their available mortgage. </p><p>To this end, significant preparatory work has already been carried out by my Department working primarily with the Housing Agency and the Department of Finance. Intensive engagement continues with key stakeholders informing the final detailed parameters of the scheme, as well as with home builders to seek to increase the output of new homes in response to the new scheme. </p><p>In addition, &euro;35m has been allocated to the new Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) facility to support Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to deliver approximately 350 Cost Rental homes at scale from next year.  Added to the 50 Cost Rental homes that will be delivered in Enniskerry Road, Stepaside in Q3 2021, it will accelerate delivery in this new sector in advance of the Land Development Agency's planned future output and the work of local authorities. This scheme will leverage the proven expertise and capacity of the AHBs, demonstrated in their development and management of social housing units.</p><p>The CREL scheme will see financing made available to AHBs on favourable terms to cover 30% of the costs for Cost Rental homes. CREL funding will be provided on similar terms to the existing Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF) model which is extensively used by AHBs for social housing. In terms of the remaining 70% of capital costs, subject to appropriate conditions, it is anticipated that long term competitive financing will be made available to the AHBs by the Housing Finance Agency. This will allow cost-covering rents to be set a lower level and so making them more affordable for tenants. Further details on the scheme will be announced in due course. </p><p>It is envisaged that the homes delivered under these schemes, supported by Government investment, will be made available to applicants who meet defined eligibility criteria. The precise eligibility conditions are currently being developed in light of the on-going policy analysis outlined. I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill which will be brought to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>In addition to these new schemes, I will also progress and accelerate the local authority led scheme to deliver more affordable homes for purchase and rent on public land.  The statutory basis for the delivery of affordable new housing for purchase on local authority lands is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced in June 2018.  Following engagement with the local authority sector, it is my intention to bring forward a number of legislative amendments to underpin this scheme in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill. </p><p>The broad parameters of the local authority led Affordable Purchase Scheme will be as follows:</p><p>- aimed at first-time buyers who are low to middle households;</p><p>- homes purchased under the scheme will be subject to a maximum statutory discount of 40% (relative to the market price), with the final price of the affordable homes to be linked to the cost of provision, on a site by site basis, and</p><p>- the local authority maintains a fully repayable equity share in the properties equivalent tothe percentage discount given</p><p>Furthermore, &euro;310m is available to local authorities for Serviced Sites infrastructure funding that will support the delivery of up to 6,200 new homes that will be made available under this scheme.  The first SSF project that will be deliver affordable homes will be Boherboy Road in Cork City in early next year.</p><p>It is envisaged that the homes delivered under all of the above schemes will be made available to applicants who meet defined eligibility criteria. The precise eligibility conditions are currently being developed in light of the on-going policy analysis outlined. I intend to bring forward any necessary provisions to underpin these schemes in a forthcoming Affordable Housing Bill which will be brought to Government in the coming weeks. </p><p>The Land Development Agency (LDA) will also play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of more affordable housing, as promised in the Programme for Government. The LDA is currently developing 9 sites that have near-term delivery potential for 3,600 new homes, the majority of which will be for Cost Rental and affordable purchase. It is also engaged in the progression of a number of other sites with potential for significant housing output.  In the longer term, it will assemble strategic land-banks from a mix of public and private lands, making these available for housing in a controlled manner, which will bring essential long-term stability and sustainability to the Irish housing system.</p><p>Other measures, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable. </p><p>An enhanced Help to Buy scheme was announced as part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus package, which was extended to December 2021 as part of Budget 2021. This allows first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available on the Revenue website. </p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build.  This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan.  Full details of the scheme are available on the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website.</p></reply>

Contract law governs such arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 provided for, among other things, the establishment of a tenancy deposit protection scheme to be operated by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).</p>  <p>  There have been significant changes in the rental market since the 2015 scheme was first envisaged and designed. For example, the 2015 scheme was intended to be financed by the interest payable on deposits lodged; this is no longer viable, given the current financial market conditions. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that disputes relating to deposits are no longer the most common dispute type referred to the RTB.</p>  <p>  Financing the operation of the scheme is an important consideration, particularly in terms of ensuring that the likely outcomes of a new scheme are achieved efficiently and effectively and that the best value from public funds is secured. Careful consideration is therefore required to introduce any necessary reforms and enhancements to the 2015 scheme, with a view to considering whether and how to introduce a re-designed scheme that is fit for purpose and suitable for current and future rental and financial markets. </p>  <p>  Any review of the scope and provisions of a Deposit Protection scheme will need to take account of changes in the residential sectors since the 2015 Deposit Protection Scheme legal provisions were enacted, to inform any necessary legislative change. Consideration will need to be given as to whether or not it is feasible to proceed to revise and implement a deposit protection scheme at this time, or to defer to a later point in time, when the RTB's Change Management Plan has been fully implemented and more robust data and information is available for consideration.</p></reply>

The key provisions of the Act make it a criminal offence for landlords to implement rent increases that contravene the law, that do not adhere to the new definition of a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation for the purpose of an exemption from the 4% p.a. rent increase restriction, or fail to cooperate with an RTB investigation, or fail to register and update tenancies with the RTB.</p>  <p>  The Act provides powers to the RTB to investigate and administratively sanction (up to &euro;30,000) landlords who engage in improper conduct including non-compliance with the rent increase restriction in RPZs and allows the RTB to initiate an investigation without the need for a complaint to be made. The RTB actively pursues landlords for non-registration.</p>  <p>  An increase of &euro;2M in  Current Exchequer Funding was provided to the  Residential Tenancies Board (RTB)  for 2020 , bringing the total amount of funding for operational costs for the RTB to &euro;9M  and a further additional &euro;2M in Current Exchequer funding for RTB operational costs has been secured in Budget 2021.</p>  <p>  The RTB received santion for an additional 29 staff in 2019 in order that it would be resourced to deliver on its broadened mandate and sanction for a further additional 5 staff was granted in July 2020 following the Residential Tenancies and Valuations Act 2020. </p>  <p>  The increase in funding and staff  provided to the RTB is designed to ensure that  the new legislative provisions introduced in both 2019 and 2020 are fully  and focrefully implemented. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies and Valuations Act  2020, which provides protection for tennats impacted economically by Covid-19,  has further expanded the RTB&rsquo;s mandate and added to the complexity of its operations.  </p>  <p>  There has been significant engagement with tenants and landlords around the Covid-19 Emergency Legislation and the 2020 Act to educate and support landlords and tenants on the provisions of the new legislation, including a number of Guidance and FAQ documents and a mailshot leaflet issued to every landlord and tenant registered with the RTB.   It is envisaged that as we move through Covid-19 and deal with the social and economic impact of the pandemic that more measures, including legislative changes, will be required for those tenants and landlords impacted by issues such as rent arrears, overholding and evictions.   Increased activities will be required to engage fully with the sector and support tenants and landlords during these difficult times, including the provision of increased direct supports and continued targeted education and awareness campaigns.</p>  <p>  I want to confirm my overall support for the RTB and the best way I can do this is by providing it with the resources it requires to be effective.</p></reply>

Demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education infrastructure, is contrary to Israel&rsquo;s obligations under international humanitarian law, and in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p>  <p>  I was deeply dismayed to learn of the demolition by Israeli authorities on 3 November of more than 70 structures, belonging to 11 Palestinian families in the community of Humsa Al Bqai&rsquo;a (also referred to as Khirbet Humsa) located in the northern Jordan Valley. These demolitions include residential, livelihood and sanitation facilities.</p>  <p>  I issued a statement on these demolitions on 6 November in which I underlined that destruction of private property such as this is clearly prohibited under international humanitarian law. Israel, as the occupying power, has clear obligations towards members of this community, including the 41 children impacted by the demolitions.</p>  <p>  On 6 November, Ireland&rsquo;s Representative Office in Ramallah visited the site of the demolitions, along with other diplomatic representatives. Ireland, the EU, and the wider humanitarian community are ready to support those impacted and the West Bank Protection Consortium, of which Ireland is a member, is providing emergency shelter and support to affected families.</p>  <p>  While my primary concern is the hardship and injustice that demolitions and confiscations cause for Palestinian families, it is important that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers should be pursued. Ireland pursues this issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium. It is the practice of the Consortium to raise this directly with the Israeli authorities and to date, the Consortium has sought compensation of over &euro;625,000 in respect of confiscated or demolished assets.</p></reply>

Roster members were selected on the basis of an open competitive application process in 2018. This process has ensured that 1) there is a suitably skilled, trained and security-vetted pool of volunteers who are available to participate in certain election observation missions (EOMs), which can arise at short notice; and 2) there is greater efficiency, as EOM calls are circulated to roster members who are pre-vetted and responsible for ensuring their online profiles with the EU and OSCE are correctly maintained as required. The roster consists of 199 volunteers and thus there is a large pool of high-calibre election observers available for nomination to international election observation missions (EOMs) organised by the EU and OSCE. By way of context, the average number of roster members participating in missions annually is fewer than 60. The number of volunteers on the roster compared to the number required annually allows for a sufficiently wide distribution of nominations among suitably qualified and vetted individuals over the lifetime of the roster, subject to fulfillment of any particular requirements set by the sending agencies (EU/OSCE). Nominating countries to international observation missions, including EU countries, follow a range of different modalities in managing their own rosters, which is a matter for each member State to decide on for themselves.</p>  <p>  The Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs has conducted a review, with independent input, of the International Election Observation Roster. That review will be presented to the Department&rsquo;s Independent Audit Committee at one of their regular meetings and subsequently published and we will be happy to provide a copy to the Deputy upon publication. </p>  <p>  The duration of the roster is one aspect considered in this review. While it is possible to reduce the duration of the roster this would also, logically, lead to a reduction in the membership of the roster which would reduce opportunities available to volunteers interested in applying for the next mustering.  More frequent musterings would also generate increased overheads and opportunity costs to my Department, which would have to be weighed in the balance of any decision.</p>  <p>  Ireland has not nominated observers to participate in international election observation missions (EOMs) of the OSCE/ODIHR and EU since March 2020. The decision not to nominate volunteers for EOMs was made on foot of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of measures to combat this unprecedented global public health emergency. The basis for the decision has been outlined in detail in response to Parliamentary Questions No. 396 of 6 October, No. 158 of 15 October, No. 655 of 3 November and No. 400 of 10 November. As detailed, the decision is based chiefly on considerations for the health and safety of all concerned. Factors taken into account include public health measures and overseas travel advice in Ireland; the COVID-19 incidence rate in Ireland and abroad; and the risk of observers being exposed and/or exposing others to COVID-19 through a) international travel, b) extensive in-country travel, c) close contact with residents as well as election observers from other countries, and d) contact with family and others on return to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, during the same period the OSCE suspended standard EOMs due to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. An OSCE EOM to North Macedonia, which had commenced activities on 1 March 2020, was suspended due to the global health emergency and all election observation personnel already in place were withdrawn. Subsequently, the OSCE requested nominations for short-term observers (STOs) for elections in Montenegro, Ukraine, Georgia and Republic of Moldova but due to public health reasons reconstituted the missions as a Limited Election Observation Missions (LEOM). Department of Foreign Affairs officials continue to monitor and evaluate EOM requests as they arise in line with the very many health and safety factors to be taken into account, as outlined above.</p>  <p>  As stated in the response to Parliamentary Question No. 400 of 3 November, the Department of Foreign Affairs, along with other concerned Departments and public bodies, participates in the COVID-19 Senior Officials' Group coordinated by Department of An Taoiseach. This working group is concerned with ensuring the operation and services of Departments and public bodies are aligned with the COVID-19 (Level 5) framework currently in place. In the event that the possibility of resuming nomination to international election observation missions is likely, that Group would be the proper forum for broader consultation to consider the risks to public health as outlined above.</p></reply>

If not contained, this conflict could threaten the stability of Ethiopia, Africa&rsquo;s second most populous country, and have serious regional implications for the wider Horn of Africa, one of the continent&rsquo;s most fragile regions. </p>  <p>  Ireland is actively supporting the efforts of the EU and wider international community to de-escalate the situation, including through engagement with the African Union which has appointed three Special Envoys. Minister Coveney has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the commencement of a national dialogue to de-escalate tensions.  Minister Coveney has also condemned the reported atrocities and identity-based attacks. It is essential to ensure that the human rights of all Ethiopians are upheld. I am gravely concerned by reports that Ethiopia&rsquo;s federal military has said civilians should protect themselves from heavy artillery, in advance of a planned assault against the regional capital. I urge all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law.</p>  <p>  The situation in Ethiopia was raised by HRVP Borrell at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 19 November. Minister Coveney intervened calling for continued EU efforts to push for a resolution of the crisis, and stressed the need to act fast and collectively to call for unconditional, unrestricted access for humanitarian actors to affected areas.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Addis Ababa is engaging closely with other EU Heads of Mission, the UN and other members of the international community in monitoring, reporting and advocating on the situation and in preparing for an emergency humanitarian response.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s largest bilateral development cooperation programme is in Ethiopia.  The Embassy of Ireland is in the process of providing &euro;416,000 to the humanitarian response in Tigray, along with a projected &euro;500,000 to support refugees in Eastern Sudan. My Department is actively looking at ways to address other critical funding needs in light of the escalating humanitarian situation.</p></reply>

Securing an overall future relationship agreement, including the best possible outcome on fisheries, is a priority for Ireland. I have repeatedly raised fisheries as a priority for Ireland in my bilateral political contacts, as indeed has the Taoiseach, Minister McConalogue and other members of the Government.  In particular we, and our EU partners, are very clear that the issue of fisheries cannot be separated from the wider trade negotiations.</p>  <p>  Ireland is seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in relation to access conditions, quota shares and the traditional activity of the EU fleet, while insisting that fisheries issues are dealt with as part of an overall trade deal. It is vital that we do everything possible to protect our vulnerable coastal communities and fishers. In particular, it will be important to ensure no EU Member States are disproportionately affected by any new arrangements.</p>  <p>  From the outset of the negotiations, Ireland and our EU partners have been clear on our level of ambition in this area and on the fact that progress on an overall economic partnership agreement on trade is linked to progress on fisheries.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Stakeholder Forum, which I chair, meets regularly to discuss progress in the EU-UK Future Relationship negotiations, and is attended by representatives of the fisheries sector.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the two sides are still very far apart even as we approach the final stages of the negotiations. The European Commission Task Force, led by Michel Barnier, is continuing to work towards achieving an overall agreement, and for a satisfactory outcome on this area.  Affected Member States, including Ireland, are continuing our very close engagement with the Taskforce on the EU approach.</p></reply>

The aim of the Recovery Fund is to support the sustainable and resilient recovery of Member States&rsquo; economies from the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall MFF/Recovery Fund package is a fair and balanced outcome and is testament to the solidarity shown by Member States to deal with this once in a generation crisis and will assist us all in our recovery from the current pandemic.</p>  <p>  As part of the final agreement reached on the MFF and Recovery Fund package in July, it was agreed to establish a new special Brexit Adjustment Reserve worth &euro;5 billion to counter the unforeseen and adverse consequences in those Member States and sectors that are worst affected by Brexit. The European Council invited the European Commission to present a proposal for a special Brexit instrument by November 2020 at the latest. </p>  <p>  Throughout the negotiations on the MFF and more recently in discussions I have had with my EU counterparts and with the Commissioner with responsibility for the Budget and Administration portfolio, Johannes Hahn, I highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s unique vulnerability to Brexit, the exposure of key sectors of Ireland&rsquo;s economy to trade with the UK, and the disproportionate impact on Ireland&rsquo;s economy as a result of Brexit.</p>  <p>  We continue to work closely with the European Commission to ensure that the Fund targets the sectors and Member States most disproportionately impacted by Brexit.  In my discussions with Commissioner Hahn, I also indicated our support for a Fund that provides early certainty on the level of funding allocated to a Member State, ensures funds flow quickly so that beneficiaries can mitigate negative impacts early, and is flexible in recognition of national specificities as to the impact of Brexit.</p></reply>

It is clear that unlocking a deal will only be possible if appropriate arrangements are found on the key issues of the level playing field for open and fair competition, governance and on fisheries, a key national interest for Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Both sides agreed in intensifying the negotiations in October that regardless of progress in individual workstreams, nothing is agreed until an overall agreement is reached.  Nevertheless we understand that progress has been made in recent weeks in a range of other areas of importance to Ireland, including on connectivity, as well as on police and judicial cooperation.</p>  <p>  Any deal must involve compromises on all sides. However, a deal cannot come at any price. The EU cannot accept proposals that impact on the integrity of the Single Market or damage the long term political and economic interests of the Union. We recognise that the UK also has its red lines. The work of the negotiators is to find a set of arrangements that respects both the EU and UK&rsquo;s values and interests, and that gives us a strong and sustainable framework for the vital cooperation between us.</p>  <p>  Michel Barnier has our full support, and the support of the entire EU27, at this crucial moment in the negotiating process. As the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator, he has been central to the united, cohesive approach of the EU27 throughout the Brexit process, including during its most critical moments. The universal confidence and respect he inspires in EU capitals is testament to his efforts.</p>  <p>  I and my colleagues in Government have remained in close contact with our European counterparts in the recent period. I would like to acknowledge the absolute support and solidarity that our EU partners have demonstrated unflaggingly throughout the Brexit process. They have always recognised the unique ways in which Ireland, north and south, is affected by Brexit. This concern has expressed itself through the EU mandate and draft legal text, and through the words and actions of our partners. I have no doubt that we will continue to enjoy their solidarity as we face the new challenges that will come with the end of the transition period.</p>  <p>  Irrespective of the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, the end of the transition period will bring substantial and lasting change. This means that business and citizens must take action now to be ready for the first of January.  I would particularly emphasise that with or without a trade deal, any business that moves goods from, to or through Great Britain will be subject to a range of customs formalities, SPS checks and other regulatory requirements that do not apply to such trade today.</p>  <p>  I would also like to take this opportunity to remind the House that regardless of the outcome of the talks, the full, effective and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol, remains vital.  The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is explicitly designed to operate regardless of whether an EU-UK Future Relationship Agreement is in place. </p>  <p>  I look forward to further updating the House as developments in the negotiations arise.</p></reply>

This means that new rules and procedures will apply to goods moving to, from or through the UK, excluding Northern Ireland.  </p><p>New rules and procedures will apply when moving goods across the UK landbridge between Ireland and the EU.  Operators will still be able to move goods across the landbridge, but the way they use the landbridge will change.  </p><p>The UK's accession to the Common Transit Convention (CTC) is welcome. It allows EU goods to move under transit through Great Britain without undergoing full import and export formalities on entry and exit.  However, to avail of the benefits of the Convention, a number of new administrative steps must be completed in Ireland, Great Britain and at the port of re-entry. Each consignment must also have a financial guarantee during the movement.  </p><p>In addition, Official Controls Regulation (EU) 2017/625 means certain goods, including animals and products of animal origin, are subject to controls on re-entering the EU and must be pre-notified to the Border Control Post (BCP) of re-entry to the EU ahead of arrival.  </p><p>The mechanism by which prior notification of a shipment containing animals or products of animal origin is provided to the BCP is at the discretion of each Member State.  Flexibility in EU legislation, expected to be adopted shortly, allows Member States to use systems other than TRACES NT (the EU&rsquo;s official SPS platform) for the provision of this prior notification.  France have indicated that, as their IT system relies on data from TRACES NT, they require prior notification of products of animal origin (POAO) through submission of Part I of a CHED on TRACES NT.</p><p>Ireland has undertaken substantial engagements at political and official level across the EU to ensure EU goods moving under transit are not subject to additional and unnecessary checks and controls.

While trade with the UK remains important, and is worth more than &euro;1 billion per week, expanding the Irish export footprint in markets beyond the UK is a key priority. In that context, the Government is working together with Irish exporters to support them in becoming more innovative, competitive and market diversified.</p>  <p>  The Irish exporting landscape has been strong and companies in Ireland have been succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services.  Against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty, Irish companies continued to grow their exports into key markets in 2019, including in Germany, France, the Netherlands and North America.  The opening of new embassies, consulates and enterprise offices as part of the Global Ireland initiative will support our companies in competing and thriving in global markets. </p>  <p>  Ministerial-led Trade Missions have supported the Government's major drive towards market diversification. The majority of trade missions in recent years have taken place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which are considered to represent the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies. These Trade Missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT, lifesciences and in the agri-food sector.  Trade Missions will resume as soon as is practicable. In the meantime, promotion of our companies abroad will continue through the work of our embassies, consulates and state agencies on the ground internationally. </p>  <p>  In addition to these global efforts, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more. The existing suite of EU Free Trade Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  Preparing for the end of the Brexit transition period is a whole of Government endeavour and continues to be a key priority across Government. The Government remains committed to doing everything we can to assist businesses and citizens in preparing for the end of the transition period, including by assisting Irish traders to diversify to access additional new markets outside of the UK.</p></reply>

This means that new rules and procedures will apply to goods moving to, from or through the UK, excluding Northern Ireland.  </p><p>From 1 January, businesses that trade with the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, will be subject to a range of new customs formalities and paperwork, along with other regulatory requirements, including Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) checks, both in Ireland and in the UK.  The Government has conducted substantial outreach to businesses and provided dedicated supports to assist them in preparing for these changes.  Further information is available in the Government's Brexit Readiness Action Plan and on GOV.IE/Brexit.</p><p>New rules and procedures will also apply when moving goods across the UK landbridge between Ireland and the EU.  </p><p>Post transition, operators will still be able to move goods across the UK Landbridge but the way they use the landbridge will change.</p><p>The UK's accession to the Common Transit Convention (CTC) is welcome.  It allows EU goods to move under transit through Great Britain without undergoing full import and export formalities on entry and exit.  However, to avail of the benefits of the Convention, a number of new administrative steps must be completed in Ireland, Great Britain and at the port of re-entry. Details of all these new steps can be found at GOV.IE/Brexit. Furthermore, each consignment must also have a financial guarantee during the movement.  </p><p>Under Official Controls Regulation (EU) 2017/625, a range of goods, including animals and products of animal origin (POAO), are subject to controls on re-entering the Union and must be prior-notified to the Border Control Post (BCP) of re-entry to the EU ahead of arrival. </p><p>Ireland has undertaken substantial engagements at political and official level across the EU to ensure EU goods moving under transit are not subject to additional and unnecessary checks and controls.

The World Trade Organisation-led Aid for Trade initiative seeks to mobilise resources to address the trade-related constraints identified by developing and least developed countries. </p><p>Aid for Trade programmes are designed to help developing countries to improve their competitiveness, expand and diversify their trade, attract foreign direct investment, create employment, and ensure women, youth and small and medium-size enterprises have opportunities to engage in trade. There is evidence that every &euro;1 invested in aid for trade creates &euro;8 in extra trade for all developing countries, and &euro;20 for least developed countries. This is particularly important in the current context, as developing countries struggle to cope with and recover from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>My Department continues to monitor the engagement by the EU and others on aid for trade. The biennial joint OECD-WTO &lsquo;Aid for Trade at a Glance&rsquo; publication, last published in 2019, provides a comprehensive analysis of current trends and developments. </p><p>Ireland was represented at the 7th Global Review of Aid for Trade which was held in July 2019 in Geneva.This Review demonstrated a continued need for and commitment to the WTO&rsquo;s Aid for Trade initiative at a time of growing global trade tensions and uncertainty.The theme &lsquo;Supporting Economic Diversification and Empowerment&rsquo; led to special consideration of the digital divide, sustainable approaches and women&rsquo;s and youth economic empowerment.</p><p>The EU adopted an updated EU Aid for Trade Strategy, <i>Achieving Prosperity through Trade and Investment, </i>in December 2017 and Ireland participates in the ongoing implementation and monitoring of this. The third EU Aid for Trade Progress Report was published earlier this year. </p><p>I am pleased that since 2000, Ireland has provided support for a number of international organisations involved in Aid for Trade initiatives. These include technical assistance programmes of the WTO; the International Trade Centre (ITC); the Advisory Centre for WTO Law; and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Port Management Programme. Our funding to these organisations amounted to &euro;1.8m in 2020. In addition, support is provided for a number of private sector initiatives across the countries that we engage in through our development cooperation programme, for example the African Agri-Food Development Programme.</p></reply>

Aid is channelled impartially to the affected populations, regardless of their race, ethnic group, religion, gender, age, nationality or political affiliation. </p>  <p>  The European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate for Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations has worked with a humanitarian operations budget of &euro;1.95 billion in 2020. The EU &ndash; its Member States and EU institutions collectively &ndash; is among the leading donors of humanitarian aid in the world.  In addition, Ireland has separately provided approximately &euro;180 million in humanitarian aid in each of the past three years to address many global crisis situations.</p>  <p>  Protecting and promoting human rights is a priority of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. With our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries, where increased human rights violations are often a first step on a trajectory towards conflict.  Ireland supports the use of multilateral human rights fora in responding to human rights violations including in the EU, UN, OSCE and the Council of Europe.</p>  <p>  Through the EU, Ireland contributes to the global response to situations which push people into forced displacement and irregular migration. For example, 70% of the &euro;4.8 billion committed through the EU Trust Fund for Africa is being used to address the root causes of forced displacement and irregular migration.</p>  <p>  Through our participation in international bodies, as well as direct support for human rights and the provision of humanitarian and development assistance, Ireland is making strong efforts to address the needs highlighted in a principled and consistent manner. With regard to the conflict in Ethiopia, Minister Coveney has urged all parties to cease hostilities, de-escalate tensions, demonstrate restraint and work for reconciliation, and has also condemned atrocities and targeting of ethnic groups.

Ireland supports the EU, UN and other international efforts to reduce the influence of Boko Haram and Al Shabaab and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians. Ireland continues to monitor the activities of these groups and to assist populations affected by their actions.</p><p>The UN is active in working to undermine the influence and impact of Al Shabaab and Boko Haram. The UN continues to monitor the situation in areas affected by Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin, through its Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), as well as at the UN Peacebuilding Commission, in which Ireland actively participates. The UN-mandated African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM) supports the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat Al Shabaab. </p><p>The EU is one of the main financial contributors to AMISOM and it has also pledged &euro;50 million in funding to the Multinational Joint Taskforce to improve security in West African territories affected by Boko Haram. More broadly, the EU supports the strengthening of government institutions and provides significant development funding in Somalia, and in the countries affected by Boko Haram's terrorist activities, notably through its Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. Ireland is a long-term donor to the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa and has committed over &euro;15 million to that Fund.</p><p>The EU Council Conclusions of June 2020 reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s commitment to tackling terrorism across Africa, particularly in the Sahel and Horn of Africa.  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to EUCAP Somalia, including the current Head of Mission. In the Sahel,<i></i>Ireland previously had 20 Defence Forces personnel participating in EUTM Mali, with numbers temporarily reduced to 12 due to Covid-19. Ireland also deploys one expert to the EUCAP Sahel Niger. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows us to contribute to international peace and security, protect human rights, and support conditions for sustainable development in the region.</p><p>Ireland also works bilaterally to promote peace and security in areas affected by armed groups. Ireland places a strong emphasis on tackling the poverty, hunger and exclusion which can contribute to radicalisation. We are members of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and observer members of the Sahel Alliance. Both groups offer international partners a forum to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin. </p><p>In addition, Ireland works with partners to respond to humanitarian need in regions affected by conflict. Ireland has provided &euro;27 million in humanitarian funding to the Lake Chad region since 2015. Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Abuja also contributes funding for those displaced by conflict in North-East Nigeria through its Humanitarian Fund. Ireland has also been a consistent supporter of the humanitarian response in Somalia, providing over &euro;51 million in humanitarian assistance since 2012, including to communities displaced by conflict in Al Shabaab-held areas. With humanitarian needs in these regions likely to remain acute, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p><p>The Embassies of Ireland in Nairobi, Addis Ababa and Abuja will continue to actively monitor the situation on the ground, advise on humanitarian response and guide Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in EU and UN fora, particularly as we take up our UN Security Council seat in 2021. </p></reply>

Fragile political transitions and peace processes are taking place against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is affecting the entire region politically, economically and socially and adding to the existing burdens of climate change, terrorism and migration, as well as multiple humanitarian challenges, including infectious diseases, locust infestations, drought and floods. </p>  <p>  Ireland, together with its UN and EU partners, is strongly committed to the Horn of Africa, through our political, development and humanitarian efforts and we will remain closely engaged in the region in the context of our upcoming tenure on the UN Security Council.  Minister Coveney discussed the Horn of Africa with fellow EU Ministers during a high level event in July and stressed that the region must remain a priority on the EU&rsquo;s agenda.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports the efforts of the EU and the UN in taking a multi-pronged approach to the Horn of Africa, including continued support for the important work of the African Union and IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development), which play a key role in regional peace and security.  </p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned by the outbreak of armed conflict in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, including the reported atrocities and ethnic profiling, and the humanitarian consequences. Ireland is actively supporting the efforts of the EU and wider international community to de-escalate the situation, including through engagement with the African Union which has appointed three Special Envoys. Minister Coveney has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and the commencement of a national dialogue to de-escalate tensions.  Minister Coveney has also condemned the reported atrocities and identity-based attacks. It is essential to ensure that the human rights of all Ethiopians are upheld. I am gravely concerned by reports that Ethiopia&rsquo;s federal military has said civilians should protect themselves from heavy artillery, in advance of a planned assault against the regional capital. I urge all parties to the conflict to respect international humanitarian law. Ireland is also a longstanding humanitarian supporter of the wider Horn of Africa region. In the context of the Tigray crisis my Department has reallocated &euro;416,000 for the humanitarian response within Ethiopia and &euro;500,000 to assist refugees in Eastern Sudan.</p>  <p>  South Sudan continues to endure an ongoing crisis, in large part the consequence of civil war.  While the ceasefire is largely holding between the main opposition parties, following the formation of the unity government last February, I am concerned that sub-national violence and human rights abuses continue to cause immense harm to civilians, with the UN reporting that over 1,000 people have been killed and more than 400 abducted in the last six months. The situation is very fragile with key aspects of the peace deal still to be implemented, including the creation of a unified army, local governance and transitional justice measures. Ireland continues to monitor the situation closely, including via our Embassy in Addis Ababa and via the EU Delegation in Juba.</p>  <p>  Just over one year on from the signing of the power sharing agreement between the military and the opposition, Sudan&rsquo;s fragile transition is proceeding amid significant challenges including COVID-19, difficulties accessing international funding, an economic state of emergency and severe flooding. On 3 November 2020, I was able to speak with the Acting Foreign Minister of Sudan to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s continued strong support for the transition and to announce additional support for Sudan&rsquo;s response to floods. In an historic step, on 3 October the Government of Sudan signed a peace agreement with key armed groups, which the EU witnessed. In June 2020, then Minister of State Ciar&aacute;n Cannon represented Ireland at the high level Sudan Partnership Conference hosted by Germany, the EU and Sudan, and announced Ireland&rsquo;s contribution of $500,000 to the World Bank Trust Fund for Sudan, to provide cash transfers for vulnerable families. </p>  <p>  Despite Somalia&rsquo;s recent progress in peacebuilding and state building, volatility and risks remain high and tensions between the Federal Government and Federal Member States remain a cause for concern.  While recent consensus reached on the electoral model for upcoming elections is welcome, it is disappointing that the model is far from the &lsquo;one-person one-vote&rsquo; elections that the international community, including the EU, advocated for. The security context in Somalia remains deeply fragile and Al Shabaab is still capable of complex attacks. Al Shabaab has also developed sophisticated revenue-raising capabilities that make it an increasingly competitive actor within Somalia. Ireland is concerned by other developments in Somalia including the ousting of the former Prime Minister in July and recent regressive legislative proposals which will impact efforts to prevent sexual and gender based violence. Ireland has raised these concerns at the most recent session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva and in discussions with the Government of Somalia.</p>  <p>  The EU engages actively in the region through political dialogue, its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions (EU NAVFOR Operation Atalanta, EUCAP Somalia, and EUTM Somalia), and development and humanitarian cooperation. Ireland has been an active contributor to EUCAP in Somalia, to which there are a number of Irish deployees including the current Head of Mission. Ireland, through the EU, also supports the efforts of the African Union led peacekeeping mission, AMISOM, to stabilise Somalia. </p>  <p>  Through regional and bilateral programmes and the Trust Fund for Africa, the EU is providing over &euro;3 billion to the Horn of Africa (2014-2020) which focuses on supporting economic opportunities for young people.  Ireland has pledged over &euro;15 million to the Trust Fund for Africa.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supports the office of the EU Special Representative to the Horn of Africa, Alex Rondos, whose mandate is to contribute to regional and international efforts to achieve lasting peace, security and development in the region. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also a longstanding humanitarian donor to the Horn of Africa, having provided over &euro;222 million in humanitarian assistance to the region since 2012 and we are also a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which countries in the Horn benefit from.  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute throughout 2021, Ireland remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance where it is needed most in the Horn of Africa. </p></reply>

On 27 August, I participated in a discussion with the Israeli Foreign Minister during an informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers.

Ireland has stayed the course and continued funding protection in protracted crises.  Some of these have seen women and children trapped in limbo in camps for decades, as in the case of Somali refugee camps in northern Kenya.  Protection is more important than ever before. However, flagrant disregard of International Humanitarian Law means that the safety of affected populations and even aid workers is not assured in many areas.  The need for material assistance is equalled and often surpassed by the need for safety and security.  Syria is one such example.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to protect women and children is to coordinate between humanitarian, development and peacebuilding actors to prioritise and deliberately allocate resources to protection, in particular against gender based violence in crises and emergency contexts.   We choose the best placed actors to assist in each situation.  We target resources to the agencies and NGOs on the ground which can provide the right supports needed for the context, including for example, providing safe spaces for women and girls who have experienced sexual and gender based violence.   A package of &euro;4.5 million from Irish Aid currently funds this crucial work in Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan and Somalia through to the end of 2021.    </p>  <p>  Gender equality and women's empowerment is a central priority for Ireland's foreign and development policy. Protection is one of four pillars in Ireland's third National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security from 2019 - 2024.  Priorities under this pillar include women's and girls' protection in fragile and conflict-affected contexts.  This includes support to provide or facilitate access to medical, legal, psychosocial and livelihood services, without discrimination.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has a Rapid Response Corps, a roster of skilled and experienced volunteers with specialized skills including gender and child protection who make themselves available to deploy at short notice to work in humanitarian emergencies.  Since 2019, nine volunteers have been deployed to work with our UN partners on gender and protection support for vulnerable women and children.  </p>  <p>  Through our Humanitarian Programme Plan grants, Irish Aid works with our NGO partners who use the grants to fund programmes to improve the wellbeing of people, in particular women and children affected by violence and gender-based violence.  For example, a grant to Concern in Lebanon focuses on Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities to reduce the risk of child labour, protect children's rights to an education, and prevent child marriage and domestic violence.   </p>  <p>  Ireland also works with a key partner, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).   The ICRC responds quickly and efficiently to help people affected by armed conflict. Ireland has provided the ICRC with &euro;10 million in core funding in 2020, to assist its work in responding to emergencies.  In addition, Ireland has responded to the ICRC special appeals in Syria, Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso and Mozambique in 2020.  In 2019, Ireland responded to a special appeal on sexual violence, providing &euro;500,000 for that effort to protect women and children.  </p></reply>

Water system management is critical to establishing sustainable food systems, and Ireland will work to ensure that this is discussed at next year's Food Systems Summit. </p>  <p>  The Government through Irish Aid supports efforts to improve governance of water and sanitation, especially where scarce and precious resources are under threat from climate change.  This includes investing in irrigation and water system projects and climate-smart agricultural practices. This support is delivered through different development partners including: local and national Government agencies; Irish, international and local NGOs; and multilateral organisations.  </p>  <p>  This support includes working with local Government representatives in Mozambique to build new water systems, install water access points and rehabilitate existing boreholes as well as train community water committees to manage these resources.  In Vietnam, Ireland has supported ethnic minority communities in 48 communes to improve access to basic services including water.  In Gaza, Ireland is partnering with the French Development Agency to provide sustainable solar power to the North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment plant to reduce contamination of water aquifers and ensure adequate clean water.</p>  <p>  Irish core support for UNICEF contributes to improved water supplies and sanitation facilities in schools and communities, and safe hygiene practices in 90 countries.  In Sierra Leone, Irish Aid worked with UNICEF to ensure that hygiene facilities in approximately 100 schools were upgraded to facilitate safe reopening.  </p>  <p>  Also with Irish Aid support, Irish NGOs and missionary orders are working with communities and local governments in low-income countries to improve water supply systems for household consumption and for agriculture production.   </p>  <p>  Ireland supports the UN&rsquo;s Global Environment Monitoring System for freshwater which is helping to build the capacity of developing countries to accurately monitor and report on water quality, including through a web based postgraduate diploma course in freshwater quality monitoring and assessment delivered by University College Cork.</p></reply>

There are currently 13 UN peacekeeping operations worldwide, with over 95,000 uniformed personnel from over 120 countries. It is one of the world's most collaborative efforts to deliver stability and safety to millions of people and it is a global effort to which Ireland is fully committed. With contributions from the Defence Forces and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Ireland is present in more than half of those operations. </p>  <p>  UN peacekeepers are increasingly deployed to complex and volatile environments.  It is vital that peacekeeping operations are designed in a way that ensures they are effective, efficient, focussed on the protection of civilians and responsive to the needs on the ground.  During our time on the Security Council, Ireland will work with partners to deliver peacekeeping mandates that align with the needs of the people they seeks to protect and have the resources necessary to do so. </p>  <p>  We will also support the cooperation of the United Nations with regional organisations, such as the African Union and the European Union, who are increasingly taking responsibility for peacekeeping operations under UN authorisation. In this framework, Ireland participates in a number of EU military crisis management and civilian crisis management missions. </p>  <p>  In undertaking this work, we remain cognisant that peacekeeping is not an end in itself but a tool to create the space for locally-owned political solutions. In that area too, Ireland looks forward to playing our part during our forthcoming tenure on the UN Security Council.</p></reply>

The Guidelines commit the EU to address the impact of armed conflict on children and to hold accountable those who recruit child soldiers.</p>  <p>  The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1261 on the impact of armed conflict on children in 1999 and since then it has established tools to strengthen child protection and to support international standards, including a systematic and comprehensive monitoring and reporting mechanism.</p>  <p>  In December 1996, the UN General Assembly created the mandate of the UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict to advocate for the protection and well-being of children affected by armed conflict and to develop best practices to address the recruitment of child soldiers. The UN Secretary-General also issues an annual report on children and armed conflict which examines both trends and specific country situations, listing all armed groups that recruit and use children. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a member of the Group of Friends of Children and Armed Conflict at the United Nations in New York, a network of 47 Member States who support the continued focus on Children and Armed Conflict.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to combat the use of child soldiers through our development programme, Irish Aid, with a focus on addressing the socio-economic causes that contribute to this situation, through providing access to education, skills and livelihood opportunities. </p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports the mandate of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict and will actively engage in the Children and Armed Conflict Working Group when it assumes membership of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) in January 2021. </p></reply>

For example, in 2016, Ireland co-facilitated the UN Summit on Refugees and Migrants. This Summit agreed the New York Declaration, which led to the Global Compact for Refugees and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.</p>  <p>  In October, Minister Coveney addressed the Executive Committee of the UNHCR, the UN's refugee agency, underlining Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for the work it does for displaced persons throughout the world.  In 2020, Ireland is providing over &euro;18.5 million in funding to UNHCR, the highest level in more than a decade.</p>  <p>  Both within the EU and the UN, a distinction is made between refugees and migrants and it is the latter group whose primary motive is to improve the quality of life and economic well-being. Ireland has repeatedly called for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among EU Member States in dealing with the wider issue of migration.</p>  <p>  The conflict in Syria has caused a major refugee and migration crisis.  This year Ireland will disburse &euro;25 million in assistance, including support to refugees in neighbouring countries.  Ireland is also party to the EU response to the Syria migration crisis, contributing over &euro;38 million.  Last month, following the devastating fire in the refugee centre in Lesbos, Greece, Ireland announced a commitment to resettle up to 50 people in families.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also working closely with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the leading inter-governmental organisation in the field of migration.  Our financial support has been increased to &euro;1 million in 2020.</p>  <p>  To address some of the causes of irregular mass migration Ireland supports the EU&rsquo;s Trust Fund for Africa which aims to address irregular migration from Africa by improving employment opportunities and strengthening resilience of communities including refugees and other displaced people.

We have always been, and will remain, a strong supporter of enlargement of the European Union, provided that candidate countries meet the necessary conditions for membership. In this regard, we welcome the reform agenda underway in the countries of the Western Balkans and the progress that has been made in the areas of security and rule of law. </p>  <p>  In March 2020, EU Member States agreed an enhanced accession methodology, which seeks to make the accession process more credible and dynamic, by clustering together negotiating Chapters and phasing in participation in EU programmes and policies. The enhanced methodology also recognises the need for more decisive measures proportionally sanctioning any serious or prolonged stagnation or even backsliding in reform implementation.</p>  <p>  The European Commission published its Annual Enlargement Package and country reports in October 2020. In terms of the progress of individual Western Balkan countries, Serbia and Montenegro are both currently negotiating Chapters of the Acquis with the EU. Serbia has opened negotiations on 18 Chapters, with two provisionally closed. Montenegro has opened all Chapters and provisionally closed three. The country reports for 2020 assessed both Serbia and Montenegro as having both made limited progress. Serbia needs to accelerate its reforms and make significant progress in the normalisation of relations with Kosovo, while Montenegro must address shortcomings in the areas of media freedom, fight against corruption and trafficking, and turn its attention to the closing of Chapters.</p>  <p>  Regarding North Macedonia and Albania, it was agreed by the European Council in March 2020 to open negotiations with both countries. It was regrettable that Member States were unable to reach agreement on the draft negotiating frameworks for both countries at the November General Affairs Council. Ireland believes the draft negotiating frameworks should be agreed at the earliest available opportunity to allow the first Intergovernmental Conferences to take place with both countries. </p>  <p>  Bosnia-Herzegovina has made limited progress over the last year and faces significant challenges to ensure implementation of the Commission&rsquo;s 2019 recommendations in the areas of democracy, rule of law, fundamental rights, and public administration reform. Progress in these areas must be seen before the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered.</p>  <p>  Kosovo is a potential candidate for Membership of the EU. The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo in 2020 noted that the political situation in Kosovo remains challenging. Rule of law, judicial reform, public administration reform, organised crime and normalisation of the relationship with Serbia are just some of the areas that must be comprehensively addressed in order for Kosovo to advance on its European path. It will be some time before Kosovo can qualify as a candidate country.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.</p></reply>

The rule of law is and should remain a fundamental principle that all EU Member States respect, protect and promote, both within and beyond the EU. </p>  <p>  Globally, Ireland is committed to a process of effective multilateralism in which the broadly accepted, rules-based international order is respected and developed. Both internationally and at EU level specifically, Ireland has advocated broadly for respect for the rule of law. </p>  <p>  We believe that it is important for the EU to have the necessary tools to monitor the rule of law across Member States and to effectively respond to challenges where they arise.</p>  <p>  To that end, we strongly support a strong and effective Rule of Law proposal to protect the EU Budget. Once the regime of conditionality is introduced, Ireland will support its fair, proportionate and effective implementation. The introduction of a regime of conditionality would be in addition to an important range of tools available to the EU for monitoring, promoting and enforcing the rule of law. </p>  <p>  Among these tools are the ongoing Article 7 proceedings against Hungary and Poland, under which there have been a number of hearings at the General Affairs Council. Ireland has actively participated in these hearings - and will continue to do so - highlighting the importance we attach to respect for the rule of law.</p>  <p>  We have also welcomed the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s first Annual Rule of Law Report, which presents a broad overview of the rule of law situations across Member States and the EU as a whole. It provides a valuable, impartial assessment of both the positive and negative developments relating to rule of law.

Ireland, together with EU partners and others in the international community, continue to support countries in the region to respond effectively to these challenges.</p>  <p>  The long-standing partnership between the EU and the LAC region is grounded in shared values and history and a commitment to multilateralism. We share the same vision when it comes to shaping global issues, such as sustainable development, free and fair trade, and the digital revolution.</p>  <p>  Relations between the EU and the LAC region were most recently discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council Meeting (FAC) on 12 October and I participated in this discussion. The impact of COVID-19 in the region had also been discussed at the FAC on 13 July. On that occasion, we voiced concern about how the pandemic is compounding difficulties already facing the region, such as inequality, gender issues, democracy and human rights. An EU-LAC Ministerial Meeting is planned for 14 December at which we hope to reaffirm and give new impetus to our strategic partnership.</p>  <p>  Ireland, through our six Missions in the region, is active under the &lsquo;Team Europe&rsquo; umbrella, which has been providing support to the most vulnerable countries and people most at risk since the outbreak of the pandemic. As of 1 October 2020, &euro;2.44 billion has been made available, so far, to partners in the region under the initiative. The EU is the LAC region&rsquo;s principal development partner (&euro;3.6 billion provided in grants between 2014 and 2020) and a main provider of humanitarian assistance. The EU also provides support through regional cooperation programmes through the Development Cooperation Instrument.  The EU Regional Programme for Latin America (2014-2020) allocated a total of &euro;918 million to the region. </p>  <p>  Debt relief is an important tool to assist countries speed up post-COVID recovery and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We note that many Middle Income countries, a number of which are in the LAC region, are not eligible for debt relief and are at risk of debt distress. We support efforts to explore ways to help address the debt sustainability challenges that they are facing. </p>  <p>  I remain deeply concerned by the serious and deteriorating political, economic, social and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and the effects of the crisis on neighbouring countries. Ireland has been active in responding to the crisis and since 2019, we have provided almost &euro;2.5m in funding to respond to the needs of migrants and refugees.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to a whole-of-Government strategy for Latin America and the Caribbean. This Strategy will act as a framework for Ireland&rsquo;s developing bilateral relations with the region and I look forward to it being finalised and published in the period ahead. </p></reply>

Immigration issues have been raised on an ongoing basis in our engagement with the US Administration and political leaders. I have raised these issues in recent contacts with Special Envoy Mick Mulvaney and with the US Ambassador, as well as with members of the US Administration and both Houses of Congress during my visit to Washington D.C. at the end of September.</p>  <p>  In the US, our Embassy and Consulates General across the country continue to monitor the situation closely and to engage with US officials on immigration issues, including with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They also actively support Irish community groups that provide assistance and information to vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. Many of these community groups are members of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centers, which receives significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme for their work. In 2019, over &euro;3m ($3.7m) was allocated to 88 organisations across the US, including those that provide front-line welfare assistance to Irish citizens. Furthermore, and in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable.</p>  <p>  We maintain close relations with members of Congress and contacts from across the political spectrum, and will continue to seek opportunities to deepen and strengthen our bilateral relations with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden. The President-elect has always been a stalwart friend and supporter of Ireland and we are looking forward to working closely with him and his Administration , as reaffirmed by the Taoiseach during their recent telephone phone call. Post-pandemic, we want to see people-to-people links strengthened and we look forward to working with the new administration, as well as with the United States Congress, across the aisle, to pursue comprehensive immigration reform in the US. Our Embassy and network of Consulates General will continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to engage with any Federal and State initiatives on this issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of securing future pathways for immigration, we continue to prioritise the E3 Visa Bill which is currently before the US Senate, having been passed in the House of Representatives. The bill was reintroduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Neal and Sensenbrenner in May 2019. If passed, this could allow access to thousands of US visas each year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities to live and work in the US. While the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted upon the congressional agenda, we hope that, when the circumstances allow, the Bill will also be passed in the Senate.  We will continue to explore all available options for securing this.</p></reply>

The Defence Forces have participated in overseas missions mandated by the UN since 1958.  We can be justifiably proud of the fact that they have completed approximately 70,000 individual tours of duty overseas in that time.  In that time a total of 7 personnel have received the Military Medal of Gallantry while 90 personnel have been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for acts relating to service overseas.</p>  <p>  The United Nations Operation in Congo was the first peacekeeping mission in which significant numbers of Irish soldiers took part.  A total of 6,000 Irish soldiers served in Congo from 1960 to 1964 in various Irish contingents over the course of this long, difficult and complex mission. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the service by Defence Forces personnel with ONUC, military medals boards, in accordance with Defence Force Regulations, were convened in 1962 and in 1965 to consider recommendations for meritorious promotions and recommendations relating to the awarding of medals for Gallantry and Distinguished Service. </p>  <p>Due to the unique nature of the events which took place in Jadotville, and the collective efforts of the Irish soldiers involved, the Government committed, as an exceptional step to award a medal known as An Bonn Jadotville or the Jadotville medal to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion, and to the family representatives of deceased members. </p>  <p>  In relation to events at Jadotville, I have asked the Chief of Staff to consider whether it is possible, as an exceptional measure, to have a retrospective examination of the events at Jadotville in September 1961 in the context of the award of medals and the possible implications for the integrity of the award of medals system.  In response the Chief of Staff has proposed the establishment of an independent group of external experts to consider the entire case and evidence, including new evidence, if any, available.  Once established, this Independent Group of External Experts will examine the events specific to Jadotville and will independently report its findings and recommendations to the Chief of Staff.  The Chief of Staff will then make recommendations to my Office.  </p>  <p>  It is not proposed to extend the scope of review to other UN operations in Congo. </p>  <p>  There are awards made to all personnel who serve on overseas missions, which aim to recognize the contribution made by the members of each contingent serving on the peacekeeping mission and the difficult circumstances in which they have to operate. In this regard, personnel received both a United Nations Medal, for their service in the Congo, awarded by the UN and the United Nations Peacekeeping medal awarded by the Irish Government. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the awards which were issued as a result of the involvement of the Irish Defence Forces with ONUC, the significant efforts of all Irish soldiers who served in this mission are valued and appreciated. They have left a substantial legacy in the context of Irish peacekeeping efforts.</p></reply>

Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition on the e-tenders website and on the Official Journal of the European Union, where appropriate, in line with the European Union procurement Directives, including the Directive 2009/81/EC on the award of contracts in the fields of defence and security. Details of tender competitions can be accessed on the Government's e-tenders website www.etenders.ie. </p><p>The following table sets out the expenditure on Defensive Equipment and Capability Development for the Defence Forces for the period 2015-2019. Unfortunately it is not possible to provide this information by country of origin, however my Department routinely publishes details of purchase orders for goods and services valued over &euro;20,000 on its website<i></i><i></i>which provides details of supplies.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Total Expenditure on Defensive Equipment and Capability Development </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2015</td>       <td>&euro;70.5m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;79.2m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;72.6m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;77.1m</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;102.5m</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The acquisition and upgrading of equipment for the Defence Forces remains a clear focus for me. Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence, reinforced by the White Paper Update 2019, as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper is to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements both at home and overseas.</p><p>The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020 provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. </p><p>The mid-life upgrade of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of 80 General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles is well underway in Switzerland.This programme is on-going and continues to command significant resources and commitment of effort.  The vehicle, which is the backbone of Defence Forces armoured capability, has been well proven in all its roles since the first vehicles were introduced in 2001.  By end-2020, it is anticipated some 52 vehicles will have been upgraded including modernisation of protection systems and weapons. The overall programme is due to be completed by 2022. In addition, an order for 28 Armoured Utility Vehicles AUVs was recently placed with Centigon, a French company, and these will provide a level of protected mobility between the levels of soft-skinned light transport and heavier armoured vehicles.</p><p>There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet.  In 2019, a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3/4 tonne 4x4 vehicles, the first of which entered service in early 2020.  In March of this year, a tender process was completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4x4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with the award of a contract to Westward Scania, based in Strokestown, Co. Roscommon. The first vehicles are scheduled for delivery in 2020 with delivery of all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023. Funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.</p><p>A step change in military air-based capability is being achieved through the acquisition of Pilatus PC-12 aircraft from Switzerland.  While nominally a replacement for the Cessna, the new aircraft move capabilities considerably ahead of the present level.  The original order of three aircraft which were delivered in September 2020 was augmented on an urgent basis by an additional aircraft delivered in April 2020 to enhance fixed wing capacity to meet demands arising from Covid-19.  The PC-12 has proven itself an effective and versatile asset.</p><p>The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space, in December 2019, and these are being manufactured in Spain, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.</p><p>The White Paper on Defence also sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class vessels, L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and L&Eacute; Niamh, as well as, in due course, the replacement of L&Eacute; Eithne.  The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well underway and is being carried out by Doyle Shipping Group, in Cobh, County Cork.  The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel (MRV) is the next scheduled component of the White Paper fleet investment programme.  Projects for other vessel replacement will be considered over the life-time of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding and the Equipment Development Plan (EDP) process.  The EDP outlines that the MRV project is in the planning ongoing stage with an indicative timeframe for progression from the current year through to 2024.</p><p>With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment.  In July of this year a tender competition was commenced for the supply of Software Defined Radios to the Defence Forces and the competition is currently underway.  The scope of the project consists of two main requirements - Personal Soldier Radios and Multi-Band Handheld, Manpack, Vehicular and Airborne radios. Given the complexity of the requirements, the procurement process is expected to be comprehensive in nature with the first radios not expected to enter service before 2023. </p><p>The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available.  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was increased to &euro;113 million for 2020, an increase of &euro;7 million.  The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022.Budget 2021 provides for a further increased gross allocation to &euro;131m in the defence capital budget in respect of equipment and barracks infrastructure.  This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.</p></reply>

The matter will be reviewed  next year by my Department in consultation with the Defence Forces and a decision will be made with regard to the continued deployment of Defence Forces personnel to this mission, in line with Government approval. </p>  <p>  In addition to the UN mission., there are 20 members of the DF currently serving the EU training mission in Mali, (EUTM Mali). The Defence Forces first deployed to this mission in 2014, and their continued participation is kept under regular review.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defencereviews the deployment of Defence Forces Personnel overseas on an ongoing basis. Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. </p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. Under the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8kms from and are attending their nearest Post Primary School/Education Centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year, is not available on public scheduled services and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education cycle. Where the number of applications for transport on a concessionary basis exceeds the number of seats available, Bus &Eacute;ireann will determine the allocation of the tickets.  Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis.</p>  <p>Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is not eligible for school transport as he is not attending his nearest post primary school.   The existing school transport service is currently operating to capacity and there are no seats available at present.  A refund of the school transport charge was processed on 8th September 2020.</p></reply>

In schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. </p>  <p>  The selection process used by schools and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, all schools have drafted new policies to be published on the school&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The act requires schools to clearly set out their selection criteria for application in the event of oversubscription, in their admission policies. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. </p>  <p>  Further information on the new admission process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/School-Enrolment.</p>  <p>  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit Data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department's own school enrolment databases, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.</p>  <p>   The process has been strengthened this year through three specific initiatives:</p>  <p>  (i) enhanced engagement with local authorities in relation to the information on residential development incorporated in the analysis process;</p>  <p>  (ii) additional engagement with patron bodies in relation to their local knowledge on school place requirements. Education and Training Boards, Diocesan offices and national patron bodies such as Educate Together, An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta etc. can also be an important source of local knowledge. This will add to information also provided to the Department by local authorities or individual schools.</p>  <p>  (iii) utilising the information gleaned from schools under the national inventory of school capacity completed by individual schools last year as part of POD, P-POD returns process.</p>  <p>  Similar to the process adopted for September 2020 readiness, the Department will be engaging further with patron bodies shortly in advance of identifying specific September 2021 capacity pressure points priorities which will necessitate specific action.  </p>  <p>  In a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; year, addressing the increase demands for school places, whilst challenging, is manageable &ndash; generally through utilisation of existing spare capacity within schools, rental, temporary accommodation or other short term measures pending the delivery of permanent accommodation. </p>  <p>  Based on analysis of recent enrolment trends, there appears to be a significant pattern of both inward and outward transfer for the Killester_Raheny_Clontarf school planning area.  Such transfer patterns are combined with data on current enrolments at both primary and post primary level, as well as with information on planned and current residential development in order to project post primary school place requirements in a school planning area.   </p></reply>

The Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question and correspondence has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions:</p><p>- 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.</p><p>- A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.</p><p>- The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p><p>It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p><p>The exceptional review process for mainstream allocations is available to schools throughout the current school year. </p><p>Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie. </p><p>A school can appeal the outcome of an exceptional review and details of how to do this are here .</p></reply>

The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile and also encompasses the Language Support (EAL) allocation that schools were allocated in previous years.  </p>  <p>  The Department also provides additional allocations for schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support.  Prior to the 2012/2013 school year, these posts were allocated on a temporary basis by way of applications by individual schools.  The reforms introduced in the 12/13 school year provided for permanent EAL posts to be allocated to schools who had previously held temporary posts.  There are 375 permanent EAL posts in primary schools, with 4 schools in Co. Donegal having a permanent EAL position.</p>  <p>  Further temporary Language Support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support. At primary level, these allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. </p></reply>

An additional &euro;105 million was subsequently announced for 2020 which will facilitate the bringing forward of an ICT grant for all schools and early payment of minor works grant for primary schools planned for 2021. The additional funding of &euro;25m for payment of an exceptional Minor Works Grant at post primary school level for school year 2021/2022 will be paid out in December 2020.

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school. </p>  <p>  The decision taken by the Government to close schools with effect from 13th March 2020 was taken in the interest of protecting our pupils, their families, teachers and those members of the wider community and is one of the many measures taken to support efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19. </p>  <p>  Given that the school transport services were not available to children from 13th March, it was decided that at the end of the 2019/20 school year a refund for that period of closure will be issued to parents. Bus &Eacute;ireann  issued refunds regarding these closures during the summer months.  </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that a refund was issued to the family referred to by the Deputy this week and the family have been contacted to advise them of same. </p></reply>

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process. </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them. </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects. </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade. </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process. Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades). </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.   </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams which commenced on 16 November.  </p>  <p>Following the conclusion of the appeals processes, students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.  </p></reply>

This number excludes students who initially entered for an appeal but later withdrew their application.</p>  <p>  As a result of the process, a total of 18 increased grades were awarded to 18 individual students.  Eleven of these were upgrades following an appeal by the student. A further seven grades were upgraded following quality assurance checks as part of the appeals process which involved checks on the documentation submitted by schools; the entry of that data on to the schools' data collection system; and the subsequent transmission of the data through the various IT systems used in the generation of calculated grades.</p>  <p>  The appeals process was a process review focussed on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process.  It was not possible to appeal the information (estimated percentage mark or rank order) provided by the school.  Due to the nature of the Calculated Grades system the professional judgement of the school was outside of the appeals process.  The design of the statistical model and the application of the national standardisation process was also outside of the scope of the appeals process.</p>  <p>  The CAO were also notified of changes to students&rsquo; results on 16 October. Candidates who are eligible for a new offer as a result of the upgraded mark received following the appeals process will be contacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Students unhappy with the outcome of the above process could invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These scrutineers are independent of my Department. The independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered in the appeals process.</p>  <p>  The closing date for application to this process was Friday 23 October.  Applications for this stage of the appeals process were submitted by 302 candidates in respect of 900 subject results.  Every effort will be made to complete this review stage as quickly as possible and to provide the outcomes to students.  At this stage, it is not possible to specify the exact timescale for completion of the review process. </p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the appeals processes, students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.</p>  <p>  Students were also given the opportunity to register for the postponed Leaving Certificate examinations which commenced on 16 November.</p></reply>

This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC),the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study would have been effective for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019/20 and may occur in 2020/21 was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021.</p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p>  <p>  The SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. This is my firm intention also. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. </p>  <p>  Other documents published by my Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </p>  <p>  The www.gov.ie/backtoschool site also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  </p>  <p>  Promoting the wellbeing of school communities has been a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. We know that most students have been happy and relieved to get back to school, reconnect and prepare to re-engage with learning.  My Department is providing for approximately 120 extra posts for guidance to support student wellbeing, recognising the particular importance for this support in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic challenges. </p>  <p>  It remains the Government&rsquo;s and my Department&rsquo;s key objective for schools to remain open and to continue to operate as normally as possible.  However, I recognise that despite the best efforts of all stakeholders, there will be situations where individual pupils or groups of pupils, teachers, or possibly entire school communities, are requested by Public Health HSE to self-isolate or restrict their movements because of a case or cases of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  There is an absolute necessity for schools to be prepared for these situations, for them to continue to support their pupils and to provide for continuity of learning. This is particularly important in the context of pupils with special educational needs, pupils at risk of educational disadvantage and pupils at risk of early school leaving.</p>  <p>  Schools are aware of the need to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future. Contingency planning is required to support continuity of pupils/students&rsquo; learning and the use of digital technology, where possible, will be used to facilitate this. It is important that planning and the adoption of approaches are based on a whole-school approach. Given the fluidity of requirements to meet the various potential scenarios that living with Covid-19 entails, it is important that schools review and adapt their plans over the coming weeks and months as the situation evolves and as the experience of schools in providing for continuity of learning increases.</p>  <p>  Extensive guidance and supports have been and continue to be made available by my Department and its support services to support schools to plan for a transition to online and remote learning and this guidance is all available at  </p>  <p>  www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/a128d-back-to-school/?referrer=http://www.gov.ie/backtoschool/.</p>  <p>  The guidance includes links to a range of materials and supports developed by the Digital Technologies team of the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), such as learning platforms and online tools which can be used to support remote learning. Those resources continue to be available to schools.    </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has issued ICT grant funding to schools to address ICT needs including digital devices, communication/learning platforms, software and other ICT solutions to support the provision of remote learning. Additional grant aid will issue during the current school year.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate is supporting school communities to provide effectively for the learning and progression of all learners during the first term of the 2020/21 school year.</p>  <p>  The situation we find ourselves in is evolving all the time.  My Department, in working with the whole of Government, will keep the situation under review and update any advices to schools as required. It is with the work of all our stakeholders together that we will continue to provide the best education for all our pupils/students.</p></reply>

Parents/guardians can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to draft, publish and implement a school admission policy in accordance with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018. In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. </p>  <p>  The admission policy, including the selection criterion to be used where the school is oversubscribed, must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  Where a board of management make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned. </p>  <p>  A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  If a student has been refused admission due to the school being oversubscribed, and the parent/guardian of the student wishes to appeal this decision they must firstly make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the student.</p>  <p>  If a student has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, the parent/guardian may, but is not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the student.  Where  refused admission is for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and the parent/guardian does not choose to seek a review by the board of management, an appeal may be made  to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  Full details on the section 29 appeals process are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link below:</p>  <p>  www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/Appeal-against-Permanent-Exclusion-Suspension-or-Refusal-to-Enrol/Appeals.html.</p>  <p>  In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) the Educational Welfare Service  is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-24a.1379.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112400098#WREE03300"><p>The onset of the Covid-19 Pandemic, and resulting phases of public health measures, has greatly impacted economic activity in the State. Young people are particularly affected by the current crisis, given their tendency to work in sectors most greatly impacted (retail, hospitality, tourism and arts). I am acutely aware of the reliance on these sectors to provide employment opportunities for young people in the West of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Latest CSO data indicates  that at the end of October over 45% of young people in the labour force were unemployed based on the COVID adjusted rate, with just under 20% of this age cohert on the live register.   While many of these young people, in particular those in receipt of PUP,  will return to work when restrictions are eased, some may not.   Therefore these young people displaced by the pandemic will require State support to re-enter the labour market, while not forgetting those who were unemployed prior to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  My Department, and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, are developing  a range of educational, training and support measures to assist young people on their journey back to employment. Measures announced under the July Jobs Stimulus include:</p>  <p>  -  Expanding the capacity of Intreo Centres to provide enhanced employment services and supports through the  allocation of 300 additional staff,  to include 100 Job Coaches. </p>  <p>  -  Extending the benefit of the JobsPlus recruitment subsidy to employers who hire young people from the Live Register. </p>  <p>  -  Facilitating access to the Back to Education Allowance and Back to Work Enterprise Allowance to those who have lost their jobs during the COVID pandemic by waiving the waiting period.</p>  <p>  -  Allowing persons who have temporarily lost their job during COVID public health restrictions to avail of part time education programmes while continuing to receive the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. </p>  <p>  -  Providing additional places on State Employment Schemes in 2021 for those furthest from the labour market and unemployed for over a year, allowing them to gain valuable work experience and new skills while providing valuable services to local communities.</p>  <p>-  Providing incentives to employers to take on more apprentices, with the provision of a grant of &euro;3,000 to employers for each new apprentice recruited.</p>  <p>  -  Providing access to additional fulltime and part-time education, including targeted short-term courses with over 35,000 new education and training places for the unemployed.</p>  <p>  Building on the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS), my Department is developing a new work experience placement programme for those out of work for at least six months. This programme, which will incorporate a training and development plan, will provide jobseekers with the necessary workplace skills to compete in the labour market. I expect to launch the Programme in early 2021, subject to public health restrictions.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the differing regional impacts of the pandemic and the need for targeted, localised employment measures. My Department operates a team of Intreo Case Officers in the West Division (Galway, Mayo and Roscommon), who provide a one-to-one career advice service and tailored employment supports to young jobseekers</p>  <p>  The Intreo service is supplemented by the  capacity of contracted employment service providers in the Division, such as the Local Employment Services (LES), which will be expanded in 2021 to cater for an increase in the number of referrals from Intreo. Many of these referrals will be those who are recently unemployed and may require additional support to re-enter the workforce.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to utilise the existing Youth Employment Subsidy Scheme (YESS) which has proven very effective in providing work placement opportunities to 46 young people in the West Division to date. Furthermore, my Department continues to work closely with the local Education Training Boards advising them on course provision and the specific requirements of the local youth labour market.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the Local Employment Office (LEO), Galway rural Development (GRD), Mayo LEADER program and SICAP to support young people who decide to avail of self employment opportunities as a route back to the labour market. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the national and local policy measures outlined above will assist young people who are seeking jobs to find a pathway back to employment. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is the case even if only one of the couple is actually claiming a payment.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the means test is to ensure those individuals and couples with limited or no income or assets receive the most support from the State, while those with higher levels of income or assets provide for their own needs to a greater extent.  It is in the nature of means-tested schemes that there is no entitlement to a payment once the means of an individual or couple exceed a given amount.    </p>  <p>  Disregarding a claimant's partner's income in the means test for Disability Allowance would give rise to a situation where a person with significant household income would have an entitlement to the payment.  This would lead to inconsistencies in how the means test is applied across social welfare schemes, and would not be compatible with the overarching policy of ensuring that social welfare expenditure is targeted to those who need it most.</p>  <p>  Any changes to the means test for Disability Allowance could have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context. </p></reply>

In this regard, it will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Pensions Commission and I will introduce legislation shortly to give effect to this.  </p>  <p>  The Commission's Terms of Reference includes the examination of sustainability and eligibility issues with the State Pension and the Social Insurance Fund.  More broadly, it will also consider the issue of retirement ages in employment contracts and consider how the pension system can further accommodate carers, who are predominantly women.  </p>  <p>  The membership of the Commission, approved by Government, reflects the need to have subject matter experts to deal with the complex social and public policy issues arising in pensions, as well as stakeholder representation which will keep the work of the Commission grounded.  This includes representation of workers, employers, civil society, academics and those with technical and policy expertise.  In this regard, the membership also includes those with involvement in organisations supporting older people.  </p>  <p>  The Government was keen to ensure that the Commission had strong female representation in its membership, and I am pleased that the majority of confirmed members &ndash; 6 out of 11 &ndash; are women.  It will be chaired by Ms. Josephine Feehily.  I am satisfied that the Commission, with its gender-balanced membership and extensive experience of social and public policy, will be keenly aware of the gender dimension of pensions policy and delivery and will bring this perspective to bear in its work.  </p>  <p>  The Commission will also engage with a range of key stakeholders to ensure that it has a genuine understanding of not only the fiscal sustainability challenges involved, but also the associated social sustainability challenges of implementing potential policy reforms.  The exact mechanisms for this engagement will be shaped by the Chair and by Commission members.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while this Government is acutely conscious of the need to consider the sustainability of the State's finances, this is not the only consideration when thinking of the State pension age.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case. </p>  <p>  The Commission will be holding its first meeting shortly. In line with the Programme for Government, the Commission will report to Government by 30 June of next year and the Government will take action having regard to the recommendations of the Commission within 6 months.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p><p>My Department provides a number of income supports to carers such as Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on all these payments to family carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion. </p><p>Carer's Benefit is a PRSI based payment, made to an insured person who leaves the workforce or reduces their working hours to provide full-time care and attention to a child or an adult who has a disability that requires that level of care.

There is no provision in legislation to waive this requirement.</p><p>Any changes to the eligibility conditions for any of the statutory schemes operated by the Department, including Carer's Benefit, would require legislative change and would need to be addressed in a budgetary context.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the number of remunerated hours worked by an employee is a matter for themselves and their employer.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with Covid-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of Covid-19, the person can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p>  <p>  The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19. The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.  </p>  <p>  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type. Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.</p>  <p>  There is currently no entitlement to statutory sick leave in Ireland.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently engaged in a public consultation process on the introduction of statutory sick pay.  Any entitlement to sick leave and payment for that sick leave is a matter between an individual employer and their employees and should be set out in the contract of employment.  Many employees agree to mandate Illness Benefit payments to their employer where they receive full or partial pay when unable to attend work due to illness &ndash; this is a matter between the employer and the employer.  </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

A number of new Standing Orders were adopted by the D&aacute;il on 17 October 2013 in order to underpin these new arrangements and these Standing Orders came into effect on 5 November 2013.</p>  <p>  In order to clarify the operation of these new Standing Orders, an Agreed Protocol for Pre-Legislative Scrutiny of the Heads of Bills by Oireachtas Committees was published in September 2014.  This protocol provides that certain Bills are exempted from the requirements for pre-legislative scrutiny, including Bills which are required to implement Budget changes such as the Finance Bill, Social Welfare Bills and &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; Bills.</p>  <p>  My Department has made two applications to the Oireachtas Business Committee to waive pre-legislative scrutiny of primary legislation since 1 January 2017.  The details of each application are below.</p>  <p>  In April 2019, Minister Doherty applied to the Oireachtas Business Committee to grant approval for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny for the publication of the Civil Registration Bill 2019.  This Bill included some important provisions related, in particular, to the difficulties being experienced by parents of children born by way of donor-assisted human reproduction (DAHR).  The Business Committee granted a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny, in part because a number of the provisions of this Bill had already been drafted as part of the Social Welfare Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 and had already undergone pre-legislative scrutiny in May 2017.  Other provisions, including those relating to DAHR birth registrations, had been drafted following Government approval and were to be included as Committee Stage amendments in the Social Welfare Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The DAHR provisions were technical amendments to correct errors in existing legislation and were not seeking to implement a new policy proposal.  The Business Committee were asked to waive pre-legislative scrutiny on the basis that many members of the Oireachtas had called for the early and urgent introduction of these provisions to address the deficiencies identified.</p>  <p>  In July 2020, I applied to the Oireachtas Business Committee to grant approval for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny for the publication of the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2020.  This Bill provided for the placing of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment on a  discrete, statutory footing as well as allowing for the attribution of paid social insurance contributions to people in receipt of this payment and jobseeker payments and to employees availing of the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme.  It also allowed for a certain apportionment of the cost of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment to be charged to the Social Insurance Fund.  The Business Committee granted a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny in this case due to the emergency nature of the Bill.</p>  <p>  The other Bills which have been initiated by my Department since January 2017 fall into the categories of Bills exempted under the agreed protocol from the requirements for pre-legislative scrutiny or they underwent pre-legislative scrutiny or the relevant Committee did not deem pre-legislative scrutiny necessary.</p></reply>

Protocols for selection preclude the selection of anyone who has already completed 52 weeks with the JobPath service within the previous four months. If, however, at the end of this period the jobseeker has not engaged in other activation supports and services they then become eligible for selection for further referral to a JobPath case officer/personal advisor. </p><p>Jobseekers referred for a subsequent period of engagement will start working with a Personal Advisor, who will review their development during their previous engagements with the service and together they will prepare a new personal progression plan to build on that progress. The actions and tasks agreed will be based on their previous engagements, with particular focus on addressing any barriers that may be identified as blocking the person from moving into full-time suitable employment. </p><p>I have recently instructed my officials to ensure that no new clients should serve more than two complete engagements with JobPath and practical arrangements are currently being put in place to ensure that this is the case. </p><p>The Department uses the measure of completion of engagements with JobPath as a more accurate metric as opposed to referrals, as customers can be referred on a number of occasions without actually engaging with the service.  The reasons for this can typically be  a change of circumstance between referral and engagement (e.g. a person may find employment before they start their engagement period with JobPath or they may transfer to another welfare scheme).  To date 133,574 clients have completed one full engagement with JobPath, 33,256 clients have completed two full engagements with the JobPath service and 1,325 people have completed a third engagement period. This information has been summarised in Table 2.</p><p>JobPath provides a case management based employment advice and counselling service to long term unemployed jobseekers which aids jobseekers in finding employment. As part of this process, JobPath in common with other contracted providers such as the LES and indeed the Department's own Intreo staff, may identify suitable job opportunities and refer jobseekers to these job opportunities.  Equally, the jobseeker may, during the period of engagement, identify their own opportunities.  This would also be case in respect of engagements with the LES or the Department's own staff.  </p><p>Between July 2015 and October 2020, some 283,826 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service. These engagements are set out in Table 1. </p><p>In the same period, 64,632 jobseekers had commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath.  Of these, 40,876 have sustained employment for 13 weeks, 32,811 have sustained employment for 26 weeks, 26,992 have sustained employment for 39 weeks and 22,581 continued to be employed after twelve months.</p><p>It should be noted that many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service. They have not yet had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment nor sustain that employment for up to 52 weeks.  The measure of performance will improve as more clients complete their engagement with the service and have a chance to reach 52 weeks in employment.In addition, employment progression rates need to be compared with the 'counterfactual' of what would have happened if a person did not avail of the of the JobPath service.  For this reason, I would refer the Deputy to the econcometric evaluation of the service published on the Department's website at .  This indicates that employment/earnings outcomes for people who engaged with JobPath are 37% improved compared to control groups who did not engage with the service.  The Department will continue to monitor this performance and will, in addition, commission studies of other employment advisory services, including the LES, over the next 12 months.</p><p>JobPath providers do not apply, nor do they recommend the application of, a penalty rate of payment. Their role is to simply advise the Department if a jobseeker has failed to attend activation meetings. The application of penalty rates is entirely a matter for Departmental staff. </p><p>The legislation underpinning the application of reduced rates of payment was provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2010.All decisions on the application of reduced rates of payment are made by officials from my Department and the circumstances of each case are taken into account prior to a decision being made.</p><p>Due to the on going economic impact of the Covid 19 Pandemic penalty rates have not been applied to payments since March 2020. Of those who were engaged with JobPath in February, 430 people or 0.7% had a reduced rate applied to their claim. This figure is consistent with the overall level of reduced  rates applied across all Jobseekers. It should be pointed out that several factors may be considered in applying penalty rates and it is not possible to state in which instances the sole context may have been non-engagement with JobPath. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p><p><b>Table 1:</b></p><p><b>JobPath Engagements (PPP agreed) by year (as of end October 2020)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Referral Year</th>       <th>2015</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>End Oct 2020</th>       <th>Total</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Engagements </td>       <td>6,588</td>       <td>65,452</td>       <td>74,860</td>       <td>60,817</td>       <td>50,341</td>       <td>25,768</td>       <td>283,826</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2:</b></p><p><b>JobPath clients with Multiple completed engagements (as of end October 2020)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Number of Jobseekers who have completed at least  one full engagement with JobPath</th>       <th>168,155</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Of which have completed  One Full Engagement only</td>       <td>133,574</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Of which have completed Two Full Engagements</td>       <td>33,256</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Of which have completed Three Full Engagements</td>       <td>1,325</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The overall cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of people who participate in the programme and the number who get sustainable jobs. </p><p>The total paid to the JobPath providers and up to October 2020 is &euro;247.9m</p><p>This total breaks down as follows: - </p><p>Referral Fees: &euro;99.9m </p><p>Job Sustainment Fees: &euro;148m </p><p>The focus of the JobPath Service is to provide intensive support to people, who are experiencing long-term unemployment or who are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed, to secure and sustain full-time employment.  This is achieved by working with the client to identify and provide intensive support to overcome barriers to employment.  </p><p>The period of engagement with the service is 52 weeks, and during that time, the jobseeker avails of intensive support from a dedicated Personal Advisor (PA). If the jobseeker is successful in finding employment, the support of the PA continues for the remaining duration of the person&rsquo;s engagement with the service and for a period of at least six and up to twelve months thereafter.  </p><p>If the jobseeker obtains employment but it is not sustained beyond 13 or 26 weeks, the engagement with the PA will resume. The employment experience will be reviewed to build on progress, and to identify measures to sustain employment.  This may entail referral to training, education or other interventions appropriate to sustaining employment.</p><p>The overall performance of the contractors in assisting persons in gaining and sustaining employment is under continual review including the numbers who sustain employment for 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. My Department meets regularly with the contractors to review all aspects of the contract delivery including performance.</p><p>Inspections are one of a number of key performance monitoring features, which enable my Department to oversee all aspects of the JobPath providers&rsquo; performance and ensure contract compliance. </p><p>As at end of October 2020, a total of 117 inspections have been carried out at JobPath service delivery locations; 72 have been notified and 45 were un-notified. </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Currently there are 58,236 beneficiaries of this payment in the State pension (contributory) scheme.  </p>  <p>  As part of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that claimants are receiving their full and correct entitlements, ongoing reviews of means tested payments are carried out.  </p>  <p>  The primary State pension (contributory) claimant is contacted to notify them that their continuing entitlement to the means-tested IQA payment is being examined.  In this context, details of the means of their qualified adult is requested.  These  review letters have been approved by the National Adult Literacy Association.</p>  <p>  Where a qualified adult has weekly means of less than &euro;100, the maximum rate of IQA is payable.  Where their weekly means is between &euro;100 and &euro;310, a reduced rate of IQA is payable.  If the qualified adult has means of more than &euro;310 per week, this exceeds the means limit and no IQA payment is due.  For claimants of contributory pension, only the means of the qualified adult are taken into account.  In the case of joint bank accounts, or joint ownership of land or property (apart from the family home), half the value or amount is assessed as means for the qualified adult.  </p>  <p>  It is open to claimants to contact my Department regarding the return of the requested information.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-24a.1438.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112400099#WRFF04100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 556, 580 and 592 together.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment scheme in March, approximately 815,000 people have applied for payment and in some cases, they have done so on a number of occasions as they moved in and out of employment or where their employer availed of the Revenue Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme. Consequently, there are over 1.4 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. To date, over 13 million individual payments have issued over a 36 week period. </p>  <p>   Arrears in respect of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will arise under two broad headings. Firstly, there may have been an initial time lag in the commencement of payments. During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. Almost 59,000 people were paid in the first week of the scheme, increasing to 283,000 people in the following week and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme. The focus was on putting claims into payment as quickly as possible was and it was not possible to generate arrears payments at the time.  Secondly, arrears may also arise in respect of individual weeks where claims could not be processed due to incomplete applications or data mismatches. </p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, my Department has developed an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date). Final testing and implementation of the automated process is currently underway with a view to issuing payments before the end of the year and as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>   I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputies.</p></reply>

To date over 3,200 claims have been put into payment in respect of  employees who have applied for a jobseeker's payment. This work is now complete and work commenced last week on applications in respect of the period pre-September when the Temporary Wage Subsidy scheme was in payment.  Each individual claim is being assessed on an individual basis for each employee involving a detailed examination of the specific work patterns and remuneration arrangements in place.</p>  <p>  Entitlement to a casual jobseeker's or short-time work support payment for any day during that period depends, among other things, on whether or not a person received remuneration from their employer for that day.  Each case needs to be examined individually to determine if the remuneration paid by the company concerned was in respect of a complete period or only specific days within a period.  This will determine if a person may be entitled to a casual jobseeker's payment in respect of the days on which a person did not work.</p>  <p>  A process has been agreed with the company that any outstanding information required to finalise decisions on social welfare entitlements will be provided by the company to their employees as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  However, because of the volume and complexity of claims involved and the need to go back to individual claimants, the process will take some time.</p>  <p>  Once a decision is made on a particular claim, the Department will notify that claimant of the outcome and it will be open to any person who is not satisfied with this decision to seek a review or to appeal that decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

There is no automatic entitlement to these payments which are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case, in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p>  <p>  If the persons concerned are experiencing financial difficulties they can contact their local Community Welfare Service (CWS) in Maynooth where their circumstances will be assessed.

The code of practice is published on <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/f75848-operational-guidelines-swi-code-of-practice-for-social-welfare-inspe/</i>.  It requires that Customers must at all times be treated equally, fairly, with respect and dignity, as outlined in the Customer Charter.  </p><p>Inspectors are appointed under Section 250 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  They are required to investigate and report on customer&rsquo;s claims and confirm that scheme conditionality is in order. The powers outline the requirement for a claimant to give an inspector information and any documents that s/he may require for the purposes of an investigation.</p><p>As part of their investigations, an inspector's remit also includes the combating of fraud and abuse of the Department's schemes. Inspectors may need to make notified or un-notified home visits.  Such visits to a customer&rsquo;s home are an operational control measure and a decision as to whether a home visit is necessary, and whether the customer is notified in advance, will depend on the nature of the case.  </p><p>It is important to understand that inspectors work across the range of the Department's activities and that home visits could be required, for instance, to facilitate access to an Urgent Needs payment or to review a case without which a delay in payment to the customer might occur.</p><p>Finally, it is also important to understand that Social Welfare Inspectors may only enter a private home if invited. There is no statutory power of entry, unlike a workplace.  If a customer does not wish to allow an inspector to enter their private home, they may be requested by the inspector to  make themselves available for interview at an alternative agreed location.  </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Both options commenced with one year of participation with the possibility of either one or two more years, depending on the option taken.  Both options were subject to qualification criteria and neither required the CE participant to undertake any training resulting in the achievement of a major QQI award.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the new conditions and qualifying criteria were introduced and a saver clause was provided for the existing clients:  &lsquo;Participants who commenced on CE prior to 3rd July 2017 will be entitled to remain under their existing CE eligibility rules, where this is to their advantage.  If it is more advantageous to the person, the current criteria can be applied.&rsquo;</p>  <p>The saver clause that was introduced allowed CE participants who commenced under that option to continue on CE for a maximum of three consecutive years with or without working towards a QQI major award, whichever was more advantageous. The 2017 saver clause does not allow those affected to continue to participate on CE for six years consecutively. </p>  <p>  The same continuous limitation of three years continues to apply to all CE participants both pre and post 2017.  CE participation was never intended to be long-term and the maximum continued participation on CE is three years. </p>  <p>  In general CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  CE participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification. CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award. In either scenario, a maximum of three consecutive year's participation on CE is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a twelve month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).  The same rules and eligibility criteria attached to participation on CE are applied throughout the country.  </p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  Places on these work programmes will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, while maintaining the role of CE as an active labour market programme. </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve CE for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities. </p></reply>

The Government confirmed as part of its Budget 2021 measures that the required amendment to primary legislation (the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005) will be brought before the Oireachtas later this year as part of the Budget Bill for enactment in advance of the 1st January 2021.  </p><p>Based on modelling conducted in advance of Budget 2021, my Department estimated costings for retaining the State pension age at 66 year, in both 2021 and 2022.  The gross extra costs were estimated at approx. &euro;321 million in 2021 and approx. &euro;653.5 million in 2022.</p><p>The net extra costs for 2021 are estimated at approx. &euro;221 million in 2021.  The 2022 full year extra cost of retaining the State pension age at 66 years is estimated to be approx. &euro;453 million.  The smaller amount in 2021 is due to a first year effect.  The 2022 extra cost figure of &euro;453 million is expected to rise year on year thereafter. </p><p>The estimates for net extra costs take into consideration PRSI receipts forgone, movements from other social welfare schemes, and secondary benefit entitlements including Fuel Allowance, Household Benefit Payment and Telephone Allowance.  The estimates are based on current rates of payments and do not make any provision for rate increases. </p><p>The estimates do not include costs for public sector pensions.

As a result of demographic pressures, the number of State pension recipients will continue to rise.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision. Sustainability is vital if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI contributions, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age. </p><p>The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2015, was published in September 2017 and highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s rapidly altering age structure.  The Review covered a 55 year period from 2016-2071.The Review emphasised that long-term projections are based on a wide range of assumptions about the future.The focus was on the trends which emerge over the projection period of the Review and on the relativities between various items of income and expenditure rather than on the results for individual years. </p><p>The Review indicated that the percentage of the population over State pension age was projected to increase from 12% in 2015 (when State Pension Age was 66 years),  to 17% in 2035 (when the State pension age was expected to be 68 years) and to 23% in 2055  (again on the basis that the State pension age expected to be 68 years).  It is also projected that the pensioner support ratio will decline from 4.9 workers/person over State Pension Age to 2.9 in 2035 to 2.0 in 2055.  </p><p>Furthermore, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) published its &ldquo;Long-term Sustainability Report: Fiscal challenges and risks 2025-2050&rdquo; in July 2020.  This report provides the IFAC&rsquo;s assessment of the long-run sustainability of the public finances in Ireland and demographic projections for the coming decades to 2050.  The economic projections were formed on the basis of consistent macroeconomic and demographic underpinnings and assumptions.This report indicated that Ireland faces a rapid pace of ageing.  It projected dramatic growth rates for older-age population cohorts.Age groups below 65 are set to see modest increases over 2020?2050, while older cohorts will increase much more markedly. The population aged 65&ndash;79 will expand by 88% and the 80+ population will expand by 240%.  </p><p>Based on modelling conducted earlier this year, the following table sets out estimated increases in expenditure directly related to the demographic changes in the pension population for the period 2021 to 2025.  These estimates are based on a State Pension Age of 66.  These demographic pressures alone mean that total expenditure on pensions over the five years from 2021 to 2025 will increase by an extra &euro;5.5 billion approx., without any payment rate increases.  </p><p>Additional Annual State Pension Expenditure From Demographics 2021-2025 (&euro; Billions)</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022</th>       <th>2023</th>       <th>2024</th>       <th>2025</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Increase caused by demographic growth in numbers (&euro;bn.)</td>       <td>0.47</td>       <td>0.65</td>       <td>1.05</td>       <td>1.4</td>       <td>1.9</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Modelling increases in pension expenditure on an annual basis beyond 2025 has not yet been done to this level of detail and requires a comprehensive examination of demographic changes and actuarial probabilities.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Government has approved the establishment of a Commission on Pensions.  The Commission&rsquo;s Terms of Reference includes a review the projected changes in demographics, earnings and the labour market, and associated costs.  In line with the Programme for Government, the Commission will report to Government on its work, findings, options and recommendations by 30th June 2021.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and in the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.</p>  <p>  The main income supports to carers provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant. Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion. </p>  <p>  A primary qualifying condition for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit payments is that the applicant provides full-time care and attention to a person in need of such care.  The person being cared for must be so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and be likely to require this full-time care and attention for at least 12 months.  However, in order to support a carer&rsquo;s continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  The maximum period in which a person may engage in employment, education and training is 18.5 hours per week and during this time, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person.  The full-time care and attention requirement and the 18.5-hour limitation are contained in the respective legislative provisions of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant schemes.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2020, the number of hours per week that carers could engage in employment, education or training outside the home was increased from 15 to 18.5 hours per week.  This measure was prioritised in response to carers and carer representative groups who found the previous number of 15 hours to be too restrictive, not only for work but for education and training purposes. </p>  <p>  I consider the limit of 18.5 hours to represent a reasonable balance between meeting the care recipient's requirement for full-time care and the carer's need to maintain contact with the workforce.  Any proposals for further changes to this condition would need to maintain this balance and would have to be considered in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main focus of the allowance is to assist individuals in receipt of certain welfare payments to improve their educational qualifications and their prospects of gaining employment.  </p>  <p>  The BTEA was extended as part of the July Stimulus in response to Covid-19.  Ordinarily a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a minimum period before being eligible to apply for the BTEA when pursuing full-time education.  The qualifying period has been waived for people coming from the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  This ensures that those who have lost their employment during the pandemic have immediate access to a range of educational options, including VTOS.</p>  <p>  In order to avail of continued financial support while pursuing a full-time course, a person in receipt of PUP should establish an entitlement to a jobseeker payment.  The BTEA is payable at the jobseekers rate for the duration of someone&rsquo;s course where they continue to have an entitlement to the payment. </p>  <p>  There are no plans to further amend the waiting periods for BTEA and if the Deputy is aware of a case affected by the 2 week quarantine period they should bring the case to the Department's attention for review. </p>  <p>  The BTEA is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for people pursuing education.  The student universal support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing third level education. </p>  <p>  Where someone in receipt of PUP wishes to pursue short term or part-time study they can continue to receive PUP while they continue to satisfy the conditions of that payment.  There are many options and supports available to jobseekers wishing to pursue short-term or part-time training or education, without a qualification period.  Any person seeking to return to education should engage with their local Intreo Centre to assess their options.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the issues for the Deputy.</p></reply>

According to the records of my Department, they have a total of 1,106 qualifying full-rate paid contributions and 257 credited contributions from their date of entry into insurable employment on 18 April 1970 to end-December 2009.  This equates to a yearly average of 33 contributions and gives them an entitlement to a standard State pension (contributory) at 98% of the maximum rate.  They were notified in writing of this decision on 5 July 2010. </p>  <p>  There is no record of the person concerned having applied for or having paid Voluntary Contributions in advance of reaching pension age.  According to the records of my Department, payment was made by the person concerned in February 2010 for outstanding self-employment liabilities.  </p>  <p>The matter of a farm partnership between the person and their spouse was investigated by the Scope section of my Department.  A formal Scope decision determined that a partnership was in place and the person was in self-employment for the years from 1988/89 onwards.    Since their income for 1988/89 was below the PRSI threshold, they were considered to be insurably self-employed from 1989/90.  As a result, a bill issued to the person concerned for settlement of their outstanding self-employment liabilities from 1989/90 to 2009.  These liabilities were paid in February 2010 prior to the person&rsquo;s 66th   birthday and their contribution record was updated.  Consequently, Class S contributions for the tax years 1989/90 to 2009 inclusive have been included in the calculation of the person&rsquo;s pension entitlement.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the person concerned is in receipt of the correct rate of State pension (contributory), commensurate with their social insurance record as held by my Department. </p>  <p>  I have arranged for a copy of their pension award letter to issue to them with a copy of their social insurance record.

Therefore, the criteria for the allowance were framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  </p><p>To receive the allowance a customer of my Department must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and also in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance. </p><p>Based on an estimated average of 136,000 recipients of TSA in 2021, the estimated cost of increasing the weekly rate of TSA to &euro;4 per week would be in the region of &euro;10.6 million.

It was advised that a general reply was being sought. </p>  <p>  The published aims of the Social Welfare Appeals Office are to provide an independent, accessible and fair appeals service with regard to entitlement to social welfare payments and to deliver that service in a prompt and courteous manner.  The Office's training and awareness raising measures for its staff are based on those principles. </p>  <p>  Under social welfare legislation the decision of an Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed under Section 317 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 by an Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  In addition, the Chief Appeals Officer has power under Section 318 of the Act to revise any decision where it appears to her that the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s decision was erroneous by reason of some mistake having been made in relation to the law or the facts.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy wishes to raise any concerns in relation to any specific appeal decision the Chief Appeals Officer will ensure that the matter will be examined and the outcome communicated to him.</p>  <p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

AIM supports children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-school where they can learn and socialise with their peers. It includes 7 levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted. It is administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department. The degree of support provided depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school setting they are attending.</p><p>A pre-school provider, in partnership with a parent, can apply for AIM Level 7 additional capitation. Where the Better Start AIM Early Years Specialist considers that a Level 7 support is critical to a child's participation in the pre-school setting, they approve the additional capitation which can be used to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or can be used to buy in additional assistance. </p><p>In relation to the child referred to in the Deputy's question, Pobal has advised that AIM Level 7 Support was granted for this child on 12/10/2020.  The service provider has engaged with Pobal via the &lsquo;Notification of Change&rsquo; process to advise of the difficulties in recruiting a person to fill the AIM-funded role.  Although the Department funds AIM supports,  any recruitment process is carried out by the preschool provider. Neither the Department nor Pobal has any role in the recruitment of staff for preschool services.</p><p>Where parents need further information on options available to them for their child's early learning and care needs, they are encouraged to engage with their local County Childcare Committee (CCC) for advice on how best proceed. The CCC may be able to provide information on other settings in the area that may have capacity for the child to attend. The CCC may also be able to provide assistance to the pre-school service in filling the staff vacancy they have.

The bursary is for childminders who achieve a level 5 or level 6 major award in early childhood care and education recognised on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) and who register with Tusla. Childminders who are registered with Tusla can also avail of the Learner Fund graduate bursary for level 7 and 8 graduate-level awards in early learning and care.</p>  <p>  The graduate and childminder Level 5/6 bursaries operate simultaneously and are funded from the same budget. In 2018 a total of &euro;412,500 was spent on the Learner Fund graduate bursary. In 2019 a total of &euro;368,250 was spent on the overall Learner Fund bursary programme which included both the graduate and childminder Level 5/6 bursaries. In 2020, a total of &euro;390,000 was allocated to the overall Learner Fund bursary programme and also included both the graduate and childminder Level 5/6 bursaries. </p>  <p>  The 2019 round of the Learner Fund saw bursaries awarded to 481 applicants for completion of relevant degrees (who may include both centre-based practitioners and childminders), and 10 Tusla-registered childminders for completion of Level 5/6 awards. The data currently available does not distinguish whether a grantee of the Learner Fund graduate bursary is a childminder or a practitioner in centre-based provision. The 2020 round of the Learner Fund bursary has recently closed and awards will be announced shortly. </p>  <p>  The number of childminders availing of the Learner Fund is expected to remain very low until regulation is extended to all childminders and bespoke training and qualifications are developed for childminders. Currently there are 77 Tusla-registered childminders. In line with commitments in First 5 and the Programme for Government, a Childminding Action Plan is currently being finalised, with a view to publication in the near future.

Tusla assesses all child welfare and protection concerns that are reported to it.</p><p>The Children First Act 2015, which was fully commenced in December 2017, provides for a number of key child protection measures. These include awareness raising, providing for mandatory reporting of child protection concerns by certain categories of persons and improving safeguarding arrangements in organisations providing services to children. The Act operates alongside the non-statutory obligations provided for in Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2017, which sets out how all reasonable concerns about a child should be reported to Tusla. The Act recognises that a child&rsquo;s welfare includes their emotional welfare while the Guidance sets out definitions of abuse, including emotional abuse, and signs for its recognition. </p><p>Referrals to Tusla regarding the possible harm to a child from a parent are assessed in line with Tusla&rsquo;s policies, procedures and best practice. Tusla has advised that its child protection and welfare assessment considers any past harm and any future danger to a child as a result of complicating factors in a child's environment. These factors include any parental behaviour that is deemed to have a negative impact on a child resulting in them being seriously harmed, including the behaviours that would indicate emotional abuse. Tusla also considers any strengths and existing safety present for the child in the context of the harm and then works collaboratively with parents, professionals and others to create effective safety for the child into the future.</p><p>However, parental alienation is a very challenging and complex issue. It generally arises in situations of extreme inter-parental conflict, which can result in children withdrawing from one parent without the other parent deliberately directing them to do so, but as a response to the conflict. Mediation can sometimes offer parents an opportunity to work through issues arising. </p><p>Tusla social work staff are supported in their professional and evidence informed assessments by access to an online evidence informed toolkit that provides detailed up-to-date research and recommended interventions on key areas such as attachment, critical analysis and thinking, child development, the impact of abuse, separation and loss and parenting capacity. Tusla also provides all staff with access to an entire research centre  with relevant current research and publications relevant to child protection and welfare practice. In addition to regular professional supervision, this ensures staff are supported in maintaining their expertise in an ongoing and supportive learning environment.</p><p>Tusla works collaboratively with child and adult mental health services, the Courts and other therapeutic services in respect of any relevant matters referred to it, including in relation to necessary interventions to support the safety and wellbeing of a child.  </p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill. The Family Court Bill will be a key element in the development of a more efficient and user-friendly family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings.

This Group will agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system, in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure, as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill.

When a person makes an enquiry they are informed about the programmes available and are offered a meeting to discuss their options.    Their goals are discussed, an initial assessment is carried out and an appropriate learning programme is offered to them. As the service operates a continuous intake policy, the person can generally start straight away. Occasionally if a person opts for one to one tuition they may have to wait a short while until a tutor is available.</p>  <p>  All courses on offer can lead to certification at level 1, 2 and 3 on the National Framework of Qualifications. Classes are free, confidential, part time and generally available during the daytime or evening. The individual is encouraged to learn at their own pace either in a small group or with one-to-one tuition if needed. </p>  <p>  There are also financial supports available for learners who are in receipt of certain Social Welfare payments.

The ongoing shortage of accommodation in the general rental sector, as well the increase in third level students over the last number of years, has placed additional emphasis on the availability and provision of student accommodation. An increase in supply in both public and private sector student accommodation has been necessary to keep pace with demand.</p>  <p>  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached in regard to a refund.</p>  <p>  If this is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). </p>  <p>  I have asked our higher education institutions, where they have accommodation, to try to show flexibility in terms of its use for the coming academic year, as well as flexibility with regard to cancellations and refunds. I would hope that that private providers will show the same flexibility, however it is not within my remit to issue instruction in relation to the private rental market.</p></reply>

Our higher education institutions have a duty of care to their students and staff, and a responsibility to foster a campus culture that is clear in the condemnation of unwanted and unacceptable behaviours, which act as barriers to their safety and their active participation in college life. </p>  <p>  In October 2020, I wrote to the Chair of the UCD Governing Authority on the communications that I received from some staff members and former students of the university, so that these might inform the oversight by the Governing Authority of the important work underway in UCD to eliminate sexual harassment and bullying, and improve the environment for students and staff. I believe that these perspectives should be given appropriate consideration by the university, with a view to ensuring an effective and inclusive process in the revision of its bullying, harassment and sexual harassment policies and procedures. </p>  <p>  In August 2020 I wrote to the Presidents of all publicly funded higher education institutions requesting that they develop and publish, by February 2021, specific institutional action plans on tackling sexual violence and harassment. These action plans will involve the implementation of systems that record the number of incidents of bullying, intimidation or harassment including sexual harassment. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has oversight of the Framework for Consent in HEIs, and these statistics will be reported annually to the HEA once the action plans in each institution are in place.</p>  <p>  I have also requested that a survey be undertaken on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying of both staff and students in the higher education institutions. The planning of this survey has commenced, and the HEA is consulting with the Irish Universities Association and the Technological Higher Education Association in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring a safe and respectful environment for all staff and students in our Higher Education Institutions, and the steps I am undertaking, I believe, will contribute significantly to the realisation of this objective.</p></reply>

These include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education including students with disabilities and Irish Travellers. </p>  <p>The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund is the funding mechanism supporting the NAP to enable innovative responses to support target groups&rsquo; participation and retention in higher education. The PATH fund was confirmed as a permanent fund in 2020 and has a current investment envelope of &euro;33.9 million over the period 2016 to 2022, across the three strands, PATH 1 - Initial Teacher Education, PATH 2 - The 1916 Bursary Fund and PATH 3 - The Higher Education Access Fund.</p>  <p>  Consultations on the next National Access Plan will commence early 2021.  </p>  <p>  A Progress Review of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education and the Priorities to 2021 was published in December 2018.  The review has shown that there has been significant increases in participation rates since work began on implementing the NAP.  The most considerable progress toward realising the targets of the NAP has been achieved amongst the disabilities target group.  The target of 8% that was set for the lifetime of the Plan has been exceeded by the Progress Review stage. A new target of 12% has been set for 2021.The overall participation rate has increased to 10.5%, and targets have equally been surpassed in respect of two of the three categories of disability. There has been a 88% increase in participation by students with physical or mobility disabilities, while participation rates by deaf students or those hard of hearing has increased by 48%.  Participation by students that are blind or that have a vision impairment has increased by 53%. </p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in full-time programmes of further and higher education. The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each HEI who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. The 2020 allocation to the fund is &euro;9.6m which is expected to support circa 14,000 students.</p>  <p>  While increases have been recorded throughout the target groups, the Traveller group has not progressed as was anticipated by the NAP.  In response to the lower than anticipated progress for Travellers, an Action Plan to Promote Traveller Participation in Higher Education was developed and published in late 2019. The plan was developed in consultation with Traveller representative groups, and aims to support and advance Traveller participation in higher education. It will work within the context of approaches to retention and transitions of Travellers across the education spectrum. The gathering of precise data in respect of Traveller students is complicated by the reliance on self-identification. However, it is anticipated that the new Action Plan, which contains nine key objectives and sixteen priority actions, will encourage Travellers to progress to higher education and have the confidence to self-identify and promote their Traveller heritage. Reporting on progress on the actions commenced in September 2020 and demonstrated that PATH Funding of &euro;1.5m has been targeted at Travellers over first three years from 2017 to 2020, high success rates of 70% among Travellers applications to the 1916 Bursary Fund and dedicated PATH 1 and PATH 3 projects.</p>  <p>  More recently on the 12th of this month I announced ring-fenced funding of &euro;300,000 for targeted supports to address the implications of COVID-19 for Traveller transfer to and progression within higher education. The funding, which has been secured through the Dormant Accounts Fund, will help ensure expected increases in Traveller participation in higher education remain on track. </p></reply>

Higher education institutions are autonomous institutions as provided for in legislation and on that basis, the criteria governing the level of tuition fees to be charged in the case of postgraduate study is solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the impact the pandemic has had on our students. To ensure the safety of our students and staff in further and higher education, the majority of college will be online for this semester.  In recognition of the challenges facing full time third level students the Government has approved once off funding of &euro;50m to provide additional financial assistance in this academic year. </p>  <p>  The funding, which was provided in Budget 2021, will offer financial assistance to all Irish/EU full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publically funded Higher Education Institutions in recognition of the significant upheaval they have experienced due to Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  The scheme will provide students who avail of the SUSI grant will receive &euro;250 top-up in their grant before Christmas or in early 2021, while students who do not avail of the grant can reduce by &euro;250 any outstanding contribution fee payments or receive a &euro;250 credit note for their institution. In a small number of cases, alternative arrangements may be made for the distribution to students.</p>  <p>  Additionally Budget 2021 provides further funding to enhance SUSI grant supports for post-grads and increase support for the PATH access initiative, which seeks to increase participation in Higher Education from the most economically disadvantaged students.</p>  <p>  This builds on the specific student supports in response to Covid, which I announced in July including including a doubling of the Student Assistance Fund.</p></reply>

Funding under the Skills to Advance Innovation Fund is being used to develop new delivery modes and enhance training capacity to facilitate the wider national delivery of these programmes. Work is also ongoing on the delivery of train-the-trainer programmes to ensure that the construction sector is appropriately positioned to expand to meet expected demand for programmes.  </p>  <p>  Retrofit skills training is currently provided by Waterford Wexford Education and Training Board and the Laois Offaly Education and Training Board.  5 Retrofit Centres of Excellence are being developed and are expected to be operational in 2021. It is anticipated that in 2020, 620 individuals will complete training courses in retrofit skills, including Near Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB) skills and this number is expected to double in 2021. </p>  <p>  As part of the July Stimulus, the Government allocated &euro;500,000 to expand skills development infrastructure in preparation for the significant increase in reskilling required to deliver the National Retrofitting Programme. Budget 2021 provided for an additional 500 places on 10 week retrofitting courses in addition to the expected increase for existing short courses.</p>  <p>  Over 15,000 places on Springboard+ and Human Capital Initiative Pillar 1 graduate conversion courses were announced in July, and a further 2,000 places were provided as a direct response to the skills needs arising from Covid-19 under the July Stimulus. These courses include areas such as Near Zero Energy Buildings, wind energy, solar energy, and sustainable energy systems.  The July Stimulus also provided for over 2,000 free or subsidised full and part time postgraduate places on a range of existing courses in 23 public and private higher education institutions. The places are available on courses in a wide range of skills areas, including Environmental Sciences, sustainable energy.  </p>  <p>  Also funded under the July Stimulus are a range of modular courses which are short and focused and will be offered in a flexible manner, allowing people to gain important skills without taking a considerable period away from the labour market. Each module will be stand-alone so that participants can gain skills and put them into practice immediately in the workplace, but modules are also accredited in such a way as to provide building blocks to a full qualification should the student so wish.  These 538 modular courses across a broad range of subjects in 32 higher education institutions, represent a new route into lifelong learning, and provide upskilling and reskilling opportunities for those who need it, while ensuring that they remain close to the labour market. They include courses in renewable energy, NZEB policy and techniques, and BIM.</p>  <p>  In addition, Green Tech Skillnet, funded by Skillnet Ireland through the National Training Fund and promoted by the Irish Wind Energy Association (IWEA), provides training for enterprises in the renewable energy and green technology sectors. Member companies work collaboratively to share best practice and to respond effectively to the specific skills needs of the sector. The network addresses both technical and non-technical skills needs of members. Skillnet Ireland will also be rolling out a new climate action upskilling scheme in 2021.</p></reply>

In assessing an application for the 2020/21 academic year, SUSI will have regard to the following qualifying criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant: 1. The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant; 2. Total reckonable income, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must  not exceed &euro;24,500; 3. As at 31st of December 2019, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in Schedule 2 of  the Student Grant Scheme 2020.</p><p>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education made detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.  The target group of &quot;those most in need&quot; was defined in terms of the dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, where the necessary conditions are fulfilled.  </p><p>In general terms, Jobseekers Benefit is considered to be a short-term payment unless it is held for 391 consecutive days at 31 December 2019.  The 391 days is the time period as determined by DEASP for a social welfare payment to be regarded as long term, and refers to social welfare days as opposed to calendar days.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit is operated by DEASP on a 6 day week basis.</p><p>The Student Grant Scheme makes provision for combining periods of Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit and other eligible payments for the purposes of meeting 391 days as determined by the Department of Social Protection. </p><p>Families on low incomes may wish to enquire with the Department of Social Protection as to their eligibility for the Working Family Payment (which is an eligible payment for the purposes of the Special Rate of Grant).</p><p>As part of SUSI&rsquo;s internal processes, Post Assessment Quality Reviews are carried out on applications both for the current academic year and all prior academic years. This includes fast track renewal applications. If a student was in receipt of funding in the previous academic year, they may have the option to make a fast track renewal application. The student is asked if there have been any changes since the last academic year and if the student answers there has not been any change,  the same rate of funding is awarded as in the previous year. If a change is found during a review, the rate awarded may be revised. In such cases, the student receives a letter notifying them of the revised decision and/or SUSI may request additional documentation to ensure that applicants are awarded the best possible rate of grant. A revised decision can be appealed and the appeals process is outlined in the letter. </p><p>If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a student grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to SUSI. </p><p>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe, (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant). Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via <i>www.studentgrantappeals.ie.</i></p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie.</i></p></reply>

Under the terms of the scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p><p>I want to look strategically at a wide range of issues related to the Student Grant Scheme, administered by SUSI, and that is why I recently announced plans to review the scheme. It is intended that the Review will commence before the end of 2020  and will report in Summer 2021. </p><p>Stakeholders will be consulted as part of the Review process. I intend to invite contributions from stakeholders in the student grant system via a formal submission process. These submissions will be considered in the context of the parameters of the Programme for Government commitments, whilst recognising that the scheme operates in the context of competing educational priorities and limited public funding. The aim of the student grant scheme is to make a contribution to the cost of going to college; covering the full cost has never been a feasible option. </p><p>The Review will focus on: </p><p>- Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the Student Grant Scheme.</p><p>- Review of eligibility and adjacency rates.</p><p>- Examining the future role of SUSI in supporting different forms of provision in line with national priorities, including postgraduate studies. </p><p>From September 2010, as announced in the Budget, all new applicants who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), and VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, are ineligible for student maintenance grants. </p><p>The decision was taken to discontinue the practice of allowing students progressing to a new course to hold both the BTEA and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments. This measure was recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes. </p><p>However, the cost of the student contribution and any fees payable to colleges for the students concerned is met for these students by the Exchequer under the Student Grant Scheme, subject to the means test and other grant eligibility requirements. A student may apply to have eligibility for same assessed by the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) by submitting an online grant application via <i>www.susi.ie</i>.</p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p><p>In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, <i>www.revenue.ie.</i></p></reply>

Apprentices are primarily employees and, in common with other employees, are eligible for Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) where they meet the terms of the scheme, including for periods of temporary lay-off.  Where an apprentice has been made redundant the relevant Authorised Officer works to support the apprentice, including seeking alternative employment.  </p><p>Employers are eligible to apply for Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) for apprentices in their employment and 117 apprentices are known to have their employment supported through the TWSS at the current time.  </p><p>The Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme (AIS) was initially funded under the July Stimulus programme and has been extended to mid-2021. It provides an employer grant of &euro;3,000 for each new apprentice registered between 1st March 2020 and end June 2021. &euro;2,000 of the grant is paid to the employer once the apprentice is registered, and a further &euro;1,000 is paid after one year if the apprentice is still in employment at that time. </p><p>The impact of Covid-19 on businesses has resulted in a decrease of approximately 24% in new apprentice registrations for the year to end October (from 5,173 in 2019 to 3,952 in 2020).  The introduction of the AIS has supported the recovery of apprentice registrations with September and October showing significant recovery compared to prior months, with October registrations (196) comparable to those of the prior year. </p><p>As of the 18<sup>th</sup>November, 522 employers have had their applications for the scheme approved in respect of 654 apprentice registrations to a value of &euro;1.308m. 63 businesses have availed of the scheme in Galway, 16 in Mayo and 14 in Roscommon.</p></reply>

Apprenticeships are between 2 and 4 years in duration leading to qualifications at level 5-10 of the National Framework of Qualifications with a range of arrangements to deliver off-the-job training. These arrangements range from one day a week off-the-job for international financial services apprentices up to a 35 week off-the-job placement for phase 4 aviation apprenticeships. </p>  <p>  In March of this year, off-the-job training for number of apprenticeship programmes moved fully online or were modified to allow for greater flexibility between on-the-job and off-the-job elements of the programmes.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it was not possible to deliver this flexibility in programme provision or assessment in the practical elements of craft apprenticeships (Phases 2,4 and 6) due to the need to access workshops and equipment together with the simultaneous closure of the construction sector. The closure of the education and training sector to face to face delivery of training between March and September 2020 resulted in the immediate loss of approximately 2,200 training places on phase 4 &amp;amp; 6 craft apprenticeships (April intake) and in the region of 2,000 phase 2 training places over the period of the closure.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the immediate loss of places, the return to face to face training in September has been subject to strict Covid-19 measures which has resulted in the reduction of available places. </p>  <p>  The following measures have been taken to ameliorate the ongoing impacts of the Covid-19 measures on craft apprentices:-</p>  <p>  - An alternative assessment approach was delivered for the theory assessments for up to 2,500 craft apprentices who had been close to finishing their phase of training at the time of the shutdown in March. Outstanding practical assessments were prioritised for completion in September 2020, with over 1,000 apprentices completing practical assessments and their phase of training. </p>  <p>  - Craft apprentices who have had their off-the-job training interrupted in March 2020 were prioritised for a return to training from 31 August (ETB training centres) and from 10 September (Institutes of Technology and TU Dublin). </p>  <p>  - Additional trainer posts have been sanctioned on a temporary basis where ETBs have identified a need for additional staff to deliver off-the-job training within Covid-19 guidelines. </p>  <p>  - &euro;12m has been provided in Budget 2021 to support additional places which will mitigate against the effect of smaller apprenticeship class sizes and catch up on lost provision in spring and summer 2020. </p>  <p>  - SOLAS is currently engaging with Further and Higher Education delivery partners to examine additional options to maximise delivery of craft apprenticeship having regard to the ongoing impact of Covid-19. This includes looking at practical impacts of online delivery and also how much of the theory for craft can be delivered online. </p>  <p>  - The HEA and SOLAS are also engaging further in relation to the curricula to see what parts can be delivered online and are working with the sector to see which elements of craft apprenticeship might be amenable to blended learning. </p></reply>

These may include new activities, growth in student numbers, diverse sources of funding, or philanthropic activity.  </p>  <p>  Circumstances where a staff member may have in excess of two years&rsquo; service but not have a CID, would include where there is an objective ground for the position being filled on a fixed term basis, that is, there is an &lsquo;objective condition&rsquo; (per the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003) such as arriving at a specific date, completing a specific task, or the occurrence of a specific event, that objectively justify the position being filled on a fixed term basis. </p>  <p>  Typical examples would include replacement appointments for academic staff &lsquo;seconded&rsquo; to School or institutional leadership roles; time bound philanthropic-funded activities; and appointments to new academic programmes, the continuance of which would depend upon student uptake.   </p>  <p>  Officials from the HEA, DFHERIS and DPER are currently engaged in discussions to agree revised principles for a new Higher Education Staffing Agreement which will update the current Employment Control Framework.  The Department is supporting the IUA and THEA in the development of the Researcher Career Development Framework which aims to provide consistency in researcher classification and salary structure, including supporting HR practices in research career management. The Framework is close to finalisation and is an important initiative in tackling impediments to career progression and mobility of trained researchers. </p>  <p>  Employers in the higher education sector are also required to operate in accordance with the provisions of national industrial relations agreements. In the event that a lecturer has concerns regarding work and contract conditions in any third level institution, they can raise this with their employer in the first instance and they also have a variety of dispute resolution options open to them.  </p></reply>

Staff in SUSI are responding to email queries within a matter of days.</p>  <p>  With regard to this specific application, I been advised by my officials that the student that you refer to  was awarded &euro;2,000 post graduate fee contribution. She  appealed on the basis that she should qualify for a Special Rate of Grant.  In order to be eligible for the special rate of grant in the 2020/21 academic year, the reckonable income must include on 31st December 2019 one of the eligible long term payments listed in Schedule 2 of the Student Grant Scheme 2020.  She did not hold an eligible payment and now has exhausted the appeals process.</p>  <p>  While her income may have been adversely affected in 2020 the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is not an eligible long term payment listed in Schedule 2 therefore she cannot qualify for the special rate of grant.  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.

In particular PhD students, in addition to conducting research, participate in other activities to develop generic and transferable skills. These activities are regarded as an integral part of their training and typically include teaching. Teaching contribution assists in the acquisition of generic and transferable skills, as described in the National Framework for Doctoral Education and the PhD Graduate Skills statement provided by the Irish Universities Association.</p>  <p>  PhD students may contribute to teaching, often at a level of 120-150 hours per year over the course of their studies, without extra payment. Such duties, which are commonly part of their terms and constitute an element in an up skilling programme, should not be viewed as unpaid teaching. A range of activities can be included under the teaching contribution, such as taking tutorial groups, demonstrating at practical classes, co-supervising undergraduate projects and student mentoring. Hours may be included that are spent in class preparation, advising, monitoring student projects, and correcting projects, notebooks or essays and will vary according to School/Discipline.</p>  <p>  While contributing to teaching is an integral part of the training of a research Master&rsquo;s or PhD student the core component of research programmes across all universities is the advancement of knowledge through original research, which must remain the primary focus of the activity of research students.</p>  <p>  The delivery of teaching duties by graduate students in a higher education institution is a matter for the institution concerned reflecting their independent self-governed status.  It is important that the allocation and conduct of such work is undertaken in accordance with the objectives of the National Framework for Doctoral Education and the PhD Graduate Skills Statement in enabling the development of key skills and competencies for postgraduate students.  In circumstances where issues arise relating to teaching duties of postgraduate students in terms of the Framework and Skills Statement, all parties should engage constructively in the interest of securing balanced solutions.</p></reply>

Therefore, I asked my officials to raise the matter directly with the Department of Health. In response that Department stated that the Minister for Health Recognises the importance of student nurses and midwives completing their essential clinical placements in a safe environment.</p>  <p>  Currently nursing and midwife students are not paid for clinical placements in years 1-3 of their studies.  Financial supports for these non-intern student nurses and midwives are governed by Department of Health Circular No. 9/2004 which provides for an accommodation allowance of up to &euro;59.70 per week to be paid where it is necessary for a student to obtain accommodation away from his/her normal place of residence. Payment is by way of refund on receipt on certified receipts. Students are also entitled to a refund of travel expenses based on certified receipts. Aware of a long standing commitment to review this placement allowance that was not progressed due to Covid 19, the Minister for Health announced in a speech to the Irish Nurses and Midwives organisation (INMO) on 9 October 2020 that he has asked his officials and the Chief Nurse to review the application of the current allowances in consultation with the INMO and the Psychiatric Nurses Association and to report back to him in 6 weeks.</p>  <p>  It is understood that Minister Donnelly has also asked his officials to review the possible options for reinstating the previous arrangement of Health Care Assistant pay for students who are on clinical placements which ran for a limited period earlier this year. My officials understand from their counterparts in the Department of Health that this review is currently being progressed with a view to its conclusion by the end of this month.</p>  <p>  Officials in the Department of Health will keep my Department advised of developments in these areas.</p></reply>

The HEA National Review of Gender Equality in Irish Higher Education and the Gender Equality Taskforce Action Plan 2018 &ndash; 2020 set out recommendations for higher education institutions (HEIs), and other relevant stakeholders, to ensure the achievement of gender equality in Irish higher education. Amongst the recommendations, is the requirement for HEIs to apply for Athena SWAN awards.</p>  <p>  The Athena SWAN charter recognises commitment to advancing the careers of women in employment in higher education and research, and that member institutions must commit to the Athena SWAN principles. These principles include addressing the negative consequences of using short-term contracts for the retention and progression of staff in academia, particularly women.</p>  <p>  The Athena SWAN application process requires institutions to provide information on the actions being taken to address issues around contract type, including what is done to ensure continuity of employment. Applicants must identify and analyse issues which are damaging to particular groups of staff and provide details on supports the institution has or will put in place to mitigate for negative impacts. Applicants must consider issues such as - differences in leave provision for fixed term contract holders; the provision of supports given to staff wishing to transition from part-time to full-time work; and information on promotions. Data is also collected on academic leavers by grade, gender and full or part-time status, the aim of which is to identify the main reasons that staff are leaving and to put in place actions to address this.</p></reply>

Non-EEA nationals wishing to study in Ireland are provided with immigration permission if they are enrolled on a programme listed on the ILEP.  The Immigration Service of my Department is responsible for ensuring that these students are conforming to the conditions attached to their immigration permission while the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is responsible for education policy in this area.  Both Departments work very closely to ensure both aspects are considered in unison. Additions to the ILEP must be approved by the ILEP Committee, which is made up of members from my Department and from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p>  <p>  Providers listed on the ILEP must adhere to certain criteria and must have arrangements in place such as Learner Protection, refunds in the case of refused visas and clear policies and procedures for students.</p>  <p>  For a foundation programme to be included on the ILEP, it must be one of the following qualifications:</p>  <p>  - QQI Preparation for Undergraduate Programme, leading to NFQ Level 5 Special Purpose Award</p>  <p>  - QQI Preparation for Postgraduate Programme, leading to NFQ Level 8 Special Purpose Award</p>  <p>  - Equivalent awards that are included in the NFQ and validated by an Irish awarding body.</p>  <p>  When the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP) was established, as a special concession, a limited number of one-year foundation programmes, not captured within the scope of the ILEP, were considered an acceptable basis for student immigration permission and letters were issued to a small number of providers placed on this auxiliary list at that time.</p>  <p>  Last December, providers were informed that the auxiliary list was being phased out and they were expected to make preparations in 2020 to apply to have foundation programmes listed in the ILEP.</p>  <p>  The college referred to by the Deputy was recently granted an extension of four months on the auxiliary list until April 2021, subject to confirmation it applied for QQI validation for its Foundation programmes.</p></reply>

Its functions are set out in section 16 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, as amended. Under Section 20 of the 1995 Act, all proceedings of the Board and all communications to the Board are confidential.</p>  <p>  Eligible serving Judges who wish to express an interest in elevation to positions in the superior courts are not currently required to apply to JAAB.  Instead, there is a process whereby expressions of interest may be submitted to the Minister of the day via the Attorney General.  Such expressions of interest are received on an ongoing basis and retained for any current or future vacancy that might arise.  Every expression of interest from an eligible judge is actively considered as part of this process.</p>  <p>  The qualifications required for appointment to the Superior Courts are set out in legislation - Section 5 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, as amended by the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, the Courts and Court Officers Act, 2002 and the Court of Appeal Act, 2014.</p>  <p>  In relation to the process, the response from the JAAB was considered in the first instance, in line with the Act.  As is standard practice with judicial appointments, having considered expressions of interest from serving members of the judiciary; all other judges eligible for the position; information on their service; and information on the qualifications required, I then proposed a name to Cabinet.  In this case, the recommendation was in line with the recommendation of JAAB, following its meeting in March last.</p>  <p>  The Government has sole discretion under the Constitution and power under the law as it currently stands to nominate persons of its own choosing, providing they are qualified and eligible for appointment as a Judge.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-24a.1828.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112400108#WRRR00400"><p>Judicial appointments are made in accordance with Articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution, by the President acting on the advice of the Government. This is a Constitutional function that cannot be transferred or delegated. The Constitutional prerogative on advising the President on judicial appointments lies with the Government alone.</p>  <p>  It has been the practice to maintain a vacancy in the Supreme Court due to the reduction achieved in waiting times in that court in recent years. However, this arrangement is kept under review.  In this particular case, the Chief Justice wrote to my predecessor on 4 February 2020 requesting that the Supreme Court vacancy arising from the retirement of Ms Justice Mary Finlay Geoghegan in June 2019 be filled.  He cited emerging pressures including the establishment of the Cervical Check Tribunal. </p>  <p>  The then Minister wrote to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) on 17 February 2020.  He asked the Board to furnish him with nominations for this vacancy, and the name of each person who had informed the Board of his or her wish to be considered for appointment. </p>  <p>  The Minister also wrote separately to the Chief Justice stating that this request of the JAAB did not pre-suppose the filling of the post; it was to facilitate the procedure should a decision be taken to make an appointment at whatever point in the future that vacancy might be progressed. As the Deputy will note, the only judicial nomination made during the period of Government formation was to the post of President of the High Court, as this senior position has broader statutory functions. It should be noted that this appointment on 18 June then resulted in a second vacancy on the Supreme Court.  </p>  <p>  By letter dated 11 March, 2020, the JAAB advised that they had met on 9 March and decided to recommend one candidate, Mr S&eacute;amus Woulfe, SC, whom it considered suitable for appointment to the Supreme Court. </p>  <p>  Following my appointment at the end of June, I was informed by my officials of the vacancy to be filled on the Supreme Court and that the Chief Justice had written to my predecessor on 7th February seeking that the position be filled as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  A draft Memorandum was submitted to my Office on 6 July, 2020.  The submission included details of the recommendation that had been made by JAAB; expressions of interest from serving members of the judiciary; and all other judges eligible for the position. The expressions of interest from serving judges were received over a number of years and retained on file for any current or future vacancy that might arise.  Whether or not existing judges put forward expressions of interest is a confidential matter for obvious reasons, and it is not the practice to release information that might identify any of those judges. All of these were submitted to me and I actively considered them. </p>  <p>  In line with the Cabinet Handbook, between 11 and 14 July I spoke with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, Minister Ryan and the Attorney General, following which I brought a Memorandum for the Government&rsquo;s consideration on July 15 last, recommending a name to Cabinet for appointment by the President. In this case the recommendation was in line with the recommendation of JAAB, which is chaired by the Chief Justice, and includes the Presidents of the four other Courts, as well as members of the Law Society, the Bar Council, and a number of lay members.  </p>  <p>  The practice in relation to appointments or nominations to positions made by Government is that only one name is brought to Cabinet by the proposing Minister. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that discussions at Cabinet and with ministerial colleagues are confidential.  Decisions made by Government and are subject to Cabinet confidentiality under Article 28.4.3 of the Constitution. The Government, as set down in law, has sole discretion under the Constitution to nominate persons of its own choosing, providing they are qualified and eligible for appointment as a Judge. This is the Government&rsquo;s constitutional prerogative and the House can be assured that the Government in making this appointment has acted in accordance with the Constitution and the law.</p>  <p>  I intend to shortly bring forward proposals to introduce a new Judicial Appointments Commission, which will significantly reform the way in which judges are appointed.</p></reply>

The Act is currently under review and the Programme for Government commits to introducing, within 12 months, legislation to address those who target victims because of their association with a particular identity characteristic, and to revise and update the Incitement to Hatred Act. My Department is working to prepare this legislation on hate crime and hate speech as a priority. </p>  <p>  As part of this work a comprehensive public consultation has been undertaken, to ensure that the Department fully understands the lived experience of those impacted by hate speech and hate crime as well as the views of professionals and other stakeholders in the field. This is necessary to ensure the laws developed are robust, clearly understood and effective in dealing with unacceptable incidents. </p>  <p>  I am pleased with the high level of engagement with this important topic and can inform the Deputy that my Department received in the region of 3,800 written responses to the consultation, including approximately 175 detailed written submissions.</p>  <p>  In addition to this comprehensive consultation and in order to ensure that the final legislation can be effective, my Department also carried out comparative research on international best practice on hate crime legislation.  </p>  <p>  The report on the public consultation and the comparative research is being finalised and I expect to publish it very shortly.</p>  <p>  It is important to ensure that the legislative proposals presented are evidence-based, proportionate and effective, while respecting important rights to freedom of expression and association. There will be a further opportunity for stakeholders to share their views when the legislative proposals on this important issue are published for discussion. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the approach taken to the reform of our legislation in this area - including through the research conducted and providing the opportunity for experts and members of the public to provide their views through consultation - will ensure that the legislation we develop plays a significant part in delivering a safer, fairer and more inclusive Ireland for everyone, now as well as into the future.</p></reply>

In 2019 there were 178 such incidents, this is a drop from the figures reported between 2005 and 2011 for example, where on average there were 236 such incidents per year. </p>  <p>  There has also been a reported reduction in crimes against the person in the first two quarters of this year versus the same period in 2019 according to the Central Statistics Office. Compared with the same periods last year, the "assault causing harm" category fell by 23.9% in the first quarter by 16.9% in the second quarter. While COVID-19 has undoubtedly played a role here, I believe that it is worth noting that the public health restrictions did not come into place until the final weeks of Quarter one.</p>  <p>  That said, any stabbing incident can, of course, cause irreparable physical harm and have potentially tragic consequences. Garda&iacute; continue to take proactive action against knife crime &ndash; including through the Assault Reduction Strategy 2019-2021, through education and engagement with community initiatives, and at an operational level &ndash; and a substantial number of convictions have been secured in the Courts over the past number of years for possession of a knife or other article.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive and robust legal framework remains in place in this regard, including heavy penalties for breaches of the law. Under the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for a conviction for possessing a knife in a public place (without good reason or lawful authority) was increased from one to five years. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also has an extended power of search, without warrant, in relation to knives and offensive weapons. </p>  <p>  The criminal law is kept under ongoing review and amendments are considered if any new trends emerge.</p></reply>

This recommendation is intended to help address delays in trails and to deal with matters such as defence applications to question a victim about his or her sexual experience. </p><p>- Engagement on development of training programmes for serving Garda&iacute;, the legal professions and members of the judiciary who are participating in sexual offences investigations and trials has started, and I expect this training to be rolled out in 2021.</p><p>- Engagement with the legal aid board on how to ensure better provision of legal advice and support to victims of sexual crime has commenced.</p><p>- Raising the public&rsquo;s awareness of their legally enforceable rights under the Victims of Crime Act 2017 including through the redesign of the victims charter website.</p></reply>

The robust PULSE data review process coordinated by the Garda Information Services Centre has been essential in the production of verifiable data reports and proving the quality of individual records in response to enquiries. This will be further validated by an internal and external audit of the review process, to be coordinated initially by the Garda Professional Standards Unit. I am informed that the Central Statistics Office has observed how this process leads to quality data used by Garda management at district level to inform operational decisions and has commented positively on this use of data in a letter to the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Central Statistics Office will continue their collaboration on the recording, verification and publication of crime data in 2021.

Each case is examined in detail on its individual merits, taking all factors into account. </p>  <p>  My objective is to have decisions on international protection applications and permission to remain considerations made as soon as is possible. This ensures that those who are found to be in need of protection can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security.  </p>  <p>  For those found not to be in need of international protection, a detailed consideration of all aspects of their case will have been carried out before a decision is made to grant permission to remain in the State or to make a Deportation Order. This includes a full consideration of their private and family rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights as well as consideration of their work situation, among other issues. If a Deportation Order is subsequently made, Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) allows an Order to be amended or revoked by making a request to me as Minister for Justice.</p>  <p>  When a person receives a letter informing them of their negative international protection decision and informing them that they no longer have permission to remain in the State, they are required to confirm within 5 days if they will accept the option of voluntary return, for which the Department will provide assistance.  To be clear, the person is not required to remove themselves from the State within 5 days &ndash; they are required to indicate an intent to do so. The time taken for relevant voluntary return arrangements to be made will take into account all factors, including Covid-19 restrictions and limitations to travel this has created. I have asked my officials to consider the process of issuing the letters for the duration of Level 5 restrictions and no negative decisions have been issued in the period since.</p>  <p>  I encourage people to be as detailed as possible in their representations to me and my Department so that we can make fully informed decisions at the appropriate time.    </p>  <p>  While the execution of a Deportation Order is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I can assure the Deputy that my Department takes a pragmatic approach to such matters in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

Section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides for an offence of frightening, bullying or threatening a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or wellbeing. There are also legislative provisions in place to deal with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and his/her parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues.  </p>  <p>  However, I am very much aware that parental alienation is a complex issue and that further analysis may be desirable. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality published a report last year on Reform of the Family Law System which includes parental alienation among a broad range of issues in the area of family law.</p>  <p>  The issue of parental alienation, particularly in the context of relationship breakdown, is a complex one which requires careful review. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill. In the preparation of the General Scheme of that Bill, account has been taken of the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality on the Reform of the Family Law System. My department has recently established the Family Justice Oversight Group which will agree a high-level vision and key medium and longer-term objectives for the development of a national family justice system in parallel with the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure as envisaged by the forthcoming Family Court Bill. As part of its work, the oversight group will consider the various recommendations, including the recommendation on parent alienation, contained in the Report of the Joint Committee.</p></reply>

This involved two officials at Executive Officer and Clerical Officer level who followed &ldquo;hashtags&rdquo; and keywords that related to the Justice Sector as part of their wider day to day responsibilities. </p>  <p>  This work meant my Department was in a position to respond earlier to issues that were arising online, when most of its workforce was working remotely. It also enabled my Department to respond to, or investigate issues, that were being raised on social media that were not being raised directly with the Department, its service providers, or through the various helplines or supports put in place for various agencies. Understanding the conversations that were happening online also assisted my Department in responding to queries raised by national and regional journalists on behalf of the public. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department ceased this social media listening exercise earlier this year in July.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-24a.1925.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112400109#WRSS05500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 726 to 734, inclusive, and Nos. 745 and 747 together.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s concern and wish to take this opportunity to assure him and the House that this appointment was made in full accordance with the Constitution and the law. </p>  <p>  Judicial appointments are made in accordance with Articles 13.9 and 35.1 of the Constitution, by the President acting on the advice of the Government. This is a Constitutional function that cannot be transferred or delegated. The Constitutional prerogative on advising the President on judicial appointments lies with the Government alone.</p>  <p>  It has been the practice to maintain a vacancy in the Supreme Court due to the reduction achieved in waiting times in that court in recent years. However, this arrangement is kept under review.  In this particular case, the Chief Justice wrote to my predecessor on 4 February 2020 requesting that the Supreme Court vacancy arising from the retirement of Ms Justice Mary Finlay Geoghegan in June 2019 be filled.  He cited emerging pressures including the establishment of the Cervical Check Tribunal. </p>  <p>  The then Minister wrote to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) on 17 February 2020.  He asked the Board to furnish him with nominations for this vacancy, and the name of each person who had informed the Board of his or her wish to be considered for appointment. </p>  <p>  The Minister also wrote separately to the Chief Justice stating that this request of the JAAB did not pre-suppose the filling of the post; it was to facilitate the procedure should a decision be taken to make an appointment at whatever point in the future that vacancy might be progressed. As the Deputy will note, the only judicial nomination made during the period of Government formation was to the post of President of the High Court, as this senior position has broader statutory functions. It should be noted that this appointment on 18 June then resulted in a second vacancy on the Supreme Court.  </p>  <p>  By letter dated 11 March, 2020, the JAAB advised that they had met on 9 March and decided to recommend one candidate, Mr S&eacute;amus Woulfe, SC, who was considered suitable for appointment to the Supreme Court. </p>  <p>  Following my appointment at the end of June, I was informed by my officials of the vacancy to be filled on the Supreme Court and that the Chief Justice had written to my predecessor on 7 February seeking that the position be filled as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  A draft Memorandum was submitted to my Office on 6 July, 2020.  The submission included details of the recommendation that had been made by JAAB; expressions of interest from serving members of the judiciary; and all other judges eligible for the position. The expressions of interest from serving judges were received over a number of years and retained on file for any current or future vacancy that might arise.  Whether or not existing judges put forward expressions of interest is a confidential matter for obvious reasons, and it is not the practice to release information that might identify any of those judges. All of these were submitted to me and I actively considered them. </p>  <p>  In line with the Cabinet Handbook, between 11 and 14 July I spoke with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, Minister Ryan and the Attorney General, following which I brought a Memorandum for the Government&rsquo;s consideration on July 15 last, recommending a name to Cabinet for appointment by the President. In this case the recommendation was in line with the recommendation of JAAB, which is chaired by the Chief Justice, and includes the Presidents of the four other Courts, as well as members of the Law Society, the Bar Council, and a number of lay members.  </p>  <p>  The practice in relation to appointments or nominations to positions made by Government is that only one name is brought to Cabinet by the proposing Minister. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that discussions at Cabinet and with ministerial colleagues are confidential.  Decisions made by Government and are subject to Cabinet confidentiality under Article 28.4.3 of the Constitution. The Government, as set down in law, has sole discretion under the Constitution to nominate persons of its own choosing, providing they are qualified and eligible for appointment as a Judge. This is the Government&rsquo;s constitutional prerogative and the House can be assured that the government in making this appointment has acted in accordance with the Constitution and the law.</p>  <p>  I intend to shortly bring forward proposals to introduce a new Judicial Appointments Commission, which will significantly reform the way in which judges are appointed.  </p></reply>

This includes a full consideration of their private and family rights in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights as well as consideration of their work situation, among other issues. The person will also have been given the option of availing of assisted voluntary return to their home country.</p>  <p>  If a Deportation Order is subsequently made, the enforcement of that Order becomes an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  For the purpose of enforcing the Order, the person is required to present at the offices of the GNIB, either at the Burgh Quay office in Dublin, or at their local Immigration Office. They may be  directed to attend at specified times on specific dates until such time as the deportation process has been completed.</p>  <p>  The presentation arrangements can vary from case to case and may be influenced by factors like the making of necessary travel arrangements and obtaining the relevant travel documents to facilitate their return. I am advised that the GNIB is taking a pragmatic approach in relation to the enforcement of Deportation Orders during the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) also allows an Order to be amended or revoked by making a request to me as Minister for Justice.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-11-24a.1968.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020112400111#WRUU01500"><p>I would like to assure the deputy that I, and the Government very much share his concerns for anyone who has been impacted by any form of behaviour that is of an inappropriate sexual nature. </p><p>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding legislation in relation to whistling or persons making comments of a sexual nature, I am not aware of any criminal legislation that makes provision specifically for this type of behaviour if it is a once off incident, as opposed to more persistent targeted behaviour that could be classified as harassment. However, I can assure the Deputy that addressing all forms of sexual violence and ensuring that we have robust legislation and policies to support and assist victims to come forward is a key priority for me and my department.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that enacting the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill is a priority for me and that I am working with Deputy Howlin in this regard. I will be taking a number of amendments to Deputy Howlin's Bill to Government this week with a view to getting approval to submit them at Committee Stage on 01 December. Among the amendments proposed will be one to section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. I am proposing amending this section to broaden the scope of the offence of harassment to cover persistent communications to or about a person and to increase the maximum penalty from 7 years&rsquo; to 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment to reflect the harm caused by the most serious forms of harassment. </p><p>The Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021, which is a whole-of-Government approach to delivering on the many actions necessary to address these matters fully, is coordinated by my Department. The Strategy includes input from relevant community and voluntary groups as well as other stakeholders across the sector. </p><p>Overall, the Strategy aims to considerably strengthen the law and structures in Ireland targeting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and considerable progress has been made in addressing these issues through the Strategy. </p><p>Raising public awareness on these issues is a key feature of our overarching response in this area and my Department is currently midway through the No Excuses campaign, a national awareness campaign to tackle domestic and sexual violence and sexual harassment. The campaign is a key action of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence for 2016 to 2021. The purpose of the campaign is to intensify the public&rsquo;s awareness of sexual harassment, domestic and sexual violence, to bring about a change in long-established societal behaviours and attitudes, and to activate bystanders. The overall aim of the campaign is to make all of us face up to the excuses we, as a society, make for unacceptable behaviours and to call on us to speak out against them. This will contribute to a change in society's attitude to sexual harassment, domestic and sexual violence in order to decrease and prevent this type of behaviour and violence. </p><p>I want to reassure the Deputy, but more importantly to reassure anyone who is a victim, or at risk of sexual abuse, that help continues to be available and to contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Our laws in supporting victims of sexual crime have been significantly strengthened in recent years, including by the introduction of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 and the Domestic Violence Act 2018. However, I can assure the Deputy that my Department is continually examining our laws in this area in the context of their effectiveness and to identify if any changes are required.</p><p>In relation to funding, in 2020, my Department provided just over &euro;2 million in funding to support training and awareness initiatives in relation to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and &euro;1.9 million euro in funding to support victims of crime, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. This year I have secured funding of over &euro;2 million for combatting domestic, sexual and gender based violence and &euro;2.1 million to support victims of crime. In addition, I have secured &euro;2.3 million to implement <i>Supporting a Victim's Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases</i>which I published last month.</p><p><i>Supporting a Victim's Journey - A plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases</i>which I published last month will be implemented as a priority and it includes the provision of specific training for all of the key personnel a victim comes into contact with during the course of their journey throughout the criminal justice system. Such personnel includes the Garda&iacute;, the DPP, the judiciary and the legal profession. Engagement on development of training programmes for serving Garda&iacute;, the legal professions and members of the judiciary who are participating in sexual offences investigations and trials has already started, and I expect this training will be rolled out in 2021.</p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to know that the rollout of the Divisional Protective Services Units (DPSU) within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now complete with DPSUs in every Garda division across the country. The completion of the rollout of DPSUs means that specially trained officers are available nationwide who will be responsible for engagement with, and interviewing of, vulnerable victims.  This will ensure that when vulnerable victims of crimes such as sexual violence present to Garda&iacute;, they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist professional and expert assistance.</p></reply>

As such I'm sure the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment further on this matter.  </p>  <p>  I fully support the Programme for Government commitment to enacting legislation in this area and the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill (as amended) is being progressed as a priority. The Bill is scheduled for Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 1 December 2020.   </p>  <p>  Today, I secured Cabinet approval to bring forward amendments to the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill to provide for two new offences to deal with the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. </p>  <p>  The first offence will deal with the taking, distribution, publication or threat to distribute intimate images without consent, and with intent to cause harm to the victim. It is intended to carry a maximum penalty of an unlimited fine and/or 7 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The second offence will deal with the taking, distribution or publication of intimate images without consent without a requirement that the person intended to cause harm to the victim. It is intended that this offence will carry a maximum penalty of a &euro;5,000 fine and/or 12 months&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>  <p>  The amendments proposed also provide that it will be irrelevant that a person may have consented to the taking of an image if it is subsequently published or distributed without their consent. It will be an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing if the perpetrator of the offence is or was in an intimate relationship with the victim of the offence.</p>  <p>  Further amendments approved by Cabinet will update harassment legislation to broaden the scope of the offence of harassment to cover all forms of persistent communications about a person, not just indecent images, and to increase the penalty from seven to ten years to reflect the harm that can be caused by most serious forms of harassment. </p>  <p>  Harassment and abuse in any form, whether online or otherwise, is utterly unacceptable and has no place in Irish society. I am, along with my Government colleagues, fully committed to tackling abusive behaviour in all forms. The standards of what is unacceptable in an online setting must be consistent with those in traditional settings, and cross government initiatives are underway to address this. </p>  <p>  Progression of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill is a priority action for me as Minister for Justice and I am committed to seeing it enacted as quickly as possible.

Further, the allocation of Garda resources is made in light of identified operational demands.  This includes deployment of personnel among the various Garda Divisions. As Minister, I have no direct role in the matter. </p>  <p>  I am assured, however, that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends, to ensure their optimum use.  I understand that it is a matter for the Divisional Chief Superintendent to determine the optimum distribution of duties among the personnel available to him or her, having regard to the profile of each area within the Division and its specific needs.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that members attached to Community Policing Units in the stations in question were temporarily re-assigned to the regular units at the commencement of the COVID-19 roster. However, members from the Community Policing Units remain in contact with their contacts throughout the community and have been providing valuable assistance to vulnerable persons throughout the crisis.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, to date, the official categorisation as a Community Garda has simply referred to those who are exclusively assigned to building relationships with local communities and civil society including giving talks to schools, community groups and others.  However, it is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that all Garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing in carrying out their duties. Indeed, this has never been more evident than in the work carried out by all members of the Garda&iacute; over the last eight months as we have tackled the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that as of 31 October 2020, there were 239 Garda members assigned to the Coolock District in total. This included 199 Garda&iacute;, 33 Sergeants, 6 Inspectors and 1 Superintendent, of which 118 Garda members were assigned to Coolock Garda station. </p>  <p>  As of the same date, there were 167 Garda members assigned to the Raheny District which included 143 Garda&iacute;, 19 Sergeants, 4 Inspectors and 1 Superintendent. Of this total, 35 Garda members were assigned to Howth Garda station and 71 Garda members were assigned to Raheny Garda station.  </p></reply>

They must ensure that the premises of a designated centre are appropriate to the number and needs of the residents of that centre and in accordance with the statement of purpose. To further assist nursing homes the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) has developed substantial public health guidance.  The guidance, which is under constant review, is available on the HPSC&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Guidance on resident admissions, transfers and discharges is addressed in the &ldquo;<i>Interim Public Health, Infection Prevention &amp;amp; Control Guidelines on: Admissions, Transfers to and Discharges from Long Term Residential Care Facilities during the COVID-19 Pandemic V1.1 21.09.2020</i>and also in the<i>Interim Public Health, Infection Prevention &amp;amp; Control Guidelines on the Prevention and Management of COVID-19 Cases and Outbreaks in Residential Care Facilities V6.1 03/11/2020.&rdquo; </i></p><p>The guidance sets out the measures that should be adopted in relation to admissions to residential facilities.  It notes that over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been significant learning about the role of testing for COVID-19 and its role in determining levels of asymptomatic infection and tracking spread of infection, especially in congregated settings, such as Residential Care Facilities. All transfers or new admissions should have a risk assessment, to ensure sufficient resources are available within the residential care facility (RCF) to support social distancing and patient placement.  Testing for COVID-19 should be undertaken for the admission of patients with no diagnosis or clinical suspicion of COVID-19 from acute hospital to an RCF within the 3 days prior to discharge from the acute hospital.  In general residents transferred or directly admitted to an RCF should be accommodated in a single room (or room with no other residents) for 14 days after arrival and monitored for new symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during that time. The detailed guidance developed to support providers provides further details and considerations in relation to this matter.</p><p>I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the query on the number of tests that have been carried out.</p></reply>

The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for administration to all persons in an at-risk group, as well as 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) for all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.</p><p>1.3 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites.  In addition, over 440,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed. As of 22nd November, over 1 million claims for reimbursement from GPs and pharmacists for the administration of influenza vaccines have been received by PCERS, including approximately 130,000 claims for the administration of nasal LAIV to children aged 2 -12.</p><p>Demand for vaccination remains strong at this point and may exceed available QIV supply. It is likely that the full amount procured, 1.35 million doses, will be administered.  Given the demand on the international market for influenza vaccine, it is not likely to be possible to procure additional supply.</p><p>As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. </p><p>Each year a certain amount of vaccine is &ldquo;held back&rdquo; to ensure those in at-risk groups receive vaccines. With the unprecedented demand this year it is important that the HSE manage the distribution of the remaining doses in order to target administration to the at-risk groups who need it the most. The delivery of the final 50,000 QIV doses to sites across the country commenced Monday 23<sup>rd</sup>November.</p><p>The significant increase in uptake among those in the at-risk groups, combined with the addition of vaccination for children aged from 2 to 12, will help reduce the impact of influenza on the community and the health system.</p></reply>

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. </p><p>The Deputy should note, that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. </p><p>The &lsquo;Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19&rsquo; in the provides for restrictions on gatherings of people indoors given the higher risk associated with these types of activities and sets out when it is considered that religious services can take place with protective measures (Levels 1 and 2) and when they must move online (Levels 3,4 and 5). Weddings and funerals are exceptions and can continue at every level with limited numbers. </p><p>Churches and other places of worship can remain open for private prayer. It is also important to note that at all levels, Ministers of Religion are permitted to travel to perform a service on-line, to minister to the sick, and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony.  The relevant regulations relating to Level 5 restrictions are S.I. 448 of 2020 (Health Act 1947 (Section 31A - Temporary Restrictions) (COVID-19) (NO. 8) Regulations 2020).</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, the Government has sought to implement these measures on the basis of guidance as opposed to regulations wherever possible. It should be noted that holding a religious gathering is not a penal offence. </p><p>I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made be people across the country at this difficult time. I know that that includes many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19. Indeed,  the Taoiseach has recently met with the leaders of the Catholic Church  to consider the range of issues relating this matter. </p><p>Finally, the Deputy will wish to note that comprehensive guidelines are in place to ensure that religious services can take place safely when<b></b>they recommence: </p></reply>

I would like to assure you that measures such as this are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p><p>You may wish to note that the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) has recently published its advice for the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on the settings and activities which are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission. The publication of this advice is accompanied by a supporting evidence synthesis report which examined data from international sources and found that indoor, high occupancy, poorly ventilated environments, where there is shouting and singing, insufficient use of face coverings, and prolonged contact, present an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The current guidance aligns with the 5 level framework of restrictive measures as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support in the safe visiting, to the greatest extent possible, having regard for the challenging times in which we are living.  </p>  <p>  I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and well-being.  </p>  <p>  Current guidance and the recommendations of the Expert Panel report seek to enhance standardisation and consistency in service delivery, including in areas such as visiting and communication.</p>  <p>The current guidance notes that   &ldquo;Critical and compassionate circumstances are difficult to define and of necessity require judgement. The term should not be interpreted as limited to circumstances when the death of a resident is imminent.  </p>  <p>  Subject to a risk assessment in each case, other examples of critical and compassionate circumstances may include: </p>  <p>  - Circumstances in which a resident is significantly distressed or disturbed and although unable to express the desire for a visit there is reason to believe that a visit from a significant person may relieve distress.</p>  <p>  - When there is an exceptionally important life event for the resident (for example death of a spouse or birthday). - When the visitor may not have another opportunity to visit for many months or years or never (for example because they are leaving the country or are themselves approaching end of life)</p>  <p>  - Increased visiting is recommended by their doctor as a non-pharmacological therapeutic alternative to an increased dose of an existing agent or introduction of a new anxiolytic or sedative agent.  </p>  <p>  - A resident expresses a strong sense of need to see someone whether for personal reasons, to make financial or other arrangements or to advocate on their behalf. </p>  <p>  - A person nominated by the resident expresses concern that a prolonged absence is causing upset or harm to a resident. </p>  <p>  - Other circumstances in which the judgement of the medical or nursing staff or social care worker caring for the resident is that a visit is important for the persons health or sense of well being.&rdquo; </p>  <p>  Separately, I understand that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre is currently reviewing the public health guidance on visiting, in consultation with relevant national stakeholders, to consider, in line with the range of public health factors, further potential for safe visiting within nursing homes.  Visiting guidance is being considered in the context of the wider COVID-19 situation, as we plan and prepare for exiting level 5 restrictions.</p>  <p>Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On the 19th   November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. </p>  <p>  This highlights the importance of suppressing the level of the virus in the community as one of the primary measures for protecting nursing homes. As citizens, we all have a responsibility in this regard and our actions across all of society can directly impact the outcomes for nursing home residents.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. </p>  <p>  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for the following reasons:</p>  <p>  - vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;</p>  <p>  - boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.</p></reply>

The issue of granting medical cards based on having a particular disease or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility.  In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.</p>  <p>  The HSE has however a compassionate system in place for the provision of medical cards when it is informed that a patient is receiving end of life treatment &ndash; that is when patients&rsquo; unfortunately have a prognosis of less than 12 months. These applications do not require a means assessment nor are they reassessed. There are currently almost 1,800 such medical cards awarded. Separately, terminally ill patients who do not meet the end of life criteria may also qualify for a medical card under the general assessment processes. Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the Health Act 1970, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and to take full account of the difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, since 2015 medical cards are awarded without the need of a financial assessment to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the Programme for Government &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo; contains a commitment to extend discretionary medical cards to those with a terminal illness. A HSE Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) was established in December 2019 to review eligibility for medical cards in cases of terminal illness. The final Report of the CAG was recently submitted to my Department and has been published. The Report notes that there are practical and legal challenges with extending eligibility for medical cards for terminally ill patients within the framework of the current process. However, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to ensuring that terminally ill patients have access to the services they need.  In that regard, my Department has devised a work programme which has been initiated and which will look to address the policy and legal findings of the Report and deliver on the Programme for Government commitment.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it has received pricing and reimbursement applications for two indications of Dupilumab (Dupixent&reg;):</p>  <p>  - For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. </p>  <p>  - For the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for pricing / reimbursement of Dupilumab in November 2017 from the manufacturer for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.  The HSE commissioned a full HTA on 29 November 2017 as per agreed processes.  This assessment was completed on 12 December 2019 with the NCPE recommending that Dupilumab be considered for reimbursement if cost-effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments.</p>  <p>  Subsequently, the HSE received an application for the pricing / reimbursement of Dupilumab on 13 December 2019 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE commissioned the rapid review process on the 17 December 2019.

Recent national research carried out by The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) regarding Vitamin D deficiency and implications for immune protection for Covid-19 was published in April, 2020. Rates of deficiency within the older population at different ages and during wintertime were considered within this research. TILDA is funded by my Department and the results of this study are available here:-  </p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).  Ireland is guided by the advice, guidance and protocols of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The expert guidance of the ECDC in particular is based upon consideration of the circumstances arising in the European Union and globally. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reviews these international developments as part of its overall examination of the evolving epidemiology of the disease.</p><p>Micronutrients, such as vitamins D, are critical for a well-functioning immune system and play a vital role in promoting health and nutritional well-being.  However, the consistent guidance from the international bodies referenced above is that there is as yet insufficient data to support the use of Vitamin D in the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.</p><p>Earlier this year, my Department requested the Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) to examine the vitamin D status of this older population and provide scientific recommendations on vitamin D supplementation. The FSAI Report found that older people in Ireland do not get sufficient vitamin D from their diet or the effect of sunlight on their skin. </p><p>Based on the evidence provided in the FSAI Report, my Department is advising that adults aged 65 and older take a vitamin D supplement to ensure they get the essential vitamin D needed for bone and muscle health. </p></reply>

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible.</p><p>It is advised to socialise safely and within the capacity limits. These various limits in the Levels are all designed to reduce the number of households mixing with each other and cut down the virus&rsquo;s chances of spreading into more homes. </p><p>The Deputy should note, that the numbers should not be considered a target - they are the maximum recommended number. It&rsquo;s always safer to meet less people, less often, for less time. If we do this, we have a better chance of keeping to the lower Levels in the Framework, and continuing to keep businesses, schools, and healthcare services open, while also protecting the most vulnerable. </p><p>The &lsquo;Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19&rsquo; in the Living with Covid Plan provides for restrictions on gatherings of people outdoors at all level's of the Plan.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, ?Ireland is now on level 5 of the framework. At level 5, no organised outdoor gatherings can take place.  The information on organised outdoor gatherings at level 5 can be viewed at:  . ??At level 3 and 4, organised outdoor gatherings of up to 15 people can take place.  </p><p>I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made be people across the country at this difficult time. </p></reply>

This Plan sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical.</p><p>As I'm sure you can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. </p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, people are asked to stay at home, with certain exceptions, and must exercise within 5km of home. Exercise and sporting amenities have been closed in order to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread. No matches or other sporting events may be held with the exception of professional elite sports and senior inter-county gaelic games and horse and greyhound racing, which may continue behind closed doors. All other training activities should be individual only. It is possible to meet with 1 other household in an outdoor setting which is not a home or garden, such as a park, including for the purpose of exercise.</p><p>The Government recognises that there are many aspects of normal life that have been altered by the emergence of COVID-19, and the response that has been required. It also recognises that these changes are difficult for many people. However, it is the case at present that many of the things which we have previously taken for granted - such as yoga classes, but also eating out, attending church, travelling abroad freely - are no longer accessible in the same way due to the risks that they pose and the ease with which this virus spreads in particular conditions.</p><p>The Government's guidelines for exercise and sporting events at all levels of the Plan are available at: . Level 5 guidance from Sport Ireland is available at: <i></i></p></reply>

Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  </p>  <p>  The current guidance aligns with the 5 level framework of restrictive measures as outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Living with COVID-19 Plan, to support long-term residential care providers in the discharge of their responsibilities and to support in the safe visiting, to the greatest extent possible, having regard for the challenging times in which we are living.  </p>  <p>  I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing.  I have communicated with the sector outlining the need for them to be flexible, innovative and to facilitate to the greatest extent possible alternative arrangements such as window visiting, in line with public health advice. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre is currently reviewing the public health guidance on visiting, in consultation with relevant national stakeholders, to consider, in line with the range of public health factors, further potential for safe visiting within nursing homes.  Visiting guidance is being considered in the context of the wider COVID-19 situation, as we plan and prepare for exiting level 5 restrictions. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On the 19th November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. </p>  <p>  This highlights the importance of suppressing the level of the virus in the community as one of the primary measures for protecting nursing homes. As citizens, we all have a responsibility in this regard and our actions across all of society can directly impact the outcomes for nursing home residents.</p></reply>

COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>With regard to domestic travel, restrictions apply at Levels 3, 4 and 5 of the Plan and these restrictions are set out in the Plan. </p><p>The public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and it provides advice to Government in line with the current epidemiological position.</p></reply>

As at 1st November 2020, there are 19 GMS vacancies, less than 1% of total number GMS panels. In each case a locum or other appropriate arrangement has been put in place to maintain GP services to the communities in question. It is not possible to provide a timescale for the filling of GMS vacancies.</p>  <p>  Finally, regarding the availability of GP training, the number of GPs entering training has been increased steadily over recent years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 214 in 2020, with a further increase foreseen in 2021.The planned transfer of responsibility for training GPs from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners, pending the resolution of certain outstanding issues, will allow for further increases in the number of training places in future years. </p></reply>

This will involve the establishment of a consultant-led public health model in line with the Crowe Horwath Report on the Specialty. My Department in conjunction with the HSE have completed a substantial amount of work on a detailed framework for the future public health model that includes consultant level roles.

This is a 5-year pilot programme, restricted to prescribing of cannabis-based products by medical consultants, for patients with certain medical conditions who have exhausted all other available medical treatment options. Those conditions are:</p><p>- Spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis</p><p>- Intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy</p><p>- Severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy.</p><p>For more information relating to the MCAP, including FAQs, please see the Department of Health&rsquo;s website at the following link.</p><p>Commercial suppliers whose cannabis products have been reviewed and are considered to have met the specified requirements set out in the legislation and are in line with the clinical guidance for the MCAP, will have their products added to Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019. Once the products are listed in Schedule 1 of these Regulations the suppliers will be permitted to supply these products to the Irish market, in line with legal and regulatory requirements. Cannabis products will only be listed in Schedule 1 of the Regulations once they have been assessed as suitable for medical use under the MCAP.</p><p>To date four products have been added to Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs (Prescription and Control of Supply of Cannabis for Medical Use) Regulations 2019. The four products are:</p><p>1. Aurora High CBD Oil Drops</p><p>2. CannEpil &trade;</p><p>3. Tilray Oral Solution THC10:CBD10 25ml</p><p>4. Aurora Sedamen Softgels.</p><p>The HSE has engaged in discussions with the suppliers of these products, regarding pricing and supply information. The HSE will consider such information, in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The programme will not become fully operational until pricing and supply matters are agreed.</p><p>Once the Medical Cannabis Access Programme commences the HSE will establish and maintain a Register to facilitate the enrolment and recording of certain data including patient identifiers (in anonymised format), prescribers enrolled in the Programme, as well as prescribed / supplied medical cannabis products. The Department can advise that while the MCAP register is not currently operational, engagement is ongoing with the HSE in regard to progressing same.</p><p><b>Ministerial Licence under Section 14 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977-2016</b></p><p>Pending full operation of the MCAP and for medical indications not included in the MCAP, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licencing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients, should they wish to do so. In line with the Chief Medical Officer's advice, the granting of a licence for cannabis for medical purposes must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time. This information can be found at the following links:</p><p><b>It is important to note that the medical decision to prescribe or not prescribe any treatment, including cannabis treatment, for an individual patient is strictly a decision for the treating clinician, in consultation with their patient.

It is not recognised as a clinical entity by the American Psychiatric Association in its 2013 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders. Nor is it currently recognised by the WHO in its International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. The Department contacted the WHO in July 2020 to confirm whether or not parental alienation will be included in its updated classification, due in 2022. The Department is awaiting a response.</p><p>At present, the Department of Health has no specific health-based supports or services for parental alienation. However, health services can be accessed by anyone in the State, who, following clinical assessment, will be treated on a needs-based basis. </p><p>The Department is led by international best practice in this area and will continue to monitor any developments in this area.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, there is no specific legislative provision regarding parental alienation in Irish family law.  Section 246 of the Children Act 2001 provides for an offence of frightening, bullying or threatening a child in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or wellbeing. There are legislative provisions in place to deal with child welfare particularly regarding the relationship between a child and their parents or guardians, providing the framework for a legal response to a wide spectrum of child welfare issues.  </p><p>I understand that my colleague the Minister for Justice, Helen McEntee, and her Department are keen to examine the issue of parental alienation in greater detail. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality published a report last year on Reform of the Family Law System which includes parental alienation among a broad range of issues in the area of family law.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that a Family Justice Oversight Group was established recently in the Department of Justice which, in addition to Department of Justice officials, also includes representation from the judiciary, the Courts Service, the Legal Aid Board and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Group has been tasked with developing a family justice system, parallel to the establishment of a dedicated Family Court structure, having regard to international best practice.  I understand that all of the various recommendations contained in the Joint Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s report, including the recommendation on parent alienation, will be considered in the work of that group.</p><p>With regard to the provision of mental health supports to children and families, the HSE Service Plan 2020 prioritises further CAMHS improvements, including increased integration with Primary Care; developing a 7-day-a-week service to ensure improved supports; enhancing early intervention and day hospital care; improving in-patient and community based services; ensuring greater promotion and use of talk therapies; and developing Eating Disorder and Mental Health Intellectual Disability services. Mental Health service delivery to young people will also improve through the use of such e-mental health initiatives as the recently introduced phone helpline, a new text line, and digital supports including online counselling.  Mental health supports for children and families are also provided through the Primary Care Psychology Service and through a range of HSE funded community and voluntary groups. </p><p>  Further improvements for the planning and delivery of mental health services for children and young people will be progressed in the context of the implementation of the new mental health policy, Sharing the Vision, along with the updating of the Mental Health Act 2001 which is now well advanced.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition and the HSE has advised GPs accordingly.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that, nonetheless, some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances. The GP chronic disease management programme which is being phased in from this year will involve the ongoing monitoring of patients&rsquo; condition and any blood tests required in this context will be covered by the fees payable for this care. </p>  <p>  However, it remains a matter of concern to me that a GMS and GP visit card patient might be charged for blood tests which are clinically necessary and I have asked my officials to discuss with the HSE what further solutions to this issue may be possible.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. </p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The NIAC recommended that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys. On foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the current immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine. </p>  <p>  However, the HIQA report published in December 2018 did not recommend an HPV catch-up programme for older boys for the following reasons:</p>  <p>  - vaccinating boys in the first year of secondary school provides the best possible protection against HPV infection;</p>  <p>  - boys are already benefitting from the indirect herd protection provided by the girls' HPV vaccination programme which started in 2010.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.</p></reply>

This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations. </p>  <p>  As of 6.30pm, 22 November, there were 278 adult critical care beds open and staffed. 214 of these were occupied, including 31 Covid-19 patients. This compares with a peak of 160 Covid-19 patients in critical care in early April. It is important to note that the balance of Covid and non-Covid care is very different now to earlier in the pandemic, with the significant majority of patients in critical care being non-Covid patients. </p>  <p>  Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.   </p>  <p>  I encourage all nursing homes to remain familiar with the latest public health advice and support, and to make every effort to continue to facilitate visitors in line with public health advice and to communicate with family and friends on an ongoing basis in order to support positive mental health and wellbeing.  I have communicated with the sector outlining the need for them to be flexible, innovative and to facilitate to the greatest extent possible alternative arrangements such as window visiting, in line with public health advice.  </p>  <p>  I am mindful that Christmas, for many, has always been a very special time for families and loved ones to come together. I would like to assure the Deputy that we want to ensure a balanced and proportionate response to COVID-19 by finding ways to implement public health measures in response to the pandemic in a way that is fair, reasonable and proportionate.  I understand that the Health Protection Surveillance Centre is currently reviewing the public health guidance on visiting, in consultation with relevant national stakeholders, to consider, in line with the range of public health factors, further potential for safe visiting within nursing homes.  Visiting guidance is being considered in the context of the wider COVID-19 situation, as we plan and prepare for exiting level 5 restrictions.  </p>  <p>Notwithstanding this, it is also important to be cognisant of the wider epidemiological situation and the risks associated with same. On the 19th   November, the European Centre for Disease Control published its latest risk assessment with regard to long-term care facilities. It highlights that the probability of COVID-19 introduction into a long-term care facility depends on the level of COVID-19 circulation in the community, with a higher risk associated with higher incidence rates in the community. </p>  <p>  This highlights the importance of supressing the level of the virus in the community as one of the primary measures for protecting nursing homes. As citizens, we all have a responsibility in this regard and our actions across all of society can directly impact the outcomes for nursing home residents.</p></reply>

This Plan sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services.</p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, people are asked to stay at home, with certain exceptions, and must exercise within 5 km of home. Exercise and sporting amenities have been closed in order to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread.

This model of care will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF and other advanced assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatments).  Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate.  It is intended that, in line with available resources, this model of care for infertility will be rolled out on a phased basis over the course of the coming years.</p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care has commenced and involves the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs in maternity networks. which will facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with infertility issues.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system.  Phase Two will not commence until such time as infertility services at secondary level have been developed across the country and the AHR legislation is commenced.  Drafting of the AHR legislation is ongoing, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General.</p>  <p>It should be noted that while AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE.  Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client&rsquo;s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service.  The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client&rsquo;s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme.  Given the costs associated with certain fertility medicines, I am aware that these schemes can have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for individuals who avail of them.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is other support available in that patients who access IVF treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.</p>  <p>  Overall, the implementation of the model of care will help to ensure the provision of safe, effective and accessible infertility services at all levels of the public health system as part of the full range of services available in obstetrics and gynaecology.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure. The HSE is also required to undertake periodic reviews of eligibility in order to ensure that a person continues to meet the qualifying criteria required to continue holding eligibility. </p>  <p>  Eligibility reviews were temporarily suspended by the HSE Primary Care and Eligibility Reimbursement Service (PCERS) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cards that were due to expire during March and August 2020 were automatically extended for up to one year and will be re-assessed on a planned basis. This temporary measure was taken in the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to preserve necessary resources for emergency HSE Covid-19 responses. While the HSE PCERS have resumed eligibility reviews, it is important to note that where any medical or GP visit card holders has a review process initiated, he/she will continue to retain their eligibility for the duration of the review process. It is noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to provide an eligibility assessment process that is responsive and sensitive to people&rsquo;s needs, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services and to that end, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the HSE have also introduced a number of helpful operational measures since the onset of COVID-19 that have temporarily removed some of the requirements that would normally be expected for the completion of a medical card application.  </p></reply>

The HSE awards medical cards in accordance with the Health Act and assesses applicants on the overall financial situation of the applicant and his or her spouse or dependent.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of any difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services and to that end, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card where an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold. Currently, more than 32% of the population hold eligibility for a medical card.</p>  <p>  All persons who are ordinarily resident in the state can apply to the HSE to be determined whether eligible for a medical card.</p></reply>

It sets out guidance where Member States might conduct rapid antigen tests in addition to RT-PCR tests in clearly defined settings where the deployment of antigen tests is appropriate, and with the aim to contain the spread of the coronavirus, to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections and to limit isolation and quarantine measures.</p>  <p>  The Recommendation focuses on criteria to be used for the selection of rapid antigen tests, the settings during which rapid antigen tests are appropriate to be used, test operators, and validation and mutual recognition of rapid antigen tests and their results. The use of rapid antigen tests can be recommended to test individuals, regardless of symptoms, in settings where the proportion of test positivity is expected to be ≥10%, e.g. in the context of contact tracing and outbreak investigations.</p>  <p>  HIQA recently completed a report into Rapid Antigen Detection Testing. The HIQA report found that antigen tests to date show reduced diagnostic accuracy compared with rRT-PCR. In addition, many of the early tests in the market offer poor diagnostic accuracy. Due to reduced sensitivity, the WHO suggests that these rapid tests should only be used when rRT-PCR is unavailable, or where prolonged turnaround times preclude clinical utility.</p>  <p>  As a result of the HIQA report, the National Public Health Emergency Team asked the HSE to investigate the possible deployment of antigen tests in Ireland. The HSE has established an Antigen Project Validation Working Group whose aim is to validate the antigen tests in the market and evaluate the public health deployment options, including evaluation of the potential uses in various settings.</p>  <p>  The objectives of the group include assessing the international evidence on the use of antigen testing, defining sensitivity and specificity levels for appropriate antigen testing, identify specific tests that will form part of the validation process, validation of antigen tests across a range of settings including symptomatic and asymptomatic persons, develop public health guidelines on the appropriate use of antigen testing, and consideration of the operational implications of deploying antigen testing in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The HSE has recently issued a tender for procurement of antigen tests and Ireland is also participating in an arrangement for the supply of antigen tests through the Joint Procurement Agreements at EU level.</p>  <p>  The RNA PCR test remains the gold standard test for diagnosing Covid-19 cases, consistent with international best practice and continues to be fundamental to identifying the source and containing the spread of the virus in Ireland.</p></reply>

ROQU advised in this correspondence that they are engaged with industry stakeholders on a national level to review the potential of the technology and within the HSE through Prof. Martin Curley, Director of Digital Transformation and Innovation. </p>  <p>  There are two aspects to the solution offered by ROQU. The core offering relates to rapid testing using antigen test kits. This is accompanied by the app which is used to advise users of the results of their tests. It is not clear to my officials whether the ROQU are the developer of the app or whether they subcontracted this to a technical partner. The efficacy of antigen testing is still under review by the Department so this aspect of the app has not been assessed from a Departmental perspective. </p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Previously, my Department had been identifying eligible areas using a range of socio economic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of working population engaged in agriculture, and stocking density. </p><p>From 2019, eligible areas were instead required to be designated using the following list of bio-physical criteria:</p><p>- Low temperature</p><p>- Dryness</p><p>- Excess soil moisture</p><p>- Limited soil drainage</p><p>- Unfavourable texture and stoniness</p><p>- Shallow rooting depth</p><p>- Poor chemical properties</p><p>- Steep slope</p><p>In tandem with the process to designate relevant lands under these biophysical criteria, Member States were also required to undertake a fine-tuning process. This process was required to identify areas where significant natural constraints were identified with reference to the above-listed biophysical criteria, but where objective criteria, such as arable land use or stocking density levels, would indicate that these constraints have been overcome.</p><p>Finally, Member States could also identify areas for inclusion as Areas of Specific Constraint where it is necessary for land management to be continued in order to conserve or improve the environment, to maintain the countryside, to preserve the tourist potential of the area, or to protect the coastline.</p><p>This three-phased process was a lengthy project, involving protracted technical engagements with the EU Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Joint Research Centre in the EU Commission. The technical process was completed in late 2018 and, at that time, further to a series of consultation meetings with key stakeholders, my Department published full details in relation to the outcome of the review project.</p><p>The vast majority of land that was previously eligible under scheme remained eligible under the new approach.  Some 700 townlands that would have previously been eligible were deemed not to be eligible under the new designation. Farmers impacted financially by this change were enititled to receive a degressive phasing out payment in 2019 and 2020. Over 2,000 townlands were designated as eligible under the new approach and were eligible to receive a payment for the first time in 2019. </p><p>The outcome of the redesignation process was communicated by my Department via letter to farmers who had claimed on the land parcels reviewed under the redesignation process.  The details of the new townlands that were determined to be eligible following the re-designation process, as well as the details of the townlands found not to be eligible, were published on my Department's website.  A full listing off all eligible townlands under the scheme following the re-designation process was also published on my Department's website.  </p><p>An independently chaired Appeals Committee was appointed to examine any requests received by my Department for a full review on the outcome of the  re-designation process in relation to individual townlands. The work of this Appeals Committee has now been completed.  Following the completion of the appeal process, farmers were advised in writing of the outcome of the review carried out by Committee.  Where the appeal was unsuccessful and the townland remained ineligible, farmers were advised of their right to make a subsequent appeal to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

This Scheme cannot open until the transitional regulations, proposed by the European Commission, have been finalised. My Department is, however, currently preparing for the re-opening of the Scheme.</p><p>The number of entrants who will be permitted into the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) in 2021 will depend on the cost of applications received but the additional funding should, at average current level of participation, facilitate the entry of 400-500 new farmers. The overall budget will also allow participants whose contracts expire on 31<sup>st</sup>December 2020, subject to Commission approval, to roll-over their participation in the Scheme for next year if they wish. </p><p>Social Farming is funded under the Department&rsquo;s Rural Innovation &amp;amp; Development Fund.  Leitrim Development Company were awarded a contract in 2020 following a competitive procurement process to continue the development of the national Social Farming Network with associated funding of &euro;400,000.  </p><p>In addition, the following social farming contracts were extended in 2020 with associated funding of &euro;359,853:</p><p>- Leitrim Integrated Development Company for a &lsquo;Social Farming Best Practice Model&rsquo; </p><p>- South Kerry Development Partnership for the &lsquo;Kerry Social Farming Project&rsquo;</p><p>- Down Syndrome Ireland Cork Branch for the &lsquo;Fields of Dreams&rsquo; project.</p><p>Agroforestry gives land owners the flexibility to graze and even cut silage and hay while growing trees for timber in the same field. This system is ideally suited to farmers who are interested in forestry but who also want to avoid taking their land out of agricultural production. Under the current forestry programme a grant of &euro;6,220 / ha is available to cover the cost of establishment; in additional five annual premiums of &euro;660 are also available. </p></reply>

RC&Eacute; employs 125 full time and 112 Full time equivalents, a total of 237. The overall Betting Duty Receipts for 2019 was just over &euro;95 million. An economic review by Jim Power estimated that in 2016, the industry supported 5,058 full-time and part-time jobs. In addition, there were 7,313 active greyhound owners. The number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector was estimated at 12,371.</p>  <p>  The most recent assessment of economic impact was undertaken by Jim Power Economics in 2017.  The report indicated that &ldquo;the gross wage bill attributed to employment in the greyhound industry is estimated at &euro;126.5M.  PAYE/PRSI paid per annum is estimated at &euro;12.7M.  Net incomes generated in the industry are estimated at &euro;113.8M.  Based on a conservative income multiplier effect of 0.5 this would result in a total economic impact to the economy of &euro;171M per annum in terms of additional spending" </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 crisis poses particular challenges with catering, admissions and tote income virtually collapsing. The only current commercial income is from online wagering activity and media rights.

The budget increase in the Horse &amp;amp; Greyhound Racing Fund allocation for 2021 of &euro;2.4M assists in bridging the gap between expenditure and income. </p>  <p>  The overall objective of the Fund is to continue to support the industry as a whole and progress the implementation of the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 including the delivery of the extensive care and welfare programme. The greyhound industry coninues to be an important industry supporting significant direct and indirect employment particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

This Protocol will apply from 1 January 2021 regardless of the outcome of the Future Relationship negotiations. </p>  <p>  The Protocol upholds measures to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, including that Northern Ireland will continue to apply the Union Customs Code and other relevant EU legislation. This will ensure that many of the changes arising in our trade with Great Britain will not apply to trade with Northern Ireland. The Protocol is clear, and the Commission have confirmed, that the movement of animals and goods, including livestock and beef, between Northern Ireland and the EU will continue to be treated the same as intra-EU movements.  This is possible because the Protocol provides that relevant EU law applies to and in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Whether tariffs will apply to Irish beef exports to the rest of the UK from 1 January 2021 is dependent on the outcome of the negotiations, which are ongoing. Ireland has been clear that one of our key asks is continued access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p></reply>

Whilst this is high level data, when looking at it, one can make certain assumptions based on our knowledge of the sectors  - such that intra-mammary tubes sold are used in the dairy industry and in general the premixes sold are predominantly used in the pig sector. </p>  <p>  The most recent HPRA report relates to sales of veterinary antibiotics in Ireland in 2018 and we await publication of the sales report for 2019. The sales figures for 2020 will not be available until Q4 2021 due to a lag period between sales occurring and reporting of sales data to the HPRA from MAHs. The sales data is submitted to the EMA as part of the European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption (ESVAC) project. </p>  <p>  The total amount of veterinary antibiotics sold by the MAHs in Ireland in 2018 was 99.4 tonnes. This represents sales data in respect of both farming and companion animals.  </p>  <p>  The 2018 data shows that the premix component (incorporated in feed) of all sales represents 29.2% of overall sales - that equates to approximately 29 tonnes. </p>  <p>  The equivalent figure for injectables is 28.1% - equating to 27.9 tonnes. </p>  <p>  The sales data however has its limitations as it does not reflect matters such as differences in dosage rate associated with different products or clarity regarding the species of animals in which products are used - the same product may be used across many species.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working to develop a National Secure Veterinary Digital Prescription System which will allow data on the antibiotics being prescribed per species and category to be collected and reported annually in line with requirements of EU Regulation 2019/6.

The focus of the initiative is on renovating or repurposing properties for residential use rather than providing a specific incentive for young persons to purchase vacant properties. </p>  <p>  In October 2018, my Department launched a Town Centre Living Initiative to explore in a holistic way how to encourage increased residential occupancy in rural towns and villages.  The pilot focused on 6 towns with different characteristics in different parts of the country. </p>  <p>  An independent report on the pilot Town Centre Living Initiative was published on 22nd June 2020.  The report highlighted the value of developing a shared vision, or masterplan, for individual towns if they are to be attractive places in which to live.  </p>  <p>  In that regard, I have secured an additional &euro;2 million in Budget 2021 as part of the expanded Town and Village Renewal Scheme, which will be used to support the development of masterplans as a basis for the strategic development of our rural towns and villages.  This initiative will be progressed early in 2021 and further details will be announced at that time.</p>  <p>  An Inter-Departmental Group has also been established which will consider all of the suggested actions in the report on the Town Centre Living initiative, as well as progressing the commitment in the Programme for Government to develop a Town Centre First approach to the regeneration of our towns and villages.  The Group recently held its first meeting and is chaired jointly by my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. </p></reply>

Due to delays in agreeing the post-2020 EU Budget, the next EU LEADER programme will not commence until 2022 at the earliest.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme.  The objective of the Transitional Programme is to allow locally-led rural development projects to continue to be delivered using the LEADER model until the new EU programme commences. </p>  <p>  The duration of the transitional period at EU level has not yet been agreed. We are therefore planning for Ireland&rsquo;s Transitional Programme to run for an initial period of 12 months, but with the scope to extend this if necessary, to align with the outcome of the discussions at EU level between the Commission and the Parliament.  </p>  <p>  An extra &euro;4 million has been provided for LEADER in Budget 2021, to bring the total allocation for next year to &euro;44 million.  I can confirm that this allocation will be used to fund a combination of existing projects as they come to completion, as well as for new projects to be approved under the Transitional Programme.  The funding will also support the administration costs of Local Action Groups and their Implementing Partners who deliver the programme locally, in closing out the existing programme and delivering the Transitional Programme.  </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years as the projects are completed. Therefore, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023, as well as in 2021. </p>  <p>  The details of the Transitional Programme are currently being finalised and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the Programme. </p></reply>

The 2020 scheme has an indicative budget of &euro;10 million and is being delivered through three Measures as follows:</p><p><b>- Measure 1</b>: Small Scale Repair/Promotion and Marketing - Grant Amounts: up to &euro;20,000.</p><p><b>- Measure 2</b>: Medium Scale Repair/Upgrade and New Trail/Amenity Development - Grant Amounts: up to &euro;200,000.</p><p><b>- Measure 3: </b>Large Scale Repair/Upgrade and New Strategic Trail/Amenity Development - Grant amounts: up to &euro;500,000. </p><p>In 2020, applications under Measure 1 were invited from Local Authorities and Local Development Companies. The closing date for applications under Measure 1 was 30th September and the applications received are currently being assessed. </p><p>Applications under Measures 2 &amp;amp; 3 are invited through Local Authorities, while State Agencies may also apply directly under Measure 3. The closing date for applications under Measures 2 &amp;amp; 3 is 30th November 2020. </p><p>Local community groups who have a project that requires funding under the scheme may approach the relevant Local Development Company or Local Authority in their area, depending on the scale of the works involved. </p><p>Given the importance of the outdoors for people's health and wellbeing, particularly at this time, I secured an additional &euro;2 million for the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme in Budget 2021.  The 2021 scheme will have an Exchequer budget of &euro;12 million and details of the scheme will be announced next year. </p><p>More information regarding the scheme, including details of projects supported in previous years, is available at </p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/policy-information/fd0c9f-outdoor-recreation-infrastructure-scheme/.</i></p></reply>
