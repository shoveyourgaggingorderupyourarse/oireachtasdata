    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-12a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021200056#WRB00500"><p>I met my French counterpart, Minister Elisabeth Borne, on Brexit matters in Dublin on 23 November 2018. I highlighted the importance of transport connectivity and Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in particular in relation to the continued use of the UK landbridge when the UK leaves the EU. We discussed also the potential implications for ports both in Ireland and in France given the levels of trade that both of our countries have with the UK. Minister Borne shared many of my concerns and said that France, like Ireland, was preparing for all scenarios, including facilitation of EU and Irish traffic at Calais.  </p>  <p>  The landbridge is the fastest shipping route to continental Europe and as such is relied upon by many Irish exporters and importers for the transport of time-sensitive products, such as those in the agri-food/perishable goods sector, just-in-time and high value goods. </p>  <p>  An estimated &euro;18.2 billion of our exports rely on this route, first travelling from Ireland by sea to the UK, making their way through the UK roads network to ports such as Dover, and then entering continental Europe at French ports, particularly the port of Calais. Disruption or delays on the Dover &ndash; Calais maritime link when the UK leaves the EU could considerably impact on hauliers and Irish businesses and is of major concern. </p>  <p>  At official level, the Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and including officials from my own Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and others has been working closely with the European Commission and other affected Member States (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden) with a view to preparing EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code.</p>  <p>  A cross-departmental delegation of officials including from my Department travelled to France in November of last year for meetings on Brexit preparedness. The need for French ports to facilitate the movement of Irish trucks transiting the UK was discussed. </p>  <p>  Irish officials also met with the European Commission for technical consultations on the landbridge in December 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to work with our French counterparts, other EU Member States and the European Commission in seeking to ensure that the landbridge can continue to be an effective route for our businesses trading with the rest of the EU Single Market.</p>  <p>  Separately, a number of representatives from French ports have travelled to Ireland to meet with Irish port representatives on a number of occasions and most recently in January of this year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-12a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021200056#WRB00900"><p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. However, I am not involved in the day-to- day operations of public transport.</p>  <p>  The issues raised by the Deputy about problems with passenger lifts at some train stations are operational matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. That said, I am concerned that the company would be doing its utmost to ensure continued accessibility for passengers who need these facilities, and I have been assured that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is committed to providing all its customers, including those who are mobility and sensory impaired, the highest level of accessibility on its rail network. </p>  <p>  When lifts get damaged and are out of service, some specialised parts may be required which can take some time to be delivered.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann endeavours to return all out-of-service lifts to operational service as quickly as possible. The company's provider of lift maintenance services gives priority to lift requirements for repair and attention. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has also advised that extensive and deliberate vandalism has a big impact on the functionality and reliability of lifts on the network. The Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann website and the Passenger Information System displays at all DART stations is updated in the event of a lift being out of order. </p>  <p>  I am advised that a number of measures are being taken by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to improve access for people with disabilities to rail and DART services. Under the Accessibility Retro-fit Programme funding is provided for, amongst other things, the upgrading of train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users. In this regard, I secured a trebling of the funding provided for the Retro-fit Programme to &euro;28 million for the period 2018 to 2021. In 2018 &euro;1m was provided for rail station accessibility upgrades and this has been increased to &euro;3m for 2019.  With increased funding from 2019 it is envisaged that larger projects will be undertaken at railway stations including the installation of lifts and bridges to allow easy access &ldquo;across track&rdquo; platforms for wheelchair users.</p>  <p>  Following a review by  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann of accessibility on the  DART, Maynooth and Northern Commuter lines, and consultation with users and representative bodies, the company has launched a new Improved Accessibility Policy.  This involves a new zonal system for DART, Maynooth and Northern Commuter, that is designed to provide better service and quicker response times to passengers who require assistance. This policy divides the 31 stations on the DART, Maynooth and Northern Commuter lines into 13 zones, with each zone including between one to four stations. One station in each zone will always be manned and will provide support to other stations in that zone.  Full details are available on the Irish Rail website.   </p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has reduced the notice period for providing assistance to customers on the DART from 24 hours to 4 hours and the company is working towards reducing this notice period even further. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann  intends to deploy Customer Service Officers (CSO) on all Intercity routes. This will mean that, at all stops, train services with a CSO on board will be able to ensure ramp assistance is available.  </p>  <p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is also developing a dedicated app to support customers who have mobility or sensory impairments, and I provided additional funding for this in 2018. This will be introduced in coming months. The app will allow users to pre-book a journey that confirms they will have assistance by a member of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann staff at their departure and arrival stations and provide them with support in an emergency.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-12a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021200056#WRB01200"><p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services. </p>  <p>  The NTA also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  </p>  <p>  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.</p>  <p>  I understand that free public transport is available in some European cities and towns to encourage increased use of public transport.  The objectives of such initiatives can be to reduce traffic congestion, to attract people into cities for leisure purposes, and to provide environmental benefits.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, the Irish Exchequer will provide just over &euro;300m as subvention for public service obligation (PSO) transport services and Rural Transport Local Link services.  I understand that the NTA wrote to the Deputy in September last and indicated that, in 2017, passengers paid about &euro;580 million in fares on subsidised bus and rail services.</p>  <p>  Therefore, if such services were to be provided free to passengers, then the expected cost to the Exchequer would be in excess of the &euro;580m collected in fares in 2017.  This amount would be additional to the 2019 Exchequer allocation of &euro;300m for PSO support and the further amount (&euro;95m allocation for 2019) that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection pays to public transport providers in respect of its Free Travel Scheme which provides free transport to almost 1 million people in the State, including all people aged over 66 living permanently here, along with some other qualifying people.  So taking round approximate figures, the Deputy's idea would cost the taxpayer about &euro;600 million per year, in addition to the &euro;400 million that the Exchequer already spends on public transport services.  And this is just the cost of the actual services;  it does not count the Exchequer investment in public transport infrastructure which in 2019 is about &euro;350 million and will be rising sharply over the coming years.</p>  <p>  The NTA also advised the Deputy that the estimates of the full year cost of providing free travel do not factor in the cost of providing the additional fleet, depots, drivers, etc. to meet the likely resultant substantial increase in passenger numbers if fares were reduced or eliminated.  </p>  <p>  While I have no immediate plans to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of introducing free public transport for all users, which would require substantial additional funding by the taxpayer or from other sources, I am interested in hearing about innovative and radical ideas that would meet the needs of passengers, and  encourage more people out of their cars and onto public transport, thus alleviating congestion and helping to tackle climate challenges.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-12a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021200056#WRB01600"><p>Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 it is a statutory function of the National Transport Authority (NTA) to determine the appropriate mix of directly awarded and competitively tendered bus services.  Arising from this, the NTA undertook a number of competitive procurement processes in 2017 and selected Go-Ahead as the preferred bidder in the competition to operate 24 routes (23 existing plus 1 new) in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  As the Deputy is aware, the phasing in of these new services commenced in September 2018 and concluded on 20 January with the transfer of nine routes.  </p>  <p>  The NTA does not regularly provide operational performance reports to my Department in relation to individual contracts that it has with transport operators.</p>  <p>  In the case of Go-Ahead, I have been advised by the NTA that it has reviewed punctuality performance for the period 20th January 2019 to 4th February 2019 (i.e. the data it has to hand since the latest round of service transfers from Dublin Bus to Go-Ahead).  From that data, on-time punctuality performance has improved overall by approximately 2% on the Go-Ahead routes compared to the same period last year, when they were operated by Dublin Bus. </p>  <p>  There are, however, variations by route and it is notable that the most recent service transfers are performing less well punctuality-wise.  This repeats a pattern seen in previous phases of service transfers, where drivers new to a route initially tend to adopt a conservative driving manner, resulting in some delays compared to schedule.</p>  <p>  In terms of passenger use, after a period of adjustment as passengers familiarise themselves with timetable changes, growth in passenger use has generally been positive, in particular where services have been enhanced compared to Dublin Bus timetables.</p>  <p>  The NTA intends to ensure that customers will experience improved service levels across all of the routes in question, and it will achieve this through a variety of means:   </p>  <p>  - The quality of service is measurable and, therefore, the NTA has set out in the contract with the new operator, the customer service levels that are expected.  The NTA will use the contract terms to drive up levels of customer service. </p>  <p>  - All services operated under the contract will continue to be regulated by the NTA as they are today.  These means that LEAP, Free Travel Pass, Real Time Information, National Journey Planner etc. will all continue to operate on these services. </p>  <p>  - The NTA has the statutory powers to determine fare levels, and the NTA will continue using its fares determination process to rationalise and improve the fare structure across all the different operators in the regulated bus market, including the new operator.</p>  <p>  Public transport passenger journeys are growing, with Dublin Bus experiencing strong growth which is forecast to continue.  That growth will allow Dublin Bus continue to expand its services in tandem with the roll-out of Go-Ahead's routes.</p>  <p>  We are always looking for ways to improve our public transport services and the NTA conducting an open, competitive process as part of providing enhanced and expanded services for passengers, and then monitoring and implementing its contacts, is part of that improvement process.</p></reply>

In advance of the meeting, the RTN forwarded a paper containing a number of proposals including those referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport passenger services nationally.  It also has a statutory remit in relation to effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  Since 2012, the NTA has national responsibility for integrated local and rural transport, including management of the Rural Transport Programme (RTP) which now operates under the Local Link brand.</p>  <p>  The NTA published the &ldquo;Local Link Rural Transport Programme Strategic Plan 2018-2022&rdquo; last year. Recognising the key role of local authorities in the planning of rural transport services, the Strategic Plan commits to ensuring that Local Link Offices are directly involved with their respective local authority in the development of relevant plans and strategies, in particular Local Transport Plans.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy would be aware, the three Regional Assemblies are tasked to coordinate, promote and support the strategic planning and sustainable development of the regions. The primary vehicle for this is the preparation and implementation of Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES). The Strategies are statutorily underpinned by the Planning and Development Acts. Under the RSES, local authorities will be required to prepare Local Transport Plans. As part of the consultation process the three Regional Assemblies are undertaking for their respective Strategy, my Department has sought that each will ensure that Local Link Offices are formally consulted in relation to the development of local transport plans.</p></reply>

The objective is to have a single aviation regulator responsible for economic, safety and security regulation and a standalone air navigation service provider.  This is in line with best international practice.    </p>  <p>  As regards the current status of the work, I can advise the Deputy that a Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Chief Executive Officer of the IAA and the Aviation Regulation Commissioner is leading the preparatory work to implement the proposed changes including work on draft legislation.  As previously outlined in December, the work of this Group is detailed and in some areas highly technical in nature.  I expect the Steering Group will make recommendations to me in the first half of this year.    </p>  <p>  As I have explained before, the overall approach to the Government&rsquo;s aviation regulation reform agenda is wholly in accordance with established practice for structural reform processes within the Irish public sector.  There will be appropriate staff consultation throughout the process.  There has already been engagement with the main staff representative body &ndash; F&oacute;rsa &ndash; and in all eventualities the commitment is that staff will transfer to the new structures on no less favourable terms and conditions, unless otherwise negotiated.</p>  <p>  Recognising that such reform has a number of complex components, I am mindful of the need to manage the transition to the proposed new arrangements for aviation regulation in a careful and methodical manner. That includes in relation to the eventual enactment of supporting legislation.  As I advised in December, while good progress is being made, there are still a number of stages to navigate on the way to the production of a draft Bill that can be put forward to the House for consideration. </p>  <p>  This is an important project for the future of aviation regulation in Ireland. While the changes involved may be complex, they also provide a new opportunity for enhancing existing provisions. Throughout the change process, senior management in both organisations will ensure that business as usual continues for all external stakeholders.</p></reply>

The Government remains firmly of the view that the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and protect the Good Friday Agreement is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement, agreed between the EU and the British Government.</p>  <p>  In 2018, following the publication of the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework, Minister Donohoe and I wrote a joint letter to Transport Commissioner Bulc and Regional Policy Commissioner Cretu emphasising the considerable challenges facing Ireland in the transport sector and setting out how the NDP and NPF will inform future investments into the regions, including the West, Border and North West regions which will be particularly impacted by Brexit. We made the point that investment in infrastructure has the potential to mitigate the implications of Brexit in these regions.</p>  <p>  A proposal for a new Regulation for the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) - the funding mechanism for TEN-T from 2021 - is also currently under consideration at EU level.  A Partial General Approach was agreed in relation to this proposal at Transport Council last December, which would in principle mean that post 2020 calls for funding may be open to infrastructure on the Comprehensive Network in Member States where there is no land border with another EU Member State. If this is maintained as part of the final agreed Regulation, it will mean that organisations will continue to be eligible to apply for funding for projects coming within the application criteria after 2020.       </p>  <p>  My Department continues to liaise with the European Commission in relation to the TEN-T network in the context of Brexit, including in relation to the EU&rsquo;s proposal outlined above, and my Department has raised Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about the implications for connectivity and trade in light of the UK's decision to leave the EU.</p>  <p>  In relation to roads and the Border Region, the National Development Plan sets out the Government&rsquo;s ambition in this area. Chapter 4 of the NDP looks at how targeted investment can promote economic resilience in the border region in the context of Brexit. This Chapter touches on a range of measures including investment in transport links. The NDP includes references, among other projects, to the N2/A5 roads, the N14 from Manorcunningham to Lifford, the N52 Ardee Bypass, the N2 Slane Bypass, the N4 from Collooney to Castlebaldwin, and the N56 in Donegal.</p>  <p>  Schemes on these routes are at various stages of development and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, will be advancing the schemes on a phased basis within the overall capital budget available to it.  </p>  <p>  As regards regional and local roads, I have been pleased to be able to allocate significantly increased grant funding to local authorities over the last two years. In this context grant allocations to Cavan and Monaghan in 2019 are up over 40% compared to the 2017 allocation. </p>  <p>  While the main focus continues to be on maintenance and renewal expenditure, some limited funding is available for Specific and Strategic road improvement grants.  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case project basis and must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework.  </p>  <p>  Grant funding being provided to local authorities in border counties includes a grant to Cavan County Council to enable the Council to update previous appraisal work relating to an upgrade of the Cavan to Dundalk regional road route.  The aim is to assess the extent to which the scheme or elements of it can be justified in terms of appraisal and advanced for further consideration.</p></reply>

This sector encompasses taxis, hackneys and limousine services, and the regulatory framework applies to the vehicles, the drivers, and the services to the travelling public that they provide.  The overall objective of the legislation and the regulatory framework is to protect the consumer interest and to uphold safety for the passengers.  The rules do not limit the number of operators; rather, they concentrate on ensuring standards of safety and service that will benefit the public.</p>  <p>  The 2013 legislation, and NTA's subsequent implementation of it, was informed by the Taxi Regulation Review Report, that was published by the Government in January 2012.  Among its recommendations, the Review suggested the introduction of a local area hackney licence, so as to address transport deficits that would not otherwise be addressed in certain rural areas. </p>  <p>  The NTA made Regulations permitting the issue of such licences with effect from December 2013.  The aim was to enable a special part-time hackney service to be provided in rural areas which are likely to be too small to support a full-time taxi or hackney operation, and which are also too far away from adjacent centres to be serviced by normal taxis or hackneys from those adjacent centres. </p>  <p>  To address transport deficits in certain rural areas, the Local Area Hackney licence continues to be offered by the NTA.  However, take-up has been low.  Despite the fact that the costs of a Local Area Hackney licence are deliberately set low and the some of the standards that must be met are lower than for an normal taxi or hackney operation, only a very small number of such licences are in use.  The NTA has looked at this, and identified that one of the main deterrents to the take-up seems to be the cost to an operator of the insurance needed to cover carrying passengers for reward compared to the restricted nature of the part-time service that can be provided under the licence.</p>  <p>  The NTA is currently undertaking a review of key aspects of taxi, hackney and limousine operations with the intention of developing a five-year strategy for the whole small public service vehicle industry.  This Strategy will guide regulatory development for the sector over that timeframe.</p>  <p>  With the assistance and input of the Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles, the review is considering a variety of issues including vehicle licensing, vehicle standards, driver licensing, wheelchair accessible vehicles, fixed payment offences, and technological developments.  As part of its work, the review is looking at the matter of local area hackneys and the scope for improving their effectiveness in addressing rural connectivity gaps.</p>  <p>  The NTA plans to conduct a public consultation process in the first half of this year on the proposals emerging from the review process.  This will give the public and public representatives the opportunity to provide their views and to inform the outcome of the work.  The outcome of the review will inform the NTA's regulatory strategies and operations, and if there are any recommendations on overall policy or legislation, then I will consider them fully with my Department. </p>  <p>  Finally, Deputies will also be aware that the NTA also has a wider role affecting transport connectivity in rural areas, arising from its responsibilities for providing integrated local and rural transport.  In the last few years, it has considerably developed the Rural Transport Programme - which it now operates under the "Local Link" brand - leading to expansion of the number of services provided, and with a substantial increase to the spending on the programme.  NTA is currently conducting a pilot scheme to test evening and night-time services as part of the Rural Transport Programme. This pilot was recently extended and future arrangements will be informed by an evaluation of its experience.</p></reply>

Under the 2017 round of the programme &euro;62m was allocated to 1,837 sporting projects and my officials continue to assist these grantees in completing their projects and draw down their grants. </p><p>Sanction was received last year from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to open a new round of the Programme with allocations of up to &euro;40m.  This new round opened for applications on Friday 7 September and the application period closed on Friday 19th October.  By that deadline, a record 2,337 applications were submitted seeking a total of &euro;162m in funding.</p><p>186 of these applications were for projects deemed invalid under the 2017 round of the programme but who subsequently submitted corrected documents.  These applications were assessed first and approximately &euro;7m in allocations to 170 projects were announced on the 17th January.</p><p>In relation to new applications, for the first time applicants who have submitted incorrect documentation under this round will be given the opportunity to correct their application during the assessment period. While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it will be at least the second quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced.  Sufficient resources are available this year to cover all existing commitments under the programme in addition to the new allocations. </p><p>With regard to swimming pools, the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP), as operated by my Department, provides grant aid to local authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. To date 51 pools have been completed and four swimming pool projects remain in the current LASPP. The priority this year is on advancing these four projects and sufficient resources are available to cover these commitments. </p><p>In relation to the future funding of swimming pools and other larger projects, the National Development Plan confirmed the establishment of a new Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100m available over the coming years. The new scheme opened for applications on 19th November and the closing date for applications is the 17th April 2019.  Full details of the scheme and application forms are available on my Department's website at . The aim of the fund is to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects where the Exchequer investment would be greater than the maximum amount available under the SCP.  Initially, the scheme has a particular focus on National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities. Swimming pool projects will also be considered.</p></reply>

As noted in my recent response to the Deputy&rsquo;s PQ (No. 1623), this funding only represents a single element in a wider range of transport mitigation efforts underway, including significant support for new and improved public and sustainable transport; a number of incentives to encourage a transition away from conventional fuels towards low and zero emitting alternatives; increasing the proportion of biofuels in the fuel mix; and working to improve EU efficiency standards for all vehicles produced. Collectively, these measures are assisting in decarbonising the sector. The most recent emission inventories indicated a small fall in transport emissions for the first time in four years.  </p><p>In 2019 the Carbon Reduction Programme is allocated &euro;7m to further support some of these measures and help maintain this downwards trend in transport emissions. Noting that the measures funded under this Programme are largely new, innovative and often associated with emerging technologies/research and, accordingly, tend to take more time to develop, establish and gain acceptance, there was an underspend in 2018. To continue and expand projects and programmes commenced last year &euro;1.965m was carried over from 2018 to the Programme in 2019. Funding reallocated during 2018 was supportive of sustainable transport generally, with increased expenditure in 2018 recorded across both public transport and active travel projects and programmes.  </p><p>It is envisaged that the 2019 allocation will support four main work streams. Firstly, the Low Emission Bus Trials, which commenced in 2018 and will run into Q2 this year, which will help to further inform purchasing decisions for transitioning the bus fleet to lower emitting alternatives. Secondly, supporting electric vehicle uptake through the Electric Vehicle Tolling Incentive Scheme and the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle Grant Scheme &ndash; based on recent electric vehicle sales I expect to see significant increase in demand in both Schemes in 2019. Thirdly, funding from the Carbon Reduction Programme will be used to cover the cost differential of purchasing low-emission public transport vehicles, beginning with nine hybrid double-deck buses for the Dublin Bus fleet and a small pilot programme in rural Ireland. Finally, in support of evidence building, the Programme will support much needed Irish-specific transport mitigation research; four projects have commenced and will be co-funded in 2019 examining subjects such as behavioural change and the decarbonisation of the freight sector in Ireland.</p><p>Tackling national emissions is an evolving challenge, affected greatly by population levels, economic activity and strongly influenced by behavioural change. In tandem, the mitigation measures and technologies currently available to us are constantly developing. In recognition of this, Ireland&rsquo;s responses to tackling challenge must be equally dynamic. Accordingly, the work streams for the Carbon Reduction Programme will evolve and be informed by the actions in the forthcoming <i>All of Government Plan to Tackle Climate Disruption</i>and the deliberations of the <i>Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce</i>.</p></reply>

It ranges from recreational craft users through to the smaller passenger boat and fishing vessel operators, on up to larger passenger and cargo ships and fishing vessels and internationally trading ships, both passenger and cargo.</p>  <p>  The Administration performs many roles in relation to maritime safety in the State, both of a preventative and a reactive nature.</p>  <p>  For example, the Marine Survey Office carries out a wide variety of regulatory and enforcement functions concerning vessels, seafarers, ports and cargos in the areas of safety, security, pollution prevention, accessibility and living and working conditions (for Irish ships in Irish waters and worldwide; and for foreign ships while in Irish ports).</p>  <p>  The Irish Coast Guard is responsible for the response to, and coordination of, maritime accidents which require Search &amp;amp; Rescue and Counter Pollution &amp;amp; Ship Casualty operations.  It also has a role in marine communication, surveillance and emergency management in Ireland&rsquo;s Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>  <p>  Ensuring safe maritime operations and, in the unfortunate instances where things go wrong, an efficient and effective emergency response, is the top priority for the Administration.  While these activities are constantly under review as part of its day to day work it is useful to take a step back and conduct a separate review from time to time or as the circumstances require.</p>  <p>  For instance, following the tragic incidents involving the Coast Guard RIB, or Rigid Inflatable Boat, off Kilkee in 2016 and, separately, the Coast Guard Rescue 116 helicopter off the coast of Mayo in 2017, I have instigated a review into the national Search &amp;amp; Rescue Framework and the important work of the Review Group is on-going.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in 2017, the Maritime Safety Policy Division of my Department also issued a revised edition of the Code of Practice for the Safe Operation of Recreational Craft, which provides users of recreational craft with important, practical safety advice and recommendations.</p>  <p>  Prior to this, in April 2015 my Department, following a wide consultation, published its Maritime Safety Strategy 2015-2019, and this document contains a list of actions that the Irish Maritime Administration is currently working on implementing.</p>  <p>  In relation to your specific enquiry regarding the Torremolinos Convention, that convention, which was agreed at the International Maritime Organization in 1977, never entered into force and is no longer open for accession.  The Convention represented the first attempt internationally to regulate the larger fishing vessel sector &ndash; this is fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over.  It was replaced in 1993 by the Torremolinos Protocol, which updated and amended the provisions of the prior Convention to try and encourage a greater number of ratifications from states.  Ireland acceded to the Protocol in 2001 and has domestic legislation for such fishing vessels.  However, similar to the prior Convention, the Torremolinos Protocol has also failed to reach the required number of ratifications to enter into force internationally.</p>  <p>  Further amendments to the Protocol were adopted by the International Maritime Organization in 2012, namely the Cape Town Agreement or, to give it its full title, the &lsquo;Cape Town Agreement of 2012 on the Implementation of the Provisions of the 1993 Protocol relating to the Torremolinos International Convention for the Safety of Fishing Vessels, 1977&rsquo;.  That Agreement has not yet entered into force.  My Department is currently preparing proposals for Irish legislation on the matter which, if passed, will facilitate Ireland ratifying the Agreement in due course.</p></reply>

In addition to that personalised consultation with individual property owners, the NTA also publishes detailed booklets in relation to each proposed "corridor", establishes a community forum for each corridor and holds public information events in relation to the various corridors. The Deputy will, I am sure, acknowledge the extensive scope of this non-statutory consultation process.</p>  <p>  I believe the consultation processes I have referred to above demonstrate the extensive engagement that has taken place and will continue to take place with communities.

We agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement is the best and only deal possible and that it cannot be reopened.</p><p>While we hope that the backstop will never be used, it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland, while protecting the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union.</p><p>In my meeting with President Juncker, at which he was accompanied by Union negotiator Michel Barnier and Commissioner Hogan, he also reiterated his firm view that the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, is not for re-negotiation. </p><p>We agreed that, while we will continue to seek agreement on the orderly withdrawal of the UK, given the ongoing uncertainty in London, we will also further intensify our preparations for a no-deal scenario.</p><p>President Juncker confirmed that the Commission stands ready to assist Ireland in meeting the specific challenges we face as a result of Brexit &ndash; particularly in vulnerable sectors such as agriculture, agribusiness and fisheries. He also confirmed that programmes providing assistance for cross-border peace and reconciliation in the border region will be strengthened. </p><p>We agreed that Ireland and the Commission will continue to work closely together over the period ahead. </p><p>I thanked my interlocutors for their unwavering commitment and noted that, as a small country, this strong solidarity resonates deeply in Ireland.</p></reply>

I note in particular the call for the restoration of pay. </p>  <p>  The scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration (C&amp;A) for members of the Permanent Defence Force provides a formal mechanism for the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, that is RACO (for commissioned officers) and PDFORRA (for enlisted personnel) to present claims and proposals relating to remuneration and conditions of service. </p>  <p>  Similar to other sectors in the public service, the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel was reduced as one of the measures necessary to stabilise national finances during the financial crisis. The recovery in the economy has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a fair and sustainable recovery in public service pay scales.</p>  <p>  Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>  <p>  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the Government established the Public Service Pay Commission to provide objective advice to Government in relation to Public Service pay policy.  Following the publication of the Public Service Pay Commission report in May 2017, the Government initiated negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, which was accepted by members of the Permanent Defence Forces, through their representative associations, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The increases due in 2018 and from 1 January 2019 have been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel. Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2019 and 2020.</p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the payscales of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p>  <p>  New entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011, will also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to interventions at points 4 and 8 of the relevant pay scales for all such new entrants to the public service. This measure, which I am pleased to say has recently been accepted by PDFORRA, will be effective for their members from 1 March 2019.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a more comprehensive examination of the specific recruitment and retention challenges in the Defence Forces, which the Commission identified in Chapter 6 of its report in May 2017. The Commission's work is on-going.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations that arise from the work of the Commission.</p></reply>

The Government allowed for greater engagement with EI and EI supported companies which could contribute to Defence Forces capabilities across the full range of its activities. </p>  <p>  The Government's White Paper on Defence states that my Department will "identify opportunities for cooperative-collaborative engagement between the Defence Forces and Irish-based enterprise and research institutes, including third level colleges".  In line with this, work is on-going to further develop the Defence Enterprise Initiative. </p>  <p>  Projects proposed by research institutes and companies, where they are seeking to partner with, or involve, Defence Force participation are submitted to the Defence Enterprise Committee for consideration.  The Defence Enterprise Committee consists of personnel from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Enterprise Ireland.  All proposed capabilities are vetted and agreed at the highest level in the Defence Organisation to ensure compatibility with the roles assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government.  </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that engagement is targeted towards companies and research institutes that have relevant technologies or are developing technologies which can support Defence Force capabilities and therefore does not target specific geographical locations.  However, I am aware of two projects involving the Defence Forces and County Kildare based companies or research institutes, both of which have successfully secured funding from the EU's Horizon 2020 Programme.  </p>  <p>  My Department and the Defence Forces will continue to provide assistance to Enterprise Ireland and companies supported by this agency in 2019 and beyond, with a view to increased research, innovation and enterprise development in Ireland.   </p></reply>

This has led to the situation whereby those who retired since 1 March 2012, on a like-for-like basis, generally receive lower pensions than their counterparts who retired before them.  </p>  <p>  Under Section 6.2 of the PSSA, a guiding principle of current pension increase policy is the need to adopt an equitable approach.  This means that those who retired since 1 March 2012 must first &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; with their counterparts &ndash; such as the person in question &ndash; who retired before them on higher pension rates.  </p>  <p>  There is an ongoing administrative exercise over the course of the PSSA to review and adjust public service pension rates in line with current policy.  As regards military pensioners who retired since 1 March 2012, I am advised that, generally speaking, the benefit of the recent pay increases including the 1% from 1 January 2018 and 1% from 1 October 2018 under the PSSA has now been passed on (with arrears) to those post-1 March 2012 retirees, including any associated dependants.  The next scheduled pay increase for public servants including members of the Defence Forces is 1.75% from 1 September 2019.  </p>  <p>  The pension increase policy out to end-2020 also provides that the benefit of the PSSA pay increases will be passed on to qualifying pre-March 2012 pensioners, but only where the pensions of those who retired since March 2012 with analogous retiring rank, pensionable service etc. have moved ahead of pre-March 2012 retirees.  In that context, military pension rates will continue to be monitored and reviewed by my Department according as each pay increase is being implemented.     </p>  <p>  However, as matters currently stand, this person&rsquo;s pension remains ahead of his counterparts who have the same retiring rank and pensionable service etc., and who retired from the Defence Forces since 1 March 2012. </p></reply>

A public tender competition for the replacement of the CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft is underway in my Department at present, following the publication of a  Request for Proposals on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) in May 2018.  The cost of the aircraft will only be known once the tender competition is concluded.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the White Paper  also provides for the replacement of the current Air Corps Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft which will be equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR). Following an open tender competition, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd in December 2017 at a cost of some &euro;32m for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna fleet. It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The NDP provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period 2018 to 2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. The replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft and the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are among the projects included.</p></reply>

Despite the Bahraini Government stating its commitment to improving its human rights record, citizens in Bahrain are living in an increasingly restrictive society. In recent years there has been further erosion of fundamental freedoms, including freedom of opinion and expression. </p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. We continually advocate for the right of civil society actors and human rights defenders to operate in a safe environment, without fear of reprisal for speaking out. Ireland, as a small country, amplifies its voice on human rights issues through multilateral engagement and through measured recommendations offered as part of constructive dialogue. Ireland has repeatedly raised Bahraini issues at the UN Human Rights Council. </p>  <p>  For example, we have repeatedly highlighted concerns about the human rights situation in Bahrain as part of our Item 4 Statements ("human rights situations that require the Council&rsquo;s attention") over the last few years. Ireland has expressed concern about the treatment of human rights defenders and the shrinking of civil society space in Bahrain. At the last HRC Universal Periodic Review of Bahrain's human rights record in 2017, Ireland urged Bahrain to accept an open offer by the OHCHR to visit Bahrain. </p>  <p>  Ireland urges all states to safeguard the human rights of prisoners and detainees and is committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Our voice has been prominent in highlighting this thematic issue. HRC Resolution 36/16, which Ireland co-sponsored, calls upon states to &lsquo;investigate promptly, effectively and impartially all alleged human rights violations and abuses suffered by persons deprived of their liberty, in particular cases involving death, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to provide effective remedies to the victims, and to ensure that detention administrations cooperate fully with the investigating authority and preserve all evidence&rsquo;. Ireland has also co-sponsored thematic Resolutions in the Human Rights Council concerning human rights in the administration of justice; and concerning torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights. While Ireland has positive bilateral relations with Bahrain, this does not prevent us from raising our concerns through the appropriate channels. My Department has consistently raised issues of human rights in Bahrain directly with Bahraini officials, as well as at EU and international level, and we will continue to do so whenever opportunities arise.</p></reply>

There have been reports of further violence emerging from Rakhine State in recent weeks.</p>  <p>  In response, Ireland has sought to deploy political pressure with the aim of easing the crisis. We have done this through bilateral contacts in Myanmar, and through our membership of both the EU and UN. This included active support for the establishment of an Independent International Fact-Finding Mission (IIFFM) on Myanmar.</p>  <p>  The report of the Mission, which was published in August 2018, found that human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by members of the Burmese Military (Tatmadaw) and other security forces in Rakhine as well as in Kachin and Shan States. The IIFFM report also finds that there is sufficient evidence of crimes committed in Rakhine State being so grave that they warrant a competent court to determine the liability for the crime of genocide of those in the Tatmadaw chain of command. </p>  <p>  Ireland has worked closely with EU and UN partners to respond to this crisis and one of the key issues we have focused on so far is the issue of accountability. At the 39th Session of the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland actively supported the creation of a resolution on Myanmar which mandates a new impartial independent mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence of the most serious violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. This is an important step in facilitating fair and independent criminal proceedings for these crimes. We will continue to advocate for this mechanism including at the upcoming 40th Session of the UN Human Rights Council. </p>  <p>  Within the EU, Ireland has pressed for progress within Myanmar on these issues. The EU Foreign Affairs Council adopted Conclusions on Myanmar on 10 December 2018, which respond to the IIFFM report and call on Myanmar to hold those responsible for these crimes to account and to take meaningful action towards the creation of conditions conducive to a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of those displaced from Rakhine State to their places of origin. This new set of Conclusions builds on the earlier Council Conclusions on Myanmar of 26 February 2018, which provided for targeted restrictive measures against senior military officers of the Myanmar Security Forces responsible for these acts. </p>  <p>  Ireland has also provided direct funding of &euro;2.325 million since 2017 to the Rohingya crisis response, supporting vulnerable communities living in conflict-affected areas of Rakhine state and Rohingya refugee settlements in Bangladesh. Our support has focused on food, nutrition, shelter, water and sanitation. In addition, experts in water and sanitation and humanitarian coordination were deployed from Irish Aid&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps and 37 tonnes of Irish Aid pre-positioned emergency relief supplies were dispatched for distribution by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). Ireland has also provided substantial humanitarian support via the UN-administered Central Emergency Response Fund. </p>  <p>  It is clear that, ultimately, the long-standing drivers of conflict in Myanmar need to be addressed. In regard to Rakhine State, the IIFFM recognises that the implementation of the findings of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State (The Annan Commission) provides a roadmap for sustainable and community-led peacebuilding in Rakhine State, and for the development of impoverished regions there.  Ireland has strongly and repeatedly called for the full implementation of the Advisory Commission&rsquo;s findings and will continue to do so. Officials in my Department, including in the Embassy of Ireland in Thailand which is also accredited to Myanmar, will continue to monitor the situation.</p></reply>

This includes deepening our network by strengthening our presence in key existing locations, and opening new offices. This will enable us to leverage the opportunities to grow our trade and inward investment, to further strengthen political relationships with our partners and promote our values, and to support Irish citizens and our diaspora abroad. </p>  <p>  Work is advancing on the expansion and strengthening  of Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic network. Our new Embassy in Wellington, New Zealand, opened officially in August 2018. Since its opening the Embassy has been busy campaigning for Ireland&rsquo;s Security Council Campaign; has hosted a number of events to engage with the political and business community; and has successfully supported a number of high level bilateral visits. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s new Consulate General in Vancouver opened in October 2018 and has been working closely with the local business community, the Vancouver Chapter of the Ireland Canada Chamber of Commerce and the Irish Community in the region. </p>  <p>  An Embassy was established in Liberia in June 2018 (which replaced the Development Office in the country). This is an important first step in bolstering our existing political and economic connections in West Africa and seeking out new opportunities and links in the region.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, staff recently arrived on the ground in Bogot&aacute;, Amman, Mumbai and Santiago de Chile, and these Missions will officially open shortly. These new Missions will promote Ireland and Irish interests over the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period with each hosting a Ministerial visit. The next phase of expansion will focus on Cardiff, Los Angeles and Frankfurt in 2019, and Embassies in Kiev, Manila and Rabat shortly thereafter.</p>  <p>  Global Ireland also recognises the importance of reinforcing our existing network to enable us to better shape and influence international events in our interests.  At a time of considerable challenge for the European Union, I see it as imperative that we deepen our engagement with our EU partners.  That&rsquo;s why we are augmenting our Embassies in Rome and Madrid, Warsaw and The Hague, as we have already done in Paris and Berlin.  It will allow us to play a more active role in supporting and promoting a rules based international environment and will help us play our full role in addressing some of the global challenges that will impact us over the period ahead.</p></reply>

Reducing barriers to returning emigrants has important implications for national competitiveness; in a growing Irish economy facilitating the return of skills will be of importance in sustaining economic growth.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister of State for the Diaspora, Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, chairs the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Irish Abroad which works to ensure that Government works in a joined up way to realise the objectives of Ireland&rsquo;s Diaspora Policy, including addressing issues affecting the Irish abroad and those seeking to return.</p>  <p>  On foot of the work by the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Irish Abroad my Department commissioned an independent economic report on difficulties experienced by Irish people returning home. This report was completed in February 2018, considered by Government, and published on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website.</p>  <p>  Since the publication of the Indecon Economic Report on Addressing Challenges Faced by Returning Irish Emigrants, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has undertaken a number of steps, in conjunction with other Government Departments and State Agencies, to address the thirty recommendations made in the report. Most recently, Minister of State Cannon wrote to relevant Ministers in December 2018 seeking a further update on progress on their individual areas of responsibility, which will be addressed at the next IDC meeting on 21st February. </p>  <p>  My Department has already implemented several of the Indecon Report&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to information provision. An enhanced &lsquo;Returning to Ireland&rsquo; section containing more information and advice for returning emigrants has been developed for our dedicated diaspora website, the Global Irish Hub. Officials are working closely with the Citizen&rsquo;s Information Board to ensure that returning emigrants have the best information and advice possible to assist them in making the return back to Ireland.</p>  <p>  Currently, nineteen of the total thirty recommendations have been addressed. Departments are aware of further action to be taken in respect of 6 recommendations. The remaining 5 recommendations are being partially implemented, or are being considered as part of a wider issue rather than in the context of the recommendation alone. </p>  <p>  All responses made in respect of these recommendations will inform a further Memorandum to Government, and will, at the request of Government, provide an update on the progress made since the publication of the Indecon Report.</p></reply>

Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. The Assad regime and its allies have repeatedly targeted civilians, through deliberate attacks, including chemical attacks, on civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals and schools, the use of &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; techniques and the denial of humanitarian assistance, and forced displacement in the interest of demographic engineering. Other groups, most notably ISIS, have also perpetrated atrocities.</p>  <p>  The situation in Syria remains grave, and there are particular fears with regards to the situation in Idleb, where conflict between the regime and opposition groups is continuing and could escalate; and in north-east Syria, where tensions between Kurdish groups and Turkey are rising. ISIS has yet to be fully defeated, and vigilance is needed to ensure that it does not re-emerge. I remain deeply concerned about the wellbeing of the Syrian people, both those inside Syria, including those who continue to suffer under an oppressive and murderous Government, as well as those in neighbouring countries, who are watching anxiously to see whether conditions will develop which will allow them to return home. Humanitarian needs remain extensive, and a major donor conference will take place in Brussels next month to discuss how these can be addressed. </p>  <p>  Those with influence on the Syrian regime have a responsibility to exert pressure to ensure that civilians are protected, and to encourage the Syrian Government to engage fully with the UN-led peace process. </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU firmly believe that nearly eight years of war have shown that military action cannot bring lasting peace to Syria. We strongly support the UN-led efforts to bring about a political resolution to the conflict, in accordance with the 2012 Geneva Communiqu&eacute; and UN Security Council Resolution 2254. These parameters make it clear that this needs to be a Syrian-owned and Syrian-led process. The EU provides direct assistance to the Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground.</p>  <p>  The UN Special Envoy&rsquo;s efforts are currently focused on establishing a constitutional committee, made up of Syrians of different political views, to chart the way forward for the country. The UN Special Envoy has been engaging directly with Russia, Turkey and Iran on this, and we believe that they have a responsibility to support and assist his efforts.</p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers met with former UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, in the margins of the 2018 UN General Assembly, and the EU will continue engagement with the new UN Special Envoy Geir Pedersen, who took up his position at the end of 2018. At the recent EU-League of Arab States Ministerial meeting on 4 February, I raised the ongoing conflict in Syria with my EU and Arab counterparts. The tragedy in Syria will remain on the agenda for EU Foreign Ministers, and the Brussels conference next month will give the EU an opportunity to set out our plans to support the Syrian people.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong and consistent donor to the Syria crisis response and our overall funding supports those in need inside Syria as well as Syrian refugees and vulnerable host communities in the region, including Jordan. At the 2018 Brussels Donor conference, Ireland pledged to contribute a further &euro;25 million in 2018, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance in response to the Syria crisis to over &euro;116 million since 2012. This is our largest response to any single crisis and a clear indication of our concern for Syria and its people. Through its annual contributions to the EU Institutions, Ireland also supports the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Syria. </p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to reiterate my unreserved condemnation of the violence perpetrated against civilians that has characterised the Syrian conflict to date, most notably by the Government and its allies, and the appalling acts committed by ISIS. </p></reply>

I am appalled by the suffering which the innocent people caught up in these events have endured, especially women and girls who were the targets of sexual and gender-based violence. While the situation has improved with a successful fight back against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, challenges remain in terms of healing the trauma victims have endured, ensuring humanitarian aid reaches them, and ensuring displaced populations can return to their homelands once it is safe to do so. </p><p>In September 2015, Ireland addressed the UN Human Rights Council on the topic of a report by the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria, which concluded that ISIS had committed the crime of genocide against the Yazidis. In our statement, we noted that the Human Rights Council<i></i>and the membership of the United Nations<i></i>have <i>&quot;an inarguable duty to end these crimes and work to achieve justice and accountability for the victims&rdquo;.</i></p><p><i></i>I regard the report of the Commission of Inquiry and its findings of genocide as authoritative. However, the responsibility for a legal determination of the crime of genocide is a matter for a legally competent and internationally recognised court. These atrocities took place in both Syria and Iraq and reported crimes in both States need to be investigated and prosecuted. </p><p>In this regard, I welcomed the UN Security Council Resolution of September 2017 requesting the creation of an independent investigative team to help to hold ISIS accountable for its actions in Iraq. The resulting body, known as UNITAD, has now been established, and is currently focusing on a number of core activities, such as the collection of existing evidence, conducting field-based investigations, and preserving evidence of acts that may amount to genocide and other grave crimes committed by ISIS in Iraq. Ireland fully supports the efforts of UN Special Adviser and Head of UNITAD, Karim Asad Ahmad Khan, in helping to bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice. </p><p>Ireland is of course a substantial humanitarian donor in Syria, having contributed over &euro;116 million in funding since 2012. And Ireland has provided over &euro;9.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq since 2012, including &euro;2 million to the UN Iraq Humanitarian Fund (IHF) in 2018. The Fund is managed by UN OCHA, and provides emergency assistance to those affected by conflict and displacement, including the Yazidi. In addition, Ireland contributes to the humanitarian response in Iraq via our contributions to the EU budget. The EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response provided over &euro;40 million to Iraq in 2018.  This funding is for a wide range of interventions targeted at the most vulnerable parts of Iraqi society. Last year this included assistance of &euro;5 million towards emergency reproductive and mental health care for victims of violence. </p><p>Last week, officials from my Department met with an NGO which advocates on behalf of the Yazidi people to discuss the current challenges their community faces in Iraq and internationally, including the issue of justice and accountability for the terrible crimes that have been perpetrated against them. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. </p></reply>

For this reason, as roster members are being trained, the Department is seeking the consent of individual roster members to allow us to disclose the list of names of the new roster by way of a response to a Parliamentary Question. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  Data regarding the age or place of residence of members of the new roster has not been captured for statistical analysis. For insurance purposes, as roster members complete security vetting the Department will be capturing the age profile of the new roster. When this process is complete, the Department will consider the information which can be provided regarding the demographics of the new roster, subject of course to the GDPR. While security vetting is on-going, based on the shortlisted candidates, slightly more than half of the new roster were not members of the last roster. With almost twice as many applications to available roster places, the intense competition will ensure that the quality of Ireland's election observation nominations remains high.</p></reply>

We provide non-earmarked core funding to the agency on an annual basis and intend to continue this in 2019.</p>  <p>  Between 1990 and 2015, maternal mortality was reduced by 44%, yet approximately 830 women die each day from preventable causes related to maternal and child health. Virtually all maternal deaths occur in developing countries; more than half of maternal deaths occur in fragile and humanitarian settings. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) works in development and humanitarian contexts to deliver lifesaving sexual and reproductive health services in order to respond to the impacts of poverty, inequality, and humanitarian emergencies. </p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department provided &euro;3,500,000 to UNFPA, an increase of &euro;700,000 on our 2017 core contribution. As the T&aacute;naiste outlined in his speech at the launch of the UNFPA&rsquo;s State of the World Population Report in October 2018, Ireland is proud to be a consistent supporter of UNFPA. Since 2006 we have provided funding of around &euro;55 million to the Population Fund, the majority of which is core funding. Ireland values the important work of UNFPA and is committed to core funding on the principle that this allows the agency to set their priorities and plan according to need which is, we believe, critical to the on-the-ground delivery of results in complex contexts.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is not currently providing additional funding to the UNFPA&rsquo;s Humanitarian Appeal and no decision to fund this specific programme in 2019 has been taken to date.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-12a.249.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021200059#WRE05800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 149 together.</p>  <p>  At the outset it is important to note that as Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation.  Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of drivers or vehicles.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the difficulties faced by returning emigrants in respect of motor insurance are being addressed as part of the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s ongoing implementation of its recommendations.  The Deputy may be aware that in fulfilment of one of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations, a protocol was agreed between Insurance Ireland and the Department of Finance under which insurance companies committed to accepting the driving experience returning emigrants gained while abroad, when the driver has had previous driving experience in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The guiding principle of the protocol is to ensure that a returning emigrant is not treated differently to any other driver, subject to verification of their continued driving experience and the normal acceptance criteria of the company.  Thus, a returning emigrant will not be disadvantaged from spending that time abroad.  Furthermore, under the protocol, insurance companies will not distinguish between countries on the basis of which side of the road driving takes place therein.</p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland submitted a report on the implementation of this recommendation to the Department in December 2017.  This report confirmed that Insurance Ireland members have agreed to publish the wording of the agreed protocol on their company websites and other forms of social media, in addition to providing training for staff who can work through issues with emigrants before they leave, whilst they are out of the country and when they return to Ireland.  The stated intention is &ldquo;to resolve any issues well before they arise and for the consumer to be aware of the considerations when moving abroad&rdquo;.  The wording of the agreed protocol is also available on the Insurance Ireland website.  Following a review by the Department, insurers have been asked to ensure this information is displayed more prominently on their websites to ensure that it is accessible and visible for consumers.  The Department will continue to monitor this situation.</p>  <p>  The December 2017 report from Insurance Ireland also outlined some sample cases which demonstrate how the rolling-out of the protocol has already led to disputed cases being resolved to the benefit of returning emigrants, and provided figures indicating that the number of such cases being processed under the Declined Cases Agreement had been decreasing, a pattern which has endured since.  The next report on the operation of the DCA, outlining the figures for 2018, is due to be submitted to my Department in this quarter.  My officials will examine the breakdown of the number of cases in the report to determine if the downward trend is continuing and I will continue to monitor the implementation of the recommendation through my Department&rsquo;s regular engagement with Insurance Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The Minister for the Diaspora and International Development, Mr Ciar&aacute;n Cannon TD, has undertaken some further work in this area, through the Interdepartmental Committee on the Irish Abroad.  This has included highlighting each individual motor insurance operator&rsquo;s overall policy in respect of returning emigrants.  The insurers which responded positively in relation to providing cover for this category are listed on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website.  These insurers have also indicated that they do, in one way or another, take into account claims-free driving experience earned abroad.  </p>  <p>  It is important to highlight that if a returning emigrant believes that they have received a high quote due to an insurance provider not accepting driving experience gained while abroad, they should contact the free Insurance Information Service operated by Insurance Ireland, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu or 01-6761820. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am hopeful that the continued implementation of all the recommendations from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance &ndash; in addition to those in the CIWG&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance and the two reports of the Personal Injuries Commission &ndash; can help to maintain and expand the positive trend which has seen private motor insurance premiums decrease by 22.16% over the last two-and-a-half years.</p></reply>

It is too early to draw any conclusions on the impact of these increases.</p>  <p>  I have sympathy for small bookmakers who may have ongoing difficulties competing with large retail and online bookmakers.  However, I could not apply the increase in betting duty to some bookmakers and not others.  Ultimately many taxes on goods or services are passed through to the end consumers and bookmakers will need to make commercial decisions on such matters.</p>  <p>  The Deputies will appreciate that decisions in relation to betting duty need to reflect broader public interest considerations.  Receipts from betting duty represented less than 1 per cent of all excise receipts in 2017 and this is also likely to be the case in for 2018.  In addition, unlike other excisable commodities, there is no VAT applied on betting transactions.  I have outlined why I consider the betting sector needs to make a fair contribution to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  In any discussion on betting duty, we must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society.  While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers.  Recent research published by the UK Gambling Commission and others provide an indicative list of these social costs, including loss of employment, experience of bankruptcy and/or debt, loss of housing/homelessness, crime associated with gambling, relationship breakdown/problems and health-related problems.</p>  <p>  I have outlined my view that the social costs of problem gambling needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.</p>  <p>  During the course of the Finance Bill process I agreed to review an alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector following the announcement of increases in betting duty in Budget 2019.  My officials are currently considering this proposal, including the compatibility of a core element with EU rules, and will set out analysis and options in relation to betting duty at the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) meeting in July.  The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards. </p></reply>

I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the recommendation was implemented at the end of 2018 through Section 13(2) of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018, which provides for the amendments to Section 8 of the 2004 Act.  This was signed by the President on 28 December 2018 and the Act was commenced in full on 28 January 2019.  This will be reflected in the Cost of Insurance Working Group&rsquo;s next update report, due to be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  By way of further information to the Deputy, the amendment to Section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 deals with the letter of claim and the potential consequences of a failure to serve a notice in writing on the alleged wrongdoer within a prescribed period from the date of the cause of action, which was previously two months.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group took the view that Section 8 should be amended to enhance the effectiveness of this statutory requirement.</p>  <p>  The key aim of the amendment is to reduce the notification period for the serving of a letter of claim from two months to one month.  Its rationale is to align the time period with data protection legislation which provides that data shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is obtained &ndash; generally no more than one month.  However an exception to this rule is where information or CCTV footage is held in the context of an investigation such as a personal injuries claim.  Consequently by requiring a plaintiff to notify a defendant within one month of an alleged incident under Section 8, the defendant is being given the opportunity to identify within the data protection time limits any relevant CCTV footage they may have of the incident, and keep it beyond the one month period for investigation purposes where they believe the claim is questionable.  This earlier notification period will also help a defendant prepare their defence in a range of other ways such as being able to put together more accurate employee witness statements where this is relevant.  In addition, the Working Group believed that the previous wording of Section 8 needed to be strengthened in order to ensure it was used more effectively by the Courts.  In this regard, the amendment means that instead of a court having the option to draw inferences from the failure to serve a letter of claim on the alleged wrongdoer within the prescribed period of time though the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, that it should be required to do so as a matter of course through the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The amendment to Section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 is seen as very important for small and medium businesses in particular, as when implemented they should make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected.  I might add that the amendment of Section 14 of the same Act to allow for the court to draw inferences from non-compliance with the requirement to lodge a verifying affidavit within 21 days after the lodgement of the service of the pleading concerned, as recommended in Recommendation 14 of the Report on the cost of employer and public liability, was also provided for within the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018.  This means that both Recommendations 6 and 14 have both been fully implemented and I believe these amendments form important steps in the reform of the overall personal injuries framework.</p></reply>

The banks&rsquo; independence is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents which I as Minister, cannot change unilaterally.  These frameworks which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.</p>  <p>  That being said officials in my department received the following response from AIB:</p>  <p>  "AIB Mortgage customer contracts, since 16/02/09, when LTV mortgages were introduced, state customers are not permitted to move down LTV bands when the LTV on their property reduces.</p>  <p>  The approach in EBS and Haven is the same. Where property prices reduce and LTVs increase, we do not move customers to a higher LTV band and these circumstances occur usually at a time customers could least afford a rate increase, such as the period 2007 through to 2012.</p>  <p>  "In 2018, as part of an enhancement to our Mortgage Proposition, AIB, including EBS and Haven, took the decision to change its policy and waive its right not to permit downward LTV band movement during the mortgage life cycle.  LTV band movement is, however, subject to a customer providing a supporting up-to-date valuation from a panel valuer and the customer requesting the change.  To be clear, the Bank will not move customers up to a higher LTV band in the event of a fall in house prices."</p>  <p>  "Prior to this policy change LTV Band movement was permitted in limited circumstances for customers with LTV Mortgages.  However, it is important to note that AIB mortgage customers who originated on an SVR Mortgage have always been permitted to move to a LTV Band, subject to the provision of a supporting valuation from an approved panel valuer, and they are advised of this capability annually in their mortgage statement."</p>  <p>  "The required changes to facilitate the revised policy were put in place in 2018 and it took effect in AIB on December 17th 2018 and in EBS/Haven on January 1st 2019.  All AIB variable rate customers were advised of the change in their annual mortgage statement sent in January. EBS variable rate customers will be advised in their annual statements in February with Haven customers advised in early March.

Under the MVR model,  the rate of interest which applies to a variable rate mortgage is linked to the LTV of the mortgage at the time of application.  Mortgages with a lower LTV ratio enjoy lower rates of interest than mortgages with a higher LTV."</p>  <p>  "The MVR model is not dynamic in respect of LTVs.  The rate of interest is variable and the LTV is calculated at the time of application only."</p>  <p>  "Based on current rates and depending on the LTV of the relevant mortgage, the MVR offers a saving of between 0.20% and 0.80% on the headline rate of interest charged to customers compared to the Standard Variable Rate."</p>  <p>  "Existing customers of Permanent TSB are eligible to apply to move to an MVR mortgage.  This allows them to take advantage of any decrease in the LTV of their mortgage since it commenced.  This extends to customers currently on an SVR mortgage, customers who had taken out an MVR prior to 2015 and customers on Fixed Rates subject to the normal terms and conditions that apply."</p>  <p>  "Since 2015, Permanent TSB has written to existing eligible customers on a number of occasions to make them aware of the MVR model, to advise them of their options to apply to move to MVR and to explain the steps to be taken to do so.  While a valuation of the property is required, Permanent TSB offers customers a voucher to pay for such a valuation.  To date approximately 30% of eligible customers have moved to the MVR model."</p></reply>

When published, the next quarterly Progress Update will thus update the information supplied in response to a recent Parliamentary Question submitted by the Deputy (4215/19).</p>  <p>  At this juncture, I would just like to highlight some relevant recent legislative developments since the last quarterly Progress Update was released. </p>  <p>  The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 has completed its passage through the D&aacute;il and is before Second Stage in the Seanad today (12 February).  Once enacted, this will strengthen PIAB by addressing operational issues to ensure greater compliance with the PIAB process and encourage more claims to be settled through the PIAB model.  In particular, the Bill deals with the issues of non-attendance at medicals and failure to provide details of special damages or loss of earnings.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Ireland published the Non-Life Insurance (Provision of Information) (Renewal of Policy of Insurance) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 in December, which will improve the level of premium information available to consumers as well as extending the renewal notification period.</p>  <p>  And, perhaps most notably, the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act was commenced on 28 January.  The aim of the database is to improve the level of transparency and the availability of information in the insurance sector by facilitating a more in-depth analysis of annual trends in motor insurance claims. </p>  <p>  More details in respect of these pieces of legislation will be included in the eighth Progress Update, which will be available on the Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am hopeful that the continued implementation of all the recommendations from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance &ndash; in addition to those in the CIWG&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance and the two reports of the Personal Injuries Commission &ndash; can help to maintain and expand the positive trend which has seen private motor insurance premiums decrease by 22.16% over the last two-and-a-half years.</p></reply>

This assessment will in many cases include insurers own presumptions based on their private modelling and research. Consequently, neither the Government nor the Central Bank can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.  This in turn should lead to the increased availability of flood insurance. To achieve this aim, there is a focus on: </p>  <p>  - prioritising spending on flood relief measures by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and relevant local authorities;  </p>  <p>  - development and implementation of plans by the OPW to implement flood relief schemes; and, </p>  <p>  - ongoing communication  between the OPW and the insurance industry, in order to reach a better understanding about the provision of flood cover in marginal areas.</p>  <p>  The above approach is complemented by a Memorandum of Understanding between the OPW and Insurance Ireland, which provides for the exchange of data in relation to completed flood defence schemes which should provide a basis for the increased provision of flood insurance in areas where works have been completed.  In this regard, the Insurance Ireland/OPW working group, which the Department of Finance attends, now meets on a quarterly basis to support the information flow and improve the understanding of issues between both parties.</p>  <p>  In order to improve the quality of the data and to get a greater idea of the impact of any new flood defence scheme, the OPW and the Department of Finance are currently working with the insurance industry to measure baseline flood cover ahead of schemes being completed.  This aims to provide a &lsquo;before&rsquo; and &lsquo;after&rsquo; of flood insurance cover for each community to be protected in the future.  The OPW has advised me that data relating to four schemes has been provided to Insurance Ireland, to pilot the comparative analysis of the levels of flood cover before and after schemes have been completed.</p>  <p>  Finally, since agreement of the Memorandum of Understanding in 2014, the OPW has provided data on 18 completed flood defence schemes, to the insurance industry.  Insurance Ireland has informed me that the most recent Insurance Ireland survey indicates that of the completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while 75% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences include flood cover.  Taken together, 82% of policies in the areas benefitting from these flood defences included flood cover in 2017.</p></reply>

They have pointed out that property insurance policies cover a range of perils such as fire, storm, theft, water damage, and it is not possible to isolate the number of burst pipes, fluvial or coastal flooding claim figures.  They have however  collated some general data on severe weather events (storm and flood) in an aggregated form.  According to their latest data, the aggregate cost to insurers of adverse weather events for the period 2013-May 2018 is approximately &euro;311 million.</p>  <p>  Additionally, Insurance Ireland has advised that they do not collect data relating to claims information or underwriting decisions of members, including instances of flood victims being denied flood insurance post a claim.</p>  <p>  Government policy in relation to flooding as the Deputy is aware is focused on the development of a sustainable, planned and risk-based approach to dealing with flooding problems.

In addition, individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance or believe that they are being treated unfairly may contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-12a.301.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021200060#WRF04600"><p>The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EC), which entered into force 1 January 2016, sets out new, more comprehensive EU-wide requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers.  It was transposed into Irish law via the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (S.I. No. 485 of 2015). </p>  <p>  Solvency II represents a significant change to the regulatory framework for insurance and introduced for the first time a harmonised regime for insurance regulation across the EU.  It has brought a number of significant changes for the insurance industry, including better alignment of capital to risks, better risk management and governance and increased transparency.  Since its entry into force on 1 January 2016, Member States, EIOPA and national supervisory authorities are working towards greater consistency in the application of these new standards across the EU.  This should mean that, over time, insurers are better regulated thus reducing the possibility of consumer loss or market disruption.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure it remains fit for purpose, Solvency II will be subject to a review in 2020 which will provide an opportunity to adapt the regime in light of changes in market conditions and insurer business models.</p>  <p>  The provision of cross-border insurance is an essential part of the Single Market and Ireland in particular is a beneficiary of this regime through its significant cross-border life industry.  However, it is acknowledged that there are obvious difficulties which arise when an insurer fails, as we have seen in this country over the last number of years.  That said however, it is important to point out that Solvency II is not a 'no-failure' regime as it would not be possible to build a viable system that provides a cast iron guarantee that no insurer would ever fail.  Any such regime would require very large capital requirements which would be likely to make insurance prohibitively expensive.</p>  <p>  Consequently, I believe it is important that EU supervisors properly and consistently supervise the insurers that they authorise, and that there is greater communication between supervisors across the EU about their respective companies conducting cross-border business.  The Deputy should also be aware that as part of the ongoing review of the European supervisory architecture, there is a proposal to further improve cross-border co-operation and communication through the strengthening of Cross-Border Collaboration Platforms.  These already operate on an ad-hoc basis, however this proposal would ensure a more formal structure is put in place where an insurer is doing a lot of cross-border business.  This would therefore give the supervisors of countries into which insurance is written a greater insight into how the business is being conducted.</p>  <p>  Finally, whilst currently in the event of failure of an insurer there is no harmonised insurance guarantee regime nor a recovery and resolution or guarantee schemes across the EU, there have been a number of reports and initiatives in this area in recent years including a recent EIOPA opinion and project work. In addition, there is a proposed amendment to the Motor Insurance Directive which would oblige member states to set up Insurance Guarantee Schemes to cover the cost of insolvent motor insurers including any cross-border business they conduct.  If progress can be made on these proposals, it is likely over time to provide a greater level of protection to policyholders and claimants in the event of a failure of an insurance company.</p></reply>

In accordance with the EU VAT Directive, Irish legislation provides for an exemption from VAT for professional medical care services recognised as such by the Department of Health and Children.   </p>  <p>  Those medical care services are generally supplied by health professionals who are enrolled, registered, regulated, or designated on the appropriate statutory register provided for under the relevant legislation in force in the State or equivalent legislation applicable in other countries. Medical care services may also be supplied by a doctor to a patient through an incorporated entity. In general, such services, which normally consist of the diagnosing, treating or alleviating an ailment, are exempt from VAT.</p>  <p>  However, some services offered by providers in the medical services sector are not exempt. For example, where a service provider has contracted with another person to be available to treat patients, the provision of this service is subject to VAT at the standard rate. The Revenue Commissioners regards this service as constituting a supply of the service of the provision of staff, which is subject to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners has commenced a project to review the tax affairs of medical locums who have incorporated a business and are employed by Personal Service Companies (PSCs) or Managed Service Companies (MSCs). The review to date has focussed on the tax affairs of a number of such companies, and their directors, where the main source of income is a contract for the provision of medical services through an intermediary and where, in most cases, the directors are the only employees of the company. A number of tax compliance interventions have commenced in respect of companies and directors operating in the medical locum sector, and further interventions will be initiated in the weeks and months ahead.

Natural gas that is supplied to consumers for non-propellant fuel use, such as for heating, is subject to Natural Gas Carbon Tax (NGCT). The current rate of NGCT is &euro;4.10 per megawatt hour.  Suppliers of natural gas for non-propellant use are liable to account for and pay NGCT and must register with Revenue in advance of making supplies to consumers. </p>  <p>  Natural gas supplied for use as a propellant, referred to as &ldquo;vehicle gas&rdquo; or Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), is subject to Mineral Oil Tax on Vehicle Gas (MOTVG). MOTVG is provided for by Section 38 of the Finance Act 2016. These legislative provisions were introduced to provide a framework for taxation of vehicle gas in advance of the development of nationwide infrastructure for compressed natural gas filling stations. </p>  <p>  The current rate of MOTVG is &euro;9.36 per megawatt hour. This includes both a carbon charge of &euro;3.70 and a non-carbon charge of &euro;5.66. Liability to MOTVG arises when vehicle gas is supplied to a vehicle fuelling facility. The supplier who supplies the vehicle fuelling facility is liable to account for and pay MOTVG and must register with Revenue. </p>  <p>  Under MOTVG legislation vehicle gas suppliers are obliged to only supply vehicle gas to vehicle fuelling facilities that have specialised meters fitted by the Transmission System Operator (Gas Networks Ireland). These meters must exclusively serve as the measuring and recording mechanisms for vehicle gas supplied to vehicle fuelling stations. In addition to these control mechanisms, MOTVG legislation also prevents vehicle fuelling stations from receiving vehicle gas from a supplier unless the station has been fitted with specialised meters and all vehicle fuel received at the station is measured and recorded by the meter fitted for that exclusive purpose. In this way there are strict controls in place for both the supply and receipt of vehicle gas. </p>  <p>  The controls that are in place in relation to mineral oils, such as marking of reduced rate oils, are not applicable to natural gas. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Mineral Oil Tax Regulations governing the blending of fuel oils are not applicable to blending of natural gas with, for example, biogas. Marking and blending statutory provisions similar to those that apply for mineral oils are unwarranted for natural gas that is supplied through the natural gas network by a limited number of suppliers. </p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that legislative provisions for NGCT and for MOTVG are robust. They will continue to monitor the situation as the Compressed Natural Gas market expands and will focus audit and compliance interventions on risk areas should they emerge.  It is also open to the Deputy to make direct contact with Revenue if he wishes to seek further information or advise of any specific concern he may wish to raise in this area.</p></reply>

It is too early to draw any conclusions on the impact of these increases. </p>  <p>  Receipts from betting duty represented less than 1 per cent of all excise receipts in 2017 and this is also likely to be the case in for 2018. In addition, unlike other excisable commodities, there is no VAT applied on betting transactions. I have outlined why I consider the betting sector needs to make a fair contribution to the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  In any discussion on betting duty, we must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers. I have outlined my view that this needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime.   </p>  <p>  During the course of the Finance Bill process I agreed to review an alternative proposal put forward by the betting sector following the announcement of increases in betting duty in Budget 2019, and I acknowledge that small independent bookmakers may have difficulty competing with larger bookmakers with retail and/or online operations. My officials are currently considering this proposal, including the compatibility of a core element with EU rules, and will set out analysis and options in relation to betting duty at the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) meeting in July. The TSG Papers will be published on the Department's website shortly afterwards.</p></reply>

I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland does not routinely collect the type of information being sought either.  </p>  <p>  While the Deputy&rsquo;s query relates to insurance claims generally, I note that the Central Bank of Ireland does collect certain relevant data in relation to motor insurance claims specifically. In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to a Parliamentary Question which I responded to him on, on 24 July 2018 which detailed information provided to me by the Central Bank of Ireland at that time in respect of the amount paid out on motor insurance claims in the years 2013 &ndash; 2017. The updated data for 2018 is not available yet. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Oireachtas recently passed the legislation to provide relevant powers to the Central Bank of Ireland to establish the National Claims Information Database. The Deputy may like to note that the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 was commenced by the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 (Commencement) Order 2019 (S.I. 2 of 2019) on Monday 28 January 2019.  The Central Bank plans to collect claims data for the National Claims Information Database from insurance undertakings in the first half of 2019, with a view to publishing its first annual report under the legislation in the second half of the year. It is expected that the Central Bank will collect and publish motor insurance claims information in respect of the last 10 years, including the number of claims reported and settled, the amounts paid on claims, the incurred cost on claims (i.e. the amount paid plus the outstanding amount to be paid, if any), and the actuarial estimate of the final cost of claims i.e. ultimate costs.  </p>  <p>  While the National Claims Information Database will focus on private motor insurance initially, the underpinning legislation has been developed in such a way as to allow its scope to increase over time. In this regard, the Cost of Insurance Working Group recommended in its Report on the Cost of Employer liability and Public liability Insurance that by the end of this year, the Central Bank produce a report on the merits and feasibility of collecting employer liability and public liability insurance data for inclusion in the National Claims Information Database.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that my Department, in line with their Guidelines for Tax Expenditure Evaluation, carried out a 3-year cost benefit analysis of the film corporation tax credit during 2018.  That analysis found that the net economic cost to society, the cost of the cultural dividend of the scheme, was &euro;72m for 2016.   </p>  <p>  Since 2015 the film corporation tax credit, which is a notified and approved State Aid, has operated on the basis of companies submitting a film budget to Revenue.  Based on the anticipated expenditure in Ireland set out in that budget, Revenue will issue a certificate for a maximum interim corporation tax credit and the company amends its corporation tax return and claims a payment of that amount.  Once the film is completed, the company submits details of the actual amounts spent on making the film in Ireland.  Revenue must review the details of the actual expenditure and will issue a final certificate.  Upon receiving that certificate, the company amends its corporation tax return and claims a payment of the balance over any interim credit claims.</p>  <p>  I was advised by Revenue in 2018 that there was an issue with the design of the scheme for Film Relief. The scheme requires upfront certification by Revenue which, means that the normal tools to discourage incorrect claims (being interest, penalties, publication and prosecution) are not available.  Accordingly, a considerable amount of Revenue time is being taken up addressing incorrect claims. Revenue has informed me that there has often been protracted correspondence with claimant companies who do not have sufficient records to support their claims, and this in turn leads to inevitable delays.</p>  <p>  The level of Revenue examination of these applications must match the risk to the Exchequer given the rising cost of the credit, with the tax credit value of applications received in 2018 alone totalling &euro;95 million. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in Finance Act 2018, I brought forward changes to the way in which companies claim the film corporation tax credit to address these two difficulties.  Those changes, once commenced, will put all claims on a self-assessment footing, with companies&rsquo; compliance assessed by Revenue in the same way as compliance with all other tax reliefs.  Revenue is bringing forward the Regulations which are necessary to support the Finance Act 2018 amendments.  Those Regulations must be made with the consent of both myself and my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and I understand that officials in both departments are currently reviewing the proposed regulations.

Projections beyond this point are not available. Similarly, projections for general government revenue and expenditure for Ireland beyond 2023 have not been compiled by my Department. </p>  <p>  As I have outlined previously, GDP figures for Ireland are distorted and of limited use. Instead, modified GNI, or GNI*, an alternative metric published by the CSO, provides a more appropriate analogue for international comparison. </p>  <p>  General government revenue for the EU-15 as of 2017 was 45.3 per cent of GDP. To increase Ireland&rsquo;s general government revenue to an equivalent 45.3 per cent of GNI* would amount to an average of an additional &euro;10.8 billion in revenue each year, until 2023 (assuming that nominal GNI* moves in line with the Budget day projections). </p>  <p>  In a similar manner, general government expenditure for the EU-15 as of 2017 was 46.3 per cent of GDP (hence the deficit for the EU-15 was 1 per cent of GDP). An equivalent 46.3 per cent of GNI* would imply an average expenditure increase of &euro;16.2 billion each year to 2023. </p>  <p>  In both cases this is in addition to the current plans as set out in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook published in Budget 2019. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is committed to investment that improves the sustainability of our public finances and our economic capacity. Under the National Development Plan, Ireland&rsquo;s planned public capital investment will reach approximately 4 per cent of GNI* by 2023, among the highest in the EU. An average level of 4 per cent of GNI* is expected to be maintained out to 2027. </p>  <p>  This substantial growth in public investment will meet the needs of the economy and remain consistent with the requirements of overall economic and fiscal sustainability. </p>  <p>  However, aiming to increase general government revenue and expenditure by such significant amounts so as to equate with overall EU rates would be inappropriate. Government fiscal policy is guided by what is right for the economy at this point in the cycle, not by arbitrary benchmarks based on the overall budgetary patterns of fifteen countries with disparate fiscal and economic situations.</p></reply>

This work is supplemented by Revenue's Customs Drug Watch Programme, aimed at encouraging members of the public, coastal and local maritime communities  to notify Revenue of suspect or unusual movements at sea or around the coast by way of a confidential 24/7 Drugs Watch, free phone facility.</p><p>Revenue is active in targeting and combatting drugs smuggling and is fully committed to tackling this criminal activity and those responsible for it. I am advised by Revenue that it has an enforcement presence at all key airports and ports and at other strategic locations and that it places particular emphasis on developing an intelligence-based focus at both national and regional level, deploying resources to areas of highest risk. Enforcement strength at particular locations is regularly augmented with additional personnel on a risk-assessment basis, or when particular operations are taking place against illegal activity.</p><p>Revenue works closely with other agencies in the State, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, in acting against the illegal drugs trade, and plays a key role as well in the implementation of aspects of the National Drugs Strategy. The relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to target organised crime groups that are involved in a range of criminal activities, including the illegal drugs trade.  I understand that this work to tackle cross-jurisdictional organised crime is being supported and reinforced by the establishment, in the framework of &ldquo;A Fresh Start: The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan&rdquo;, of the Joint Agency Task Force, which includes Revenue. In addition, Revenue is involved actively in international fora, including the EU&rsquo;s Customs Cooperation Working Party, Europol and the World Customs Organisation, in working together with other administrations, agencies and services to counter the trafficking of drugs and drugs precursors.</p></reply>

The Government&rsquo;s strategy is that in return to its investment on flood defence schemes in the most at risk communities, households and businesses should be able to access flood insurance. </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has a very specific role in the exchange of information with the insurance industry in relation to completed flood defence schemes, to an agreed standard of protection desired by the industry. </p>  <p>  A Memorandum of Understanding agreed on 24 March 2014, between the Office of Public Works and Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance companies in Ireland has a specific focus on agreeing a basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on flood relief schemes completed by the OPW.  </p>  <p>   The Memorandum came into effect on 1 June, 2014 with an initial tranche of data provided by the Office of Public Works to Insurance Ireland in respect of twelve completed flood defence schemes; showing the design, extent and nature of the protections offered by these works.  Details of a further five schemes were provided in January 2015 and details of the Waterford Flood Defence Scheme was provided in 2017. </p>  <p>  Since that time the level of flood insurance cover for homes and small businesses for areas protected by OPW flood defence schemes has on average increased from 77% to 82% with the level of flood insurance cover reported to be up to 90% in areas benefitting from fixed defences. </p>  <p>  The Department of Finance and the OPW meet with Insurance Ireland to address issues in relation to this transfer of data. The OPW and the Department of Finance are currently working with the insurance sector to baseline flood cover ahead of schemes being completed.  This aims to provide a &lsquo;before&rsquo; and &lsquo;after&rsquo; of flood insurance cover for communities  being protected in the future; and give a baseline to be able to address any concerns about the levels of cover being reported.  In 2018, data relating to four schemes has been provided to Insurance Ireland, as the first set of data to pilot a comparative analysis of the levels of flood cover before and after schemes have been completed.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that while the Memorandum requires that insurers take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed flood defence schemes, it does not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations for which information has been provided by the OPW.  The provision of insurance cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers.  </p></reply>

Following on from that decision, my Department has been engaging with the Department of Health and with other Departments in relation to how the increased costs of the National Children's Hospital project in 2019 will be managed within the overall agreed capital allocation for 2019, in light of the multi-year management of the broad range of capital projects, amounting to upwards of &euro;7 billion this year.  </p>  <p>  As this process is ongoing, the effect of the decision could not be included in the revised estimates 2019, which was published on 19 December 2018.</p>  <p>  I am bringing proposals to Government in this regard and decisions will be announced in due course.  The overall intention is to proceed with our very ambitious agenda of strategic infrastructure investment throughout the course of 2019 and subsequent years, with the minimum of disruption to the rollout and delivery of key projects.  Any reallocations will be published in further revised estimates for 2019 for relevant Departments, in due course.</p></reply>

Access to the Island is highly variable due to weather and sea conditions and may not be feasible until later than the generally scheduled opening. </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has repeatedly stated that to extend the visitor season at the Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l site beyond these dates would create unacceptable safety, logistical and operational difficulties for the maintenance and guide operation in the first instance and might also create a greater risk to the fragile built and natural heritage for which the Island is famous.  Ensuring the greatest level of visitor and staff safety, at a location where there has been two fatalities in recent years, is of paramount importance during the visitor season.  Necessary safety preparations are undertaken on site by OPW staff each year prior to the admittance of visitors to the island.  It should also be noted that OPW previously extended the season to the end of October on a three year trial basis from 2011 to 2013 to assess the feasibility of maintaining a visitor service at that time of year but was unable, because of deteriorating weather and sea conditions, to maintain the island open to the end of that month in any of those years and was in each case forced to close early. </p>  <p>  Work is underway currently on a new ten year management plan for the World Heritage Site and it is expected that the length of the season will be addressed directly within that.   The process to develop the management plan includes a public consultation element which has been underway for the past several weeks and will allow for the full expression of views on all matters relating to the World Heritage Site. </p>  <p>  The question of providing a public toilet at Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l has been under review for some years.  However, the technical challenges of working within the particular environment of the island are considerable and it has not yet been possible to find a viable solution.  The former lighthouse property is currently being assessed for potential use in this regard to determine if a suitable facility can be developed there.</p></reply>

A Memorandum of Understanding, MOU, agreed on 24 March 2014, between the Office of Public Works and Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance companies in Ireland has a specific focus on agreeing the basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on areas defended by flood relief schemes completed by the OPW.  </p><p>Under the MOU, the OPW requirement is that insurers who are party to the agreement take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed flood defence schemes, when assessing exposure to flood risk.  The MOU does not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations for which information has been provided by the OPW.  The MOU recognises that the provision of insurance cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers based on the risk they are willing to take on a case by case basis.</p><p>The flood maps developed by the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management, CFRAM, Programme are community based maps on the future risk of flooding in an area, for the purpose of developing community based flood risk management measures.  They are not developed based on historic flooding information alone, or to designate individual properties at risk from flooding and cannot be relied upon for commercial purposes. This has been outlined to the Insurance Industry that has informed the OPW that it relies upon its own flood models to make its commercial decisions.</p><p>The OPW has published information available to it in relation to past flood events and this is currently accessible, where available and applicable, through individual flood maps on <i>floodinfo.ie</i>.  The presence of this information in any given area is indicative of a risk of flooding but individual properties may not have flooded in the past or may not be at risk of future flooding due to local conditions e.g. elevated floor levels, the use of individual property protection measures or for other reasons.</p><p>Any person with an insurance-related query or complaint can contact Insurance Ireland's Insurance Information Service 01 676 1914 or <i>feedback@insuranceireland.eu</i>.  In addition, the Financial Services Ombudsman, 01 567 7000 or info@fspo.ie, deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers. </p></reply>

The membership of the GCCC, given below, includes representatives from the main capital spending bodies and departments with a significant involvement in public sector construction related activities.  In order to draw on the considerable experience in procurement within the public sector, the committee also includes bodies from outside the central government sector.</p><p>Relevant departments and bodies nominate representatives to sit on the committee and they have either technical, e.g. civil and building engineering, architectural, quantity surveying, or project management, and/or administrative backgrounds. Representative departments and bodies may change their individual nominees on the GCCC from time to time. Special advisors/consultants or other guests may be invited to participate in the work of the Committee as may be required from time to time.</p><p>All public works projects that are delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the Government's capital plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Capital Works Management Framework, CWMF.  The CWMF is mandated by circular and was developed to provide an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.  The public works contract is a key component of the CWMF and is a lump sum, fixed-price contract which is to be used on all public works projects.  </p><p>It is possible for public bodies to seek a derogation from the use of the standard forms of contract from the GCCC.  This process may be used for complex or large projects which have specific requirements which do not naturally fit with the standard &lsquo;lump sum&rsquo; contracts and has been availed of by a number of sanctioning authorities.</p><p>A derogation, if agreed, does not approve the approach or strategy of the contracting authority, but simply acknowledges that the circumstances are such as to warrant a different approach than the standard.  It is a matter for the contracting authority and the sanctioning authority to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regards to compliance with procurement rules and project appraisal in accordance with the Public Spending Code.</p><p>The current details of the GCCC at 12 February 2019 as requested by the Deputy are set out below.<table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Technical/Administrative Position in Organisation</th><th>Department/Office</th></tr><tr><td>David O&rsquo;Brien</td><td>Senior Construction Adviser (Chair to GCCC)</td><td>Office of Government Procurement</td></tr><tr><td>Eileen Dalton</td><td>Assistant Principal (Secretariat to GCCC)</td><td>Office of Government Procurement</td></tr><tr><td>Jim Deane</td><td>Principal Officer, Procurement Policy</td><td>Office of Government Procurement</td></tr><tr><td>Grainne Connolly</td><td>Engineer, Marine Engineering Division</td><td>Dept. of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</td></tr><tr><td>Noel Clancy</td><td>Chief Engineer, Marine Engineering Division</td><td>Dept. of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</td></tr><tr><td>Noel &Oacute; Murch&uacute; </td><td>Engineer, Marine Engineering Division</td><td>Dept. of Agriculture, Food and the Marine</td></tr><tr><td>Deirdre Creaney</td><td>Assistant Principal, Property Management Branch</td><td>Dept. of Defence</td></tr><tr><td>Neil Murphy</td><td>Head of Quantity Surveying Services</td><td>Dept. of Defence</td></tr><tr><td>Larry McEvoy</td><td>Manager (Professional &amp;amp; Technical), Planning and   Building Unit</td><td>Dept. of Education &amp;amp; Skills</td></tr><tr><td>Derek Kavanagh</td><td>Quantity Surveying Adviser - Housing Advisers &amp;amp;   Building Standards</td><td>Dept. of Housing, Planning and Local Govt.</td></tr><tr><td>David O'Grady</td><td>Engineering Inspector Roads Division</td><td>Dept. of Transport, Tourism and Sport</td></tr><tr><td>Ciaran McCaffrey</td><td>Senior Manager, Capital Funding</td><td>HEA </td></tr><tr><td>Eleanor Masterson</td><td>Deputy Chief Architectural Adviser</td><td>HSE</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Finnegan</td><td>Principal Quantity Surveying Adviser</td><td>HSE</td></tr><tr><td>Gerard Cahillane</td><td>NDFA Head of Finance and Operations</td><td>NDFA</td></tr><tr><td>David Corrigan</td><td>Head of Project Management </td><td>NDFA</td></tr><tr><td>Aidan Quinn</td><td>Principal Quantity Surveyor, Quantity Surveying Services </td><td>OPW</td></tr><tr><td>Colette Davis</td><td>Assistant Principal, Flood Project Management Services</td><td>OPW</td></tr><tr><td>Gerard Kennedy</td><td>Assistant Principal, Intermediate Projects</td><td>OPW</td></tr><tr><td>Gerard Harvey</td><td>Assistant Principal Architect</td><td>OPW</td></tr><tr><td>Geraldine Fitzpatrick</td><td>Chartered Engineer FIEI,    Head of Roads Capital Programme</td><td>Transport Infrastructure Ireland</td></tr><tr><td>Patrick Duffy</td><td>Regional Manager</td><td>Transport Infrastructure Ireland</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.</p><p>Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p><p>- Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p><p>- Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p><p>- Provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>There are currently two primary schools in the Kilcoole school planning area with a combined 2017/18 enrolment of 932 and one post-primary school with a 2017/18 enrolment of 689. There are currently eight primary schools in the Greystones school planning area with a combined 2017/18 enrolment of 3,195 and two post-primary schools with a combined 2017/18 enrolment of 1,110.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022), including the following new primary and post-primary schools to be established in the areas referred to by the Deputy as follows:</p><p>- a new 8-classroom primary school to serve the Kilcoole/Newtownmountkennedy school planning area to be established in 2019; and</p><p>- a new 800-pupil post-primary school to be established in 2021 to serve the Kilcoole &amp;amp; Greystones school planning areas as a regional solution.</p></reply>

SPHE provides specific opportunities to enable the child to understand himself or herself, to develop healthy relationships and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour. It is a particular concern of the curriculum to develop in the child respect and care for his or her body. It also enables the child to acquire the knowledge and attitudes that help to promote a healthy lifestyle.  As part of this the child should be enabled to recognise and practise basic hygiene skills such as: personal hygiene practices, hygienic eating habits, developing basic skills in dressing himself/herself and caring for clothes, taking proper care of teeth.</p><p>The primary curriculum is currently undergoing a process of review and redevelopment, which includes SPHE and the time allocated.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of Clerical Officers and Caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff was improved in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p></reply>

The scheme was developed to reduce potential regression in learning associated with these specific categories of special education needs over the summer holidays. The scheme does not make provision for children with other categories of Special Education Needs, for example, Down Syndrome. </p><p>The National Council for Special Education&rsquo;s Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders was published in July 2016. </p><p>The NCSE review found that in general parents value July provision because it provides day-time respite for families and a structured day for students. </p><p>However, the NCSE review found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised. </p><p>These include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided to all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The Council recommended that the relevant Government Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. </p><p>The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe, social environment for all students with complex special educational needs, which might include some children with Down syndrome.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has convened an Implementation Group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and representatives from other relevant Departments and agencies to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered. </p><p>There are no plans to change the July provision scheme coverage until this work is complete. </p></reply>

These additional release days - 18, 24, and 30 depending on the size of the school - will be effective from 1st September 2019.  </p>  <p>  This builds on measures in previous budgets, including &euro;0.4 million made available in Budget 2018 to fund almost 4600 additional release days for teaching principals in primary schools. This funding provided an increase in the number of release days available to teaching principals in the 2018/19 school year to 17, 23 or 29 days depending on the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Any additional increase in the number of release days will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that mandatory reporting of child protection concerns by teachers and greater oversight of child protection arrangements in schools were among a range of changes that came into effect with the full commencement in December 2017 of the Children First Act 2015 and with the introduction of new Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017.  </p>  <p>  Face-to-face training sessions were provided for school principals or Designated Liaison Persons (DLPs) for child protection in all schools in 2018 by the Professional Development Service for Teachers, and additional training sessions are being provided for newly appointed principals/DLPs in 2019. </p>  <p>  Matching changes to inspection arrangements also began to be rolled out in 2018, and new Child Protection and Safeguarding Inspections are a further step to monitor child protection in schools.</p>  <p>  The new inspections are designed to strengthen our child protection systems in schools.  They will provide another level of reassurance and they will help to guide and direct schools in relation to meeting their child protection obligations.  They are also an important way of promoting improvement in the implementation of child protection procedures by schools; they are also designed to promote best practice in school leadership as it relates to child protection. </p>  <p>  The inspections do not require any school to produce any paperwork or record that the school is not already required to have in place since December 2017. The inspectors are also flexible in carrying out the checks and in timing the meetings they have with any staff in the school, so that school life is not disrupted.  </p>  <p>  The new Child Protection and Safeguarding Inspections were developed through an extensive research and consultation process with the education partners and other interested stakeholders including the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  In the context of this consultation, my Department carefully considered feedback from schools, principals, unions and management bodies, particularly in relation to their requirements on record-keeping and reporting and the supports they need in order to implement child protection procedures.  In that regard: </p>  <p>  - My Department has provided a suite of templates and supporting documents to help schools and boards to fulfil their record-keeping, reporting obligations and other obligations under the 2017 Procedures</p>  <p>  - The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and the Inspectorate are working closely together to promote best practice among schools in relation to child protection</p>  <p>  - The Inspectorate has provided regional seminars on the new Child Protection and Safeguarding Inspections for primary and post-primary school principals and is planning further briefings on the new inspections during May and June 2019. The Inspectorate is also presenting at conferences of a number of education partners. It is expected that more than 3,000 principals will have attended briefing sessions on the new inspections by the end of June this year.</p></reply>

This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise enrolments from within the school planning area which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.</p>  <p>  The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. </p>  <p>  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President on the 18 July 2018, is an important piece of legislation which will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils. </p></reply>

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).</p>  <p>  All mainstream schools in Galway City and County receive a service from NEPS psychologists based in the Galway Office. As the Deputy may be aware there were two psychologist vacancies in this office, all schools continue to have access to support and development, critical incident and advisory support from NEPS and pupil casework via their assigned psychologist or via SCPA. The school to which the Deputy refers in his question has heretofore, in this academic year, been in receipt of assessment services via SCPA. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that a new recruit, sourced from the recruitment panels administered by the Public Appointments Service, took up office in Galway in early January. I understand that a meeting has taken place recently with the school in question, the NEPS Regional Director and the new psychologist, preparatory to her taking up her assigned duties with the school following a short period of induction to the service. </p>  <p>  For the Deputy&rsquo;s information a candidate for the second staffing vacancy has been identified through PAS and a start date agreed in the next two months.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This was the biggest change to the PAYE system since the 1960s.  </p><p>From 1 January 2019 employers are required to report their employees&rsquo; pay and statutory deductions to Revenue for each payroll issue.</p><p>The salary issue relates to the taxation of the substitute staff who were paid in the first payroll of 2019 and in the case of post primary substitute teachers in the second payroll. </p><p>In these payrolls, in which the new system was applied for the first time the payroll files that transferred to Revenue inadvertently included an end date for substitute staff. This informed Revenue that these staff would not be paid under this employer number in the future. </p><p>This notification caused Revenue to immediately reduce the tax credits and cut off points to zero for this cohort of staff which meant that when they were next paid, there were no tax credits available to be applied to the salary. </p><p>This has meant that some substitute staff paid on the payrolls of the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>and 17<sup>th</sup>January and who have continued to be employed since have been assigned week 1 / cumulative zero credits or emergency tax.</p><p>The payroll software has been amended to prevent an end date transferring to Revenue for future payments which means substitute staff paid on payrolls after the 17<sup>th</sup>January do not have problems with tax credits.  </p><p>However this software amendment did not correct the issues that arose for the staff who were paid already.</p><p>My Department is working closely with Revenue to implement a solution to this problem.  A solution is currently being implemented in consultation with Revenue. </p><p>Some adjustments will be processed for the post primary payroll issue of the 14<sup>th</sup>February and further adjustments will be processed for the next pay issue of the 28<sup>th</sup>February.</p><p>This solution will be applied to the primary and non teaching staff payrolls of the 21st February and  primary substitute teachers and substitute non teaching staff paid on that date should have the correct tax deducted.</p><p>There are staff paid on the payroll who are assigned zero credits apart from those impacted by the end date issue. For example in cases where a substitute staff member is retired and in receipt of pension their credits may be assigned to the pension payment and zero credits assigned to the substitute employment. In addition teachers are placed on emergency basis where their tax position has not been finalised with Revenue. Some substitute staff may have other employments and their credits may be assigned to that employment. </p></reply>

Working with other Government Departments and agencies it is represented on both the National Oversight Committee and the Standing Sub-Committee, established to give leadership and drive implementation of the strategy.</p><p>Schools support their students to develop the key skills and knowledge to enable them to make informed choices when faced with a range of difficult issues, including drugs, alcohol and gambling. This is mainly done through the SPHE programme, which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances. SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in junior cycle. It also forms part of the mandatory 'Wellbeing' area of learning for the new junior cycle which was introduced in September 2017. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.</p><p>Relevant topics in SPHE include student decision-making skills and safety and protection. Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices that guide them towards considered decision-making, begin to understand their own rights and the rights of others, and explore decision-making. In respect of safety, students&rsquo; ability to assess the consequences of risky behaviour is developed.</p><p>Current best practice guidelines for the delivery of SPHE indicate that the classroom teacher is the best placed professional to work sensitively and consistently with students and that individual themes such as Substance Misuse Prevention should not be treated in isolation but should be integrated with the other SPHE modules. </p><p><b>Funding provided by DES to projects in LDTF areas 2014 - 2018</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>KDPPG </th><th>PMCA</th><th>BESLP</th><th>Crinan YP</th><th>Familibase</th><th>RASP</th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>&euro;48,000</td><td>&euro;7,450</td><td>&euro;71,070</td><td>&euro;50,475</td><td>&euro;67,400</td><td>&euro;138,840</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>&euro;43,200</td><td>&euro;6,705</td><td>&euro;76,615</td><td>&euro;52,040</td><td>&euro;67,400</td><td>&euro;138,840</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;38,880</td><td>&euro;6,035</td><td>&euro;76,615</td><td>&euro;52,040</td><td>&euro;67,400</td><td>&euro;143,830</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;34,560</td><td>&euro;5,365</td><td>&euro;76,615</td><td>&euro;52,040</td><td>&euro;67,400</td><td>&euro;148,820</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;34,560</td><td>&euro;5,365</td><td>&euro;76,615</td><td>&euro;52,040</td><td>&euro;67,400</td><td>&euro;148,820</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is a network of Government officials involved in their respective victim support policy areas across the EU Member States. </p>  <p>  The Network has been established in order to further strengthen the supports to victims across the European Union and to enhance the co-operation of the Member States in the area of victims&rsquo; rights against the background of the European Union Victims Directive. </p></reply>

Road traffic enforcement data is transferred by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Road Safety Authority (RSA), on an ongoing basis, for detailed analysis in the context of the RSA's road safety promotion function. </p><p>I have been informed by the RSA that, in their latest figures, from 2012 to 2016*, there were 99 single vehicle collisions with animals, five of which involved deer.  Of the 99 recorded incidents there were three cases in which the animal species was not specified, therefore, deer were involved in only 5.2% of collisions, during this period, where the species was recorded.

This represents an increase of over 6% over the initial allocation for 2018.</p>  <p>  Very significant capital investment is also being made in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This includes </p>  <p>  - investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver on reform and deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in delivering professional policing and security services for the community; </p>  <p>  - investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet over the same period; and </p>  <p>  - considerable capital investment is also being made in the Garda estate. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is a matter for the Commissioner to efficiently manage these resources provided for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to determine the allocation of budgets to all Divisions, including those in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, based upon operational requirements.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review so as to ensure their optimum use.</p>  <p>  For example, I can confirm to the Deputy a capital allocation of &euro;10 million will be available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the Garda fleet in 2019.  I am not in a position to confirm to the Deputy today what the exact allocation will be across the Garda Divisions, including those in the DMR, of the additional vehicles which will be purchased from this allocation. </p>  <p>  A total of &euro;61 million has been allocated to Garda ICT infrastructure and Communications for 2019.  I understand that a full list of ICT projects for 2019, together with a breakdown of the roll-out of additional ICT infrastructure across the Divisions, is still being finalised within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Garda estate, I would recall that the Office of Public Works (OPW) has the responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation and accordingly the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the OPW.  </p>  <p>  The Garda Building and Refurbishment programme 2016-2021 will continue to be delivered during 2019.  The programme includes planned works at over 30 locations, including: </p>  <p>  - major refurbishment of selected stations and facilities, including facilities for meeting victims of crime;</p>  <p>  - essential remedial works to selected existing stations; and</p>  <p>  - development of large scale Property and Exhibit Management Stores (PEMS).</p>  <p>  The programme also includes a Cell Refurbishment Programme and provision of improved Custody Management Facilities.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Garda Divisions in the DMR, this investment includes the development of a new Garda Station and Immigration Facility at Transaer House in Dublin Airport.  Work on this project commenced in 2018.  Construction works are ongoing on this development and I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are expected to be complete by the end of Q1, 2019.</p>  <p>  Other major building projects which will continue to be progressed during 2019 for the benefit of the Divisions in the DMR include the ongoing refurbishment of Fitzgibbon Street station and development of a facility at Military Road, Dublin.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for Government contained a commitment to re-open six Garda Stations on a pilot basis to determine possible positive impacts on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  A report was prepared by the Garda Commissioner which identified the six Garda Stations to be reopened on a pilot basis, including two stations in the DMR, namely Rush and Stepaside.  I understand that the Garda authorities and the OPW are cooperating closely on implementation of the pilot project.  Reopening of all relevant stations is being pursued as a priority and I am informed by the OPW that it expects that work will be completed at all remaining stations in 2019.</p>  <p>  The clear goal of this significant investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them in locations identified in accordance with agreed Garda priorities.</p></reply>

I am advised that the grant assistance is made available through community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations that are registered with Pobal.  Any decision to extend the scheme to house alarms, rather than personal alarms, would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I can advise the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pursue a range of measures to support elderly and more vulnerable people in the community, working closely with Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other community groups.  For many years, my Department has supported community crime prevention by providing funding for the Community Alert programme, which is operated by  Muintir na T&iacute;re, in partnership with the Garda authorities.  At the Ploughing Championships last September, I announced that up to &euro;150,000 would be made available for local communities in 2018 towards the cost of running the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  A total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation.  These unprecedented resources are underpinned by the Government's ongoing commitment to achieving a Garda workforce of 21,000 by 2021.</p></reply>

Very significant capital investment is also being made, including investment of &euro;342 million in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021; and investment of &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet over the same period.</p><p>In terms of investment in the Garda estate, the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is an ambitious 5-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities, which continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country, underpinned by over &euro;60 million in Exchequer funding as well as a major Public Private Partnership (PPP).  There has been some good progress on the programme in 2018, as well as in other major projects in relation to the Garda estate, including in particular the completion and entry into operational use of 3 new Divisional and Regional Headquarters at Wexford, Galway and Kevin Street (Dublin), which collectively required funding of over &euro;100 million.  The clear goal of this investment is to address deficiencies in the Garda estate and provide fit-for-purpose facilities for Garda members and staff as well as the public interacting with them.</p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW), which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.</p><p>The Public Private Partnership<b></b>arrangement included in the Building and Refurbishment Programme is intended to deliver new stations at Macroom, Clonmel and Sligo as well as a new custody suite at the Garda Station at Anglesea Street Cork.</p><p>I am informed by the OPW and the Garda authorities that the OPW has acquired sites for the development of the new stations in Macroom and in Sligo.  The site in Clonmel is a portion of the former Kickham Barracks and has at all material times been in state ownership.  Having previously been transferred from the Department of Defence to Tipperary County Council, I am informed by the OPW that all difficulties in relation to completion of transfer of the site from the Council to the OPW are resolved and that the transfer is now being finalised.  On completion, ownership of all three sites will be vested in the OPW. </p><p>The development of PPP projects is progressed under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA).  As the Deputy will appreciate, preparation of a PPP can be complex, but my Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are actively engaging with the NDFA with a view to progressing the matter further.  These engagements concern the appropriate scope and governance of the PPP bundle, as well as costings and design for the stations.  The Department is also engaging with the NDFA in relation to delivery via PPP of a Courts Service project at a site in Hammond Lane, Dublin.</p><p>It is not possible at this point to provide a timeframe for completion of the projects.  However I can assure the Deputy that delivery of the new Garda stations at Clonmel, Macroom and Sligo through this PPP arrangement is being pursued as a priority.  </p><p>There is no indication, nor is it anticipated that this project will be impacted by the budgetary position in relation to the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p></reply>

Accordingly, I do not propose to comment in any way on that matter.</p>  <p>  I can, however, say that my predecessor was notified by the Garda referred to in the Deputy's question that a complaint had been made to GSOC citing the Protected Disclosure&rsquo;s Act 2014.  In order to be of assistance, in April 2017 the then Minister opted to utilise her powers under section 102(7) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to refer that correspondence to the Ombudsman Commission.  This was so the Commission could assess whether the contents might form part of their investigation.  The individual concerned was notified of the Minister&rsquo;s actions at that time.  That investigation is on-going at present.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will, no doubt, appreciate the statutory independence of GSOC, which prevents me from interfering with its operational functions.  That is the guarantee to persons making complaints that their complaints will be considered independently and free from outside interference.  I have full confidence in the role that GSOC plays in investigating complaints of wrongdoing in the Garda&iacute;, including protected disclosures from members. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Protected Disclosures Act was enacted in 2014 to allow employees to bring alleged wrongdoing to the attention of the appropriate authorities.  The Act also affords very important protections to persons making protected disclosures.  The Act provides that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is a designated body for receipt of protected disclosures.  The protections afforded under the Act include protection from dismissal and other forms of penalisation and for the protection of the identity of persons making disclosures.  I am sure that the Deputy appreciates that the protection of whistleblowers rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the process.</p>  <p>  With regard to the actions taken by the Garda Authorities in respect to these allegations it is important to remind the Deputy that I, as Minister, have no authority to direct the Garda Commissioner in matters concerning the control, operation and direction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Similarly, certain workplace issues which have also been raised in the correspondence are not matters in which I have authority to act, nor indeed would the Deputy wish me to have such authority.  These are properly matters for the Garda Commissioner.</p></reply>

Section 15A provides that, where the application is based on being the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen the requirements include that the couple are married or civil partners to each other for a period of at least 3 years and are living together and, immediately before the date of application, have a period of one year's continuous residence in the island of Ireland and, during the preceding four years, have a further period amounting to 2 years (i.e. 3 years in total). </p>  <p>  It is also open to an applicant generally to apply under Section 16(a) of the 1956 Act where the applicant is of Irish descent or has Irish association.

In line with Government policy, an inclusive approach has been adopted by the NSAI which continues to work closely with other Government agencies to fully provide the information and supports required by Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  Brexit is an ongoing and evolving process which requires a fluid and adaptive response in the provision of guidance and support.  A dedicated Brexit Unit was established in the NSAI last year which has developed a three-strand approach focused on raising public awareness, engaging with Government and industry, and assessing and developing strategies to mitigate the impact of Brexit on Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  Over the past number of months, the NSAI has organised a series of standalone general and sector-specific Brexit briefings.   As well as raising public awareness through participation at Brexit information events, a number of online supports have been developed.  These include a dedicated Brexit webpage outlining guidance for businesses, a dedicated point of contact for individuals seeking advice, and Brexit factsheets which provide succinct and clear information on standards and certification issues in several sectors.</p>  <p>  A key message from NSAI to businesses is that if a business relies on a UK Notified Body for conformity assessment certificates, they need to be aware that certifications from UK Notified Bodies will no longer be valid after Brexit.  NSAI is also advising businesses to examine their supply chains to check for risks and vulnerabilities to the UK.  If they depend on sourcing a product, component or perhaps a service from the UK, their supply chain may be at risk. </p>  <p>  To ensure that businesses that use standards and require certification are fully informed about their requirements post-Brexit, the NSAI is engaging proactively with industry representatives and other stakeholders.  It has undertaken analysis work to identify possible gaps and exposure in the provision of certification services to Irish companies, including wider formal engagement with all Irish Notified Bodies.  </p>  <p>  This work forms part of the concerted efforts across my Department and agencies to ensure that businesses make the necessary preparations for Brexit.</p></reply>

We understand the importance of achieving the best possible spread of employment and investment across the country and we have been working hard towards that goal. Significant progress has already been made, with 58% of all IDA client-supported employment now located outside of Dublin. This figure represents the highest such figure in the history of the Agency. Our aim is to increase this percentage further in 2019.</p><p>Limerick forms part of the IDA's Mid-West region, along with County Clare and North Tipperary. There are 56 IDA supported client companies in the County, which collectively employ approximately 12,000 people. Limerick is home to a number of prominent multinationals who have shown significant commitment to the County with companies such as Northern Trust and Stryker continuing to perform well. </p><p>Site visits represent a valuable tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas. However, as I have said before, site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential, as almost 70% of all new FDI comes from existing IDA client companies. </p><p>I want to emphasise that the IDA does its utmost to encourage its clients to locate or expand in regional Ireland. This is just as much a priority for the Agency as it is for my Department and the Government. Indeed, the IDA is continuing to target an increase of investment of 30% to 40% in every region by the end of its current strategy in 2019. At the same time, we must recognise that the final decision as to where to invest always rests with the firm concerned. It is also the case, no matter what efforts we make to underline the undoubted benefits of regional locations, that certain overseas companies will only consider investing in large urban areas for various commercial or operational reasons. </p><p>The IDA will continue to work with both existing and prospective clients to identify new opportunities for investment in the Mid-West. In doing so, the Agency will continue to highlight the region's strengths to overseas firms. </p><p>The table below outlines site visits to Limerick from 2011 to 2018.<table><tr><th>County</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>2018</th></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>40 </td><td>30 </td><td>23 </td><td>22 </td><td>40 </td><td>49 </td><td>42 </td><td>35 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

I am working closely with the agencies under my Department who have a wide range of supports available to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK, and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.  </p>  <p>   Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is to assist client companies to build on the strength of their 2018 performance by supporting them to start, innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint. In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, a Global Ambition campaign launched and an intensive programme initiated to support companies to take action and plan for Brexit so that they have the resilience necessary to navigate the challenges and opportunities posed by any kind of Brexit.  </p>  <p>  The UK is the leading exporting destination for Enterprise Ireland supported companies and is the first export destination for many companies. Despite this, Enterprise Ireland supported companies, including food companies, are steadily diversifying their global footprint beyond the UK. The proportion of exports to the UK has reduced by 10% over the last ten years, reflecting the success Irish companies are having in substantially increasing and broadening their exports to other international markets.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has a broad range of supports to help companies prepare for Brexit including the Brexit Scorecard, Be Prepared Grant, Advisory Clinics, Agile Innovation Fund, Operational Excellence Offer and Market Discovery Fund. Recently launched EI supports include online Customs Training and Act On Consultancy.  Later this month, it is planned that the Local Enterprise Offices will be launching their customs training offering which will be available to all companies.  Furthermore, the suite of enterprise supports in place cover a range of potential Brexit impacts.  These range from liquidity support through short term and longer term loans, to restructuring aid for businesses in severe operating difficulties, including an EU State aid approved Rescue and Restructure Schemes in place to deal with sudden shocks and an expanded network of overseas offices and in-market supports to help firms diversify markets and to consolidate market share in the UK where appropriate.   </p>  <p>  I recently met with key players in the Grocery Retail and Distribution sector to hear directly from them on the current status of their Brexit preparedness.  Distribution chains within the sector are highly integrated across Ireland and the UK and I will continue to engage with the sector on preparatory actions.  This is reflective of the importance the Government attaches to the sector and its recognition of the challenges that it faces, including in a no-deal Brexit scenario.    </p>  <p>  Additionally, I chair my Department&rsquo;s Enterprise Forum on Brexit and Global Challenges which provides a forum for discussion of enterprise policy implications arising from Brexit and other Global Challenges, with a particular focus on capturing the views, concerns and suggestions of the enterprise sector.  Membership of the Forum, which meets every 6-8 weeks includes business representative bodies, representatives from the Agencies under my Department and policy officials from across my Department.  </p>  <p>  It is vital that businesses which have yet to do so, now engage with the appropriate Government measures in place to mitigate against the impact of Brexit.  My Department and its agencies will continue to provide the necessary extensive supports and advice to ensure that businesses are prepared for the challenges which exposure to Brexit brings.</p></reply>

Funding in REV 2019 for Centres for Research Training helps to address the human capital component of PRTLI.</p>  <p>  &euro;15.5 million has been allocated under subhead B.5 towards the new Centres for Research Training (CRTs) initiative.

I am focused on supporting and sustaining existing regional employment while also working to create new economic opportunities and jobs in every county of Ireland. With regard to foreign direct investment (FDI) supported employment, there are now nearly 230,000 people working in IDA client firms. Last year saw more IDA-supported jobs added in regional Ireland than at any time over the past 17 years, with 58% of total such employment now located outside of Dublin. </p>  <p>  County Louth itself has seen a 3.5% increase in FDI-driven employment in the last year. There are now 28 IDA-supported client companies in the County employing 3,903 people. These firms are continuing to grow and develop. Last year, for example, saw PCI Pharma announce that 70 new jobs will be created at their facility in Drogheda. This represents a vote of confidence in what Louth and the broader North-East region has to offer to multinationals who are looking to locate outside of Dublin. In particular, Louth continues to maintain a strong contingent of overseas firms in the International Business Services sector, with key clients such as YapStone, Becton Dickinson and PCI Pharma Services performing well in the County. </p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in  Louth, the Government remains determined to achieve more. That is why work is continuing to unlock further the economic potential of the County. The IDA remains pivotal to this and the Agency is engaging with its clients and with other enterprise agencies to create jobs and source new investment there.</p></reply>

An Interdepartmental Group, which includes representatives from all Departments, is also assisting the development of the Strategy. This approach reflects the broad spread of policy areas impacted by digitalisation.  </p>  <p>  A public consultation exercise, to allow citizens to influence the development of the Strategy, took place at the end of 2018. Over 300 responses were received. In parallel, consultations with stakeholders and experts to inform development of the Strategy took place.</p>  <p>  It is intended that the new National Digital Strategy will set out Ireland's vision and ambition in the fast-changing digital world. It will set out a roadmap across themed pillars incorporating Digital Foundations, such as infrastructure and security; Trust, Society and Well-being; Effective Use of digital; and the Digital Economy and Labour Market changes. As well and focusing on national issues, it will place an emphasis on international and European linkages and help to position Ireland within the European Union, at the heart of digital developments.</p>  <p>  While it is too early to comment on any specific initiatives that the Strategy may address, I have no plans to introduce a merchant&rsquo;s incentive scheme. </p>  <p>  It is recognised though that all businesses, regardless of size or sector, in today&rsquo;s competitive environment must build their digital online capability. Accordingly, the agencies of my Department offer a range of supports to assist businesses to trade online. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop front line service assisting in delivering business growth and jobs for the small and micro-enterprise sector. The LEOs are the first port of call for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business, in terms of advice, training, sign posting to other support providers and, in certain circumstances, grant support. The LEOs undertake a number of activities to encourage businesses to build their online presence and compete in the online market place.</p>  <p>  The LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with training and advice, to micro companies (10 or less employees) who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity. Since the start of the scheme in July 2014 to date almost 4,500 micro companies have availed of the TOVS. </p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace. These programmes are focused on different elements which aim at maximising outputs from investment in online trading such as: </p>  <p>  - Marketing, focused mainly on development of an online/mobile marketing strategy;</p>  <p>  - Social Media, with the majority of programmes focused on educating the client base on how to use the different social media platforms to support their business;</p>  <p>  - eCommerce Sales Strategy, including how to convert website visits into sales; and</p>  <p>  - Search Engine Optimisation, including web analytics and video optimisation for web.</p>  <p>  As Chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I have prioritised supporting the retail sector to develop their online capability and enhance their competitiveness. In 2017, data from the CSO showed that 66% of Irish enterprises in the Wholesale and Retail Sector reported having a website or homepage, with only 28% able to facilitate online ordering. </p>  <p>  In support of this, the first call for the new pilot Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland, opened on 24th October 2018 and closed on 5th December 2018. Applications are currently under assessment by Enterprise Ireland. The Scheme launched with a fund of up to &euro;625,000, which was later doubled to &euro;1.25m as part of the Department&rsquo;s 2019 Budget. A second call will issue this year (2019). The Online Retail Scheme will support retail businesses of 20 employees or more under the areas of (research, strategy development, implementation and training) who are ready to strategically grow their online capability. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the strong role the retail sector plays in supporting regional development and vibrant communities, at least 50% of the total number of grants awarded will be reserved for retail SMEs with their headquarters outside of county Dublin.</p>  <p>  More generally, Enterprise Ireland (EI) works with 5,000 manufacturing and internationally traded services companies, and building an online presence is part of the range of supports offered to those clients. EI has supported projects focused on developing innovative products on new product platforms for international markets. Working closely with the Irish Internet Association, EI delivers a range of funded and advisory eCommerce supports for its clients to develop their online marketing capabilities. In addition, EI regularly organises events which can connect clients with leading experts and inform them on best practice.  </p>  <p>  An additional &euro;1.8m has been earmarked for the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland over the next 3 years. The proposed investment, again via EI, is to assist the sector to develop and generate additional export sales and online revenue opportunities, increasing market diversification by client companies and underpinning sustainable growth.</p></reply>

To date, the communications plan has included:</p><p>1. Issuing letters to all prescribers and pharmacists in relation to new European Medicines Agency (EMA) and HPRA guidelines on the use of sodium valproate;</p><p>2. Issuing patient-specific letters to GPs;</p><p>3. Issuing 2500+ letters to patients who were dispensed sodium valproate;</p><p>4. Issuing letters to pharmacies advising them of the patient support service and requesting that they include a patient information leaflet every time they dispense sodium valproate;</p><p>5. Developing an information web page regarding sodium valproate; and</p><p>6. Using social media to provide regular updates to patients and stakeholders.</p><p>In addition to this HSE programme, the HPRA has collaborated with national stakeholders, including patient representatives and healthcare professionals, to implement the EMA&rsquo;s new risk minimisation measures in Ireland.</p><p>These measures have included changes to the product information for patients and healthcare professionals; a visual warning on the packaging of valproate medicines; updated educational materials to reflect the new measures and provide age-appropriate advice; and a patient alert card to be attached to the packaging so that pharmacists can go through it with the patient when valproate is dispensed.</p><p>In tandem with the actions taken by the HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), as pharmacy regulator, has directed pharmacists that they must inform women of child-bearing age of the potential risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes when supplying medicines containing valproate. This includes providing a patient leaflet and Alert Card with each supply of these medicines.</p><p>It is important to note that many of these actions, as well as other strands of work within the HSE Valproate Response Project, are continuing while an impact assessment led by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) is taking place, and are not dependent on the outcome of the RCSI's report. </p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that the HSE is planning a public conference on sodium valproate at the end of March to expand the scope of communication around this medicine and increase awareness among women age who are currently taking, or have previously taken, sodium valproate.</p></reply>

This has taken longer than anticipated with respect to determining the most robust monitoring mechanism to preserve the integrity of the implementation of the Codes for the benefit of public nutritional health and in line with the main objective of the Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP) to deal with the problem of obesity. The progression of the development of guidelines to govern the implementation of these codes is also being conducted in tandem with the development of the robust monitoring mechanism.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department has engaged with industry representation on initiating a register of signatories to the Codes of Practice from the perspective of compiling a list of companies that would be signing up to the Codes. The development of guidance on the interpretation of the Codes will precede the development of this list. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged with industry both formally and informally in a number of areas of interest within the context of obesity. For example, and as the Deputy is aware, the Obesity Policy Implementation Oversight Group agreed to establish a sub-group for Reformulation. This sub-group has met on a number of occasions since being established and agreed their Terms of Reference. The Reformulation sub-group is technical in its work programme. The work of the sub-group will primarily set targets on reformulation of food and drink. It will also make recommendations on addressing reduction of portion sizes and on monitoring and validation procedures. </p>  <p>  As part of its work, a workshop between the Reformulation sub-group and Food Sector Stakeholders comprised of, among others, industry on reformulation, took place on the 20th of September last. This workshop provided an important opportunity for detailed engagement with key Food Sector Stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities of reformulation in the interests of promoting the health and wellbeing of the population. And the work of the sub-group is now building on this engagement.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs are charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.</p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients. If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office.</p></reply>

There are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain, and these additional stocks, together with planning by Revenue to allow the fast-tracking of essential drugs into Ireland, where necessary, will help deal with any delays that may arise.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions. To do so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the HPRA developed and launched a multi-stakeholder Medicine Shortages Framework to anticipate and manage medicine shortages when they occur. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit.</p>  <p>  As an additional safeguard, my Department requested that consideration be given to those categories of medicines which are considered most essential to public health. As a result, HSE and HPRA technical experts are undertaking a process to verify the contingency planning in place for the continuity of supply of medicines essential to public health, in order to determine those medicines that have the potential to be vulnerable to supply disruption and, where necessary, identify clinically appropriate alternatives. Work on this process is ongoing and will continue in the months before and after Brexit.</p>  <p>  Both the HPRA and HSE have requested that medicines manufacturers and suppliers highlight any issues regarding the availability of specific products associated with Brexit and, to date, no major issues have been identified through this process.</p></reply>

Contract Awarded to main and specialists contractor 3rd August 2017.</p>  <p>Procurement Stage 2: While the basement Phase A works were under construction, the 2nd stage detailed design for the above ground Phase B works was completed with a full bill of quantities priced at the 1st stage Preliminary design tendered rates. The contract becomes in effect a lump sum contract. Phase B works instructed 8 January 2019.</p>  <p>  The procurement strategy was developed and finalised from 2014 to 2016.  The Government Contracts Committee, the cross-government consultative committee for construction procurement matters, accepted that given the project&rsquo;s scale, complexity and its programme, the circumstances were such as to warrant a deviation from the standard form of Government contract and agreed a derogation from its use.</p>  <p>  Reasons for adopting the two-stage process include:</p>  <p>- Early commencement on site, two years ahead of traditional procurement (Phase A works commenced on site on 3 October 2017 and are nearing completion. Finalisation of instruction for Phase B main works in parallel allows these works to commence;</p>  <p>- Market engagement with Irish and international contractors identified this procurement approach would attract increased competition in a situation where there are a very limited number of contractors with the ability to undertake a project of this scale. This was borne out by the competitive nature of the tender process with 5 contractors short-listed for the main contract, 4 for the mechanical installation and 4 for the electrical installation;</p>  <p>- Claims are addressed up front, prior to main construction, rather than as is traditional throughout the project and beyond;</p>  <p>- Reduce exposure to rising inflationary pressures in the construction market through procurement at 2016 tender market rates (versus 2018 tender rates);</p>  <p>- Provide opportunity for the 3 contractors (main contractor and Mechanical &amp;amp; Electrical contractors) to influence/interrogate the detailed design and assume contractual responsibility for completeness including quantities at end of Stage 2 Design;</p>  <p>- The programmes for main works are fully aligned across 3 contractors with a single point accountability for site management.</p>  <p>- Project substantially de-risked in relation to ground conditions with Phase A nearing completion prior to instructing and commencing the main hospital build (Phase B); and</p>  <p>- Incorporation of streamlined dispute resolution including using an independent expert whose decisions are binding on all parties.</p>  <p>  A Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) is determined prior to the instruction to proceed with the main Phase B works (with the GMP only adjustable for clearly defined exclusions such as changes in scope, excess national construction tender inflation above 4% post July 2019, changes in legislation (e.g. VAT, PRSI, statutory labour rates, building regulations). Other than in respect of exclusions, the GMP ceiling cannot be exceeded with any amount in excess not recoverable by contractors.</p></reply>

Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the Memorandum from the Cabinet Agenda at the time. I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.  </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

Research has shown that as many as 1 in 100 people are likely to be at risk of developing iron overload. However this fact alone is not sufficient to commence a population based screening programme.</p>  <p>  There are well established international criteria to be met before a national population based screening programme can be recommended. The current position of the UK National Screening Committee is that a systematic population screening programme is not recommended.</p>  <p>  Arising from a recommendation from the Scally Report (2018) a National Screening Committee (NSC) will be established and become operational in Ireland during the course of 2019. The NSC will be responsible for advising the Minister and Department of Health on all new proposals for screening and revisions of existing programmes.</p></reply>

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

There has been significant progress on age appropriate admissions since 2008 when there were 247 such admissions to adult units. This declined to 84 admissions in 2018. The number of  admissions each year does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children involved, as an individual may be admitted on more than one occasion.</p>  <p>  There has to be some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements occur, and where full account is taken of all relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, or geographical factors relating to access or visiting. This may in practice be the best care option in at least some cases, bearing in mind all the circumstances. The HSE closely monitors  on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units, with a view to minimising these. It also facilitates insofar as possible transition from CAMHS to Adult services.</p>  <p>  Work is underway by the HSE to review existing levels of service provision generally, and to examine international models of best practice on the most appropriate models of delivery for use in the Irish context in order to enhance access to mental health care, including CAMHS. My objective, and that of the HSE, is to further improve all aspects of mental health care nationally for those under age 18, including those relating to access and age appropriate care settings.</p></reply>

Of the 12 ordinary members, three shall be appointed to represent the interests of the general public; three shall be appointed on the nomination of the Chairperson; two shall be appointed on the nomination of the Health Service Executive; one shall be appointed on the nomination of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin; one shall be appointed on the nomination of the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street; one shall be appointed on the nomination of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Tallaght; and one shall be appointed on the nomination of the Faculty of Paediatrics, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</p><p>In 2007, the Chairperson and ordinary board members that were appointed collectively had wide-ranging experience and expertise in areas such as public and private sector management, capital infrastructure management, finance, ICT, construction, communications, health and hospital management, and paediatric medicine.</p><p>Following An Bord Plean&aacute;la's refusal for Mater site project<b></b>an interim Board of officials was appointed in January 2013 until July 2013, when a new Board was appointed to progress the project on the St. James's campus.  The skill set associated with the new Board includes construction management, legal expertise, engineering and environmental consultancy, architecture, paediatric medicine, planning, procurement, accountancy, ICT and hospital management. This Board was re-appointed in July 2018 on expiry of their five-year term of office.  As noted above, as provided for under the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (Establishment) Order 2007, two of the Board members are appointed on the nomination of the HSE, and three to represent the interests of the general public.  It is under that latter provision that the official from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was appointed.</p><p>The Children's Health Act 2018 amended the Board appointment process to better reflect the Board's primary role which is to deliver on the capital project, rather than its previous broader remit which also included operational planning for the services, the latter now being a matter for Children's Health Ireland.  To allow for the appointment of a Board under the new provisions sooner than on the expiry of the five-year term of office, the Act also includes a provision which, when commenced, provides for the cessation of membership of the Board in place at the time of commencement of the provision. </p><p>As set out in the NPHDB Annual Reports, a total of 42 individuals have been appointed to the NPHDB to date since its establishment in 2007.</p></reply>

They can also avail of specialist disability services, which are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory and community groups.</p>  <p>  There are a number of non-statutory organisations specifically focused on addressing the needs of the deaf community.

However, there are a number of other funding options available to the Irish Deaf Society. It has received funding, in the past, from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Education and Skills. It has also received grants from the Department of Justice and Equality and the national lottery.  </p>  <p>  I am currently working with colleagues in government to see if this issue can be resolved and I remain hopeful of a positive outcome.</p></reply>

This includes opening the new centre at Connolly in 2019, including the recruitment of the relevant staff to support the expansion of a consultant-delivered workforce and increased capacity through additional outpatient clinics. As set out in the 2019 HSE National Service Plan, development funding of &euro;6.7m has been provided for a number of specific paediatric service initiatives, this includes revenue funding for the further recruitment of the workforce for the paediatric outpatients and urgent care centre on the campus shared with Connolly Hospital. </p>  <p>  A total of 13 consultant posts are required and were approved by the Department of Health to support the opening of the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly.  Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland, CHI, has confirmed that to date 10 of these positions have been filled and recruitment is ongoing for the remaining posts. Recruitment for nursing, HSCPS and administrative positions at the Centre is also at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  While it is acknowledged that there are recruitment challenges nationally, and internationally, in certain specialties such as radiology and this challenge has been shared by CHI, recruitment is ongoing, and Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland at Connolly is on schedule to open in July 2019.  </p></reply>

GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service. GPs are also remunerated for services they provide on behalf of the HSE under other public health schemes, such as the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, etc.</p>  <p>  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009 imposed a range of adjustments to health contractor payments. These included different levels of reductions to various GP fees and allowances and the elimination of certain payments.</p>  <p>  Despite reductions to the payment rates of health contractors made under FEMPI legislation, the total fees paid to GPs under the GMS scheme have increased from just over &euro;472 million in 2009 to approximately &euro;525 million in 2017. This increase in fees is largely due to significant developments and investment in GP services introduced in recent years, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional financial support provided by the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 now allows the setting and varying of contractor payments on a non-emergency statutory basis. It is my intention to put in place a new multi annual approach to fees in return for service improvements and contractual reforms based upon health policy considerations and engagement with representative bodies.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the HSE are currently engaged in talks with the Irish Medical Organisation in relation to the reform and modernisation of the GMS contract. Agreement on the delivery of service improvements and contractual reform has the potential to facilitate a substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multi annual basis. Of course, any agreement must benefit patients an provide value for the taxpayer. </p>  <p>  In line with the long-established approach to such processes, and by agreement of the parties concerned, I am not in a position to give further details while engagement between the parties is underway. </p></reply>

After six weeks, the sample is deemed expired and cannot be processed. Although every effort is made to avoid these situations from happening, it is inevitable that cervical screening programmes will sometimes encounter these issues; in some cases, the increased volume of smear tests in 2018 resulted in a delay transferring samples to slides. </p>  <p>  However, in the period April to December 2018, a proportion of overall cervical screening samples were not transferred to slides within the six-week timeframe. Repeat testing was required in 550 cases or 0.25% of total samples. This compares with a rate of 0.23% for the same period in 2017. In line with normal practice where this occurs, CervicalCheck contacted these women, and their GPs, to inform them of this issue and to invite them to attend a repeat smear test in three months&rsquo; time (repeat tests can only be carried out three months after the last test to allow time for cells to grow back).</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the increase in the volume of smear tests in 2018. This followed on from a period of significant concern for women. This includes women who have availed of out of cycle tests, following my request to CervicalCheck to make the necessary arrangements to enable them to do so without charge where their GP considered they should have a further test as part of their reassurance. I am advised it also includes a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening.  This increased level of engagement with the programme is welcome. </p>  <p>  However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put immense pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan to take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. </p>  <p>  The development time for cervical cancer is between ten and fifteen years, so it is important that women of screening age attend for cervical screening each time they are invited to participate. The HSE has advised that in this context, a delay in the return of cervical screening results, whilst undesirable, is not necessarily dangerous and poses a very low risk to women. </p></reply>

This decision was made in good faith to address the considerable fears of the many anxious women in Ireland as a result of significant media coverage of the issues that emerged in late April.  </p>  <p>  In the months since then, there has been a significant increase in the volume of women presenting for smear tests. This includes women who have availed of the out of cycle tests, but also a greater number of women presenting for scheduled screening.  </p>  <p>  This increased level of engagement with the programme is very welcome. However, the increased demand has undoubtedly put pressure on lab capacity and turnaround times. </p>  <p>  The HSE has been working actively with the labs to manage this issue and to improve turnaround times for smear tests. In addition, the HSE is aiming to source additional screening capacity, which would improve the turnaround time of results; however, sourcing capacity and resources is a global challenge as countries start to move to primary HPV screening, which vastly reduces the requirement for cytology screening staff. The HSE is currently developing a capacity plan, which will take account of available capacity and expected demand, with the aim of bringing the programme into stabilisation this year. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. </p>  <p>  The HSE advises that the CervicalCheck Programme has recently agreed with laboratories to prioritise those slides which originate from women who attended colposcopy, as this cohort of women are considered to have the most serious need. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to him. </p></reply>

Together, they will provide all secondary, or less specialised, acute paediatric care for children from the Greater Dublin Area. Furthermore this hospital will also be the single national tertiary/quaternary centre for highly specialised paediatric care for children from all over Ireland with the critical mass to deliver best outcomes.     </p>  <p>  The Outpatient and Urgent Care Centres will improve geographic access to urgent care for children in the Greater Dublin Area. Consultant-led urgent care, with 4-6 hour observation beds, appropriate diagnostics and secondary outpatient services including rapid access general paediatric clinics as well as child sexual abuse unit examination, observation and therapy rooms will be provided in the Outpatient and Urgent Care Centres. The centre at Connolly will also include two HSE paediatric care primary care dental services operating theatres.</p>  <p>  An international cost benchmarking study commissioned by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to identify construction costs for similar large scale international hospital projects, sourced data provided in relation to 10 projects ranging in size from 45,000 sq.m to 350,000 sq.m.  The report concluded that, in terms of cost per sq.m, the new children's hospital was at the higher end but aligned with similar projects, reflecting that the cost per sq.m of &euro;6,500 matches international norms.</p>  <p>  The cost per sq.m range is inevitably impacted by the individual briefs  for each of these projects and the limitations of international cost benchmarking generally. There are challenges in drawing cost comparisons between the national children's hospital due to be completed in 2022 and an 18,000 square metre 148 bed, children&rsquo;s hospital in Germany which is already open. With its focus on education, research and innovation, the new children&rsquo;s hospital will also be a research-intensive academic healthcare institution, which creates a path between the patient, the classroom and the laboratory.  In relation to bed numbers, the number and breakdown in type of bed across the three sites reflects the new model of care which has been planned and designed in a sustainable manner to deliver modern paediatric care now and into the future. </p></reply>

The HSE's Social Care Directorate and its National Capital and Property Steering Group have accepted recommendations from HSE CHO 1 to retain and upgrade both facilities, in the context of future capacity requirements for these areas. This revises the original decision to replace the existing long stay residential beds on both sites as part of the Capital Investment Programme for Public Residential Care Centres for Older People 2016. It further revises the scale of the proposed new unit at Letterkenny from the original 130 beds to 110 beds. Importantly, the decision to revise the proposals was informed not just by the technical and feasibility studies in relation to the physical infrastructure in these two sites but also on the basis of a broader analysis of population projections and National Planning norms carried out by the HSE. </p>  <p>  The need for additional beds and the potential to develop a replacement facility to the existing community nursing unit in Lifford will be reviewed further post 2021, when new Census data is available and the Health Service Capacity Review and the National Development Plan have been advanced.

To date the Committee has met on 10 occasions.  Some 31 different stakeholder groups have been represented at these meetings, including the main farming organisations. </p>  <p>  I have also taken the opportunity through the All-Island Civic Dialogue process to discuss with the farming organisations here the challenges presented by Brexit, and of course have met with them on a regular basis outside of these formal occasions to monitor and discuss developments. This engagement has been very useful in helping not only to quantify the scale of the challenge facing the agri-food sector, and to discuss possible approaches to preparedness and contingency planning, but it has also helped to inform my approach to the negotiations, through the whole-of-Government approach being co-ordinated by the Department of Foreign Affairs. </p>  <p>  While I have not had any formal meetings with the main Northern Ireland farming organisations, I have on occasion met with representatives of these organisations through the All Island Civic Dialogue process, and in the context of discussing developments with political representatives from the Oireachtas and from the Northern Ireland assembly.  Discussion at these meetings has generally focused on the Irish Government&rsquo;s commitment to the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland and discussion around the main asks of the negotiations from the Government's perspective, including continued access to the UK market without tariffs, and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.</p></reply>

The stock was subject to high harvest rates for more than four decades, and fisheries were not managed during this time. While dogfish is showing some signs of recovery from the historical lows of the mid 2000s, the period is very short in comparison to the longer-term historical decline.</p>  <p>  The spawning biomass of this species is at an extremely low level, although conservation measures in recent years have had an impact in terms of stabilising the decline. The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing. The scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) is that there should be no targeted fisheries in 2019 and 2020 and that any possible provision for landing of by-catch should only happen as part of a management plan, including close monitoring of the stock and fisheries. ICES also states that, based on medium term projections, any bycatch should not exceed 2,468 tonnes in  total for EU and Norwegian waters.</p>  <p>  For 2019, there is a very limited quota available (53t for Ireland) for use only in pilot schemes designed to reduce such by-catches. Any such schemes are subject to EU Commission approval and must relate to reducing by-catches of dogfish in other fisheries i.e. the targeting of dogfish would remain prohibited. Such a scheme for dogfish avoidance was explored by the Marine Institute and, following consultation with industry, a draft pilot scheme was submitted for review to the Commission&rsquo;s Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). </p>  <p>  STECF raised a number of queries about the proposed scheme, in particular on whether or not it would result in a reduction in catches of dogfish relative to the catches that would occur in the absence of a scheme. Having considered the STECF comments and concerns, the Marine Institute reviewed the draft scheme and has now advised that Ireland should not proceed further with the dogfish avoidance scheme but rather work collaboratively with other Member States and the Commission to explore possible bycatch reduction management measures. On the basis of the available scientific advice, there is no possibility of reintroducing a targeted fishery.  </p></reply>

This period coincides with the Food Wise 2025 Strategy which is the over- arching strategy for the Irish food and drink sector and allies it to the stated aims contained therein, to drive added value for Irish agricultural produce. The Strategic Objective of the new Organic Strategy is to create a consumer led viable Organic Food Sector in Ireland, enhancing the sustainability credentials of Irish Food, which will produce a wide range of organic products to meet increasing domestic and export market opportunities.</p><p>The targets per subsector are outlined hereunder as requested:<table><tr><th>Sub Sector</th><th>Target</th></tr><tr><td>Cereals &amp;amp; Pulses</td><td>To increase the area under organic cereals and pulses from 2,426 hectares in   2017 to 5,000 hectares</td></tr><tr><td>Dairy</td><td>To increase organic milk production annually by 10% over the lifetime of the plan with more significant increases possible thereafter. </td></tr><tr><td>Horticulture</td><td>To encourage import substitution where possible and increase the area under organic horticulture from 524 hectares in 2017 to 750 hectares. </td></tr><tr><td>Beef </td><td>To increase organic cattle production from 0.8% of total cattle in 2016 to 1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Sheep</td><td>To maximise organic sales to match current levels and pattern of supply, through a marketing campaign focussed on peak supply periods.</td></tr><tr><td>Aquaculture</td><td>To increase the quantity of salmon produced to organic standards from 20,000 tonnes to 26,000 tonnes.</td></tr><tr><td>Poultry/Eggs</td><td>To increase the area under organic cereals and pulses will impact positively on the potential for increased organic poultry.</td></tr></table>The targets set for the individual sub-sectors recognise the importance of promoting organic food production not alone having regard to market demand but also the imperative of climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection requirements.However, the targets recognise the current very low production levels and are set at a level to build a platform for further increases.  In this context the Organic Sector Strategy group recommended that the targets should be subject to review after five years.</p></reply>

It is also possible that there could be significant export certification requirements in respect of exports of agri-food and fisheries products to the UK post-Brexit. </p>  <p>  Work in this regard has been focused on three key areas, namely, infrastructure, staffing and information technology, and in three key locations, that is Dublin Port, Rosslare Port and Dublin Airport.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the state will be in a position to apply the relevant measures at the appropriate time.</p></reply>

Market development and diversification is also a key response to the challenges which Brexit poses for the agri-food, in particular, the beef sector.  </p><p>In April 2017 I launched a seven point action plan on market access. This is being implemented through a variety of actions, including, inter alia:</p><p>- A market prioritisation exercise and subsequent detailed studies carried out by Bord Bia on behalf of my Department. On meat the five &lsquo;deep dive&rsquo; countries selected for detailed study were: Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico &amp;amp; Malaysia</p><p>- A market access web portal was launched in May 2018, and available on my Department&rsquo;s website provides a wide range of valuable information to exporters.</p><p>- An enhanced programme of Government agri-food trade missions. All of these trade missions involve collaborative planning and participation by both my Department and Bord Bia</p><p>Beef market access has been a key feature of these missions and over the last two years, trade missions have focused on key growth markets such as:</p><p>- Asia - China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia;</p><p>- North America - USA, Mexico and Canada; as well as,</p><p>- The Gulf States and Turkey.</p><p>These missions included participants from across the agri-food sector and featured extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions.  These and the other missions that my Department has under consideration for the first half of 2019 will serve to enhance and improve our existing levels of market access in these destinations.</p><p>According to Bord Bia, in 2018 beef worth an estimated &euro;2.5 billion was exported. In 2018 a number of additional markets were opened by my Department including the Chinese beef market, and the markets for beef, sheepmeat and poultry in Kuwait and Qatar. In 2017 the Egyptian beef market was re-opened to Ireland and amended improved beef certificates were agreed with Singapore, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.  </p></reply>

The EU&rsquo;s MFN (Most Favoured Nation) Tariff Schedule was then applied to this export data.  This tariff schedule includes both ad valorem tariffs and tariffs per weight/unit of product, as set out in the EU&rsquo;s TARIC database. The imposition of tariffs is not a linear exercise, and the possible tariffs that could be imposed vary both within individual categories and the sector as a whole.  A calculation of tariff rate equivalents based on actual value and volume of trade in 2016 was completed, and is summarised in the table attached.</p><p>This analysis found that the estimated cost of potential tariffs for the sector as a whole is &euro;1.7 billion, based on Irish agri-food exports to the United Kingdom of &euro;4.8 billion in 2016.  </p><p>There are a number of important caveats which must be considered when examining these results, including:</p><p>- Tariff data used, is based on a TARIC database extract at 31 December 2016, with the exception of those commodities where tariff rates had changed during the years 2014, 2015, 2016;</p><p>- This analysis represented over 90% of agri-food exports to the United Kingdom between 2014 and 2016.</p><p>- This analysis does not take account of any possible tariff rate quotas (TRQs), nor does it account for non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade, including transport delays and additional administrative costs.</p><p>- The analysis does not include the impact of any changes to the Euro-Sterling exchange rate.</p><p>- In respect of live animal exports, the average tariff rate equivalent is 8%, however in 2016, 67% of total value of live animal exports were not subject to tariff. The estimated tariff on total live exports which are subject to tariffs is 24%, and for exports of live bovines the tariff rate equivalent is approximately 40%.</p><p>Additionally, for some sectors further analysis is ongoing due to the complexity of the tariff calculations, namely:</p><p>- While raw forestry products do not usually attract third country duties, processed wood based products such as MDF, and OSB are subject to ad valorem charges based on declared value.</p><p>- For Cereals and Cereal Preparations products, almost half of the top 20 commodities are subject to duties which are calculated based on complex compositional data of the ingredients used.</p><p>Third country duties for individual product lines can be found on the TARIC website using the eight digit combined nomenclature (CN) code:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p><b>Tariff rate equivalents of agri-food sector commodities, 2016</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Total Exports to the UK 2016</th><th>Est Duty as a % of the declared value</th><th>Total Est cost of tariff equiv. </th></tr><tr><td>Dairy</td><td>&euro;857,279,000</td><td>49%</td><td>&euro;422,547,000</td></tr><tr><td>Beef</td><td>&euro;1,113,448,000</td><td>70%</td><td>&euro;780,521,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sheepmeat</td><td>&euro;52,027,000</td><td>75%</td><td>&euro;38,996,000</td></tr><tr><td>Pigmeat</td><td>&euro;408,182,000</td><td>22%</td><td>&euro;90,595,000</td></tr><tr><td>Poultry</td><td>&euro;217,308,000</td><td>55%</td><td>&euro;118,817,000</td></tr><tr><td>Live Animals</td><td>&euro;259,200,000</td><td>8%</td><td>&euro;21,123,000</td></tr><tr><td>Eggs</td><td>&euro;10,877,000</td><td>19%</td><td>&euro;2,035,000</td></tr><tr><td>Other Meat &amp;amp; Meat Preps</td><td>&euro;46,949,000</td><td>18%</td><td>&euro;8,543,000</td></tr><tr><td>Fruit and Vegetables</td><td>&euro;239,155,000</td><td>14%</td><td>&euro;33,439,000</td></tr><tr><td>Fish</td><td>&euro;64,262,000</td><td>14%</td><td>&euro;8,900,000</td></tr><tr><td>Beverages</td><td>&euro;301,642,000</td><td>5%</td><td>&euro;14,250,000</td></tr><tr><td>Cereals &amp;amp; Cereal Preparations </td><td>&euro;339,582,000</td><td>14%</td><td>&euro;47,813,000</td></tr><tr><td>Animal Feedstuffs</td><td>&euro;211,769,000</td><td>8%</td><td>&euro;17,272,000</td></tr><tr><td>Misc.

However we did see a return to normal growing conditions in the autumn/early winter which provided farmers with an excellent opportunity to replenish fodder stocks.  </p>  <p>  My priority throughout last year was to support measures to assist in the conservation of as much fodder for this Winter/Spring as possible from within our own resources and to supplement this with necessary imports as required. To this end I introduced a number of targeted measures including:</p>  <p>  - a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been positive engagement with this measure.</p>  <p>  - a &euro;4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure sought to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage. The measure operated through the Co-operatives/registered importers and covered additional forage imported into the country. I am advised that there remains significant reserves of imported fodder in storage at present through these co-ops.</p>  <p>  The most recent national fodder survey conducted in January by Teagasc, on my behalf, and published in the last week indicates that the fodder deficit has receded further. The most recent statistics show that 73% of farmers have sufficient fodder to meet their livestock&rsquo;s requirements. Additionally the survey shows a steady decrease in the percentage of farms reporting deficits of over 10% since the last survey in October of last year (22% in October versus 15% in January).</p>  <p>  In relation to County Wexford, the recent Teagasc survey indicates that currently the level of deficit is below 5% </p>  <p>  It is important to stress that while the deficit nationally has been reduced significantly there still remains a fodder deficit on some farms and there is a need for farmers to remain vigilant and avoid complacency. I have urged Teagasc and the other Stakeholders to continue their individual efforts in support of those farmers worst affected and in need of help. </p>  <p>  Whilst it is not possible to predict the arrival of the spring and the end of the wintering period,  I can assure the Deputy that I, together with my officials will continue to closely monitor the fodder situation.  </p></reply>

Brexit depending on the outcome has the potential to have a very significant impact on farmers and on the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  There are on-going discussions with the Commission regarding the difficulties facing Ireland, and the assistance that might be required for its agriculture, food and fishing sectors. </p>  <p>  I and my officials have been working very hard for quite some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required in order to deal with these impacts. The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors. We discussed the unique exposure of these sectors to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors.</p>  <p>  The Commission has adopted a legislative proposal to help prepare for the potential significant impacts that a &ldquo;no-deal&rdquo; Brexit would have on Irish fisheries and this is currently before the Council and Parliament.   </p>  <p>  The proposal is to allow fishermen and operators from EU Members States to receive financial aid under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) for the temporary cessation of fishing activities. The aim of this is to help off-set some of the impact of a sudden closure of UK waters to EU fishing vessels in a no-deal scenario.</p>  <p>  While I welcome this measure as a useful first step I believe that additional measures, including further financing, over and above the EMFF, at EU level will be required.</p>  <p>  In that regard, I am continuing to work with the Commission and other concerned Member States to continue to develop EU wide measures to address the very serious potential problems that may arise. It cannot be left to individual Member States to address these problems in isolation. </p>  <p>  Ireland is particularly exposed with regard to the potential impacts for our fisheries sector.  I will be meeting with Fisheries Commissioner Vella next Monday to explore additional possible mitigation measures. </p></reply>

The provisions of the current Directive are reflected in Irish law in the Broadcasting Act 2009 and related statutory instruments.  </p>  <p>  In May 2016 the European Commission published a proposed revision of the AVMS Directive. The proposal was designed to update the rules and requirements in the AVMSD to reflect the rapid changes that the audiovisual media market is experiencing. The revised Directive updates existing requirements for television broadcasting and on-demand audiovisual media services and, for the first time, sets out rules and requirements for Video Sharing Platform Services, for example YouTube and Dailymotion.</p>  <p>  The text of the revised Directive has been adopted by the EU and was officially published on 27 November 2018. The deadline by which Ireland must implement the provisions is 19 September 2020.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the provisions of the revised Directive are implemented in Ireland in a robust and effective manner. Given that the final text has now been published, and the challenging legislative timeline involved, it is intended that a public consultation will commence shortly to gather the views and suggestions of stakeholders on how Ireland should approach the implementation of the provisions of the revised Directive.</p></reply>

In that context, engagement with local IFI officers and, where necessary, regional management brings legislative, operational and technical expertise, as well as local knowledge and understanding, to bear.

However I have undertaken to liaise with the Deputy who sought the meeting.</p>  <p>  In relation to high level strategic engagement, I am taking a lead role in liaison with angling stakeholders and intend to host a joint meeting of all established Angling Federations together with senior officials of my Department and IFI.

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality.</p>  <p>  Following a review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to develop a new Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP), which aims to enhance and build on current arrangements. One of the key objectives of the programme is to enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. The AAMP will more than double the capacity of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland over the period 2017 to 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. My Department has committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme. </p>  <p>  Hourly monitoring of PM10 and PM2.5 in Enniscorthy has been provided as part of this overall expansion of the national ambient air quality monitoring network. The new monitoring station in Enniscorthy, which is operated by Wexford County Council in partnership with the EPA, has recorded six exceedances of the daily PM10 limit value of 50 ug/m3 so far this year. During 2018 the station's annual average value exceeded the World Health Organisations (WHO) guideline value for PM2.5, along with other stations in the national monitoring network. However, it did not exceed the EU annual limit value for PM2.5. </p>  <p>  In the most recently published report on Irish air quality, Air Quality in Ireland 2017 &ndash; Indicators of Air Quality, the EPA outlines that the WHO PM10 24 hour guideline value was exceeded at 11 monitoring stations, the PM2.5 24 hour guideline value was exceeded at 9 monitoring stations, and the PM2.5 annual guideline was exceeded at 1 monitoring site. The 2017 data showing that the burning of solid fuel is the biggest threat to good air quality in Ireland, followed by emissions from vehicle exhausts.</p>  <p>  In relation to air pollution more generally, recent scientific evidence indicates that it is more damaging at lower concentrations than was previously understood. With this in mind, I am committed to bringing forward Ireland's first ever National Clean Air Strategy. The Strategy, which I intend to publish this year, will provide the policy framework necessary to identify and promote integrated measures across Government that are required to reduce air pollution and promote cleaner air, while delivering on wider national objectives. Domestic solid fuel use will be addressed in the context of the strategy.</p></reply>

The scheme was introduced in 2010 and requires suppliers of liquid road transport fuel to ensure that biofuels make up a certain percentage of annual fuel sales. It works on the basis of tradeable certificates with two certificates awarded per litre of sustainable biofuel if that biofuel is produced from wastes or residues and one certificate per litre for all other sustainable biofuels. </p>  <p>  For each calendar year, a fuel supplier must hold sufficient biofuel obligation certificates to demonstrate compliance. Suppliers can meet their obligation either by placing sufficient amounts of biofuel on the market themselves, or by purchasing certificates from other suppliers with a surplus. The number of certificates required is determined by the biofuel obligation rate which, for 2019, is set at 10% by volume. This means that at the end of the year, a fuel supplier must hold ten biofuel certificates for every 90 litres of fossil fuel they place on the road transport fuel market this year. </p>  <p>  Suppliers of gaseous transport fuels, such as compressed natural gas, are not currently subject to the above obligation. However, if a supplier was to place a renewable gaseous fuel, such as biomethane, on the road transport market, that supplier would be eligible to receive biofuel certificates for this fuel provided it meets the sustainability criteria set out in the scheme.</p>  <p>My Department plans to hold a public consultation on the Biofuels Obligation Scheme later this year which will provide the opportunity for stakeholders to input into the development of the scheme.   </p></reply>

Following on from the outcome of  judicial review proceedings regarding the scheme last year, my Department continues to liaise with the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure (DfI) regarding next steps in relation to the project and the timeframes involved. </p>  <p>  DfI now intends to issue for consultation an Addendum to its previously published Environmental Statement. This should result in a new decision which may in turn be the subject of a further legal challenge. In this context it is not possible to state definitively when construction of Phase 1a of the A5 project will commence. </p>  <p>  Allowing for the time required for public consultation on the scheme statutory documentation, a new DfI decision on the scheme and the possibility of a further legal challenge, it is understood that late 2019 is the earliest that construction could start subject to a decision to proceed with the scheme and the outcome of any further legal challenges.  In the event of a further legal challenge, it could be early 2020 before construction could start.  </p>  <p>  It is envisaged that payments from the Irish State will be based on an agreed protocol and would be linked to the achievement of construction stage milestones.  In that context, the provision of funding in the financial year 2019 is no longer considered appropriate and accordingly it has been identified as a budgetary adjustment which could be made this year without direct impact on the progress of projects included in Project Ireland 2040. </p></reply>

While there will be no undue delay in completing the assessment process, in view of the opportunity to correct documentation, the record number of applications received and the detailed information contained in each application, it is likely to take a number of months to have all applications assessed. Accordingly, I expect that it will be at least the second quarter of this year before the full set of allocations under this current round of the programme are announced.   </p></reply>

Technically, the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company, which is a 19th-century joint-venture company, consisting today of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the Irish side and Stena line on the Welsh (Fishguard) side. </p>  <p>  The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was considered in a strategic review, commissioned by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants. Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.</p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment, the Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by the Department.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities. The port is targeting growth and new business opportunities and recently received the approval of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Board for a strategic plan to grow the port&rsquo;s business.</p>  <p>  This includes investment plans for up to &euro;25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets and new technology.  The port is engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department late last year on the company's plans for strategic development of the port over the coming years.</p>  <p>  Finally, Brexit will have implications for a number of key ports and airports and Rosslare continues to work closely with my Department and a range of other relevant Government Departments and Offices in preparing for the additional border controls that will arise from Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In this context, my Department has met Rosslare Port management on a number of occasions over the past year, most recently last month, about the infrastructural requirements of the port in connection with Brexit.  My Department has also been meeting ferry and shipping companies regarding their plans for dealing with the challenges of Brexit.</p></reply>

Models currently available in Ireland can achieve ranges of up to 400km on a single charge. As battery technology continues to improve, it can be assumed that in time all consumers, including those based in very isolated rural areas, will be able to confidently transition away from traditionally fuelled vehicles to EVs. It is clear that this transition is already underway, with a marked increase in EV sales in the first month of this year. Of course, EVs are not the only alternative fuel or technology available to reduce transport emissions.  A wider range of alternative fuels and technologies, particularly for the heavy duty sector, must be incorporated into the national fuel mix if we are to decarbonise the sector.</p>  <p>  The potential future role of compressed natural gas (CNG) and biomethane is currently being evaluated by the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, which is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. CNG is particularly considered a suitable alternative to diesel in the freight sector. It is reported to emit few emissions, particularly NOx, SOx and particulate matter and importantly, acts as a pathway fuel to renewable biomethane which can dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. The anaerobic digestion industry, which produces biomethane, is also an important developing industry which could support a circular economy between the transport and agricultural sectors, while improving national fuel security and contributing towards sectoral targets to 2030 under the Renewable Energy Directive.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a number of valuable measures are already in place to encourage the uptake of CNG and biomethane vehicles in Ireland.  In Budget 2015 the Government committed to maintaining the duty levels for natural gas and biomethane as a propellant at the EU minimum rate of &euro;2.60 per GJ for a period of eight years, putting natural gas in a very competitive price position with diesel. In Budget 2019 an accelerated capital allowance scheme was also introduced for gas-propelled vehicles and related equipment. This enables businesses to write down the purchase cost of such vehicles or equipment up-front in the year of purchase rather than spread over 8 years. Furthermore, the on-going deliberations of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce will include, inter alia, the role of further incentives, potential obligation schemes, and the requirement for additional fuelling infrastructure in promoting alternative and low emitting fuels including CNG. It is expected that the Taskforce will deliver its findings and recommendations to the Government later this year.</p></reply>

The Office of the Chief State Solicitor acts on behalf of the Department to ensure that all legal requirements are completed.</p>  <p>  In order for the Department to issue formal approval and allow for the subsequent payment to the club referred to by the Deputy, the Chief State Solicitor's Office must confirm that the legal formalities are complete.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>  <p>  Before the financial crisis, local authorities could apply on a regular basis for grants for Specific  (schemes costing less than &euro;5m) and Strategic Improvement Grants (schemes costing more than &euro;5m) for the strengthening, widening or realignment of regional and local  roads.  However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant this grant scheme had to be curtailed from 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The current Capital Plan does provide for the gradual build-up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required even for the basic maintenance and renewal of the network.  For this reason, there continues to be very limited scope for funding new or additional projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under these Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis.  All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and the Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF) and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind. </p>  <p>  As regards the Tir Chonaill bridge, Donegal town, the 2019 grant allocation for the rehabilitation of the bridge is &euro;900,000.  The estimated total cost of the project is &euro;1.8 million.</p>  <p>  In relation to Fintra bridge, an allocation of &euro;150,000 is being provided in 2019 for the scheme which is at route option selection stage.</p></reply>

There were three expressions of interest received for new pools, two of which were valid , one in Lucan and Ballyogan in Dublin. The third was in North Kildare but was not valid as the Council did not have title to the proposed site. Following an examination of the valid proposals it was decided to include a new swimming pool in Lucan in the LASPP.</p>  <p>  The National Sports Policy was published on 25th July 2018 and provided for a Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100 million available over the coming years.  The fund was launched in November 2018 and is open to applications until 17 April 2019. The fund will initially focus on the requirements and development plans of National Governing Bodies of Sport and Local Authorities, all of which received letters inviting them to make applications.  Swimming Pool projects will be considered for funding. The full details of the programme are available on the Department's website.</p></reply>

Safeguarding the continuing free flow of trade is a priority for my Department in preparing for Brexit.</p>  <p>  In this context, the National Development Plan sets out a range of Investments that will strongly support the continued development and improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s ports and State airports by the relevant commercial  State bodies, consistent with sectoral priorities already defined through National Ports Policy and National Aviation Policy, in addition to continued Exchequer support for the small regional airports. </p>  <p>  Significant investment currently and over the coming years in Ireland&rsquo;s airports and ports will play a major role in safeguarding and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international connectivity which is fundamental to Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness, trading performance in both goods and services and enhancing its attractiveness to foreign direct investment.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, and In light of the UK&rsquo;s intention to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, physical infrastructure will be required for customs, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and health checks and controls at Dublin Port, Rosslare Harbour and Dublin Airport.  </p>  <p>  The establishment of these controls for both a withdrawal agreement and a no-deal exit scenario is being undertaken by the OPW and overseen by an Interdepartmental Group at Secretary General level, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform.  The Group has focussed on these three locations for which we are heavily dependent on connectivity to the UK.   </p>  <p>  In 2018, my Department, in conjunction with the Irish Maritime Development Office, commissioned a Ports Capacity Study to assess capacity within the Irish port system to meet present and future demand. Work on the study is ongoing.</p>  <p>  The Department has also assessed the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the UK Landbridge.  Based on consultations with the shipping sector and wider, the preliminary assessment is that sufficient capacity will be available on direct routes to continental ports from end March 2019, and should demand for further capacity arise, the shipping sector can respond quickly to meet such demands.</p></reply>

In addition, the media coverage of sports events helps to put Ireland onto travel itineraries as a holiday destination.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, I am very supportive of the work of the tourism agencies and the national governing bodies of sport to attract international events, subject, of course, to an assessment of the costs and benefits involved in any State financial support, in particular the number of overseas visitors.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland provides financial assistance, subject to eligibility criteria, to applicants who are proposing to bid to host international events (including sporting events) in Ireland that would attract significant numbers of international visitors.  When an event with international tourism appeal is confirmed for Ireland, Tourism Ireland would then promote it in relevant markets overseas.  </p>  <p>  In terms of forthcoming sporting events, as the Deputy is aware, following a successful collaborative bid from the Football Association of Ireland, Dublin City Council and my Department, Ireland will host four games as part of the UEFA EURO 2020 football tournament in June 2020.  Ireland will also host the UEFA European Under 17 Championships in 2019 and, in American Football, Navy and Notre Dame will return to Ireland in 2020 for a high profile US college football game having previously played here in 2012.</p>  <p>  Minister Ross and I also support efforts to explore possibilities to host other major sporting events.  With regard to soccer, we welcomed the announcement by the FAI and IFA of their intention to submit a joint bid to host the UEFA European Under 21 Championships in 2023.  In addition, the national football associations of England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland are in discussions about the feasibility of bidding to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup and those considerations are at an early stage.  In the sport of golf, we are exploring the opportunities that may exist for hosting the Ryder Cup in Ireland in the future.</p></reply>

The Attorney General cited a number of considerations, most notably the significant potential for the review to have a prejudicial effect on ongoing criminal proceedings.</p>  <p>  In light of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice, Minister Flanagan and I have agreed to postpone the review rather than risk affecting matters before the courts. Matters may be revisited at a later date to determine if further action is warranted and, if so, the form that such action might take.</p></reply>

Attempts by Tusla to secure continuing commercial cover have proved unsuccessful. </p>  <p>  As I have mentioned in previous replies, pending a permanent solution, all foster carers have an indemnity on an individual basis where required.  This is on an ex-gratia basis as a temporary measure to address immediate individual cases while the overall indemnification issues are being resolved. </p>  <p>  Again, the Deputy will be aware that, I fully support extending State indemnity to foster carers.  My Department has been in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter, and my intention is to include foster carers under the General Indemnity Scheme operated by the State Claims Agency as soon as possible. In this regard, work is ongoing with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to draft the necessary Order for Government. </p>  <p>  This process has taken longer than expected due to a number of technical issues arising in the course of the approvals process. These issues need to be resolved to ensure that foster carers will have the necessary cover to carry out their very important role. I am currently awaiting confirmation from the Office of Parliamentary Council that the last of these issues is now settled. When this is confirmed and the draft Order is finalised, it will be possible to proceed to its submission for Government approval in the usual manner. </p>  <p>  I have spoken to the Irish Foster Carers Association (IFCA) on this matter, most recently at a meeting on 17 January, and recognise that this is of considerable interest to the association and to all foster carers. My officials have kept IFCA up to date on a continuous basis. In addition, I understand that Tusla has also made publicly available the information provided to IFCA so as to communicate the position to those foster carers who are not members of that association.</p>  <p> I am hopeful that this matter will be resolved shortly.</p></reply>

Ultimately, this streamlining will tangibly reduce the overall administration which childcare providers will be required to undertake.</p>  <p>  To allow for continuity of service, the existing childcare programmes will continue to operate until the launch of the Affordable Childcare Scheme. </p>  <p>  Applications for the existing programmes can still be made up until the new Scheme goes live in October. After this time, no new applications for these existing schemes will be allowed.</p>  <p>  To make the transition as smooth and safe as possible, families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme immediately on its launch or to remain on their existing programme for a final programme year. </p>  <p>  The free preschool programme, ECCE, will not be affected by these changes.</p>  <p>  As part of the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme, considerable, sustained engagement has taken place with consultative and focus groups to inform the design and development of the system. Childcare providers have been, and continue to be, integral to this process.</p>  <p>  My Department will shortly be rolling out a comprehensive programme of information, training and supports for parents, providers and other stakeholders.  Training for childcare providers will be provided across multiple platforms, including classroom-based and online, up until the launch date. This training will be tailored and timed to suit the needs of busy childcare providers, and has been designed to ensure that childcare providers are well prepared to operate the Scheme in advance of its launch.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will subsidise the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of parents, many of whom, to date, have not been able to access such support. As such, it is imperative that DCYA acts as quickly as it can to introduce the new scheme, whilst of course offering supports to providers to assist them with the transition. It is important to note that the new scheme is also increasing investment in childcare services and accounts for some of the 117% increase in budget to the childcare sector over the last 4 years, from circa &euro;260m in 2015 to &euro;575m in 2019.</p></reply>

These young people are offered a wide range of services from different State actors including income supports, health supports, accommodation and education. </p>  <p>  The aftercare provisions of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015 came into force on the first of September 2017. This means that there is now a statutory obligation on Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to prepare an aftercare plan for each eligible child and young person. This plan encompasses the range of supports that a young person may need from all service providers, including Tusla, to help them make the transition to independent adult life.</p>  <p>  For young people with a disability or mental health support need, aftercare planning forms the basis of discussions between Tusla and the HSE to effectively manage the transition from child to adult services, based on assessed need. This is facilitated by Tusla via the local Aftercare Steering Group, with the HSE participating in the planning process and taking responsibility for the provision of the required services.</p>  <p>  Following national consultation in 2017, a standardised aftercare allowance was introduced on the first of January 2018. The allowance currently amounts to &euro;300 a week. Continuing in further education or training entitles the young person to receive the standardised aftercare allowance even after they turn 21. Where a young person in education or training remains with their former foster carer, the aftercare allowance is payable to the foster carer and a living allowance is agreed with the foster parent, the aftercare worker and the young adult.  Where the young person continues with education or training and is in independent living, they directly receive the allowance.</p>  <p>  Finally, and as the Deputy is aware, the provision of services for adults with disability or mental health related needs fall within the remit of the Health Service Executive.</p></reply>

As of 8th February, 2019, there were 224 young people in private residential care. </p>  <p>  In deciding to place a young person in a residential centre, Tusla must take into account a number of variables to determine if the placement is suitable.  Such factors include the individual requirements of the young person in need of a placement, the existing requirements of the young people currently in the residential centre and the staffing, additional supports, geographical profile, age/gender and purpose and function of the centre in question.</p>  <p>  Tusla have also indicated that there are 38 young people who currently require placement in a private residential setting. </p>  <p>  The requirements for private residential placements to meet the changing, complex and individual needs of children and young people vary on a daily basis. Due to this shifting pattern of complex need there may not be sufficient placements, at a given time, in private residential care to meet placement demand.   </p>  <p>  Tusla's National Private Placement Team (NPPT) review private residential centre vacancies on a daily basis. In the event of private centres reaching their capacity; or having no appropriate vacancies, the NPPT team continue to review vacancies daily and, as suitable vacancies arise, the appropriate referral and supporting information is issued to the identified private service provider.</p>  <p>  For children awaiting private placements, it should be noted that Tusla actively manage their needs. For some, this takes place in a temporary residential setting. Others are supported in their community until a private residential placement, appropriate to their need, is available. </p></reply>

These projects, targeting young people under the various pillars of the National Drug Strategy, provide a range of supports for young people by way of targeted drug prevention and awareness programmes as well as referrals. </p><p>The Value for Money and Policy Review of the Youth Funding programmes 2014 examined four of the targeted funding schemes, the Special Projects for Youth scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund 1 &amp;amp; 2, and Local Drug Task Force projects scheme. The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of a complex area to do with the impact youth service provision has in young people&rsquo;s lives.</p><p>Overall, the review had three key messages:</p><p>- The youth programmes can provide a significant contribution to improving outcomes for young people and should be considered for on-going public funding.</p><p>-The current model of performance management, governance and scheme design are not fit for purpose and needed complete reform</p><p>- A single scheme should replace the current four schemes with a clear focus on targeted young people.</p><p>The review makes a number of recommendations for the future operation of a new youth funding schemes to ensure an evidence-informed and outcomes focussed programme is designed to secure the optimal outcomes for young people.</p><p>As a result of the VFMPR report my Department is managing the most significant reform of youth services ever undertaken. This will provide an opportunity to identify need and to focus funding on young people most in need of intervention.</p><p>In advance of the introduction of a new single targeted funding scheme in 2020, a transition phase in 2019 will see the funding previously provided under the four funding programmes, including the LDTF funding, collapsed into one funding stream for 2019 to assist with preparations for the new scheme in 2020.</p><p>The tables below set out below are the Local Drug Task Force funding allocations for the past five years.<table><tr><th>LDTF </th><th>2018</th><th>2017</th><th>2016</th></tr><tr><td>CDYSB Projects</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Administration</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>&euro;33,336</td></tr><tr><td>Ballyfermot Youth Service - LDTF</td><td>&euro;89,850</td><td>&euro;77,450</td><td>&euro;73,762</td></tr><tr><td>Bonnybrook Youth Project (Sphere 17)</td><td>&euro;123,264</td><td>&euro;120,864</td><td>&euro;115,108</td></tr><tr><td>BRYR (Ballymun Regional Youth Resource)</td><td>&euro;114,271</td><td>&euro;106,871</td><td>&euro;101,782</td></tr><tr><td>Charlemount Community Assocation (SAYS)</td><td>&euro;48,420</td><td>&euro;46,558</td><td>&euro;44,341</td></tr><tr><td>Cork Street &amp;amp; Maryland Community Project (DAYS - Donore   Avenue Youth Service)</td><td>&euro;31,013</td><td>&euro;49,051</td><td>&euro;46,716</td></tr><tr><td>Crosscare (Ballybough)</td><td>&euro;51,162</td><td>&euro;49,194</td><td>&euro;46,852</td></tr><tr><td>Crosscare - L.E.A.P.P.</td><td>&euro;129,272</td><td>&euro;126,872</td><td>&euro;120,830</td></tr><tr><td>Finglas Youth Resource Centre</td><td>&euro;84,918</td><td>&euro;82,518</td><td>&euro;78,589</td></tr><tr><td>St. Michaels Youth Project</td><td>&euro;47,681</td><td>&euro;45,847</td><td>&euro;45,183</td></tr><tr><td>St. Andrew's Youth Resource Centre</td><td>&euro;54,340</td><td>&euro;47,442</td><td>&euro;43,664</td></tr><tr><td>SWICN - South West Inner City Network</td><td>&euro;43,503</td><td>&euro;41,830</td><td>&euro;39,838</td></tr><tr><td>Sub-Total</td><td>&euro;817,694</td><td>&euro;794,497</td><td>&euro;790,001</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB Projects - Co Dublin</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Administration</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a </td><td>&euro;17,859</td></tr><tr><td>Ballyogan Youth Project </td><td>&euro;44,489</td><td>&euro;42,778</td><td>&euro;40,741</td></tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown Peer Drug Ed.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-12a.1756.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019021200084#WREE01600"><p>I wish to thank the Deputy for the matters raised. There appears to be three main areas of concern which centre on the following: the Board of Pobal, the Affordable Childcare Scheme and attendance records for childcare places under my Department's programmes. I will address these separately below.</p>  <p>  Part 1: Pobal Board:</p>  <p>  Pobal operates under the aegis of the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD). The Board of Pobal are appointed by the Minister of Rural and Community Development via the Public Appointments Service process. Consequently, any decisions regarding the structure of Pobal require the consideration of my cabinet colleague, Minister Ring, the officials of his department, and the Pobal Board. Notwithstanding this fact, Pobal does indeed administer a number of programmes and schemes on behalf of my Department and consequently, my officials liaised with their counterparts in DRCD with respect to the make-up of the Pobal Board upon its latest renewal.</p>  <p>  On foot of this interdepartmental engagement, it is my understanding that my cabinet colleague has due regard for the benefits of direct expertise on the board of Pobal, recognising the importance of appointing persons from diverse backgrounds; with knowledge pertaining to the activities of Pobal. This due regard takes place in the context of ensuring a significant cohort of Pobal&rsquo;s board are equipped for the proper governance of the company, with respect to risk management, finance, governance, audit, etc. In the context of these multi-faceted concerns, I can confirm that the newly appointed Pobal board takes cognisance of the important role early learning and care and school age childcare plays in the overall delivery of Pobal&rsquo;s services. Accordingly, there are now four members of Pobal&rsquo;s board with extensive experience of the early years and youth sectors at policy and practitioner level:</p>  <p>  - Ms. Patricia Ball O&rsquo;Keeffe  - qualified solicitor and consultant on child and family law issues</p>  <p>  - Ms. Ann Hanley &ndash; Cavan County Childcare Committee employee</p>  <p>  - Ms. Mary Mooty &ndash; extensive experience in the youth and childcare sectors  and presently employed by Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board</p>  <p>  - Mr. Fintan Breen  - National Programme Co-ordinator for the Leadership for Inclusion in Early Years (LINC) programme developed under the ECCE Access and Inclusion Model</p>  <p>  It should be noted for the sake of clarity, that my Department sets policy and Pobal implements this and administers schemes on behalf of my Department. The services Pobal provides to my Department are managed under a multi-level governance framework, specifically service level agreements, programmes of work, and individual programme agreements, all of which are monitored closely via regular high level management meetings.</p>  <p>  Part 2: Affordable Childcare Scheme:</p>  <p>  The DCYA is planning for the Affordable Childcare Scheme to launch in October 2019, replacing all previous targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme. Ultimately, this streamlining will tangibly reduce the overall administration which childcare providers will be required to undertake.</p>  <p>   To allow for continuity of service, the existing childcare programmes will continue to operate until the launch of the Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  Applications for the existing programmes can still be made up until the new Scheme goes live in October. After this time, no new applications for these existing schemes will be allowed.</p>  <p>  To make the transition as smooth and safe as possible, existing registrants / families can choose to make the switch to the new Scheme immediately on its launch or to remain on their existing programme for a final programme year.</p>  <p>  The free preschool programme, ECCE, will not be affected by these changes.</p>  <p>  As part of the development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme, considerable, sustained engagement has taken place with consultative and focus groups to inform the design and development of the system. Childcare providers have been, and continue to be, integral to this process.</p>  <p>  My Department will shortly be rolling out a comprehensive programme of information, training and supports for parents, providers and other stakeholders.  Training for childcare providers will be provided across multiple platforms, including classroom-based and online, up until the launch date. This training will be tailored and timed to suit the needs of busy childcare providers, and has been designed to ensure that childcare providers are well prepared to operate the Scheme in advance of its launch.</p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will subsidise the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of parents, many of whom, to date, have not been able to access such support. As such, it is imperative that DCYA acts as quickly as it can to introduce the new scheme, whilst of course offering supports to providers to assist them with the transition. It is important to note that the new scheme is also increasing investment in childcare services and accounts for some of the 117% increase in budget to the childcare sector over the last 4 years, from circa &euro;260m in 2015 to &euro;575m in 2019.</p>  <p>  Part 3: Attendance versus registration only</p>  <p>  For all of the early learning and care and school age childcare programmes funded by my Department, funding is provided based on children&rsquo;s attendance rather than registration. This reflects our responsibility to protect public funds by ensuring that the childcare places which are being publicly subsidised are being used.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of service providers to ensure that they communicate with parents to ensure that children are registered for the level of childcare for which they actually attend. Neither Pobal nor my Department expect service providers to act as &ldquo;truancy officers&rdquo;, however, in cases where a child&rsquo;s pattern of attendance is consistently below what they are registered for, then the service provider is expected to update PIP to reflect this.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that recording attendance and updating PIP can be difficult for providers, and therefore how to guides, instructional videos and a good practice guide to keeping attendance records are available from Pobal. Further support is available from City and County Childcare Committees.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that there are financial implications for services where programme payments are reduced based on reductions in attendance. If these financial consequences affect the continued viability of a service, a range of supports are available through local City/County Childcare Committees and through Pobal's Case Management system. I would therefore recommend that affected services contact both Pobal and their local CCC, who will offer support.</p>  <p>  The forthcoming information and training sessions mentioned above, will I believe, provide assurances to service providers re the how the design of the scheme recognises the needs of parents/families and indeed providers.</p></reply>

This consultation helped shape the terms of reference for the review and the procurement of an independent third party to review the programme.

This investment has funded walkways, blueways, trails and other outdoor infrastructural projects around the country.</p>  <p>  I propose to launch the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme for 2019 during the first quarter of 2019, to continue investment in projects that will benefit visitors and locals alike in rural areas.</p>  <p>  The Walks Scheme currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 private land-holders to maintain those trails. The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase the number of walks covered by the scheme.  In line with this commitment, funding for the scheme was doubled in Budget 2019 - from &euro;2 million to &euro;4 million - to allow this expansion to proceed. </p>  <p>  I am initiating a review of the operation of Walks Scheme which will inform decisions regarding the expansion of the scheme.

Approximately 129,000 customers are in receipt of the TSA payment.  The estimated full year cost of the scheme is over &euro;16 million.  </p>  <p>  To receive the allowance a customer of my department must be in receipt of a qualifying payment and also in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance and the Fuel Allowance.  Qualifying payments for the allowance are State Pension (Contributory and Non-Contributory), Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension Invalidity Pension, Disability Allowance, Blind Pension, Disablement Pension (Incapacity Supplement), Deserted Wife&rsquo;s Benefit and Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension under the Occupational Injuries Scheme. </p>  <p>  The primary objective of the TSA is to allow the most vulnerable people at risk of isolation, including the elderly and those with disabilities, access to personal alarms or phones for security.  Therefore the criteria for the allowance were framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  People who live alone would be considered amongst those most at risk of social isolation, and this payment, along with the Living Alone Allowance (LAA), are also in part a recognition of the greater challenges facing those living alone in avoiding poverty.  The deprivation rate of couples over 65 is less than half that recorded among those over that age who live alone.</p>  <p>  The number of pensioners eligible for Fuel Allowance but not LAA is 78,960 which would result in an estimated full year cost of extending TSA to this cohort of &euro;10.265 million.  Any decision to extend in this manner would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I understand that this arises due to a claim by CE supervisors and assistant supervisors, through their union representatives, for the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme. </p>  <p>  I would like to clarify that CE supervisors are, or were employees of private companies in the community and voluntary sector that receive state funding.  They are not employees of my Department or public servants and it continues to be the position that it is not for the State to provide funding for such pension scheme provision.</p>  <p>  However, a detailed scoping exercise was carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in 2017 in order to comprehensively examine and assess the full potential implications of providing such a pension scheme.  This exercise clearly highlighted that the provision of any such pension scheme presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million per annum and &euro;347m depending on the size of the sector, which is difficult to ascertain. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that this cost excludes any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million.</p>  <p>  Employers, including CE sponsoring organisations, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one Standard Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) under the Pension (Amendment) Act 2002.  </p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.   </p></reply>

Information letters were issued to these pensioners explaining that my Department will contact them again to either inform them about the outcome of their review or to request further information in order to complete their review.  All of the claims involved will be individually examined, starting with those aged 71 or over.  Due to the numbers involved, the process will take a number of months to complete. </p>  <p>  Where possible, my Department will use information already held to assist in these reviews.  If required to complete a review, additional information is being requested in writing from pensioners in relation to unexplained gaps in their social insurance record.  These information requests also explain how to access my Department&rsquo;s on-line service to provide the relevant information. </p>  <p>  From mid-January, almost 24,000 requests for additional information have issued to review pensioners.  </p>  <p>  The online pension review application is the most recent service to be added to MyWelfare.  The online application was prototyped and repeatedly tested with pensioners before being launched.  It only requests data needed to complete the review, the questions are short and the wording used has all been tested with pensioners.  Of the pensioners eligible for the pension review, 87% have already taken the first (of two steps) required to access the Department&rsquo;s online services, by completing the SAFE Registration process</p>  <p>  The information request issuing also contains a phone number the pensioner may call if they are unable to complete the online form. Their contact details will be taken and a paper application form will issue to them when paper forms become available. When the form is returned, the person&rsquo;s state pension (contributory) pension will be reviewed and they will be informed of the outcome in writing. </p>  <p>  The first review outcomes will be notified during Quarter 1 2019. Regardless of when a review is completed, where a pensioner qualifies for an increase, the increase will be paid with their next due payment, together with arrears backdated to March 2018, or their 66th birthday if later. If a pensioner does not qualify for an increase, they will continue to receive their existing rate of payment. No personal pension entitlement rates will be reduced as a result of this review. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

However, in order to support a carers continued attachment to the workforce and broader social inclusion, carers may engage in some limited employment, education or training, while still being regarded as being in a position to provide full-time care.  During this time of employment, education or training, adequate provision must be made for the care of the relevant person. </p>  <p>  In 2003, the number of hours per week that carers could engage in employment, education or training outside the home was 10.  As part of Budget 2006, this was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  There has been no further change since then.</p>  <p>  Any further changes to this condition would need to be considered in a budgetary context and would also need to maintain a reasonable balance between the requirement to provide full-time care for the care recipient and the needs of the carer.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The 2019 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;1.95 billion. </p>  <p>  Jobseeker's allowance is a means tested payment which has always been available to all jobseekers including employees and those in self-employment. A person may qualify for jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  Where self-employed people satisfy the appropriate means test and any other specific qualifying conditions, they have eligibility in the same way as employees. If a self-employed person is engaged in farming they may qualify for the means-tested farm assist payment which is currently paid to approximately 6,600 farmers.</p>  <p>  The new scheme for the self-employed, which I announced as part of the 2019 Budget measures, will extend a PRSI insurance based benefit similar to jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed who pay class S contributions and who lose employment. This measure which will be introduced later this year builds on other significant improvements for the self-employed in recent years such as access to invalidity pension and treatment benefits.  This measure is part of the Government&rsquo;s stated aim of creating a supportive environment for entrepreneurship, including providing an income safety net to employees and the self-employed alike.</p>  <p>  Applicants will have to satisfy the qualifying conditions for the new jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit support including a PRSI contribution requirement. The specific details of this scheme are currently being examined as part of the legislative process.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In this regard, no single criterion can necessarily support a decision that a couple are separated or not. The criteria for assessment include, but is not limited to:</p><p>- the duration of the relationship;</p><p>- the basis on which the couple live together;</p><p>- the degree of financial dependence of either adult on the other and any agreements in respect of their finances;</p><p>- the degree and nature of any financial arrangements between the adults;</p><p>- whether there are one or more dependent children;</p><p>- whether one of the adults cares for and supports the children of the other;</p><p>- the degree to which the adults present themselves to others as a couple.</p><p>If the deciding officer considers the couple to be separated, then the earnings of the spouse/partner would not be included in the means assessment.

This is very positive.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Therefore, the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.  This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  Reversing the 2014 change could be expected to cost a sum in the region of &euro;100 million per annum, depending upon the impact it would have upon retirement.  </p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age.  Where this is not possible and a person exits the workforce before reaching State pension age they may apply for either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments are currently paid to eligible jobseekers aged 18 to 66 years. </p>  <p>  Jobseekers Benefit is payable subject to the person satisfying the general scheme conditions. This entitlement is normally paid for 9 months (234 days) for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions paid and for 6 months (156 days) for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions paid.  Arrangements are in place to provide that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year can generally continue to be paid benefit up until pensionable age (66 years) provided they satisfy the necessary contribution conditions.  The jobseekers schemes are kept under review and any further changes, including entitlement beyond the 66th year, will be considered in that context.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  In this regard, the Workplace Relations Commission has produced a Code of Practice on Longer Working and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has published guidance material for employers on the use of fixed-term contracts beyond normal retirement age.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In summary, any income or capital, with some exceptions and disregards, belonging to the person and his/her spouse, partner or co-habitant is assessable for social welfare means testing purposes.</p>  <p>  Social welfare legislation provides for the disregard of certain compensation awards when assessing the means of a person. These disregards include, for example, all income derived from compensation awarded by the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and in relation to disability caused by Thalidomide.  Any payment made by the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board is also disregarded for social welfare means test purposes. In addition, ex gratia payments made to women who were admitted to and worked in the Magdalen Laundries, or through the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme are also disregarded.</p>  <p>  All compensation or court awards which are not specifically provided for in social welfare legislation are assessed in the normal manner.  However, most social assistance schemes (such as Jobseeker's Allowance and State Pension Non-Contributory) have an initial capital disregard of &euro;20,000.  In the case of Disability Allowance, the first &euro;50,000 in capital is disregarded. </p>  <p>  Any changes to the means assessment of social assistance schemes would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

As a consequence, people whose pensions were calculated under the 2000-2012 ratebands were subject to a significantly more generous regime than those who qualified before or afterwards, as a Yearly Average of only 20 contributions per year (out of a maximum of 49) could attract a 98% pension.  The effect of the Budget 2012 rateband changes, as it impacted upon those new pensioners since September 2012, will be familiar to anyone who followed the debate on this matter over the last 6 years.  If pre-September 2012 pensioners were also allowed avail of HomeCaring Credits, their arrangements, as a group, would continue to be significantly more generous than those of post-2012 pensioners.  There would also be a very significant cost which would be expected to be of the order of several hundred millions of euros each year.  This in turn could significantly impact funds for future pension increases with consequential implications for pensioner poverty.  </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;232 (over 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension).  This rate of payment does not include rent allowance, household benefits or fuel allowance.  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The service was launched in 2015 on a &lsquo;rolling basis&rsquo; with referral numbers gradually increasing over time. </p><p>There are two phases to the service. During the first phase, of 12 months duration, a personal advisor (PA) provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment. The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work. During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months. In addition to the two phases jobseekers may also undertake training while with the service and this may extend the period the jobseeker is supported through the service for up to a further 6 months. </p><p>In designing the JobPath service, the Department took steps to ensure the focus would be on sustained employment outcomes, rather than the traditional measurement of such contracts i.e. outcomes based on jobseekers being &lsquo;placed into / starting&rsquo; employment.  As a result the Department only makes payments for full time employment outcomes that last a minimum of 13 weeks.  The Department is therefore not reporting on or making payments for any job sustainment outcomes of less than 13 weeks e.g. full time employment of 12 weeks duration - which will have been beneficial to the Jobseeker. </p><p>It should also be noted that jobseekers are supported by the service for up to 30 months and as such the duration of the client journey necessitates the requirement of a cohort based approach to reporting in order to produce accurate outcome data. For this reason, the number of clients entering employment and sustaining employment is expected to increase over time. </p><p>In regard to individual client&rsquo;s employments which last less than 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, my Department does not collate and process such specific data and the information requested is currently unavailable.

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p>  <p>  As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. </p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.   My Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced later in Q1 2019, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in mid 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force which, together with the normal statutory requirements of the Planning Acts, which apply to wind energy development projects in the same manner as other proposed developments, provide an adequate framework through which wind energy developments can continue to be considered by planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  </p></reply>

Deloitte has been appointed to audit Irish Water&rsquo;s accounts and its current term of appointment concludes with the 2018 financial year end audits.  The Ervia Board&rsquo;s decision to appoint Deloitte as Irish Water&rsquo;s auditors was on the basis of Ervia&rsquo;s appointment of Deloitte as auditors to audit the financial accounts of Ervia.  The appointment of the same auditor across Ervia and its subsidiaries, including Irish Water, is considered to be the most practical approach for Ervia.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Gas Act 1976, as amended, the appointment of auditors for Ervia is currently being considered for the 2019 financial year end audits and beyond, and such a decision necessitates my approval.  The appointment of the same auditor across Ervia and its subsidiaries, including Irish Water, will be addressed as part of this Ministerial consent process in due course.  Account will also be taken of the ongoing consideration of the potential role for the Comptroller and Auditor General, as outlined in my reply to Question No. 209 of 6 February 2019.</p></reply>

The regulations, once finalised shortly, together with guidance, will be issued to local authorities. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is based on local authorities providing, directly or indirectly, below market price housing. The local authority takes a charge against the property equal to the discount provided. The Act provides for a charge up to a maximum of 40% of the market value. The charge is fully repayable at re-sale or at the end of the charge period. Repayments will be paid into a centralised Affordable Housing Fund which will administered by the Housing Finance Agency.  </p>  <p>  To be eligible for the Scheme the applicant must be a first-time buyer, having never previously purchased or built a dwelling in the State, or owned or be beneficially entitled to an interest in any dwelling or land in the State or elsewhere, but there are limited exceptions to this, such as in the case of separation, divorce and nullity.

The first call for proposals under the Fund was launched in July 2018 and in November, I announced details of the 88 successful proposals for funding, details of which are published on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>www.housing.gov.ie/sites/default/files/publications/files/urdf_-_2019_funding_allocations_0.pdf. </i></p><p>My Department has been engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a regular basis in respect of the URDF and Project Ireland 2040 delivery.  The Government is committed to delivering Project Ireland 2040 within the overall multi-year resource envelope that has been set out. For 2019, the overall Exchequer capital allocation across Government has increased by &euro;1,325 million or just over 22% above the 2018 allocation as stated in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2019.  With regard to implications arising from the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital project, following on from discussions at Government today, my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform has outlined how the additional cost pressures will be accommodated with a minimum of disruption to the scheduled roll-out of key infrastructure projects under Project Ireland 2040.  Among the measures contributing to the accommodation of the increased costs is an updated profiling of expenditure under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, which indicates that &euro;13m of drawdown under the Fund can be reprofiled from 2019 to 2020 without causing delays to projects.</p><p>With regard to funding eligibility of community arts centres, the objective of the URDF is to support compact and sustainable development in order to enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns and to ensure that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and to visit.  I would welcome, therefore, any types of proposals that assist in fulfilling this objective, which can include the development of community arts centres if integrated within a broader strategy for the area in question.  The types of proposals eligible for funding included, but were not limited, to the following: </p><p>-  Active land management, including the acquisition, planning, design, enabling through servicing, decontamination or otherwise, of areas, sites and buildings;</p><p>-  Measures to address building vacancy;</p><p>-  Building refurbishment, redevelopment and/or demolition;</p><p>-  The development of areas, sites and buildings and the strategic relocation of uses or activities;</p><p>-  Public amenity, planting, streetscape/public realm, parks, recreational facilities, safety, security and/or crime prevention works;</p><p>-  Infrastructure related to housing, economic or skills development (including enterprise and tourism), transport and services infrastructure;</p><p>-  Infrastructure that enables improved accessibility, in particular sustainable modes such as walking and cycling, public transport and multi-modal interchange, but also including roads, bridges and car parking;</p><p>-  Transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society, in an urban context. </p><p>My Department is currently engaging with successful applicants in respect of the progression of their proposals in 2019.

The tenancy agreement is between the tenant and the landlord and is covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended). The accommodation sourced by tenants should be within the prescribed maximum HAP rent limits, which are based on the household size and the rental market within that area. </p><p>The earliest date a HAP payment will be payable to a landlord is the date a complete and valid HAP application has been received by the local authority. Limerick City and County Council provide a highly effective transactional shared service for HAP on behalf of all local authorities.

Details in relation to social housing delivery for the last five years to end Q3 2018 is available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p><p>Details in relation to targets on a local authority basis for 2018 and 2018-2021 can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland website at: <i></i>.</p><p>Targets are reviewed annually and, following Budget 2019, the number of social housing homes to be delivered in 2019 under Rebuilding Ireland is as follows:<table><tr><th>Rebuilding Ireland Targets</th><th>2019</th></tr><tr><td>New   build</td><td>4,982</td></tr><tr><td>Part V </td><td>1,260</td></tr><tr><td>Voids </td><td>303</td></tr><tr><td>Total: Build </td><td>6,545</td></tr><tr><td>Acquisition </td><td>1,325</td></tr><tr><td>Lease </td><td>2,130</td></tr><tr><td>Total: Build,   Acquisition and Lease</td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Rental Accommodation Scheme </td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Housing Assistance Payment </td><td>16,760</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>27,360</td></tr></table></p><p>The breakdown of the 2019 targets by local authority is currently being finalised and will be published shortly.</p><p>A number of different schemes operated under the broad term &lsquo;affordable&rsquo; in the period to 2012, prior to being stood down. Data relating to activity under the various schemes (the Part V Scheme, the Shared Ownership Scheme, the 1999 Affordable Housing Scheme and the Mortgage Allowance Scheme) is available on my Department's website at the following link: .  </p><p>In order to underpin progress in the area of affordable housing, I commenced Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 on 18 June 2018, the effect of which is to place affordable dwelling purchase arrangements on a statutory footing.</p><p>The primary legislation will be supported by associated regulations, which are currently at the final legal drafting stage, following extensive consultation between my Department, the Housing Agency and local authorities. The regulations, once finalised shortly, together with guidance, will be issued to local authorities.</p><p>The Scheme is based on local authorities providing, directly or indirectly, below market price housing. The local authority takes a charge against the property equal to the discount provided. The Act provides for a charge up to a maximum of 40% of the market value. The charge is fully repayable at re-sale or at the end of the charge period. Repayments will be paid into a centralised Affordable Housing Fund which will be administered by the Housing Finance Agency.</p><p>In order to support local authorities in delivering affordable homes, &euro;310 million is being made available from 2019 until 2021 under the Serviced Site Fund (SSF). The SSF will fund facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites. At a maximum funding rate of &euro;50,000 per affordable home, at least 6,200 affordable homes will be facilitated.</p><p>On foot of the first call for SSF proposals which issued to local authorities in Dublin, the Greater Dublin Area, Cork and Galway City, approval was issued in December 2018 for ten projects at a cost of &euro;43m, which will support the delivery of some 1,400 affordable homes. Infrastructure works on these projects will begin as soon as possible and delivery of affordable homes is anticipated from early 2020 onwards.</p><p>A second call for proposals will issue to local authorities shortly. In order to inform that process, all local authorities wishing to be considered for funding have been asked to submit economic assessments of the requirement and potential to deliver affordable homes from their sites.</p><p>The Government is also committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p><p>There are currently two cost rental projects at Enniskerry Road in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, which will deliver 50 and 330 cost rental homes respectively.  The experience on these projects will inform a national cost rental framework under which similar projects will be rolled out on a wider scale. My Department is engaged with the National Development Finance Agency, the European Investment Bank and the Land Development Agency to develop the optimum funding and delivery mechanisms to support cost rental delivery at scale in Dublin and other urban areas.</p><p>The Government, through Rebuilding Ireland, remains fully focused on increasing supply, and the latest CSO report on housing completions, to end 2018, shows significant progress in this regard.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p>  <p>  Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment.    </p>  <p>  A valuation for commercial rates purposes is arrived at by estimating the Net Annual Value (NAV) of the property, at a specified valuation date. The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; has a legal definition and is set out in section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001 as the rent for which, one year with another, the property might, in its actual state, be reasonably expected to let from year to year, on the assumption that the probable average annual cost of repairs, insurance and other expenses (if any) that would be necessary to maintain the property in that state, and all rates and other taxes payable in respect of the property, are borne by the tenant. This definition of Net Annual Value is applied to all rateable properties and classes of business on a nationwide basis. </p>  <p>  Estimating the NAV of a rateable property is an evidence-based, transparent exercise. During a revaluation the Valuation Office analyses relevant market rental transactions for all rateable properties including service stations in accordance with the legislation, best practice internationally as set out in published Practice Guidance Notes, well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the higher Courts and the conclusion drawn from that analysis is applied to similarly circumstanced property using the &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; method of valuation which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar properties.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law. Appeals are generally made on an individual case basis, having regard to the particular circumstances of the property under appeal. However, the decision in one case can have relevance in other similar cases. </p>  <p>There is no provision in the legislation for taking a &ldquo;class&rdquo; or group appeal before the Tribunal, as each case is considered on its individual merits and by reference to the specific circumstances of the property. For these reasons, I have no plans to introduce legislative proposals along the lines indicated.  However, I am advised that individual appellants can make arguments to the Valuation Tribunal in relation to their concerns about the overall valuation methodology adopted by the Valuation Office for a specific category of rateable property, should they wish to do so.   </p>  <p>  I am also informed that, as a practical measure, it is possible for a Test case to be heard by the Valuation Tribunal. In order to proceed with a Test case both parties involved, the appellant and the respondent, must agree that such an approach is appropriate.  In addition, such a process must be entered into on the clear understanding of how precisely the determination of the Valuation Tribunal in the Test case would be applied to the other cases under appeal identified as being part of the test case series. All cases involved must be similarly circumstanced.  A Test case is identified and nominated through mutual agreement between appellants, their representatives or agents and the Valuation Office and this is notified to the Valuation Tribunal.   </p>  <p>  The nominated case would then be heard by the Valuation Tribunal in the normal course. The Valuation Tribunal is advised of the details of the other appeals to which the outcome of the test case appeal will apply and the agreed terms of how specifically the outcome of the test case is to be applied to the other cases in the test case series. The right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law for either the appellant or respondent still applies in a Test case situation.</p></reply>

The Regulations and the credit policy stipulate that, subject to the maximum purchase price allowed, a maximum of 90% of the value of the property can be borrowed by approved applicants. In the case of a self-build property, a loan can be provided up to 90% of either the construction cost, or in the case where the site is also being purchased the construction cost plus the cost of purchasing a site. However, in both these instances, 90% of the loan being sought is the maximum amount that will be approved.  A 100% mortgage cannot therefore be granted.</p><p>The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first-time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have been able to afford at a higher interest rate. One of the key conditions of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is that prospective applicants must demonstrate that they have had inadequate loan offers from two commercial lenders. </p><p>To support prudential lending and consistency of treatment for borrowers, a Loan to Value ratio of 90% applies to the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan as per the Central Bank's prudential lending guidelines. Therefore, in order to avail of the loan, applicants must have a deposit of funds equivalent to 10% of the market value of the property.</p><p>Applicants must provide bank or similar statements (such as post office, credit union, etc.) for a 12-month period immediately prior to making an application, clearly showing a credible and consistent track record of savings. Gifts in the form of cash are permissible up to 7% of the market value of the property, where their source is verified. The cash savings of the applicant should be no less than 3% of the market value of the property. </p><p>Decisions by local authorities as to whether to advance a loan to an individual are taken on a case-by-case basis, within the criteria as set out in the credit policy. Each local authority must have in place a credit committee which makes the final decision on applications for loans. There is also an appeal procedure in each local authority so that those who are not satisfied with a decision regarding their application can have the decision reviewed.</p><p>For prospective purchasers of new-build or self-build properties, the applicant may also be eligible for the Help to Buy Initiative for first-time buyers through the Revenue Commissioners. This could provide additional assistance of up to 5% of the purchase or construction price of relevant properties, which represents a significant contribution towards the relevant deposit requirements. A range of eligibility criteria applies to applications under the Help to Buy Initiative, and full details are available on the website of the Revenue Commissioners at .</p></reply>

Details of the Council's funding of schemes and initiatives for the particular support of music can be found on its websites at the following link <i>.</i></p><p>These include funding for a number of bursaries including a music bursary award to support professional artists to develop their art practice.  I understand that applicants are only eligible to apply for such funding on reaching 18. </p><p>The National Concert Hall (NCH) has a programme for Musicians and Music Students that offers a variety of initiatives to develop young musicians. These include a range of competitive bursaries including the Young Musician&rsquo;s Award for String Players, which is a fund of &euro;10,000 awarded every second year and which is open to players between the ages of 13 -17; the Bernadette Greevy Bursary for singers, which is a &euro;5,000 award, part-funded by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; and the Jerome Hynes Composition Competition, which is a &euro;2,000 bursary for young composers.</p><p>The NCH offers a wide range of other initiatives designed to foster the development of young musicians. These include masterclasses and workshops presented by visiting artists; a development orchestra called SinfoNua; the Female Conductor Programme, a major new project encouraging women into the world of orchestral conducting; and a new summer programme, the International Master Course, for high-level students and emerging professionals.  For younger musicians, the NCH also partners with the Royal Irish Academy of Music on the Primary Ensemble Project, a programme supporting the development of music ensembles in primary schools.</p><p>In addition, Creative Ireland's Creative Youth Plan, launched in December 2017, seeks to ensure that every child in Ireland has practical access to tuition, experience and participation in music, drama, art and coding by 2022. This Plan is being led by my Department, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Arts Council, all working in partnership.  The Creative Schools programme is one of the key deliverables of the Creative Youth Plan.  Following an open application process, 150 schools were selected for the pilot in the school year running from 2018 to 2019. These schools have approximately 38,000 pupils. Music is the focus of a number of the Creative Plans being developed by these schools in conjunction with their creative associates.</p><p>In addition to curricular provision for music at both primary and post-primary levels, the Department of Education and Skills currently supports the Music Generation initiatives, in respect of a wide number of local Music Education Partnerships (MEPs).  I understand that Music Generation is being expanded nationwide over the period to 2022 and that they are currently in phase 2 of their three phase expansion plan. </p><p>Under the National Creativity Fund, developed under the Creative Ireland Programme, I recently announced the foundation of the first national youth orchestra for disabled musicians in Ireland - Le Ch&eacute;ile. This is a collaborative, inclusive and exciting step for the country&rsquo;s musical youth; the orchestra will be developed through the Royal Irish Academy of Music&rsquo;s (RIAM). Le Ch&eacute;ile will develop musical ensembles for young disabled musicians in every province in Ireland, culminating in the foundation of the Open Youth Orchestra of Ireland (OYOI) &ndash; the very first of its kind in Europe.</p><p>Funding to local authorities, under the Creative Ireland Programme in 2018, resulted in over 1200 events taking place across the county, of which over 120 were specially related to music events.  A large number of these were specifically for children and young people. </p><p>In addition to the above, the following initiatives by my Department are targeted towards support for music.</p><p>- Annual funding is provided by my Department to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann (CC&Eacute;) for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture. CC&Eacute; provides weekly classes at community level in all traditional instruments, singing, and dance through its network of centres and branches all over the country. </p><p>- The National Folk Theatre, Siamsa Tire, which receives annual funding from my Department, brings to life Irish folklore through music, song and dance.</p><p>- My Department provides funding for the purchase of equipment under the Music Capital Scheme to performing groups and individual talented musicians on an annual basis. The Scheme is managed by Music Network on behalf of my Department.  </p><p>- Culture Ireland, provides supports for Irish artists and musicians to travel abroad and develop their careers.  </p><p>I would also add that my Department provides funding to many different orchestras. In terms of music and ensuring that it is a vital part of cultural life in Ireland, my department provides funding for the cross border orchestra of Ireland and the peace proms. The Department provides annual funding to the Cross-Border Orchestra Peace Proms in which 20,000 children from 250 schools across the island of Ireland participate. The Proms provide a vital platform for young people to showcase their musical talent.</p><p>Support for music and musicians will continue to be a key focus of the supports provided by my Department and its agencies, and more broadly by Government in the context of the Creative Ireland programme.</p></reply>

These include representatives of workers in the industry which include</p><p>- The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU)</p><p>- SIPTU</p><p>- Irish Film Workers Association (IFWA)</p><p>- GMBh Trade Union</p><p>- Screen Guilds of Ireland</p><p>The emergence of disputes between stakeholders have, however, impeded progress on the Forum.  I understand that following the transmission of an RT&Eacute; Prime Time programme on the film industry, ICTU and SIPTU stated that they would not attend a Forum to which the IFWA is invited, and that  the Screen Guilds of Ireland gave a similar response.  Based on the ICTU position, Screen Producers Ireland also indicated that it would not attend. </p><p>My Department will work with the Audiovisual High Level Steering Group to address issues raised in the audiovisual industry, and to support the industry and the people who work in it.</p></reply>
