The PQQ assisted the Department in evaluating the eligibility, economic and financial standing and technical and professional capability of each bidder to provide the services required under the NBP.   Only those bidders that could demonstrate they had the necessary economic and financial standing, together with the required technical and professional capability, were allowed to participate in the procurement process. </p>  <p>  The procurement documentation issued to all bidders at the beginning of the process set out a mechanism for the Department to assess and approve or reject changes to the membership of any of the bidders, as would be appropriate in a procurement of this scale and duration. </p>  <p>  As part of the assessment of a change, any bidder in the process was required to demonstrate that it continued to meet the economic and financial standing, and technical and professional capability, set out in the original rigorous pre-qualification criteria. The Department could not have approved a change in Bidder composition unless it met those criteria. The criteria were designed to ensure that Bidders who passed had the ability from a financial robustness and technical ability, to build, operate and maintain the NBP network. </p>  <p>  The bidder which submitted its Final Tender to the Department met these relevant thresholds, as did the other bidders invited to participate in the process. </p>  <p>  My Department has received a final tender submission from the bidder and I intend to bring a recommendation to Government regarding this submission in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The plan involves a mix of commercial investment and a State-led intervention. It has acted as a catalyst in encouraging a significant level of investment in high-speed broadband infrastructure by commercial operators and is a key priority for Government.    As Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have had a number of conversations with the Taoiseach and other members of Government on the areas within my remit, including the National Broadband Plan. These meetings have included discussions on the progress of the ongoing procurement process to appoint a company to deploy the State Led Intervention network. </p>  <p>  The NBP has also been the subject of formal Government consideration at key milestones in the procurement. Notably, the Government approved the launch of procurement in December 2015. Government also approved the proposed ownership model in July 2016. In addition, Government was provided with updates to the process for their information, such as the Commitment Agreement signed between the Department and eir in April 2017 to provide access to high speed broadband to 300,000 premises mostly in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  The bidder for the State led intervention procurement process submitted its final tender in September 2018. My Department's assessment of this bid is now progressed to its concluding stages. My priority is to bring the process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible and it is intended to bring a recommendation to Government in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Following a rigorous planning process which included an eleven week oral hearing, the section of the project in Ireland was granted planning permission by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in December 2016. This decision was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court and judgement is expected in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  The section of the project in Northern Ireland was also granted planning permission. A Judicial Review of this decision was commenced in Northern Ireland and I understand that this is expected to conclude later this year. </p>  <p>  Following motions passed in D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann in early 2017 calling for further independent examination of the project, two studies were commissioned by my predecessor and were published on 2 October 2018 following consideration by Government. The study conducted by an International Expert Commission determined that from a techno-economic point of view, an Alternating Current overhead line is the most beneficial way of meeting the need for enhanced power transfer capability between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  There are currently a number of on-going procurements in relation to the project being undertaken and managed by ESB Networks, such as tower design. However no critical procurement contracts such as construction will be concluded until all legal proceedings are resolved. The earliest possible date for construction is early 2020.</p></reply>

The projects span a range of sectors including agriculture, transport, district heating, and public lighting. </p>  <p>  In the Agriculture sector, Gas Networks Ireland will be supported to deliver a facility that will allow renewable gas produced from the anaerobic digestion of wastes, including agriculture wastes such as slurry, to be injected into the national gas grid. The project will also support the use of this renewable gas in the transport sector through the development of two compressed natural gas fuelling stations and grant support for 74 vehicles. </p>  <p>  Having completed that assessment stage, the seven projects must now undergo the project validation process. The validation process will include more detailed examination of the projects, agreement of project outputs and payment timelines.</p>  <p>  The scope, structure and timeframe of future calls for applications have not yet been determined. To assist development of future calls, my Department plans to hold a workshop with all those who applied under the first call. This workshop, which will be held this month, will provide the opportunity to provide feedback to applicants and also to inform the next call.</p>  <p>  In July 2018 a new pilot scheme to support micro generation was introduced, initially targeting domestic self-consumption through a grant scheme for solar PV installation and battery storage. A review of the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro generation including broadening the scheme to include other groups and other technologies. As I outlined in the D&aacute;il on 27 November last, in response to the Micro Generation Support Scheme Bill, I am supportive in principle of providing a route to market for citizens and communities to generate their own renewable energy and receive a fair and efficient price for doing so. This very much aligns with Ireland's energy policy as set out in the Energy White Paper 2015 and wider EU energy policy goals.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in relation to the preparation of a new All of Government Plan to Address Climate Disruption, emphasising the need for agriculture to make a significant and positive contribution to climate mitigation. These discussions have focused on existing, scaled-up and new measures to cover regulatory enhancement, targeted supports, capital supports, and afforestation and wood mobilisation. As well as carbon abatement and sequestration, measures that result in energy displacement (i.e. substituting fossil fuels with renewable energy and renewable materials) have also been a focus of discussions. Reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post-2020, which will likely incentivise particular farming practices and processes, will clearly play a significant role in determining the overall shape and configuration of the Irish agri-food sector in the next decade, and the European Commission's current CAP proposals - which place a welcome focus on sustainability criteria, including carbon emissions -- will play a critical role in the transition to more environmentally sustainable farming processes and activities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-24a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400044#WRA02500"><p>The energy efficiency grants administered by the SEAI are funded by my Department. Grants are available to homeowners for insulation, heating controls, heat pumps and solar thermal hot water heating systems. Grants are also available for solar PV systems, electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging. Grants are also available for businesses to improve their energy efficiency.    The majority of the home energy grants are available to homeowners whose properties were built before 2006. Since the introduction of these grants nearly 400,000 homes across the country have received an energy efficiency upgrade, representing nearly one home in five across the country. Grants are administered through a range of schemes:</p>  <p>  - The Better Energy Homes scheme provides a financial incentive, typically covering 30% of the cost of works, to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.</p>  <p>  - The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme provides a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty who meet the defined eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  - The Deep Retrofit Pilot Programme is available to homeowners who want to upgrade their house to an A BER while availing of grant support of up to 50%. 4 homeowners in Cork availed of this grant in 2018. </p>  <p>  - The Better Energy Communities scheme supports energy efficiency upgrades to mixed projects of homes, community facilities and businesses in a local community. This scheme provided funding of &euro;20m in 2018 to 37 projects across the country, upgrading 1,189 homes and 454 community buildings. In 2018 12 of these projects included homes and community buildings in County Cork. </p>  <p>  - The Sustainable Energy Communities scheme supports and funds communities to build capacity and develop plans to upgrade the energy efficiency of their local area. 24 communities in Co Cork are signed up to the network.</p>  <p>  In 2018 &euro;5,251,691 was invested in improving the efficiency of homes in Co Cork. This was an increase of almost &euro;1.7m on the investment made in 2017 in Co Cork, reflecting the increased investment overall by Government in energy efficiency. Fewer homes were upgraded however, reflecting the shift to deeper, more expensive measures that also result in more carbon savings.</p>  <p>  A number of actions are already underway to encourage investment in energy efficiency and further uptake of home energy grants by homeowners across the country. For example, the Better Energy Homes Scheme was expanded in 2018 to support the transition away from fossil fuels, and achieve greater energy savings and emissions reductions, by introducing a new grant for heat pumps and increasing the grant amount available for all other measures. In addition, the Better Energy Warmer Homes was also expanded in 2018 to include internal and external wall insulation which allows more people to avail of the scheme and also increases the energy savings and emissions reductions from the investment made. More information can be found on the website of the SEAI.</p></reply>

From 1 March 2019, this policy will also apply to all public bodies.</p><p>The Government Decision also requires Departments to publish Resource Efficiency Action Plans to improve how public bodies manage water, energy and material resources. Each public body must report to its respective Minister by end-November on the measures it is taking. My department is currently rolling out supports for public bodies to ensure their compliance with the Government Decision.</p><p>The decision on single use plastic items pre-empts a more wide-ranging EU legislative proposal, which is expected to be agreed shortly. The draft EU Directive proposes to target the 10 most prevalent single use plastic items found in Europe's marine environment, as well as lost and abandoned fishing gear. The proposed Directive includes:</p><p>- banning certain single use plastic products;</p><p>- introducing national consumption reduction targets for other single use plastics; and,</p><p>- obliging single use plastic producers to fund waste management and litter clean ups.</p><p>Increasing public awareness plays a major role in reducing use of single use plastics and plastics generally. With support from my Department, the Regional Waste Management Offices have designed the website www.mywaste.ie to provide consumers with a single information resource on managing household waste with particular focus on the importance of waste prevention and recycling.</p><p>My Department is also working closely with Repak on this issue. Repak members can sign up to a pledge to reduce plastic packaging waste by:</p><p>- minimising avoidable single use packaging and promoting reuse where possible; and</p><p>- supporting plastic recycling targets of 50% of all plastic packaging by 2025 and 55% of all plastic packaging by 2030. </p></reply>

Ireland will, within the EU and UN climate frameworks, pursue and achieve a transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy, underpinned by a secure and competitive energy supply in the period to 2050.In recognition of this challenge, Minister Bruton is currently preparing an All of Government Plan which will set out the actions that must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. This Plan will develop new initiatives across electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and other relevant sectors, building on the previous actions taken by Government, including in the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan, and is to be completed early this year. </p><p>The Government has made a clear commitment and plan to decarbonise as outlined in both the National Mitigation Plan and the Energy White Paper &ldquo;Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030&rdquo;. Prohibition of exploration for petroleum will do nothing to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and will make Ireland 100% dependent on imports for our fossil fuel needs in the future, when we know that Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous production at Corrib will decline and Kinsale is approaching its end of life.In a European context, the UK, Norway, and Denmark, as well as Ireland, continue to explore and produce natural gas and oil to help meet a part of Europe&rsquo;s future energy needs, and reduce Europe's energy imports from Russia and the Middle East, while Europe plays a leading role globally in the transition to a low carbon future. </p></reply>

I have allocated &euro;85m to the residential retrofit schemes this year.  The National Development Plan demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure and investment needs over the next ten years, to 2027. The Plan indicates resourcing of &euro;21.8bn for climate and low carbon related actions of which &euro;3bn is for funding residential energy efficiency schemes. </p>  <p>  My Department funds the Deep Retrofit Pilot Programme, which is administered by the SEAI.  The Programme is investigating the challenges and opportunities of Deep Retrofit, including how to fund it.  New Building Regulations will require at least a B2 rating to be achieved where major renovations take place and the NDP commits to upgrading 45,000 homes per year to a B2 rating. </p>  <p>  The Deep Retrofit Programme is providing insight on the potential costs of upgrading the building stock, as a greater range of building archetypes are upgraded under the scheme. Development of economies of scale in the market though the aggregation required by the programme will also inform cost. </p>  <p>  What is clear is that the Exchequer will not be able to fund the scale of deep retrofit that needs to happen in order for Ireland to meet its climate targets.  Alternative financing options, including using EU financial instruments to lower the interest rates for loans for energy efficiency works, have to be a part of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy to decarbonise our buildings.</p></reply>

However, there are currently no specific targets set for plastic bottles within the Directive and, therefore, data relating to plastic bottles is compiled within data for all other plastic packaging items.    The European Commission's &ldquo;Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment&rdquo;, which is expected to be agreed shortly at European level, contains a number of specific proposals relating to plastic bottles, including measures to ensure that all plastic bottles have tethered lids and that from 2030 all Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles contain at least 30% recycled plastic. The proposal also sets specific targets for the separate collection and recycling of plastic bottles and states that, by 2025, Member States shall take the necessary measures to collect 77% of plastic bottles separately for recycling, with that figure rising to 90% by 2029. My Department is currently assessing how best to meet these new targets with a number of options under consideration, including a national study into the impact of potentially introducing a Deposit and Return Scheme.</p>  <p>  With regard to glass bottles, statistics relating specifically to glass bottles are not collated.

Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised.  The new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, approved by government in July 2018, will provide for a renewable electricity ambition of 55% by 2030. Currently, 30% of our electricty is generatred from renewables. </p>  <p>  I have secured Government approval to develop an all of Government plan which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. This Plan will include the steps which we must take in order to reach this target. I will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport and heat, as well as a range of other sectors.</p>  <p>  In all projected transitions to a low carbon economy by 2050, gas will continue to play a role. It plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more Co2-intensive fossil fuels. In Ireland gas powered generation also provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation. </p>  <p>  So while gas useage will reduce significantly in the years ahead, Ireland will still need secure sources of gas. At present this is provided by both gas piped on shore from Irish gas fields and imports through gas pipelines from the UK. </p>  <p>  The development of an LNG facility could further enhance Ireland&rsquo;s gas security of supply by increasing import route diversity and would be compatible with the State&rsquo;s commitments to tackle climate change. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and on-going review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.</p>  <p>  The project to which the Deputy refers is a private commercial project.

This is a significant energy infrastructure project, involving the installation of new meters to over 2 million customers nationwide. The rollout will occur in a phased basis, commencing with an initial delivery of 250,000 meters across the latter half of 2019 and 2020 and approximately 500,000 meters in each of the four subsequent years. By 2020 almost three quarters of a million of existing meters will be more than 40 years old and in need of replacement. </p>  <p>  Last week&rsquo;s announcement by ESB Networks lays out the details of three procurement processes related to the Smart Meter Upgrade &ndash; the smart meters themselves, their deployment and the communications technology they will use. The announcement of the awards of contracts followed a rigorous tendering process carried out by ESB Networks in 2018.</p>  <p>  The national installation of smart meters is a key enabler of Ireland's transition to a low carbon energy system that will help deliver on our climate action goals. There will be no need for estimated bills with smart meters. Accurate energy usage information across the day will enable consumers to be more efficient in their use of electricity and save money (e.g. by using appliances off peak). This will, in turn, reduce the need for less efficient and more costly generation at peak times and support the increase in renewable power on the electricity system. Smart meters will also support greater uptake of electric vehicles and micro-generation.</p></reply>

Ireland is committed to achieving this and the latest data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) indicate that 30.1% of our electricity came from renewable sources in 2017. The Government has adopted a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable electricity including the Renewable Energy Feed-In-Tariff (REFIT) schemes. In addition, my Department is developing the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS), which will be designed to assist Ireland in meeting its renewable electricity ambition of 55% out to 2030.    In July 2018 a new pilot scheme to support micro generation was introduced, initially targeting domestic self-consumption through a grant scheme for solar PV installation and battery storage. A review of the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro generation. As I outlined in the D&aacute;il on 27 November last, in response to the Micro Generation Support Scheme Bill, I am supportive in principle of providing a route to market for citizens and communities to generate their own renewable energy and receive a fair and efficient price for doing so. This very much aligns with Ireland's energy policy as set out in the Energy White Paper 2015 and wider EU energy policy goals. </p></reply>

This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p>  <p>  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. When this Government came into office, this had risen to 52%. Today, 74% of premises can access high speed broadband. </p>  <p>  In April 2017 my Department published an updated version of the National Broadband Plan (NBP) High Speed Broadband Map. This is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. The map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/Eircode:</p>  <p>  - The AMBER area represents the parts of the country where commercial operators have no plans to build high speed broadband networks. Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high Speed Broadband through a State Intervention.</p>  <p>  - The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  - The LIGHT BLUE area represents eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017.</p>  <p>  Information on categories of specific premises can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.broadband.gov.ie, by entering the relevant Eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map. For those premises which fall within eir's commercial deployment to 300,000 premises further detail is provided on that company&rsquo;s website, www.fibrerollout.ie. </p>  <p>  Under a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017, eir is in the process of passing 300,000 predominantly rural homes with high speed broadband. According to information submitted by eir to my Department, as of Quarter 4 2018 the company has passed some 225,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. This is in the process of verification by officials in my Department.</p>  <p>  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. My priority is to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible and I will bring a recommendation to Government in this regard in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements. </p></reply>

Both Public Service Broadcasters spend millions of euro each year on independently produced programming. This is vital in supporting a vibrant independent sector, including in the regions. Section 116 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that RT&Eacute; make specific amounts available each year for the commissioning of television and radio programmes from the independent production sector. In 2017, RTE spent &euro;39.7m on independent productions. </p><p>TG4 commissions the majority of its Irish language programmes from independent production companies throughout Ireland. In 2017, the broadcaster spent over &euro;21.6m on independent productions, which was 88% of its annual programme budget for that year.</p><p>In addition, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is responsible for the administration of the Broadcasting Fund which includes the Sound and Vision Scheme. This scheme, which is financed from the TV Licence fee, provides funding in support of high quality programmes on Irish culture, heritage and experience, programmes to improve adult literacy, and archiving of programme material. Revenue from this fund can be applied for by independent producers and broadcasters for specific projects of a public service nature. In 2017, &euro;12m in funding supported 63 television and 176 radio projects.</p><p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment examined the longer term issue of the future funding of public service media. The Committee published their report at the end of November 2017. </p><p>Following consideration of the recommendations made in that report, Government approval was received in July 2018 to establish a Working Group on the Future Funding of Public Service Broadcasting. The Working Group, which is chaired by my Department, is currently deliberating on a number of options for the reform of the TV Licence Fee and its collection.

Details of these grants are provided below and further information is available on SEAI&rsquo;s website .  Homes:</p><p>- A range of grants are available to householders to suit their circumstances and scale of work they wish to undertake.</p><p>- Better Energy Homes provides a financial incentive (typically covering 30% of the cost of works) to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their homes.</p><p>- Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme provides a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty who meet the defined eligibility criteria.</p><p>- Better Energy Communities encourages and supports community based partnerships to carry out energy efficiency upgrades to mixed projects of homes, community facilities and businesses within a local community.</p><p>- The Warmth and Wellbeing Pilot Scheme is a joint energy, social and health policy initiative aimed at validating the health impacts of improved energy efficiency in a home. The pilot scheme was established in HSE Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) 7, specifically in Dublin 8, 10, 12, 22 &amp;amp; 24.</p><p>- The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme is available to homeowners who want to upgrade their house to an A BER while availing of grant support of up to 50%.</p><p>The majority of these grants are available to homeowners whose properties were built before 2006. Since the introduction of these grants nearly 400,000 homes across the country have received an energy efficiency upgrade, representing nearly one home in five across the country.</p><p>Businesses:</p><p>- The Excellence in Energy Efficient Design (EXEED) Certified Program focuses on lifecycle energy performance in the industrial, commercial and public sectors. It works by using grant offers to incentivise businesses or organisations to look at projects from the design stage, and consider the most efficient process when commissioning or designing a new project, process or asset. This scheme is applicable to any sector or organisation, and to projects of any scale or complexity. The EXEED Grant Scheme can provide grant support of up to &euro;500,000. In 2018 56 projects have received grant funding through this program.</p><p>- The SEAI SME Programmes supports businesses to tackle their energy costs. SEAI have worked with over 3,000 businesses of all sizes and types, and delivered savings of up to 30% for participants through the programmes. Two pilot schemes operated in 2017 and 2018:</p><p>- Dairy Farm Grant Scheme provided in collaboration with Teagasc offered grants of 40% to support the installation of efficient vacuum and milk pump technology which can significantly reduce energy and costs to farmers &ndash; with 116 benefiting from this scheme.</p><p>- The Smart Lighting Pilot Scheme encourages and supports businesses to upgrade their lighting by providing grants of up to 30% which enables businesses to permanently reduce their future energy use and spend on lighting. To date 256 SMEs have availed of this scheme.</p></reply>

The International Energy Agency&rsquo;s World Energy Outlook 2017 recognises the role which gas will play in the transition to 2050.    In Ireland, gas powered electricity generation provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation.  Natural Gas has the potential to play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more CO2-intensive fossil fuels.</p>  <p>  The potential for LNG was examined as part of a study carried out by Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid, on Ireland&rsquo;s resilience to a long-term gas disruption.  While the study found that Ireland&rsquo;s gas network is largely resilient to cope with a long duration gas disruption, it recommended, subject to a detailed cost benefit analysis, a floating LNG terminal may be the most appropriate option to further enhance Ireland&rsquo;s security of gas supply.</p>  <p>  There have been a number of announcements of private sector commercial proposals to build LNG facilities in Ireland. These are commercial projects and the location, development and final investment decisions for these projects are ultimately the responsibility of the project promoters. It is the responsibility of the respective project promoters to comply with any legal and regulatory requirements, including requirements for planning permission, consents, permits and related environmental impact assessments.</p></reply>

Bord na M&oacute;na commenced co-firing at its Edenderry Plant with biomass in 2008, and it is expected that ESB will commence co-firing at its 2 peat fired plants with biomass in 2020.    ESB is in the process of seeking planning permission for the phased transition of its stations to biomass by the end of 2027. Bord na M&oacute;na currently has planning permission to co-fire with up to 30% biomass. </p>  <p>  In relation to the supply of biomass, Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s BioEnergy division sources sustainable biomass that is used at the Edenderry power station and I am advised that up to 80% of the biomass used in the Edenderry power station is from domestic sources. However, in the event that all three peat-fired plants have planning permission to co-fire with biomass, it is unlikely that the amount of biomass required will be supplied from indigenous sources. It is likely that the supply deficit would be met by imports. </p>  <p>  In addition to the three power stations, there is demand for biomass for use in industry and in residential heating, and the Government&rsquo;s Support Scheme for Renewable Heat will also create a demand for biomass supplies in the coming years. </p>  <p>  As pointed out by Coford in its recent reports on Wood Supply and Demand to 2025, and Mobilising Ireland&rsquo;s Forest Resource, the key challenge is to ensure a balanced approach to the development of wood resource to best meet demand. Mobilising the private supply of indigenous resources is a key factor. As the supply of indigenous biomass increases, supported by the forestry programme and other measures, imported biomass will be displaced. </p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across Ireland and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest. </p>  <p>  There are approximately 42,000 premises in County Cavan. Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high speed broadband in Cavan has increased by 5,317, a 13% increase. In total, the number of premises in Cavan with access to high speed broadband is now 23,535, or 56% of the total premises in the county. Approximately another 1,570 premises will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment. </p>  <p>  There are approximately 33,000 premises in County Monaghan.

The most significant drivers for the increased emissions in 2017 are higher dairy cow numbers, with an increase in milk production of 9.2%.  In the last 5 years, dairy cow numbers have increased by 26.1% and corresponding milk production by 38.8%.  This reflects national plans to expand milk production under Food Wise 2025 and the removal of the milk quota in 2015.  I have recently received a mandate from Government to begin the preparation of a new All of Government Plan to bring about a step change in our climate ambition over the next decade, and beyond.  My vision is that this new Plan will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. In developing this Plan, all proposals which can inform and lead to significant greenhouse gas emission reductions are being considered. </p>  <p>  Over the longer term, it is clear that climate change presents a long-term challenge across the whole of the economy and that all sectors are going to have to play their part if we are to achieve the deep decarbonisation to meet the objectives of the 2014 National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development.</p>  <p>  Matters relating to agriculture and food policy are, in the first instance, a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest.    There are approximately 85,300 premises in County Meath. Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high speed broadband in Meath has increased by 31,564, a 36% increase. In total, the number of premises in Meath with access to high speech broadband is 62,934, or 74% of total premises in the county. Another 2,468 will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment.</p>  <p>  The remaining 19,905 homes, schools and businesses in Meath will be connected under the Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan. </p>  <p>  In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address or Eircode. </p>  <p>  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. My priority is to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible and I will bring a recommendation to Government in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

While such emissions are not currently accounted for in relation to the calculation of compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s emissions targets in the period to 2020, from 2021 onwards these emissions will be integrated into the EU framework for compliance with national emissions targets. It is, therefore, essential that Ireland has robust policies in place to manage emissions and enhance removals from relevant LULUCF sectoral categories. </p>  <p>  In relation to the report referred to, the need to achieve deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades will pose significant long-term challenges to our existing approach to land use.

The latest projections, published in May 2018 by the EPA, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the Effort Sharing Decision could be only between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.    The EU system does not fix separate targets for different sectors. The Effort Sharing Decision allows Member States to meet their targets using unused emissions allowances from earlier years, or through purchasing allowances from other Member States or on international markets. Ireland has certain accumulated credits already acquired. However, I am advised that Ireland will need to purchase allowances to meet projected shortfalls in 2019 and 2020. My Department currently estimates the costs of this requirement to be in the region of &euro;6m to &euro;13m, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.</p>  <p>  I have recently secured Government approval to prepare an All-of-Government Plan which will set out the actions to be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change, including how Ireland will, at the very least, meet its targets for the period to 2030. </p></reply>

Phasing out coal-fired power generation is a key recommendation, and this is currently already an action in the National Mitigation Plan and will be further advanced in the All of Government Plan. Encouraging a city-level low-carbon transition to reduce urban pollution is also being progressed in the context of measures in the transport sector, including actions to increase the numbers of electric vehicles in Ireland and further increase biofuel blends. The Lancet report calls for a rapid expansion of access to renewable energy, unlocking the substantial economic gains available from this transition. This a critical policy area on which the Plan will focus considerable ambition and I anticipate that a significant scale-up in the penetration of renewables will feature in the Plan. </p></reply>

In this context, the ARW are trained and equipped to undertake a range of specialist roles.  They are an elite military unit and their capability is a significant asset to the State both in a domestic national security role and in an overseas role.  </p>  <p>  The ARW is part and parcel of the capabilities available to the State to be deployed in support of our national security and overseas peace support operations.   They are deployed overseas to UN peacekeeping missions in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Acts and their deployment is covered by the same legislative provisions as apply to the rest of the Permanent Defence Force.  The statutory authority for the despatch of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force for service overseas is set out in Section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No.2) Act, 1960 as amended by the Defence (Amendment) Act, 2006.  The ARW have previously been deployed on UN mandated peacekeeping operations including, in what was then East Timor with INTERFET, in Liberia with UNMIL and in Chad with EUFOR tChad/RCA where their particular skill set has been required.  </p>  <p>  MINUSMA, the UN mission in Mali is a authorised under Chapter VII of the UN Charter by the UN Security Council.  It is a significant UN peace enforcement mission comprising both regular and special operations forces and high end capabilities.  The option to deploy a small contingent of Army Ranger Wing personnel to MINUSMA as part of a larger Special Operations Forces within the mission later this year has arisen.  </p>  <p>  Ireland currently has no Defence Forces personnel deployed to the UN mandated MINUSMA mission.  However, potential overseas missions are considered on an on-going basis.  The Department and the Defence Forces are in the very early information gathering stage in considering this particular mission.  This involves getting detailed information on the mission and its operations, consideration of the possible role which the Defence Forces may be able to undertake in the mission, how such a deployment fits with Defence Forces capabilities having regard to existing and potential commitments at home and overseas and a detailed threat analysis and assessment.  This process has only just commenced and will take a period of time to reach a conclusion.  On foot of the respective military and policy advice arising from this process, I will then consider the matter.  I should emphasise again that no decision has been taken yet and there is some way to go in the process before we reach that point.</p></reply>

This was a special acknowledgement from the Government to the members of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann who served during the centenary year.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware from my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions, and as I have indicated in response to representations on this issue, many thousands of personnel have served in the Defence Forces since the foundation of the State.  To put in place a mechanism to establish the identity of each, contact those who are still alive, decide on eligibility and, in the case of infirm or deceased former members, resolve who should get the medal on their behalf, would place an inordinate and disproportionate administrative burden on my Department. This, in turn, would divert important resources to the detriment of other more pressing and relevant requirements of my Department and the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the contribution of veterans to the centenary commemorative events in 2016 it was agreed to present a framed medal to each of the Veterans Associations along with a plaque for each of ONE&rsquo;s 41 Branches and each of IUNVA&rsquo;s 21 Posts. It is not proposed to revisit this arrangement. </p></reply>

This is only done in exceptional cases and only where there is incontrovertible verified evidence available from Departmental records that the criteria for the award of a medal have been met. </p><p>  The relevant records were maintained for the specific purpose of dealing with individual applications for medals or pensions and not to act as a record of all activities during the Easter Rising and the War of Independence.  Where a person made an application for a pension or medal in respect of their service or involvement in the Easter Rising and/or War of Independence, verified evidence of service was required before the award of a pension or medal was made.  Such verification was provided by surviving members of the old IRA and other related organisations who knew of the membership and activities of the applicant. However, not every individual who was involved in Easter Week and/or the War of Independence made an application for a pension or medal and in such cases there would have been no reason to seek or hold verification of membership or individual activities. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, there are now no surviving members of Cumann na mBan or the old IRA alive who could verify membership. Due to the length of time that has now elapsed there is no mechanism available at this stage by which service and activities, in the absence of existing Departmental records, can be investigated or verified. In the absence of a verification process at this stage it is very difficult to satisfy the requirements and therefore the award of such posthumous medals is quite rare.</p><p>Any application for a posthumous medal made to my Department will be carefully considered; however, I have no plans to put in place wider arrangements or to amend the criteria in relation to the posthumous award of medals relating the 1916-1921 period. </p><p>I can confirm that there are no applications for posthumous medals in respect of Cumann na mBan service on hand, nor have any such applications been received in recent years.

We discussed the disappointing but not unexpected outcome of the 15 January vote in the House of Commons on the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. Both Mr Barnier and I are in agreement that what we need from the UK is clarity on how it proposes to move forward, and ultimately what it wants to achieve. The EU could then consider any next steps it might take.  The EU continues to take a united approach to the negotiations and I thanked Mr Barnier for his unwavering support for Ireland.</p>  <p>  Mr Barnier and I remain firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the British Government. The European Council has made clear that it stands by the Withdrawal Agreement and that it is not open for renegotiation.  The EU stands ready to work further on the Political Declaration as we look to the future relationship. </p>  <p>  Mr Barnier reaffirmed his commitment to the backstop provisions contained in the Agreement, which is the only agreement on the table that provides the essential legal guarantee to avoid a hard border in any circumstances and protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. </p>  <p>  In light of the ongoing uncertainty in Britain, however, the European Council has asked that preparedness work at the national and EU level intensify, taking account of all possible outcomes. I outlined Ireland&rsquo;s approach in this regard, including planned legislation and other contingency measures.  I also thanked Mr Barnier for the Commission&rsquo;s continued helpful and constructive engagement in this area, and their understanding of the particular challenges faced by Ireland.</p></reply>

As already announced in Budget 2019 , last October, further funding is being earmarked for the Passport Service, which has seen a significant increase in demand for Irish passports from Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and Great Britain since the UK voted to leave the EU. </p><p>2019  Estimates allocations will help the Department to address critical challenges that are facing Ireland at EU and international level in the context of Brexit. Including a greater focus on delivering further improvements in our services to citizens in such areas as passports. </p><p>The agreed additional allocation for Brexit-readiness work includes increased funding for additional staffing to facilitate the processing of increased passport applications (&euro;2m) and applications for Irish citizenship via the Foreign Birth Registration system (&euro;0.6m). There will also be additional funding in 2019 for the operational costs of passport processing.</p><p>A key part of the Passport Service&rsquo;s strategy in managing increasing application volumes is a focus on implementation of service improvements. Since 2016, a significant programme of reform to enhance passport services for citizens has been underway, including the introduction and expansion of online passports services and a new passport card. The award winning online passport application service will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of exceptionally high volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the Passport Service. The Online Renewal Service allows Irish citizens (both adult and children) to renew their passport twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week from anywhere in the world, has led to an exceptionally enhanced customer service experience.<b></b>To allow further reform and development of the Passport Service &euro;6m in capital funding will be made available to the Passport Reform Programme in 2019.</p><p>Staffing needs in the Passport Service are assessed on the basis of a number of factors including forecasted demand, the balance between more complex first-time applications and renewals as well as the uptake of online services and associated productivity gains. As noted above, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sought and has been provided with additional funding in the 2019 Estimates for additional full-time staff in the Passport Service in order to better cope with periods of peak demand and the rising volumes of applications. Additional full-time staff have already been recruited and the Passport Service will continue to monitor operational requirements during the year.</p></reply>

"Realising our Rural Potential: Action Plan for Rural Development" contains a detailed list of actions and priorities with a view to revitalising rural Ireland generally. This effort is being led by the Minister for Rural and Community Development in conjunction with Ministers and officials from other Departments, as well as the Local Authorities and a range of other stakeholders. A variety of actions included in this plan aim to assist in improving rural towns and making rural Ireland a better place to live. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Department of Finance Tax Expenditure Guidelines, published in October 2014, set out guidelines for best practice in ex-ante and ex-post evaluation of tax expenditures and is used by my Department when considering whether or not to introduce a new tax expenditure, or in reviewing an existing measure. These guidelines provide that tax expenditures should only be used in limited circumstances of demonstrable market failure, and where a tax based incentive is likely to be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p>  <p>  Finally, EU State Aid rules make it difficult to introduce tax reliefs that target specific geographic areas while excluding others. In this regard, the Deputy may be aware of the difficulties that my Department encountered in obtaining state aid approval from the European Commission for the Living City initiative. </p></reply>

Since the UK referendum, Brexit is an integral part of business planning in the Department of Finance and issues relating to Brexit are mainstreamed across all divisions of my Department. In this context, I meet and engage on an ongoing basis with my officials on issues linked to Brexit.  The objective of my approach as Minister for Finance is to protect the economic and financial interests of the state and to support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise disruption to trade to the greatest extent possible. These objectives are being advanced under four priority headings which are developing appropriate economic and budgetary policy advice; safeguarding financial stability through engagement with the CBI and the NTMA; assuring continued funding of the State by the NTMA and supporting the work of the Revenue Commissioners in the areas of customs, direct and indirect tax.   </p>  <p>  I would point out that my Department has been to the fore in producing and funding a number of Brexit-related studies, both before and since the UK's referendum decision, covering overall macroeconomic and sectoral impacts. A dedicated Brexit Unit within the EU and International Division was established in July 2016 to oversee and coordinate Brexit work across the entire Department and to act as a key liaison point, in particular with the Departments of the Taoiseach and of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Assistant Secretary who heads the EU and International Division of my Department is designated as the lead official in the Department for Brexit matters.  We have appointed lead Brexit coordinators at Principal Officer level across all divisions of the Department. Developments on and preparations for Brexit are a standing item for discussion by my officials at key departmental structures, such as the Executive Board and EU Strategy Committee meetings.</p></reply>

However, a Revenue Commissioners concession allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain types of vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  Revenue has since decided to remove this concession with effect from 1 March 2019 so that all food supplements will be charged at the standard VAT rate.  </p>  <p>  The operation of the concession became extremely problematic as a result of efforts by certain businesses in the industry to extend the concession beyond the scope permitted. Consistent challenges to Revenue guidance and decisions on the VAT rating of products gave rise to serious concerns about compliance within the industry and unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.</p>  <p>  It should be noted, however, that human oral medicines, including certain folic acid and other vitamin and mineral products, licenced by the Health Products Regulatory Association will continue to apply at the zero rate of VAT.  Infant foods will also continue to be zero rated. </p>  <p>  However, independent of Revenue&rsquo;s decisions on interpretation, I agreed during the recent Finance Bill to put in place a process that will conclude in the 2019 Tax Strategy Group Paper to examine some of the policy choices around the VAT treatment of food supplements.

It should be noted that just because an insurer is authorised to provide this type of insurance does not mean it is currently doing so.  It has also indicated that there are 874 non-life Freedom of Service companies on the register, however the Bank is not in a position to tell me how many of these companies are actively selling motor insurance in the Irish Market. This is because many such companies register and participate only for a limited time in the Irish Market, or never participate at all.  </p><p>Consequently in order to be as helpful as possible, I am attaching a link below to the membership list of the Motor Insurers&rsquo; Bureau of Ireland (MIBI). This provides a much clearer profile of the make-up of the motor insurance industry in Ireland because under Section 78 of the Road Traffic Act,  all motor insurance undertakings wishing to do business in Ireland are required to become a member of this body in order that the EU requirement of compensating victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles can be met.  </p><p>.</p><p>When looking at the membership list, the Deputy will note that the freedom of services undertakings are marked by a reference to &ldquo;FOS&rdquo; in the company code field of the table.  In this list (January 2019) there are 18 Irish undertakings and 22 FOS undertakings.  In addition, there are six Lloyd&rsquo;s syndicates operating through brokers.  It should be noted that these numbers will change as undertakings enter and exit the Irish market from time to time.</p></reply>

To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression.  In 2017 SUSI provided some &euro;370m in student supports that benefitted more than 78,000 students.  Additional funding of &euro;4 million was secured in Budget 2017 and a further &euro;3m in Budget 2018 to facilitate the reinstatement of full maintenance grants, from September 2017, for the most disadvantaged postgraduate students. </p>  <p>  The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education published in 2015 has as its overall vision the goal of ensuring that the student body entering, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population.  One of its specific objectives is to increase access by students from target groups to initial teacher education (ITE). </p>  <p>  Arising from this, in September 2016, my predecessor, Mr. Richard Bruton, T.D. announced that an allocation of &euro;2.7m was being made available, over a three year timeframe, for ITE access initiatives under strand 1 of the PATH Fund.  The objective of PATH 1 is to increase access to initial teacher education for students from the target groups identified in the National Access Plan, namely Students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, Mature students,  Students with disabilities, Travellers, Part time/flexible learners and Further Education award holders. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in November 2018, I published the Action Plan for Teacher Supply.  One of the actions is for the Higher Education Authority to engage with higher education institutions to develop proposals for flexible options which will facilitate access to, and participation in, Professional Master of Education (PME) programmes in targeted subject areas, including for persons who wish to change careers.  It is intended that this action will be progressed over the coming months. </p>  <p>  Also under the Action Plan, the Department is exploring the provision of additional supports for postgraduate ITE students.  Following from this, an additional &euro;1 million was added to the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) for the current academic year 2018/19 for students attending PME programmes.  The SAF provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level.  Students can be assisted towards rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books/class materials.  The total SAF allocation for 2018/2019 is now &euro;10.1 million.  In accordance with the Action Plan, the Department will continue to consider the provision of additional supports for postgraduate ITE students.</p></reply>

This also extends to the number of access route places.</p>  <p>  The Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) and the Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) offers places at reduced points to school leavers from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and students with disabilities.  Admissions under the HEAR and DARE scheme are regulated by the institutions themselves.  Each institution determines its own admissions policy in relation to the schemes, the number of places they reserve and the allocation of those places.  The HEAR/DARE scheme is administrated by the CAO on behalf of the higher education institutions that participate in the scheme.  The number of places vary year to year and are offered on a course-by-course and HEI-by-HEI basis.</p>  <p>  In 2017 the total eligible HEAR applicants were 4287 of which 3043 accepted an offer and the total eligible DARE applicants were 3542 of which 2423 accepted an offer.  </p>  <p>  Currently, there are 23 HEIs participating on the HEAR scheme and 24 HEIs participating on the DARE scheme.  In addition to the HEAR and DARE schemes, many higher education institutions also operate their own access routes including places available for access students.  </p>  <p>  Arising from the implementation of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-19, my Department has made available increased funding for equity of access both through core institutional budgets and also through targeted funding, including in particular the newly established Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) Fund. </p>  <p>  Through the PATH fund an investment of &euro;16.2 million will be made over a three-year period to support greater levels of access and participation across higher education.

The PSI is an independent statutory body and is responsible for defining and ensuring the standards of education and training for pharmacists qualifying in Ireland.  This includes developing standards, policies and carrying out accreditation of pharmacy degree programmes.</p>  <p>  In August 2014, the Minister for Health approved changes to the education and training of pharmacists.  This change in Pharmacy education has come about because the regulatory body, the PSI, now requires graduates to have completed a Masters degree before entering the PSI Register and practising as a Pharmacist.  The new programme was intended to keep pace with changing healthcare needs in Ireland and offer an improved student experience through its evidence-based and experiental-based learning approach.</p>  <p>  For those students that commenced their pharmacy course from September 2015, the structure of the pharmacist qualification changed from a four-year Bachelor degree programme followed by a one-year Internship Programme (which resulted in the award of a Level 9 degree) to a five-year fully integrated pharmacy degree programme. </p>  <p>  This programme structure supports the dispersal of placements throughout the five years (rather than focussed on the final year) and culminates in the award of a Masters in Pharmacy (M. Pharm) following successful completion of the fifth year. </p>  <p>  State funding under the Free Fees initiative is available for undergraduate awards only.  In practice, this means that the first four years of the pharmacy programme are funded for those students who satisfy the Free Fees criteria.  A full tuition fee is then payable by all students for the final year of the programme, as this is a postgraduate Level 9 award. </p>  <p>  SUSI grant support is available for those students who meet the qualifying criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression.  Different supports are available to undergraduate and postgraduate students.  Qualifying students attending integrated/intercalated courses will be initially assessed in respect of the undergraduate portion of the course.  A separate application will be required in respect of the portion of the course deemed to be the postgraduate element.</p>  <p>  Any students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.  This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.  Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief is available on postgraduate tuition fees paid.  Details in relation to this relief are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

It is completely unacceptable that crimes were not properly pursued in many cases.  This situation must be thoroughly addressed; not only for the victims and the proper administration of justice, but also for the future welfare of children who may go on to commit further crimes. </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities have taken a number of technical and organisational steps to prevent recurrence of the failures identified.  While there have been significant improvements, there is more to be done to achieve a comprehensive solution.  The Commissioner has also established a National Bureau for Child Diversion to improve future management of this whole area. </p>  <p>  The Policing Authority, which was established to provide independent oversight of policing, has indicated that it will follow through with further detailed examination of this matter and the actions being taken by the Commissioner.  I will also continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>  <p>  The issues in question relate to youth crime cases deemed unsuitable for the Garda Diversion Programme.  Therefore, it is important to recognise that there are no negative implications for the effectiveness of the Diversion Programme itself, which has been in operated successfully for many years, helping young offenders turn away from crime.</p></reply>

The YJAP set out on a range of key actions to help reduce the number of young offenders in detention and steer young people away from criminal or anti-social activity, in line with the principles contained in the Children Act.  The YJAP was coordinated by the Irish Youth Justice Service, supported by my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Oberstown Children Detention Campus, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service, Tusla and community stakeholders. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I will be convening an expert Steering Group next month to help guide the development of the new Youth Justice Strategy, including a review of the provisions of the Children Act.

As of 13 January 2019, this response has included:</p>  <p>- 86 arrests.</p>  <p>- 11 persons charged in relation to organised crime gang murder investigations, 3 persons convicted of murder with life sentences imposed.</p>  <p>- 37 firearms seized (in relation to murder offences).</p>  <p>- In the region of 290 searches.</p>  <p>- 16,969 lines of enquiry  conducted with more than 73,220 high visibility checkpoints implemented with significant support from Armed Support Units.</p>  <p>- A significant amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic, and forensic evidence has also been examined.</p>  <p>  We have also seen reports of very significant drugs seizures by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Waterford and Dublin recently which led to a number of arrests being made. Yesterday, as part of an intelligence-led operation targeting serious organised crime activity in the Louth Division, Garda&iacute; from the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, assisted by Officers from the Criminal Assets Bureau and Louth Division, seized a quantity of cannabis herb with a street value thought to be in the region of &euro;940,000 (pending analysis). An arrest was made on foot of the operation and investigations remain ongoing.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of arrests were made in the UK recently on foot of investigations into the supply of drugs and firearms in Ireland and the UK which resulted in a number of court appearances, while others arrested were released under investigation.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the allocation of all Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and his management team and I have no role in this matter. However, I have been advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to monitor all new and emerging crime trends so that Garda resources can be allocated accordingly.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, the Government has increased the budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to &euro;1.76 billion for this year, which will facilitate the continued recruitment of new Garda members as well as Garda staff. The Garda Commissioner has now indicated that it is his intention to recruit a total of 600 trainee Garda&iacute; along with a net 600 Garda staff.  The recruitment of these additional Garda staff will allow the Commissioner to redeploy a further 500 fully trained Garda&iacute; from administrative duties this year to the frontline policing duties for which they were trained.</p>  <p>  I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that the recruitment of Garda members and Garda staff planned for 2019 will ensure that, taking account of projected retirements, the Government's commitment to increasing the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 15,000 Garda members and 4,000 Garda staff by 2021 will be achieved. The number of Garda members in An Garda Siochana increased to just over 14,000 at the end of 2018, a net increase of over 1,000 since the end of 2016.  The Commissioner's plans for the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to frontline policing in 2019 will result in a net additional 1,100 Garda&iacute; deployed to operational policing by the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  This approach to management of resources by the Commissioner, including recruitment and redeployment, is very much in line with the Report of the Commission for the Future of Policing in Ireland which recommended the return of Garda&iacute; to the front line to deliver visible policing. The Deputy will be aware that on 18 December 2018 I published a four year high level plan, &lsquo;A Policing Service for the Future&rsquo;,  which sets out the approach to implementation of the Commission's recommendations. Civilianisation, workforce planning and redeployment are some of the key projects which will continue to be progressed over the lifetime of this reform programme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-01-24a.306.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019012400051#WRH01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 to 120, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that last week I, along with Minister of State Stanton, responded to a Private Member's Motion on rural crime in the D&aacute;il, during which I outlined the initiatives and supports introduced by this Government to tackle rural crime.  I also recognised that when it comes to tackling crime, including rural crime, all members of the Oireachtas are seeking the same goal, which is safer communities for all of our citizens. </p>  <p>  The Government's response to crime in both rural and urban areas is focused on two key objectives: Strengthening the law to get tougher on repeat offenders and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively. I can assure the Deputy that this approach is kept under constant review.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,400 recruits have attested as Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Garda numbers reached almost 14,000 by the end of 2018.  The Garda Commissioner intends to recruit an additional 600 Garda&iacute; next year along with redeploying a further 500 Garda&iacute; from administrative duties to frontline policing. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government underlines the need for close engagement between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities and this is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  As part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnership initiatives with important rural-based organisations such as the IFA, Muintir na Tire and other community organisations. </p>  <p>  It is appropriate to also highlight the Government&rsquo;s plan to implement the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Those recommendations have a core focus on a more visible Garda organisation working closely and collaboratively with communities and other agencies to keep communities safe and to prevent harm to vulnerable people.   </p>  <p>  In relation to the deployment of Garda resources, including personnel, to specific areas, members will appreciate that this is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. However, I am advised that Garda management constantly monitor the distribution of these resources in light of crime trends and overall policing needs at local level &ndash; and this applies equally in both rural and urban areas. A total budget of &euro;1.76 billion has been provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2019, an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation. This substantial investment will provide new and leading edge technology to support our front line Garda&iacute; in carrying out their work in both rural and urban communities.    </p>  <p>  Since November 2015, there has been concentrated policing activity throughout the country as a result of Operation Thor. As of January 2019, there have been over 177,000 targeted checkpoints and more than 270,000 crime prevention patrols carried out nationwide. This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 9,300 arrests and 10,600 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to bring pressure on the gangs and individuals responsible for these type of offences.  </p>  <p>  On 20 December 2018, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) published the latest crime statistics for Q3 2018.  While I am pleased that, nationally, burglary and theft-related offences were down, I am concerned that offences relating to robbery increased over the 12 month period to the end of Q3 2018 when compared to the end of Q3 2017.  This trend must be tackled comprehensively, and the focus on the recruitment of new Garda&iacute; and increased resourcing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reflect this Government&rsquo;s commitment to support Garda&iacute; in the fight against crime.    </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that at the National Ploughing Championships last September, I announced details of the 2018 Text Alert Rebate Scheme which was available to over 1000 local groups registered under the Garda Text Alert Scheme. My Department committed in the region of &euro;150,000 to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme.  </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also committed to support investment in CCTV systems and a grant-aid scheme was launched by my Department in 2017 to assist in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas with 20 CCTV grants scheme applications approved to date. The scheme is open to all groups wishing to take advantage of the available funding.</p>  <p>  Finally, I believe it is absolutely vital that, as elected officials, we continue to encourage all citizens to report all instances of criminality to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Only then can the crime be properly investigated by Garda&iacute;. Furthermore, these reports will allow the Garda authorities to identify any new or emerging crime trends affecting a particular community and, where necessary, allocate Garda resources in order to tackle these developments.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains resolute in its determination to act against those within society who pose a significant threat to the welfare and well-being of our citizens and the communities they serve. All Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity, whether it be in the area of drug offences crime or otherwise.  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime. </p>  <p>  In that regard, I would like to highlight significant drug seizures made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recently in Waterford, Dublin and Louth with a combined estimated value in the region of &euro;1.8 million. These seizures, which also led to arrests being made, were the result of meticulous, intelligence-led planning and execution by key branches of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the fight against drugs and organised crime. </p>  <p>  The Government has allocated very significant resources to policing in recent years, and this will continue; in particular, through the accelerated programme of Garda recruitment. This will undoubtedly enhance policing services for all communities across the country. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as a result of these additional resources, he has been able to assign additional personnel to the Specialist Bureaus that come within the ambit of Special Crime Operations, including the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  I would like to re-affirm that the Government remains committed to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make communities safer.</p></reply>

This order requires the person concerned to remove themselves from the State and remain outside the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Order is a matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. </p>  <p>  Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned requesting that the deportation order be revoked, pursuant to the provisions of section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). All relevant aspects of the case will be considered before a decision is made. </p>  <p>  The Deputy might wish to note that the decision to ensue from the consideration of this request will be to have the existing deportation order &lsquo;affirmed&rsquo; or &lsquo;revoked&rsquo;. Once such a decision has been made, this decision will be notified in writing. In the meantime, the deportation order remains valid and in place.</p>  <p>  The person concerned was required to 'present' at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 7 April 2005, to make arrangements for his deportation from the State. The person concerned failed to 'present' on that occasion and is therefore recorded as a person who is evading deportation. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and to facilitate the practical actions to be taken in response to the UK's exit from the EU.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme provides affordable working capital to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees that are or will be impacted by Brexit and meet the scheme criteria. The &euro;23 million exchequer funding (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million.  </p>  <p>  It has been designed to assist eligible Irish businesses in the short-term to deal with the challenges of Brexit, which include the pressures of increased market instability and currency volatility. The scheme is open to both State Agency clients and businesses that do not have any relationship with State Agencies. Sole traders may also apply. </p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process.  First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. This application process requires businesses to use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form. As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet the challenges posed by Brexit. Guidance is available on the SBCI website on how to complete a business plan.  The SBCI assess the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number. </p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank.  Approval of loans under the Brexit Loan Scheme is subject to the finance providers&rsquo; own credit policies and procedures.</p>  <p>  The scheme was launched in March 2018 and, as at close of business on 18th January, there have been 376 eligibility applications received of which 337 eligibility applications have been approved and 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level to a value of &euro;14.9m. </p>  <p>  Of the 337 eligibility applications, 42 food businesses have been approved for eligibility from the following categories: 2 under &lsquo;Non-Primary Agriculture&rsquo;, 27 under &lsquo;Manufacturing&rsquo;, 8 under &lsquo;Wholesale &amp;amp; Retail Trade and 5 under &lsquo;Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Service Activities&rsquo;.  Of the 65 loans progressed to sanction at Bank level, 8 relate to food businesses to a value of &euro;3.8m.</p></reply>

The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year, with approximately 1.3 million attendances in 2018, up 3.5% on 2017. This reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 years and over age group. Patients in this age group are the highest users of most health and social care services, have more complex needs and longer stays in our acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  However, the National Service Plan 2018 includes an expected activity target that 100% of patients aged 75 and over are discharged or admitted within 24 hours of registration.  Therefore, any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific question the Deputy has asked, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly.</p></reply>

These safety features take the form of an anti-tamper device (e.g. foil seal, breakable cap) and a set of unique identifiers embedded in a 2D barcode on the pack.  </p>  <p>  The Delegated Regulation is directly applicable across all EU Member States.  However, a Statutory Instrument is being prepared to ensure that the Irish legislative system is consistent with the requirements of the new Regulation.  </p>  <p>  The Delegated Regulation was finalised and published in 2016.  The intervening 3 year transition period allowed more than ample time for all concerned parties to prepare well in advance of the legislation coming into full effect on 9th February 2019.  Details of the requirements of the Delegated Regulation have been widely communicated to all sectors throughout this 3 year transition period, including to the HSE. </p>  <p>  The intention of the provisions of the national Regulations in respect of persons authorised to supply medicinal products to the public, is that the offences for non-compliance with this EU Commission Delegated Regulation will be in line with offences already set out in other national medicinal product legislation.  The new national Regulations, The Medicinal Products (Safety Features on Packaging) Regulations 2019, currently in draft form, are made under Section 32 of the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, as is the case with existing medicinal product Regulations which already provide for such rules and offences for non-compliance occurrences. </p>  <p>  As with other medicinal products Regulations, this national legislation will provide that the &lsquo;persons&rsquo; upon whom any proposed sanctions or penalties are placed may be a body corporate as well as an individual.  This is dealt with by section 18(c) of the Interpretation Act 2005, which provides that a reference to "person" in any enactment includes a body corporate as well as an individual.  </p>  <p>  To reiterate this important point, the liable parties and the corresponding offences for this Delegated Regulation are in line with existing legislative arrangements governing the sale and supply of medicinal products to the public.  There is nothing new in terms of the obligations under this legislation in terms of the focus of where the legal obligations lie.  It is the responsibility of the body corporate to ensure that the infrastructure is in place and correctly functioning to facilitate the pharmacist decommissioning the medicinal product from the national repository prior to supplying to the patient.  It is also the responsibility of the pharmacist that dispenses the medicinal product to comply with their requirements under this legislation.  It will be for the appropriate regulator to decide who might be prosecuted for an offence specified in the Statutory Instrument.  </p>  <p>  The Department recommends that HSE personnel who have questions or concerns relating to their obligations and the obligations of their organisation under Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/161 and the draft Medicinal Products (Safety Features on Packaging) Regulations 2018, should seek guidance from HSE Management in the first instance, including the readiness of the infrastructure to facilitate decommissioning of medicines, and from their professional Regulator. </p>  <p>  The Department is considering all points submitted in the consultation.</p></reply>

There are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain, and these additional stocks, together with planning by Revenue to allow the fast-tracking of essential drugs into Ireland, will help deal with any delays that may arise.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions. To do so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the HPRA developed and launched a multi-stakeholder Medicine Shortages Framework to anticipate and manage medicine shortages when they occur. This framework is used to manage and address an average of 45 shortage notifications a month. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit.</p>  <p>  As an additional safeguard, consideration is being given to those categories of medicines which are considered most essential to public health. HSE and HPRA technical experts are undertaking a process to verify the contingency planning in place for the continuity of supply of medicines essential to public health, in order to determine those medicines that have the potential to be vulnerable to supply disruption and, where necessary, identify clinically appropriate alternatives. Work on this process is ongoing and will continue in the months before and after Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Both the HPRA and HSE have requested that medicines manufacturers and suppliers highlight any issues regarding the availability of specific products associated with Brexit and, to date, no major issues have been identified through this process.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the Authority's last significant fee increase was in 2010. In 2011 and 2012, the HPRA reduced fees, and there were no fee increases between 2013 and 2017. Fees were increased by approximately 2% in 2018. </p>  <p>  The impact of new EU legislation continues to be felt across the HPRA. For example, the Falsified Medicines Directive will commence in February 2019, the Medical Devices Regulations will commence in May 2020, the Clinical Trials Regulation is scheduled to be implemented in 2020 and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulations will commence in 2022. The regulatory model for medicines is becoming more complex, and EU pharmacovigilance legislation has led to an increase in the number of referrals and regulatory actions arising from the outcome of these referrals. Public scrutiny and the role of the regulator in relation to medical devices and medicines such as the HPV vaccine has increased, while compliance activity is also increasing.</p>  <p>  Over the last several years, the HPRA has continued to enhance services to support the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland. The development of an innovation office and an international platform has brought greater oversight and global co-operation to the benefit of all stakeholders and of public health. The development of the agency has ensured that the HPRA is well placed to negotiate the impact of Brexit and continual changes in the regulatory environment.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that Brexit and the Falsified Medicines Directive will also present significant challenges to the pharmaceutical industry. However, the HPRA plays a vital role in supporting this industry, and this fee increase is considered necessary in order to enable the Authority to continue to fulfil its public health remit.</p></reply>

Where a patient requires care not available in a particular location, the patient should be transferred to a hospital/service where the necessary care is available. </p>  <p>  The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 makes provision for women in cases where a medical practitioner has not given an opinion or has given an opinion that would not lead to certification for termination of pregnancy to be carried out.  Section 13 of the Act provides that the woman, or a person acting on her behalf, may make an application to the HSE for a review of the relevant decision. Within 3 days of receiving such an application, the HSE must convene a committee of medical practitioners to review the relevant decision.  The committee must complete its review not later than 7 days from the date on which it was established.</p>  <p>  Under section 7 of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, I am committed to carrying out a review of the operation of the Act not later than three years after it was commenced.</p></reply>

Several of the PSI&rsquo;s functions under the Pharmacy Act 2007 relate to education, including promoting and ensuring the highest standards in education and training for the qualification to practise as a pharmacist, and make sure that relevant experience is gained in the course of that pharmacy education and training.</p>  <p>  In 2010 the PSI commissioned a review of the five year programme of education and training for the pharmacist qualification in Ireland.  One of the recommendations included the introduction of an integrated 5-year Masters level programme of education and training for pharmacists in line with international best practice, to replace the previous 4 year Bachelor plus 1 year in-service practical training programme.</p>  <p>  A National Forum was established to advise and assist the Council of the PSI in its oversight of the development and ongoing delivery of the new fully integrated programme of pharmacy education, training and assessment.  The National Forum for Pharmacy Education and Accreditation Interim Report of November 2013 noted that it was an essential component of the integrated degree that the student remain a student for the full five years of study. Under the previous model, students became employees during their final year.</p>  <p>  Since September 2015, students commencing their pharmacy education undertake a PSI-accredited five-year fully integrated Master&rsquo;s degree programme in pharmacy, with the first cohort awarded this MPharm degree graduating in 2020.  This programme is operated by the schools of pharmacy in three universities in Ireland (Trinity College Dublin, University College Cork and Royal College of Surgeons Ireland). </p>  <p>  This newer pharmacy programme provides for both the academic and practical experience that is required by students to qualify to practise as a pharmacist in Ireland. Students qualify after 5 years with a Masters in Pharmacy and are eligible to apply for registration as a pharmacist with the PSI.</p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Education and Training) (Integrated Course) Rules 2014 (S.I. No. 377 of 2014) is the legislation which underpins the new 5 year MPharm educational programme.  It includes the programme recognition and accreditation requirements, and details about the in-service training placements for students. </p>  <p>  Part of the PSI&rsquo;s accreditation process involves visits to the universities operating the MPharm programme, which includes meeting with representative students at each School of Pharmacy.  The accreditation teams assess the programme of training and education various standards, including one related to students and the supports available to students.</p>  <p>  The PSI has stated that it will continue to engage with the academic institutions that deliver the MPharm programme and their role is to ensure the quality of the MPharm programme and high standards in education and training for the qualification to practise as a pharmacist.</p></reply>

Those measures included medicines which might not be approved for reimbursement including Pembrolizumab, once they are prescribed by the treating clinician.</p>  <p>  Following that decision, concerns were raised regarding the provision of Pembrolizumab to other cervical cancer patients on the same basis as encompassed by the Government decision of 11 May 2018.  In the light of those concerns, I asked the HSE to examine ways in which other women with cervical cancer could be afforded access to Pembrolizumab if prescribed by their treating clinician. </p>  <p>  That examination would have to have regard to the fact that the drug Pembrolizumab does not have  a marketing authorisation in Europe and accordingly  cannot be considered for reimbursement through the HSE statutory process. Furthermore, any decision would have to have regard to the fact  that Pembrolizumab is an off label  investigational medicine for the treatment of cervical cancer and that supporting evidence for the use of this drug to treat cervical cancer is limited.</p>  <p>  Following discussions between my  Department  and the HSE,  the HSE has put in place arrangements which will facilitate access to Pembrolizumab for cervical cancer patients, on a case-by-case basis in public hospitals, when a treating clinician determines that this is in the patient&rsquo;s best interests.  All prescribing decisions will be entirely a matter for the treating clinician, in line with patient safety protocols and the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics.  The HSE has communicated this approach to hospitals and medical oncologists.  </p>  <p>  This arrangement will apply to cervical cancer patients only.  The statutory responsibility of the HSE for medicine pricing and reimbursement decisions, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, remains unchanged.</p></reply>

As such, all policy meetings relating to areas exposed to the UK in a Brexit context feature a common thread of discussion on Brexit matters.</p>  <p>  It is the most significant challenge facing the agrifood sector at this time. Therefore, my officials and I meet on a daily basis internally, with state agencies and with representatives from the agri-food and fisheries sectors to discuss and prepare for Brexit.  We also meet regularly with Ministerial colleagues and their officials, with EU Commissioners and their officials, as well as with EU counterparts </p>  <p>  The meetings with the main industry representative organisations such as Meat Industry Ireland, and  Food and Drink Industry Ireland, as well as with the farming and fishing representative organisations provide me with an opportunity to hear their concerns, to outline their challenges that the UK withdrawal from the EU will present to them and allow me and my officials update them on developments at EU level and on our preparedness measures. </p>  <p>  Brexit is a standing agenda item on my Department's weekly Management Board meetings, where all of the necessary policy and preparedness issues are addressed.  Both Minister Doyle and myself have attended Management Board meetings where we have been fully briefed on my Department's planning for a central and no-deal Brexit scenario.  I and my officials are also continuing to meet with my EU counterparts in key Member States to ensure they are fully aware of Ireland's concerns about the impact of Brexit on the agri-food sector.  </p>  <p>  Brexit is also a standing item on the agenda for the regular High Level Committee meetings which oversee the implementation of the FoodWise 2025 programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, I and my officials have had a range of bilateral meetings with Commissioner Hogan, with other EU Commissioners, with the Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier and with Commission officials to apprise them of Ireland's key 'asks' of the Brexit negotiations and to apprise them of the impacts Brexit will have on the sector.</p>  <p>  Finally, myself and my officials are in regular discussion with Cabinet colleagues and their officials to discuss developments and strategies around Brexit as part of the 'whole of Government' response to Brexit. </p></reply>

Therefore, my Department has had extensive engagement with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys and her Department in relation to employment permits for non-European Economic Area nationals.</p>  <p>  This engagement culminated in my Department submitting a detailed, evidence based case to Minister Humphreys Department earlier this year which laid out the justification for granting employment permits to three sectors &ndash; dairy farm assistants, general operatives in meat plants, and horticultural farm assistants. This resulted in the introduction in May 2018 of a pilot quota of permits by Minister Humphreys, including 500 for horticulture workers. So far, I understand that 39 of these have been issued, with around 60 applications having been received. These numbers are lower than was expected, although I understand that with the drought and the timing of the announcement, demand may have been lower than anticipated.</p>  <p>  Alongside the dedicated pilot scheme for the agri-food sector, it is also important to point out that an overarching review of the broader employment permit system has been carried out by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Minister Humphreys published the report on this review last September and my Department, having actively participated in the review, is now part of an inter-departmental group tasked with implementing the recommendations. I am confident that this exercise will lead to a permit regime that is more flexible and adaptable to the labour needs of the agri-food sector, particularly for seasonal employment.</p></reply>

The derogation provided for under Community rules on the movement of equidae is applicable to movements between EU Member States only. It is not inclusive of movements between the EU and Third Countries. </p>  <p>  Currently Ireland is part of a Tripartite Agreement (TPA), along with the UK and France which allows for the movement and trade of horses between the three countries without undergoing veterinary inspections and without health certificates. As the TPA is based on EU legislation on the movement of horses within the EU, the UK cannot be part of the Agreement once it becomes a Third Country. </p>  <p>  The current focus of our 'no deal' contingency planning is on the arrangements that will be necessary for the Department to fulfil its legal obligations with respect to import controls on live animals and agri food products as efficiently as possible while also ensuring the minimum possible disruption to trading arrangements. </p>  <p>  As part of this planning we are upgrading existing Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) and developing additional BIPs to cater for the increased volume of inspections necessary, including in respect of equines being imported from the UK, and making arrangements to facilitate the certification of horses to the UK as necessary. </p></reply>

This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p><p>The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. When this Government came into office, this had risen to 52%. Today, 74% of premises can access high speed broadband. </p><p>Commercial operators have invested over &euro;2.75bn in upgrading and modernising their networks over the past 5 years, and further investments are planned.</p><p>Under a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017, eir is in the process of passing 300,000 predominantly rural homes with high speed broadband. According to information submitted by eir to my Department, as of Quarter 4 2018 the company has passed some 225,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. This is in the process of verification by officials in my Department.</p><p>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available on that company&rsquo;s website, . A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.dccae.gov.ie.</p><p>The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. My priority is to bring the procurement process to a fair and impartial conclusion as quickly as possible and I will bring a recommendation to Government in this regard in the coming weeks.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements.</p></reply>

The aim of the scheme, a joint policy initiative between my Department and the Department of Health, which began in 2016, is to demonstrate the positive effects that making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and well-being of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition. An independent research project is underway alongside the scheme's delivery and will assess the impact the scheme is having.</p><p>The Deep Retrofit Pilot Scheme which launched in 2017 is investigating how to create a scalable offering for the deep retrofit of Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER), while building consumer demand and contractor capacity for deep retrofit. Under the scheme Government is funding up to 50% of the total capital and project management costs for homes that achieve an A3 Building Energy Rating post retrofit.</p><p>The information requested in relation to number and value of grants provided under each scheme, by county breakdown for 2014 to 2018 where available, is set out in the following tables contained in the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

Details of the proportions of electricity generated from oil, gas, coal, wind, solar or other renewable sources are available in Table 8 <i>&ldquo;Growth rates, quantities and shares of electricity generated by fuel&rdquo;</i>on page 29 of the report.  The report sets out the progress that Ireland has made in reducing reliance on fossil fuels for transport, heating and electricity production. In 2017, as Ireland&rsquo;s economy grew by 7.2% as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) or 3% as measured by gross national income (GNI), whereas energy use increased by 0.5%. The report also states that renewable energy use grew by 52% between 2013 and 2017.  Notwithstanding this, over 90% of all energy used, including transport, in Ireland in 2017 was from fossil fuels. </p><p>There are no specific international requirements on the composition of electricity generation in the fuel mix.  The EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.  SEAI analysis states that 10.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources. This avoided 4.1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions and &euro;439 million of fossil fuel imports. Ireland achieved 30.1% of electricity, 6.9% of heat and 7.4% of transport energy requirements using renewable energy sources in 2017.</p></reply>

Table 11 (Page 34) shows that the share of electricity from renewable energy has increased fourfold between 2005 and 2017 &ndash; from 7.2% to 30.1% - an increase of 23 percentage points over 12 years.  Table 11 also shows how electricity production from wind energy has increased to the point where it accounted for 84% of the renewable electricity generated in 2017.  Electricity generated from biomass accounted for 8% of renewable electricity in 2017. Biomass consists of contributions from solid biomass, landfill gas, the renewable portion of waste and other biogas (including anaerobic digestion). Renewable electricity (or non-fossil fuel) generation accounted for 30.1% of gross electricity consumption in 2017.  SEAI does not have any preliminary data for the year 2018 yet.</p><p>Wind, hydro and solar photovoltaic (PV) generated electricity in 2017, respectively, accounted for 25.2%, 2.4% and 0.04% of Ireland&rsquo;s gross electricity consumption.  Wave energy technology is still at the Research, Development and Demonstration stage globally.  Tidal energy is a little closer to commercialisation.</p><p>Details in relation to All-Island electricity system demand and fuel mix are publicly available on the EirGrid website at <i></i><i>/</i>.  This includes information on the number, type and generating capacity of plants on the system. EirGrid&rsquo;s report titled <i>&ldquo;All-Island Generation Capacity Statement&rdquo;</i>(Pages 12 and 13) gives details of the fuel mix (2017) from different energy sources for both Ireland and Northern Ireland. Regarding grid stability, EirGrid are progressing plans for further cross border interconnection and initiatives that encourage flexibility such as the DS3 programme that support integration of more intermittent generation sources.</p><p>The total amount of renewable generation connected to the grid at November 2018 was 3,938MW, of which wind generation was approximately 3,610MW, hydro was 238MW and biomass was 91MW.  Eirgrid estimates that a total of between 3,900MW and 4,300MW of onshore renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland to achieve 40% renewable electricity by 2020.</p><p>In regard to projected electricity needed for the next five and ten years, EirGrid have projected a number of scenarios in the publication titled &ldquo;<i>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Energy Scenarios 2017</i>&ndash; Planning our Energy Future&rdquo; (July 2017). </p></reply>

In the electricity sector, which accounts for less than one fifth of Ireland's overall emissions, we have made good progress and are well on our way to our target of 40% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector by at least 80% by 2050.  As energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are linked, meeting this objective requires a radical transformation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy system from being predominantly fossil fuel based to a clean, low carbon energy system.   As set out in the Energy Policy White Paper, a low-carbon future involves moving away from high-emissions fuels in electricity generation to lower emissions fuels such as gas, and ultimately away from fossil fuels altogether.  This policy is fully aligned with EU policy objectives of decarbonisation in the electricity sector. </p>  <p>  On the way to achieving this low-carbon future, it is settled policy that Moneypoint will cease burning coal by 2025, and the three peat-fired electricity generating stations in th Midlands will cease burning peat before 2030. All three plants have been awarded support for biomass combustion under the REFIT3 Scheme for up to 30% of the installed capacity up to 2030. Bord na M&oacute;na commenced co-firing at its Edenderry Plant with biomass in 2008, and it is expected that ESB will commence co-firing at its 2 peat fired plants with biomass in 2020, subject to the plants receiving planning permission. </p>  <p>  In relation to electricity generating stations being restricted in the past twelve months on the basis of their levels of GHG emissions, all fossil fuel based stations participate under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which is a system designed to reduce emissions and provides a strong incentive to decarbonise the manner in which these installations produce electricity. EU ETS carbon prices have been on average over &euro;20 per tonne since August 2018. As the carbon price rises even further, these installations become less economically viable, and incentivises companies to move to lower GHG emitting technologies, including renewable generation. </p></reply>

The full report is available on the CRU website:<i>  </i>As the Deputy is aware, the PSO levy has been in place since 2001 and consists of a set of support schemes designed to facilitate national electricity policy objectives for renewables, indigenous fuels and security of supply. It has successfully delivered on these objectives, with a total amount of renewable generation connected to the electricity grid of 3,938 Mega Watts (MW) in November 2018, the vast majority of which was comprised of onshore wind generation. </p><p>The Generation Capacity Statement published annually by EirGrid provides a forecast of expected electricity demand and the level of generation capacity that will be required on the island over the next ten years, using a range of scenarios. Under a median demand forecast, EirGrid currently anticipates Ireland&rsquo;s total electricity requirement peak will exceed 6.5 GW by 2026. This data is used to plan for future electricity generation adequacy, security of supply, and associated network enhancements.

I do not have statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services and make specific investments in particular locations. </p>  <p>  With regard to mobile telephony service quality in other countries, comparisons between Member States and within regions can be problematic for many reasons, including the fact that the technical characteristics of mobile phone networks determining coverage and capacity will vary between operators and locations.  Other factors include the characteristics of individual markets, including topography, population density, frequencies used etc. </p>  <p>  The Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce produced a report in December 2016, available on my Department's website, containing 40 actions to alleviate telecommunications networks coverage deficits. An Implementation Group is overseeing implementation of the actions and comprises all key stakeholders responsible for delivery. </p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development published the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce Implementation Review 2017 on 21 February 2018, which comprehensively outlines the progress made in 2017 on the Taskforce actions.  Of the 40 actions, 29 had been completed, with work on the remaining 11 carrying into the 2018 Work Programme. Following close engagement with stakeholders at the inaugural National Stakeholder Forum 2017, 23 new measures were identified for delivery in 2018. The outcome of discussions at the second Annual National Stakeholder Forum held in October 2018 informed preparation of the 2018 Annual Review report which will be published shortly together with the 2019 Work Programme. </p>  <p>  Some of the Taskforce's key achievements to date in addressing mobile phone coverage issues include:</p>  <p>  - Work by my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development to achieve a greater consensus around site selection for telecoms infrastructure and therefore improve mobile phone coverage.</p>  <p>  - Both Departments are working with a pilot group of local authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots. This pilot exercise has been completed, with all local authorities having been asked to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to provide additional coverage on an economic basis.</p>  <p>  - Establishment of a focus group to provide guidance with respect on categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The focus group report was published on my Department's website on 31 August 2018. It is anticipated that the output of the focus group should influence the actions of the mobile network operators in their work to reduce mobile phone blackspots, as well as informing future policy in my Department with regard to priorities for mobile phone services.</p>  <p>  - Work underway by a working group which is investigating the feasibility of developing standardised policy for accessing and utilising State and publicly-owned assets for the deployment of telecommunications infrastructure.</p>  <p>  - ComReg is delivering a composite national coverage map, which will, in tandem with its work on handset testing and activities to raise consumer awareness, allow people across Ireland to optimise the service available to them. </p>  <p>  - Development by ComReg of a licensing scheme enabling households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</p>  <p>  ComReg is providing expert advice to the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce and has committed to implementing a number of actions designed to improve the service experience of mobile phone users. In late 2016, in accordance with its strategic plan and in alignment with taskforce actions, the Regulator commenced several projects to gain greater understanding of factors affecting mobile user experience, including the effect of building materials on indoor coverage. </p>  <p>  In 2017 ComReg published the results of a survey, the first of its kind in Ireland, investigating Irish people's experience and perceptions of their mobile phone service. The survey involved over 2,800 face-to-face interviews and to ensure that the experience of those in rural areas were captured, the survey sampled a higher percentage of those living in less densely populated parts of the country. The full report can be found on ComReg's website at www.comreg.ie/publications. </p>  <p>  In tandem with the work of the Taskforce, the release by ComReg of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which has been identified at EU level as a primary band suitable for 5G rollout, will also contribute to addressing increasing mobile data demands and improve mobile coverage. Mobile operators' commercial investment has also resulted in improved services, following ComReg's 2012 multi-band spectrum auction. at least one operator has now in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. </p>  <p>  All of these initiatives should help enhance the quality of mobile phone and data services, particularly in rural areas.</p></reply>

Neither my Department nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing of insurance products. The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered are commercial matters for insurance companies and are based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. These are considered by insurance companies on a case by case basis.</p><p>Consideration is given to the age of the driver, the type of car, the claims record, driving experience, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc. Insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, prices vary across the market and consumers are free to choose. Insurance companies price in accordance with their own past claims experience, for example, where the age of a car is a factor, different insurance companies would use different age thresholds. The Cost of Insurance Working Group is looking at the circumstances behind the  cost of motor insurance and how to improve the situation, but will still not be able to directly affect the actual costs of motor insurance.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council. </p>  <p>  Prior to the financial crisis, applications for funding for road improvement projects would have been considered as part of the Specific Improvement, and Strategic Regional and Local Road Grant Schemes. However, the extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the crisis meant these grant schemes had to be curtailed after 2013 because expenditure on maintenance/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network. </p>  <p>  The NDP does provide for the gradual build up in funding for the road network but it will take some years yet to reach the level required for the adequate maintenance and renewal of the network. For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes.  </p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific and Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework and it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  </p>  <p>  Under the capital project appraisal process a Preliminary Appraisal has to be submitted in relation to each proposed project.  Once an appraisal is received it is assessed taking into account other competing projects and the overall roads budget. A Preliminary Appraisal has been received from Donegal County Council and is currently under review.</p>  <p>  It is expected that regional and local road allocations for 2019 will be notified to local authorities shortly.  </p></reply>

The savings arising from the initial reduction and subsequent discontinuance of the telephone allowance meant that my Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2018 I announced a new scheme called the Telephone Support Allowance (TSA). The primary objective of the TSA payment is to allow the most vulnerable people access to personal alarms or phones for security by providing a contribution towards the cost. People in receipt of qualifying Social Protection payments and also in receipt of the living alone increase and fuel allowance automatically qualify for the TSA.</p>  <p>  Unlike the previous telephone allowance element of the Household benefits package, the TSA does not require that a person have a telephone, or subscribe to any utility company, in order to receive payment, and I am not convinced that the introduction of a payment with such a criterion is the most effective way of using additional resources to support older people.  Instead, the approach taken by the Government has been to increase general payments to all pensioners, and enhance additional targeted supports for those pensioners most at risk of poverty.</p>  <p>  The criteria for the TSA are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  Fuel Allowance is a means tested payment and these criteria will ensure that the TSA payment goes to those most at risk of social isolation. </p>  <p>  Any decision to extend the TSA scheme to all pensioners regardless of their means or personal circumstances or to reinstate the telephone allowance element of the household benefits package would have significant budget implications and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen and participants have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing this valuable work in their local communities.</p>  <p>  As the RSS is a supplementary income support scheme designed specifically for those whose income falls below a certain limit, an individual must continue to satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme to be eligible to participate on the RSS.</p>  <p>  If a participant&rsquo;s circumstances change, a means test is undertaken to determine their new rate of payment.  The means assessment for RSS includes income that the participant and their spouse, civil partner or cohabitant has in addition to any capital or property (except their own home).  Payment of RSS is not taken into account when assessing the weekly means.  If changes were made to the conditions to allow all participants receive the full rate of payment regardless of their means, it would in effect change the nature of the scheme of supporting farmers and farm families with low incomes.</p>  <p>  The rate paid to a participant on the RSS is equivalent to the participants underlying social welfare payment plus a top-up of &euro;22.50 subject to a minimum payment of &euro;220.50.  RSS participants in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s pension or disability allowance retain their payment and also receive a top-up payment which will bring the minimum weekly payment equal to &euro;220.50.</p>  <p>  As part of the recent Social Welfare Budget package for 2019, I increased the weekly personal rate for participants by &euro;5.00 with proportionate increases in weekly payments for qualified adult dependants with effect from March 2019.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive.</p>  <p>  SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.  Following a tendering process, my Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard.  It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft Guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report under the SEA process, will be commenced later in Q1 2019, with the aim of issuing the finalised Guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in mid 2019.</p>  <p>  When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

My Department has been working closely with all local authorities to ensure that new social and affordable homes are delivered from the public land bank, including that of Dublin City Council, with particular emphasis on prioritising those sites with the greatest potential to deliver housing at scale, in the short to medium term.</p><p>All local authorities are being funded to significantly increase their delivery of social housing as part of the Rebuilding Ireland programme and a strong social housing construction pipeline is already in place for local authorities and approved housing bodies. Some 2,586 social housing homes in the Dublin City Council area are either completed or are currently progressing through the various stages of the project life-cycle. Further projects will continue to be added to the pipeline on an ongoing basis.</p><p>A detailed breakdown of the social housing construction programme, including that of Dublin City Council, is set out in the Social Housing Construction Status Report which is published on a quarterly basis. The report covering the period up to end Quarter 3 2018 is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: .  The report for Q4 2018 is currently being prepared.</p><p>In terms of affordable housing, a targeted approach is being pursued to support local authorities.  To this end, I have provided additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund. Under Budget 2019, a total of &euro;310 million will be provided for this purpose over the course of 2019 to 2021. I approved the first tranche of funding under the Fund on 11 December 2018, through which some &euro;43 million in funding is being provided to facilitate the delivery of some 1,400 affordable homes. Details of the Dublin City Council SSF projects are listed in the following table.<table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Project/Location</th><th>Total   Provisional Cost of Proposal<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>Provisional<br /><br />Exchequer Grant Amount<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>Provisional<br /><br />Local Authority Contribution<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>Affordable Housing Potential</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin<br /><br />City</td><td>Cherry<br /><br />Orchard</td><td>&euro;7,645,415</td><td>&euro;6,804,419</td><td>&euro;840,996</td><td>183</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin<br /><br />City</td><td>Balbutcher,<br /><br />Ballymun</td><td>&euro;4,135,351</td><td>&euro;3,680,462</td><td>&euro;454,889</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin<br /><br />City</td><td>Sillogue,<br /><br />Ballymun</td><td>&euro;3,975,000</td><td>&euro;3,537,750</td><td>&euro;437,250</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>-</td><td>&euro;15,755,766</td><td>&euro;14,022,631</td><td>&euro;1,733,135</td><td>340</td></tr></table></p><p>The combination of this Fund and the significantly increased funding for the social housing programme will open up more opportunities for larger mixed-tenure developments.  My Department will continue to engage proactively with the City Council to accelerate the delivery of these projects, in particular on such key sites as O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road, which combined will deliver over 1,200 homes.</p><p>As regards other public sites in Dublin that are not in the ownership of local authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA) is in the process of advancing agreements with various State bodies, including the Housing Agency, the Office of Public Works, and the HSE, which are participating in the first tranche of land agreements in the Dublin region, and is keen to work in partnership and co-operation with local authorities.  A detailed business plan for the LDA is currently in development and will provide additional information on its delivery programme.</p><p>Acknowledging that renters in Dublin are currently facing significant access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the introduction of a not-for-profit, cost rental sector in Ireland. Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p><p>A significant early mover project is being advanced by Dublin City Council, which will deliver important lessons in terms of cost rental in an Irish setting, at Emmet Road, Inchicore. While the final tenure-mix on the site will be decided by Dublin City Council, to be informed by the detailed site development process, it will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided by the City Council under cost rental arrangements. My Department is also engaging with the National Development Finance Agency, the European Investment Bank and the LDA to examine the optimum funding and delivery options to support cost rental delivery at scale in Dublin and other urban areas.</p><p>Finally the approved housing body sector includes a number of housing co-operatives whose objectives are to provide social and affordable housing. These bodies are supported through a range of schemes for both social and affordable housing which are funded by the State through the local authorities. In addition, some local authorities facilitated housing developments through supporting co-operatives to deliver housing under the low cost sites scheme. With the introduction of a new affordable purchase housing scheme and cost rental, supported by the Serviced Sites Fund, there will be further opportunities for approved housing bodies, including co-operatives, to provide affordable housing.</p></reply>

Such tenants pay the differential rent set out in the relevant housing authority differential rent scheme.  </p>  <p>  In the case of homes funded historically under the now closed Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme, social housing tenants, that is, households nominated by the housing authority, pay a rent to be determined by the AHB, subject to a minimum set out by my Department, as a condition of the provision of funding under the scheme. Where the development was partly - at least 5% - funded by the AHB itself, however, up to 25% of the tenancies could be allocated to households/persons not on a social housing waiting list, and in such cases the rent to be paid is a matter for the AHB itself.</p>  <p>  In the case of AHB units funded under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), it also the case that up to 25% of tenancies may be allocated to persons not on the housing authority&rsquo;s social housing waiting list in cases where the units are at least 5% funded by the AHB. In such cases the rent will be determined by the AHB.  Social housing tenants in CAS units pay, as a condition of funding under the scheme, an economic rent; if this rent is unaffordable, tenants may avail of support under Rent Supplement from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>  <p>  Occasionally AHBs acquire units without funding from my Department (e.g. bequests, gifts). In such cases, the allocation of tenancies and the rent to be paid is a matter for the individual AHB concerned.</p>  <p>  Discussions on affordable housing are ongoing between my Department, local authorities and AHBs. However, no proposal of the nature referred to by the Deputy has been received by my Department at this time.   </p></reply>

In seeking to ensure that the commemorative programme is authentic and comprehensive, I am particularly interested in ensuring that the vital role of women in making and shaping our national shared history will continue to be acknowledged and lead to a deepening of the public awareness and understanding of the role. </p>  <p>  The history and achievements of Cumann na mBan have previously been commemorated under the State commemorative programme, specifically with a conference at the National Museum Collins Barracks in April 2014 and a commemorative stamp issued by An Post the same year.  In 2016 the State commemoration to honour the role of women in the Easter Rising was led by President Higgins at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on International Women's Day.  On 6 February last year I marked the date of passage of the legislation introducing the voting rights for women and their right to stand in parliamentary elections with the publication of the Mn&aacute;1916 book by my Department, a copy of which I shared with each member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The story of Cumann na mBan is also featured in both the Decade of Centenaries website and Century Ireland, the online contemporary newspaper of the Centenary programme supported by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Decade of Centenaries commemorative programme 2019-2023 will be based on a four strand approach comprising:</p>  <p>  - A State Ceremonial Strand which will comprise a limited number of symbolic acts of national commemoration focusing on themes of remembrance and reconciliation and on the commemoration of all of those who lost their lives during this period.</p>  <p>  - An Historical Strand which will comprise a diverse range of activities designed to encourage authentic historical enquiry about this period and promote the use of primary archival sources. Initiatives will be developed in collaboration with State partners, National Cultural Institutions, institutions of learning and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  - A Community Strand, which will involve a collaborative approach &ndash; similar to that adopted for the 1916 centenary commemorations &ndash; between the State, local authority network and community organisations, including in Northern Ireland where appropriate.</p>  <p>  - The Creative Imagination Strand, which will continue to encourage artistic and creative expression in remembrance of the significant historical events of the period from 1919 to 1923 and all of those who lost their lives.</p>  <p>  The development of Cumann na mBan and it's significant contribution to the nation over the course of this historical period will continue to be recognised through these four commemorative strands.</p></reply>
