    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-23a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300064#WRA00700"><p>Following extensive mediation discussions, agreement was reached between the St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) on the relocation of the NMH to the Elm Park campus. The terms of this agreement provides for the establishment of a new company which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services. It is vitally important that the legal and governance arrangements associated with this project are robust. Considerable work has been undertaken to develop a legal framework to protect the State's significant investment in the new hospital and ensure the hospital building remains in State ownership; it is hoped to conclude this work shortly. This legal framework will underpin the operational and clinical independence of the new hospital, ensuring care in the new maternity hospital will be delivered without religious, ethnic or other distinction and any medical procedure which is in accordance with the laws of the land will be carried out there. Once finalised, proposals will be subject to consideration with the parties concerned. I can assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the development of the new maternity hospital on the St Vincent's campus. This is a vital project for women and babies in Ireland, representing the flagship project of the National Maternity Strategy and the largest single investment ever made in maternity services in Ireland. The model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally. Government policy is therefore to co-locate all remaining maternity hospitals with adult acute services in order to provide optimal clinical outcomes. In that context, it is proposed to relocate not only the NMH, but also University Maternity Hospital Limerick to University Hospital Limerick, Dooradoyle, the Rotunda Hospital to the Connolly Hospital campus in Blanchardstown and the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital, to St James's Hospital. More broadly, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has established an independent review group to examine the role of voluntary organisations in the operation of health and personal social services in Ireland. The terms of reference provide for: </p>  <p>  - An examination of current arrangements across the health and social care sector; </p>  <p>  - Consideration of issues currently arising, and those likely to arise in the future;</p>  <p>  - Recommendations on how the relationship between the State and voluntary organisations should evolve in the future.</p></reply>

A key building block in this vision will be the 96 community healthcare networks and 433 Primary Care Teams that are already working across the country and delivering a wide range of health services to people in their local communities. </p>  <p>  In recent years, the HSE has made concerted efforts to move many social care services, including mental health and disability services, into the community.  Much progress has been made in developing services that are more integrated, less centralised and more focused on the patient.  I do however believe we can be more ambitious in terms of developing primary and community-based care.  The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy sets out a number of strategic actions and concrete sub-actions that I intend to progress over the coming months and years to bring care closer to home for the benefit of the patient.        </p>  <p>  The HSE has been working to progress and deepen the implementation of multidisciplinary team working.  To this end nine learning sites (one per CHO) are being put in place.  The experience gained through these learning sites will inform future decision making and proposals in relation to the best way forward. </p>  <p>  I am aware that concerns were expressed by nurse representatives in relation to the potential effect of multidisciplinary working arrangements on existing reporting structures.  In light of this, and in order to facilitate progress with the learning sites, it has been agreed that, for the present, reporting relationships for nursing staff will remain unchanged within the new structures.</p>  <p>  I recognise that today many professionals working in front line services already work collaboratively.  It is important that this collaborative working arrangement continues and indeed develops regardless of reporting structure.</p></reply>

That scheme was being run independently by the manufacturer without reference to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The company notified the HSE that it had decided to terminate the access scheme from 30 September 2017.  Following interventions by the HSE, the company modified its decision and agreed to continue to supply the medication free of charge for the patients on the access scheme.  Due to the critical and exceptional circumstances, the HSE agreed to fund the provision of the necessary nursing service to ensure that patients could continue to receive the medicine</p>  <p>  The HSE is continuing to liaise with the treating Consultant and the company and has drafted the terms of an agreement for the long term care  of the 19 alpha one clinical trial patients.  This proposal is being reviewed by CSL Behring and it is hoped that a final agreement can be reached shortly. </p>  <p>  In so far as the provision of Respreeza to other patients is concerned, it is open to the company to submit a new reimbursement application which will be assessed by the HSE in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.

A major reconfiguration of therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, is underway as part of the HSE's National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People.</p>  <p>  HSE Disability Services in Dublin North City and County are working proactively with the HSE's National Disability Office to address waiting times.  However, there are a number of factors driving the demand for services, including an increase in the population of children overall and an increase in the number of children presenting with complex needs.  </p>  <p>  Addressing and improving services for children and adults with a disability remains a priority of the Government and for the Health Service Executive.  I am pleased to inform the House that Dublin North City and County Disability Service has recently received approval of an increased allocation of resources which will provide five posts across a number of disciplines including: Psychology, Occupational Therapy, Speech and Language Therapy, Physiotherapy and Social Work.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has commenced the recruitment process for these posts which will assist in the reduction of waiting times for early intervention services across the area. </p>  <p>  In addition, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to children with disabilities, funding for an additional 100 therapy posts was secured as part of Budget 2019. This investment will have a significant positive impact on waiting times for assessment and therapy service delivery over the course of the next year.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-10-23a.21.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102300064#WRA01900"><p>The National Dementia Strategy was launched in December 2014 to meet the challenges faced by people living with dementia in Ireland and to provide services to meet growing demand in future years. The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year. The Strategy emphasises the need for a "whole community response" to dementia, as the majority of people with dementia live in their own communities and wish to avail of services in their local area.</p>  <p>  To support future development of services and supports for people with dementia, the National Dementia Office and the Alzheimer Society of Ireland undertook a joint project in 2016 and 2017 to map dementia-specific community-based services across the country. Information from the project is included in an on-line service finder on the Understand Together website so people can find out what services are available in each county.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites. An evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service was published on 26 September. It recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide. </p>  <p>  In addition to these community supports, in 2014 the HSE introduced Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages to test the feasibility of providing a high level of support to people with dementia with complex needs to facilitate them to remain living at home. These were initially co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies and now fully funded by the HSE, which has committed to continue to provide approximately 120 packages at any one time. In addition to the IHCPs, people with dementia are also able to avail of standard home care services on the basis of need and within the resources available.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has secured &euro;6.26 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund for numerous projects to improve care and supports for people with dementia. Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports; a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a national dementia registry; the national rollout of a dementia training programme for HSE homecare staff; the development of dementia resource centres; funding for a dementia community activation coordinator; and community support projects for people with dementia. </p>  <p>  In July and September, I met with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland to discuss dementia issues. I have also met Senator Colette Kelleher, a former CEO and advocate of the ASI, to specifically discuss the needs of people with dementia. I am very aware of the need to address issues surrounding dementia, and am committed to maintaining the constructive relationships the Department has with advocacy groups as we continue to work towards the greater provision of services and care to people with dementia, their carers and families in the HSE's National Service Plan for 2019. </p>  <p>  In terms of plans to expand support levels for people with dementia, the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the HSE's 2019 National Service Planning.</p></reply>

In addition, specific investments to improve paediatric services have been made including the establishment of the Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital in 2019 and the development of sustainable and safe paediatric orthopaedic service, including scoliosis,  for children and young people</p>  <p>  To date in 2018, the NTPF has approved almost 12,700 additional first-time outpatient appointments and this is projected to increase to 40,000 appointments next year. I recently met with the CEO&rsquo;s of all hospital groups to discuss improving access for patients and requested that they work with the NTPF and HSE in 2019 develop innovative proposals to address the number of long waiters on outpatient lists in 2019. </p>  <p>  This year, the NTPF has approved 504 Outpatient appointments for Temple Street as part of an initiative to support implementation of an extended working day in the hospital. The NTPF is also due to meet with the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group (CHG) this month to review proposals for additional insourcing and outsourcing initiatives in cardiology, ENT, and other specialties.</p>  <p>  In addition, the CHG advises that it has implemented a number of new and innovative initiatives to improve access to outpatient appointments for patients across a range of specialties including cardiology, dermatology, and orthopaedics. This includes:</p>  <p>  - additional clinics in ENT and dermatology;</p>  <p>  - the appointment of additional staff in general paediatrics, ophthalmology and orthopaedics; and</p>  <p>  - the use of virtual assessment clinics for rheumatology.</p>  <p>  The Outpatient and Urgent Care Centre at Connolly Hospital in 2019 the will result in 6,350 outpatient appointments being issued for the new facility next year, with projected full year outpatient attendance of 15,240 in subsequent years. </p>  <p>  The additional &euro;9 million provided to the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group (CHG) in 2018, to support the development and implementation of a sustainable and safe paediatric orthopaedic service for children and young people, has also led to the improvement in waiting times for outpatient appointments for children.</p></reply>

This will enable the HSE to reduce the waiting list for Assessment of Need under the Disability Act and to drive implementation of the <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme </i>through new staff appointments to reconfigured multi-disciplinary, geographic-based teams. </p><p>The HSE is now in the process of developing its National Service Plan in accordance with the relevant legislative provisions and funding allocation. As planning for service provision for 2019 is currently underway it is not possible to provide detailed information on how the allocated funding will be spent in 2019. Decisions have yet to be made with regard to the types of therapy posts that will be created, the areas to which they will be allocated, and the time-frame for the recruitment of the additional posts. </p><p>However, as soon as these decisions are finalised, the HSE and agencies funded through Section 38 and Section 39 of the Health Act will make every effort to recruit these clinicians as quickly as possible, within the budget allocation provided. The additional funding for 100 therapy posts for children&rsquo;s disability services will have a significant positive impact on waiting times for assessment and services over the course of the next year.  </p></reply>

Patients in this age group are the highest users of most health and social care services, have more complex needs and longer stays in our Acute Hospitals.    </p>  <p>  I recognise that hospitals are increasingly operating at or above capacity, with year-round demand pressures that are further challenged over the winter months. However, the National Service Plan 2018 includes an expected activity target that 100% of patients aged 75 and over are discharged or admitted within 24 hours of registration.  Therefore, any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.  </p>  <p>  Ireland East Hospital Group, which includes St Vincent's Hospital, advise that the hospital did not meet the target because of an increased demand and activity for unscheduled care this year.   Between January and August 2018, the total attendances in St Vincent's Hospital ED increased by 7.4%, while admissions rose by 13%, as compared with the same period in 2017.   For those over 75, attendances increased by 10.8% and admissions by 18.6% to the end of August 2018.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Health, I am committed to maintaining the focus on addressing overcrowding in our hospital emergency departments.  My Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure that local and regional winter plans at hospital group and community health care organisation level are consolidated and supported through policies and plans at national level to ensure the most effective response to the winter challenges to unscheduled care provision. </p>  <p>  In addition, as part of Budget 2019, &euro;10m in funding has been allocated in 2018, to enable hospitals to de-escalate before the end of the year, with a focus on  supporting patients in the over 75 age group.</p></reply>

The Strategy contains specific commitments in relation to improving governance and accountability across the health service. </p>  <p>  One of the key actions outlined in the Strategy is to establish an independent Board for the HSE and to reconfigure the HSE to improve accountability and support integrated care.  Legislation to establish a Board for the HSE is currently before the Oireachtas. I intend to establish the Board once the legislation has been passed.  I have already announced Mr Ciar&aacute;n Devane as Chair designate of the Board. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the task of identifying the optimal set of health structures including national and regional bodies, and the most appropriate governance, accountability and performance framework for the future health system will be an important stream of work under the Sl&aacute;intecare programme of reforms. As set out in the Implementation Strategy, I am committed to the development of a new system of health structures comprising a leaner national centre with responsibility for national planning, strategy and standard setting, complemented by regional integrated care organisations with responsibility for the planning and delivery of services at a regional level. </p>  <p>  As a first step, my Department has undertaken a public consultation regarding the geographical alignment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations. The submissions to the consultation are currently being analysed by my Department and I hope to publish the report of the analysis shortly.

The report proposed that this funding be used to provide ehealth infrastructure,  develop primary care infrastructure including primary care centres and community diagnostics, expand training places, provide for system change and to renovate and increase hospital capacity.</p><p>The report suggested that &euro;500 million per annum for the next 6 years will be required for this.</p><p>The National Development Plan (NDP), published earlier this year as part of Project Ireland 2040 provides &euro;10.9 billion to invest in infrastructure, equipment and additional service capacity for the public health sector over the next 10 years. This represents an increase of 165% in capital funding over the previous decade. This capital provision will address all of the capital components of the proposals in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report, albeit, over a ten year period as opposed to six years as recommended in the report.</p><p>The funding provided for in the NDP will deliver:</p><p>- 2,600 additional  acute hospital beds, including elective-only hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway;</p><p>- 4,500 additional long and short-term community beds;</p><p>- A modern ehealth and ICT infrastructure;</p><p>- Additional Primary Care facilities with greater access to diagnostics; and</p><p>- Additional facilities for mental health services and for people with disabilities</p><p>The NDP provides for an unprecedented capital investment in the health service and represents one of the largest building programmes in its history. This won't be delivered overnight. It is essential that new capacity and facilities are properly planned and designed. This process will be undertaken under the auspices of the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office in line with the specific actions outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p><p>In addition to this I am delighted that I have secured over &euro;200m in budget 2019 which will directly support a range of additional services including initiatives proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report and committed to in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy including: </p><p>- Ringfenced funding for the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office;</p><p>- &euro;20m for the establishment of a new ring-fenced Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund to drive improvements in the way we deliver care across the system;</p><p>- Funding for a new GP contract which is critical to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision of delivering more care in the community;</p><p>- Expansion of free GP care, by increasing the weekly income threshold for GP Visit card by &euro;25 which could benefit up to 100,000 people. This supports the Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation to move towards universal GP care over 5 years;</p><p>- Additional funding for 100 new therapy posts to address assessment of need waiting lists for children with disabilities and funding to ensure that the needs of all those leaving school in 2019 will be addressed;</p><p>- &euro;55m in new development funding aimed at further enhancing community mental health teams for adults and children;</p><p>- Reducing user charges and out of pocket payments by further reductions in prescription charges - 50 cent reduction in prescription charges from &euro;2.00 to &euro;1.50 for all medical card holders over the age of 70. This is in line with a Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation to reduce prescription charges;</p><p>- A &euro;10 reduction in the monthly Drugs Payment Scheme threshold from &euro;134 to &euro;124 which is also in line with a key Sl&aacute;intecare recommendation; </p><p>- Increased investment of &euro;20m in the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  &euro;75m will be available to the NDPF IN 2019 which will be used to treat 70,000 patients on waiting lists in 2019; and</p><p>- Additional funding for  care redesign and the National Children's Hospital.</p><p>Funding has also been provided to expand existing health services, in line with Sl&aacute;intecare recommendations and full details of this will be contained in the National Service Plan to be published in December. </p></reply>

The Government's objective is to continue to achieve annual increases in the number of training places available while ensuring that all of the places are filled.</p>  <p>  Entry provisions to the GMS scheme have been changed to accommodate more flexible GMS contracts and the retirement age for GPs has been extended to 72. An enhanced support package for rural practices has been introduced with improved qualifying criteria and an increased financial allowance of &euro;20,000 per annum. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and the HSE recently re-engaged with the Irish Medical Organisation to set out the State's position in relation to reform of the GMS contract.

I recently met with the CEO&rsquo;s of all hospital groups to discuss improving access for patients and requested that they work with the NTPF and HSE in 2019 develop innovative proposals to address the number of long waiters on outpatient lists in 2019. </p>  <p>  Outpatient waiting list figures for the end of September for Midlands Regional Hospital Tullamore show that there were more than 14,282 patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment, of which 74% are waiting less than 18 months. </p>  <p>  More broadly, Dublin Midlands Hospital Group is working to introduce complete 'episode of care' clinics, as well as evaluating options for outsourcing appropriate specialties to reduce outpatient waiting lists. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Waiting List Validation function, which was established in the NTPF last month, will deliver a standardised approach to validation across all hospitals in line with best patient-centred practices. This new function will have many benefits including the identification of patients on waiting lists who are ready and available to proceed with hospital care, the reduction in the Did Not Attend rate (DNA), and an improvement in information for managing waiting lists. The NTPF estimates that 30,000 patients who no longer require treatment will come off the outpatient waiting list in 2019 as a result of this activity.</p></reply>

This year has seen ongoing improvements with the number of patients waiting for inpatient and daycase procedures (IPDC), now at 72,700 from the peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a 16% reduction in the overall number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2019 the Government has further increased investment in this area, with funding to the NTPF to increase from &euro;55m in 2018 to &euro;75m in 2019. In 2019, the NTPF plans to deliver 25,000 Inpatient Day Case treatments, building on the 20,000 procedures delivered in 2018. In addition, 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes will be carried out, bringing to 9,000 the additional scope activity provided by the NTPF since the start of 2018. Furthermore, 40,000 Outpatient appointments will be arranged as part of 2019 activity. It is expected that a further 34,000 patients who no longer need treatment will be removed from the waiting lists by the NTPF Central Validation Unit.</p>  <p>  As a result, the NTPF projects by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the IPDC waiting list from just over 86,000 in July 2017, to 70,000 at the end of 2018 and to under 59,000 by the end of 2019. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise the 2019 Waiting List Initiatives before the end of this year. This will include the continuing engagement of the NTPF with the HSE and public hospitals, inviting proposals for waiting list initiatives either through the private sector or through public sector insourcing. The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the recent Budget provided an increase of &euro;1.05 billion in Health funding. This brings the health budget for 2019 to &euro;17 billion. This is the highest level of Health investment in the history of the State. This will allow the health service to meet additional demands caused by the demographic pressure of a growing and ageing population. The additional funding provided as part of Budget 2019 will directly support a range of additional services including initiatives proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report and committed to in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy. Sl&aacute;intecare will focus on meeting the demand for health care that our population currently has, and which will continue to grow in future years. </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive is currently in the process of finalising its National Service Plan for 2019, in consultation with officials from my Department. This will inform the activity to be provided by the HSE next year as well as informing the number of new staffing positions that will need to be created in 2019.  </p></reply>

The 50 organisations included were agreed at the WRC by all parties.  I asked the HSE to engage with the Section 39 organisations to establish the facts around what cuts were applied and how and when they were implemented. The HSE has completed the first phase of their work in relation to the agencies identified as part of the WRC process.  This exercise has shown that of the agencies who returned data, a majority did apply pay reductions of some form.  It also showed that some agencies made some form of pay restoration between 2016 and 2018. Following constructive engagement with the assistance of the Workplace Relations Commission, an agreement was reached on 2 October between the parties.  Pay restoration will commence with an annual pay increase of up to &euro;1,000 in April 2019 for those employed by the 50 organisations involved in the pilot.

Assessment and interventions need to be tailored to the individual. There are assessments/tests which can be carried out in primary care settings by a General Practitioner. Specialised tests may be required when considering differential diagnoses. </p>  <p>  Treatment for ME is tailored to address the varying symptoms presented by those affected by ME. In general, these treatments are delivered within the context of primary care, with referrals into secondary care for specialist interventions in the areas of Neurology, Rheumatology, Pain Specialists, Endocrinology, Immunology, Cardiology, etc. The challenge in relation to ME is that it does not sit within one specialty, but crosses a number of specialties, with patients attending different Consultants for management of symptoms as they arise. </p>  <p>  Waiting times for access to these services can be lengthy. However, there is currently work under way as part of the implementation of the Strategy for the Design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020, specifically as regards addressing how and where the patient is treated and the classification of referrals with corresponding clinically recommended time-frames. Consideration is also being given to condition specific referral forms. This work should see significant improvements with respect to access to appropriate services. </p></reply>

Containing 42 actions across four national goals, it sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Government departments and agencies to carers. I am pleased to say that significant progress has been made on a large number of actions, and the Department of Health is determined to offer as much support as possible to family carers throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Following the enactment of the necessary legislation, free GP care has been extended to those in receipt of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance or Carer&rsquo;s Benefit since 1 September this year. Furthermore, in December 2017, the Government announced the provision of an additional &euro;10 million specifically to enhance respite care in the disability sector, which has had a positive impact to date. &euro;8 million of this provides for the equivalent of 12 new houses, one in each CHO, with an additional three in the Greater Dublin area. The remaining &euro;2 million is for innovative respite solutions, such as Home Sharing and extended day services, to provide assistance where people need it most.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health has also secured funding through the Dormant Accounts fund to enable the HSE to pilot a Carer's Needs Assessment in one Community Healthcare Organisation. The HSE developed this tool with significant input from the Family Carer Reference Group, which represents a national network of over 200 carer groups across Ireland. The assessment will assist in identifying the needs of carers across all care groups and will track health and wellbeing outcomes for carers over time.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE are committed to ensuring that family carers receive as much support as possible to allow them to continue caring for their loved ones. Both the Department and the HSE will continue to engage with family carer organisations to address the needs of carers. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to prepare the 2019 National Service Plan. Pending agreement of the National Service Plan, I am not in a position to comment either on the funding that will be made available for carers or the specific services that will be provided.</p></reply>

The 221 figure is the number of women within the 1,482 for whom the clinical audit conducted by CervicalCheck showed a differing cytology recommendation to their original test. I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the number of women among the 221 who come from Co. Louth.</p>  <p>  In light of the particular sensitivities surrounding this issue it was decided that written, informed consent will be sought from women or the next-of-kin of women who have passed away, before they are included in the review which will be carried out by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. This consent process is nearing completion. To date, 1,591 letters have issued to individuals requesting consent to participate in RCOG Review. Consent forms have been returned by 813 individuals (51%), of whom 786 have consented to participate. Within this group, 65 women are among the 221 affected women and families. </p>  <p>  In regard to laboratories, it can be noted that each of the laboratories which provides services for CervicalCheck serves a discrete population of women. Individual GP practices, clinics and colposcopy services are assigned to one designated programme laboratory. The samples of all tests taken in those locations are processed in the assigned laboratory. As has previously been stated, it can be assumed that false negatives have arisen in all contracted laboratories due to the limitations of screening and the fact that false negatives are inherent in screening. However, variations arise in relation to the socioeconomic status of populations assigned to each lab, urban-rural breakdown, overall volume of tests performed by the lab, the percentage of tests which are received from colposcopy clinics (this would result in the lab receiving a disproportionate number of high grade lesions) and other factors. </p></reply>

Patients in this age group are the highest users of most health and social care services, have more complex needs and longer stays in our Acute Hospitals.    </p>  <p>  I recognise that hospitals are increasingly operating at or above capacity, with year-round demand pressures that are further challenged over the winter months. However, the National Service Plan 2018 includes an expected activity target that 100% of patients aged 75 and over are discharged or admitted within 24 hours of registration. Therefore, any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.  </p>  <p>  I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the specific query raised by the Deputy in relation to hospitals in County Cork. </p></reply>

Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome, bringing together the detailed work being undertaken by individual Ministers and their Departments on issues within their policy remit, was identified as an early priority and is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.   This work has provided baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations. This is enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a withdrawal agreement, including a transitional arrangement, is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK.   My Department and its agencies have been conducting detailed analysis on the impacts of Brexit in the area of health. A number of issues are being examined and contingency planning for a range of eventualities is underway. A key issue will be to ensure that there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis. This analysis will inform resource requirements and ensure that the response to Brexit is adaptable to what is a changing process. </p></reply>

Agreement on the delivery of service improvements and contractual reform has the potential to facilitate a substantial increase in the resourcing of general practice on a multiannual basis. </p>  <p>   Under the General Medical Services (GMS) contract, GPs are reimbursed for a range of services they provide to medical card and GP visit card holders. GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service. GPs are also remunerated for services they provide on behalf of the HSE under other public health schemes, such as the Maternity and Infant Care Scheme, Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme, etc. </p>  <p>  Despite reductions to the payment rates of health contractors made under FEMPI legislation, the total fees paid to GPs under the GMS scheme have increased from just over &euro;472 million in 2009 to approximately &euro;525 million in 2017. This increase in fees is largely due to significant developments and investment in GP services introduced in recent years, with more services being made available to our citizens and additional financial support provided by the HSE.</p>  <p>   The Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 now allows the setting and varying of contractor payments on a non-emergency statutory basis. It is my intention to put in place a new multiannual approach to fees in return for service improvements and contractual reforms based upon health policy considerations and engagement with representative bodies.</p></reply>

This year has seen ongoing improvements with the number of patients waiting for inpatient and day case procedures (IPDC) now at 72,700 from the peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a 16% reduction in the overall number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure.</p><p>In Budget 2019 the Government has further increased investment in this area, with funding to the NTPF to increase from &euro;55m in 2018 to &euro;75m in 2019. </p><p>My Department is working closely with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund to finalise the 2019 Waiting List Initiatives before the end of this year. The Plan will outline the combined impact of HSE and NTPF activity in 2019 to reduce the number of patients waiting for treatment. </p><p>The NTPF activity will cover approximately 50 high to medium volume procedures. The NTPF will also take a targeted approach in 2019 and further procedures will be tendered for, depending on waiting list times and suitability of patients for treatment at outsourced facilities.</p><p>While the NTPF will provide many of the procedures through outsourcing, it will build on the progress made in 2018 and the engagements with individual Hospitals to further support public system initiatives through HSE insourcing. NTPF authorisations are made in respect of the longest waiting patients first.</p><p>IPDC Waiters for Urology Testing by Group by TimeBand as at 18/10/2018</p><p>Average Wait Time: 144 Days<table><tr><th>Sum of Total</th><th>Column Labels</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Row Labels</td><td>0-3 Months</td><td>3-6 Months</td><td>6-9 Months</td><td>9-12 Months</td><td>12-15 Months</td><td>15-18 Months</td><td>18+ Months</td><td>Grand Total</td></tr><tr><td>Children's Hospital Group</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin Midlands Hospital Group</td><td>96</td><td>61</td><td>41</td><td>50</td><td>35</td><td>32</td><td>29</td><td>344</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland East Hospital Group</td><td>442</td><td>176</td><td>138</td><td>29</td><td>19</td><td>15</td><td>17</td><td>836</td></tr><tr><td>RCSI  Hospitals Group</td><td>507</td><td>234</td><td>72</td><td>43</td><td>19</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>877</td></tr><tr><td>Saolta University Health Care Group</td><td>406</td><td>253</td><td>88</td><td>54</td><td>22</td><td>21</td><td>29</td><td>873</td></tr><tr><td>South/South West Hospital Group</td><td>443</td><td>245</td><td>161</td><td>54</td><td>26</td><td>9</td><td>48</td><td>986</td></tr><tr><td>University of Limerick Hospital Group</td><td>448</td><td>405</td><td>284</td><td>46</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>1196</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>2346</td><td>1379</td><td>786</td><td>283</td><td>129</td><td>84</td><td>133</td><td>5140</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Government has accepted all 50 recommendations set out in the Report.</p>  <p>  These recommendations address issues identified through Dr Scally's extensive programme of work.  I am committed to returning to Government within three months, as recommended by Dr Scally, with a full plan for the implementation of these recommendations. Development of this plan is underway, overseen by the CervicalCheck Steering Committee, which I established in June.</p>  <p>  My first priorities for implementation include establishment of a National Screening Committee by early 2019, the establishment of an Independent Patient Safety Council, and the recruitment of a new leadership team for the Screening Service. Funding to implement recommendations of Dr Scally&rsquo;s inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme has been allocated in Budget 2019. </p>  <p>  Last week, I met with Dr Scally and I have asked him to provide the independent review of the implementation plan recommended in his report which I am pleased to say he has agreed to do. Dr Scally has also undertaken to do some further work in relation to the laboratories. </p>  <p>  Dr Scally presented two reports containing his first findings to me in early June. These were published following the Government meeting on Tuesday, the 12th of June. I accepted all six recommendation from these reports and implementation of these is well underway; in his final report, Dr Scally has stated that he is impressed by how my Department is carrying forward these recommendations.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding recruitment and retention challenges, the number of consultants employed in the public health service has increased by 118 in the 12 months to end August 2018 and by 479 in the past five years to 3,032 (whole time equivalents).</p>  <p>  The Public Sector Pay Commission in its Report published on 4 September 2018 identified difficulties in attracting consultant applications for advertised posts at present and acknowledged that the pay rates for new entrants had been highlighted as a factor in this. The Commission also recognised that the implementation of the settlement of the 2008 Consultant Contract claim, while necessary of itself, would serve to highlight further the differential in pay between the pre-existing cadre of consultants and new entrants. The Commission stated that policy responses that may be proposed for new entrants across the public services generally may not address the degree of pay differential which currently applies to new entrant consultants.  Notwithstanding this, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has since published pay proposals regarding new entrants across the public service, including consultants under Section 4 of the Public Service Stability Agreement. </p>  <p>  Given its analysis, the Pay Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential between pre-existing consultants and new entrant consultants. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department have noted the Commission's views and consideration will need to be given to potential solutions which are in line with public sector pay policy and available budgets. This will be a significant challenge given the amounts involved.</p></reply>

I recently met with the CEO&rsquo;s of all hospital groups to discuss improving access for patients and requested that they work with the NTPF and HSE in 2019 to develop innovative proposals to address the number of long waiters on outpatient lists in 2019. </p>  <p>  Outpatient waiting list figures for the end of September show that there were just over 6,000 patients waiting for a first appointment in Navan Hospital and of these, over 72% are waiting 12 months or less.</p>  <p>  More broadly, Ireland East Hospital Group (IEHG) has engaged in a number of initiatives to address long waiting lists throughout the wider hospital group. IEHG advises that at present 73% of all patients are offered an outpatient appointment within one year of referral.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Waiting List Validation function, which was established in the NTPF last month, will deliver a standardised approach to validation across all hospitals in line with best patient-centred practices. This new function will have many benefits including the identification of patients on waiting lists who are ready and available to proceed with hospital care, the reduction in the Did Not Attend rate (DNA), and an improvement in information for managing waiting lists. The NTPF estimates that 30,000 patients who no longer require treatment will come off the outpatient waiting list in 2019 as a result of this activity. </p></reply>

Full establishment is dependent on the commercial operators making these products available in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Whilst medical cannabis products are not medicines, ensuring that such products meet appropriate quality standards when they are made available to the Irish market is a critical aspect of facilitating safe access to medical cannabis for Irish-based patients. Department of Health officials are working intensively on this issue to ensure a supply of appropriate medical cannabis products from other EU Member States and further afield to meet the needs of Irish patients. However, the Department of Health has no control in relation to business decisions taken by commercial product manufacturers and has no powers to compel such companies to supply their products to Irish market. </p>  <p>  Until these products are made available in Ireland it remains a matter for the prescriber, who has successfully applied for a Ministerial Licence under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2016, and their patient, to source the prescribed medical cannabis-based product. It is understood that patients who have been prescribed such products under Ministerial Licence have sourced them from a pharmacy in the Netherlands.</p></reply>

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. </p>  <p>   Testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland in all major hospitals.  Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard laboratory approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and has been agreed by experts from the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and other Irish and international experts.  </p>  <p>   Laboratories in Ireland generally follow the laboratory testing recommendations of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Infectious Disease Society of America, the European Federation of Neurological Societies, and the British Infection Association.  Irish laboratories have their own quality assurance methods to make sure the tests are working correctly as well as being accredited by the Irish National Accreditation Body to perform the test correctly.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory.  This laboratory uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities which involves a screening test followed by a confirmatory test. </p></reply>

I recently met with the CEOs of all hospital groups to discuss improving access for patients and requested that they work with the NTPF and HSE in 2019 to develop innovative proposals to address the number of long waiters on outpatient lists in 2019. </p>  <p>  Outpatient waiting list figures for the end of September for University Hospital Limerick show that there were more than 29,000 patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment, of which 69% are waiting less than 12 months. </p>  <p>  More broadly, the HSE advises that the University of Limerick Hospital Group is working to provide a range of insourced outpatient clinics across a wide range of specialties including dermatology, endocrinology, gynaecology, ENT, and many more. These clinics will actively work to reduce the longest waiting patients across those specialties with the largest waiting lists.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Waiting List Validation function, which was established in the NTPF last month, will deliver a standardised approach to validation across all hospitals in line with best patient-centred practices. This new function will have many benefits including the identification of patients on waiting lists who are ready and available to proceed with hospital care, the reduction in the Did Not Attend rate (DNA), and an improvement in information for managing waiting lists. The NTPF estimates that 30,000 patients who no longer require treatment will come off the outpatient waiting list in 2019 as a result of this activity.</p></reply>

The Strategy aims to improve dementia care to allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible and to deliver improved services and supports. The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia and progress to date, as well as future plans, is recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year. Plans are progressing to further implement the Dementia Strategy through the National Dementia Office, including in the area of diagnosis, post-diagnostic supports and care pathways.</p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area. </p>  <p>  There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health secured &euro;6.26 million through the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia. Projects receiving funding include the delivery of post-diagnostic supports; a dementia diagnostic service for people with intellectual disability; a national network of memory technology resource rooms; the development of a national dementia registry; the national rollout of a Dementia Training Programme for HSE homecare staff; the development of Dementia Resource Centres; funding for a dementia community activation coordinator; an evaluation of services for people with early onset dementia; and community support projects for people with dementia.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to prepare the 2019 National Service Plan. Pending agreement of the National Service Plan, I am not in a position to comment either on the funding that will be made available for dementia care or the specific services that will be provided.</p></reply>

In Budget 2019 we have further increased investment in this area, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund to increase from &euro;55 m in 2018 to &euro;75 m in 2019, an overall increase of 150 % since this government came into office.  </p>  <p>  In 2019, the NTPF plans to deliver 25,000 Inpatient Day Case treatments, an increase of 5,000 from the 20,000 procedures committed to in the Waiting List Action Plan 2018. Furthermore, 40,000 first outpatient appointments will be arranged as part of the 2019 activity.</p>  <p>  NTPF activity next year will cover approximately 50 high to medium volume procedures and will be through a combination of treating patients in outsourced facilities and supporting the public system initiatives.  In addition, the NTPF will take a targeted approach in 2019 for procedures not included in the high to medium volume bracket. </p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise a coherent Waiting List Action Plan for 2019 before the end of the year. The priority of my Department is to maintain a seamless continuation of the considerable progress made this year into next year.  This will include the continuing engagement of the NTPF with the HSE and public hospitals, inviting proposals for waiting list initiatives either through the private sector or through public sector insourcing. The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate.   </p>  <p>  In terms of treatment offers, the NTPF authorises public hospitals to offer outsourced treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. NTPF authorisations are made in respect of the longest waiting patients first.</p></reply>

I note in particular the call for the restoration of pay. </p>  <p>  Similar to other areas of the public service, the pay of Permanent Defence Force personnel was reduced as one of the measures necessary to stabilise national finances during the financial crisis. </p>  <p>  The economic recovery and a resumption of economic growth has provided the fiscal resources to provide for a sustainable and fair recovery in public service payscales. </p>  <p>  Defence Forces pay and that of other public servants is increasing in accordance with public sector pay agreements. The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations balloted their members, who voted to accept the terms of these pay agreements. </p>  <p>  Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement. In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were implemented. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The first increase due under this agreement from 1 January 2018 has been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel and a second increase has been applied from 1 October 2018. Further increases in pay under this agreement are scheduled for 2019 and 2020. </p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement the pay of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre Financial Emergency in the Public Interest (FEMPI) levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement. </p>  <p>  The recently announced proposal by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and reform in respect of new entrant payscales will also benefit those who joined the Defence Forces since January 2011. </p>  <p>  Measures such as the implementation of the Working Time Directive for members of the Permanent Defence Force and a review of contracts for enlisted personnel are under active consideration. The Department of Defence is engaging with the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations on these matters through the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme.</p></reply>

As such, officials from my Department and I hold regular meetings with recognised Veterans&rsquo; Associations at which issues of concern to their members are discussed. </p>  <p>  My Department has Service Level Agreements with the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel (O.N.E.) and the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA) which set out the services the Department provides to these Associations.  Under the terms of these SLAs my Department provides financial support by way of an annual subvention to O.N.E. and IUNVA to encourage their valuable efforts and the range of services they offer to ex-service personnel.  In further recognition of this work, last week I announced that I was increasing my Department&rsquo;s annual grant to O.N.E. from &euro;44,000 to &euro;100,000.  This significant increase in the grant will make a substantial contribution to the work of O.N.E.</p>  <p>  I was honoured to recently officially open a new Veteran Support Centre located in Custume Barracks Athlone I am strongly supportive of O.N.E.&rsquo;s plans to establish further Veteran Support Centres around the country.  Fitting out new Centres with equipment, training volunteers and the increased administration and insurance liability will increase O.N.E.&rsquo;s overheads.  The increase in the grant will defray some of these costs and allow O.N.E. to press ahead and bring to fruition their plans for a network of Veteran Support Centres nationwide. </p>  <p>  I am also supportive of the annual Veterans&rsquo; Day and the launch of O.N.E.&rsquo;s annual Fuchsia fundraising appeal and I am committed to continued engagement with Veterans&rsquo; Associations into the future.</p></reply>

Shortages of medicine alone are putting at risk the lives of 3m people with chronic diseases, and the growing number of malaria cases, expected to reach 2m by the end of the year, will make it the highest incidence of malaria anywhere in the world. </p>  <p>  Ireland believes that the government of Venezuela must acknowledge the humanitarian crisis and allow humanitarian actors to operate without interference. I urge the Venezuelan government to allow the entry of humanitarian assistance into the country. Last month, Ireland co-sponsored the resolution on Venezuela adopted at the 39th session of the Human Rights Council on this subject.</p>  <p>  The crisis has caused one of the biggest population displacements in the world, and Ireland believes that countries hosting Venezuelan migrants must be supported. </p>  <p>  Ireland has supported the deployment of a Rapid Responder to assist UNHCR in supporting the Colombian Government&rsquo;s efforts to enhance its asylum system and respond to the humanitarian and protection needs of Venezuelans in Colombia, as well as fully supporting the &euro;35 million EU humanitarian package announced in August.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the recent appointment of Mr. Eduardo Stein as UNHCR and IOM Joint Special Representative for Venezuelan refugees and migrants in the region, to ensure a coordinated approach to dealing with the crisis.</p>  <p>  The situation in Venezuela continues to be raised at the highest levels within the EU and was discussed by Foreign Ministers at our meeting on Monday 15 October. I welcome the high priority given to the issue by the EU, and I believe that it is important for us to work in step with our like-minded regional partners.</p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned by the reports of human rights violations, and I condemn any attempt to infringe on the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. Ireland fully supports the EU sanctions introduced in June of this year.  These sanctions are aimed at materials that can be used by the Government for internal repression, and create a legal framework for a travel ban and asset freeze against those who have shown blatant disregard for the rule of law and disrespect for democratic principles, including a number of Government officials.</p>  <p>  I have repeatedly called for the Venezuelan government to engage in dialogue with the opposition, to respect the electoral calendar and to fully restore the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Mexico is responsible for our diplomatic relations with Venezuela and is monitoring the situation closely, engaging with partner organisations on the ground and with EU Missions in Caracas. Ireland will continue to engage regularly with our EU partners on this issue, as well as with affected countries in the region. I can assure the Deputy that Ireland is committed to seeking a peaceful and democratic solution to this crisis.</p></reply>

Then, as now, the Government continues to pursue two key objectives with regard to Irish immigration to the United States; firstly, increased pathways for legal migration by Irish citizens to the US; and secondly, seeking some form of relief for undocumented Irish citizens living in the US.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed the issue with President Trump in the Oval Office last March and also in his meetings on Capitol Hill during this year&rsquo;s St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit.  I have also prioritised this issue in my own engagements with the US Administration and Congress, and discussed it most recently with Congressman Richie Neal last week in Dublin.   </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Special Envoy to the United States Congress on the Undocumented, Deputy John Deasy, has also been active on the issue and has, since his appointment, travelled to Washington, D.C., on ten separate occasions for meetings with key contacts.</p>  <p>  In addition, our Embassy in Washington, D.C., continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the Administration and with a wide range of contacts on Capitol Hill. </p>  <p>  Through these many high-level contacts and discussions, the Government continues to explore a number of different options. This remains a very challenging issue, however.  Immigration reform has been a sensitive and divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with an issue which directly affects over 11 million people, from many different countries of origin.  </p>  <p>  On the welfare of the undocumented Irish, the Embassy, as well as our six Consulates across the United States, work closely with Irish Immigration Centers, which support the needs of Irish citizens in the United States, including those who are undocumented. These Centers all receive annual funding from the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme to support their important work. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that both the Taoiseach and I, together with our Government colleagues, Special Envoy Deputy Deasy, and our Embassy in Washington, D.C., will continue to give full priority to these issues.  </p></reply>

Since then, there have been ongoing exchanges between the Commission and the Polish authorities and two hearings have taken place at the General Affairs Council on 26 June and again on 18 September.</p>  <p>  On 24 September, the European Commission gave notice of its intention to initiate infringement procedures with regard to the law on the Polish Supreme Court. This is separate to the ongoing procedure under Article 7 (1). On Friday, 19 October, the European Court of Justice, in the context of interim proceedings before final judgment on the substance of the case is made, ordered that Poland adopt a number of measures that would have the effect of suspending the application of the provisions of this legislation.</p>  <p>  At the most recent General Affairs Council meeting on 16 October, as part of the Article 7(1) TEU procedure, the Commission provided the Council with an update on recent developments.  Ministers reiterated the importance of upholding the rule of law in all EU Member States and stressed the need to achieve tangible progress.</p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently stressed the importance of the rule of law, including at the hearings that have taken place to date at the General Affairs Council, and urged an early solution on this matter.</p>  <p>  On 12 September 2018, the European Parliament, under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, adopted a reasoned proposal to the Council, inviting the Council to determine whether there is a clear risk of a serious breach by Hungary of the values on which the European Union is founded.</p>  <p>  The President of the European Parliament formally communicated this proposal to the President of the Council of the European Union, the Austrian Chancellor Mr Sebastian Kurz, on 18 September.</p>  <p>  At the General Affairs Council on 16 October the Presidency informed Ministers about the next procedural steps following the triggering of the Article 7(1) TEU procedure for Hungary.  The Commission will provide the Council with an update on the relevant infringement procedures at its next meeting.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s concerns about issues relating to the rule of law and the importance it attaches to the values on which the European Union is founded are well known and stressed, as appropriate, in Council meetings and in bilateral engagements.</p></reply>

We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  Many minority religious and ethnic communities across the Middle East are vulnerable to violence by state and non-state actors, including terrorist attacks. Ireland has consistently called for inclusive, democratic solutions to the conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa region.</p><p>I participated in the Third International Conference on the victims of ethnic and religious violence in the Middle East, which took place in Brussels in May this year. The Conference brought together 67 countries and 13 international organisations, to find ways to further support the members of the communities targeted by Da&rsquo;esh and other extremist organisations for ethnic or religious reasons, particularly in Iraq and Syria.</p><p>I unreservedly condemn the brutal atrocities which terrorist groups, including Da&rsquo;esh, have inflicted in Iraq and Syria, including against religious minorities, notably the Yazidis. I am appalled by the suffering of the innocent people caught up in these events, especially women and girls who were targeted by sexual and gender-based violence. While the situation has improved, with a successful fight back against Da&rsquo;esh in Iraq and Syria, challenges remain in terms of healing the trauma these groups have endured, ensuring humanitarian aid reaches them, and ensuring displaced populations can return to their homelands once it is safe to do so.</p><p>In the Iraqi context, Ireland has always emphasised that the security effort must be accompanied by national reconciliation to ensure an inclusive state, allowing for political, economic and social opportunities for all. The January 2018 EU Foreign Affairs Council conclusions on Iraq reiterated the EU&rsquo;s firm and active commitment to the preservation of the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multi-confessional nature of Iraqi society, including the protection of its minority groups, building on the bond of a common national identity and inclusive citizenship.<b></b>The EU stands ready to support Iraqi and international efforts to hold members of Da'esh to account, and ensure accountability for human rights violations and abuses, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, as well as acts against persons belonging to minority groups.  Ireland fully supports these conclusions.</p><p>Since 2012, Ireland has provided just over &euro;9.5 million in humanitarian assistance to Iraq including &euro;2 million to the UN Iraq Humanitarian Fund (IHF) in 2018 alone. The IHF ensures funding is allocated to the best-placed organisations, and that these funds are targeted towards those in greatest need.</p><p>Ireland also contributes to the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response in Iraq which has provided over &euro;40 million this year. This funding goes to the most vulnerable people, for a range of services. This includes a grant in recent months of &euro;5 million towards emergency reproductive and mental health care for victims of violence.</p></reply>

The 2015 foreign policy review, <i>Global Island Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy for a changing world</i>, recognises that human rights violations undermine development.  <i>Global Island</i>commits the Department to promote and protect those who face persecution for defending human rights, with an explicit commitment to the promotion of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals.  This is a recognition that LGBTI people frequently suffer disproportionately from violence and, in many countries, face systemic discrimination.</p><p><i>Global Island</i>provides the overall foreign policy frame for the recent public consultation paper on international development, part of the process towards a new policy on international development. That public consultation paper reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to upholding human rights, within the foreign policy context provided by <i>Global Island</i>and Ireland&rsquo;s international development actions.</p><p>As part of the contextual analysis underpinning the new development policy, threats to civil society space and the role of human rights activists are identified, as is the importance of respect for human rights: this includes LGBTI community rights. The public consultation paper also highlights that our new international development policy will be informed by recent Irish experience in bringing greater equality for minorities in society.</p><p>The rights of all minorities, including those of the LGBTI community, and shrinking civil society space were raised at recent public meetings held to discuss the consultation paper, and in written submissions. These issues will be taken into consideration in the final drafting of the new policy which will aim to ensure coherence in our approach at international and country levels.</p></reply>

The Government fully endorses the legitimate aspiration to unity expressed in Article 3 of the Constitution, as amended by the people in 1998.</p>  <p>  The principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland are fundamental elements of the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island North and South.  The Agreement states clearly that &ldquo;it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively and without external impediment, to exercise their right to self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish, accepting that this right must be achieved and exercised with and subject to the agreement and consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, under the Agreement, the two Governments &ldquo;recognise the legitimacy of whatever choice is freely exercised by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland with regard to its status, whether they prefer to continue to support the Union with Britain or a sovereign united Ireland&rdquo;.  And should such a choice be made in the future, it will be a binding obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.</p>  <p>  The trigger for a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland.  This would occur when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland considers it likely that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland.</p>  <p>  At present, the Government does not believe it likely that such a border poll in the near future would result in a decision on the part of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland in favour of constitutional change.  In these circumstances, it is the Government&rsquo;s clear view that such a poll would only increase uncertainty and division at an already difficult and sensitive time.</p>  <p>  In the absence of the prospect of a referendum in the near future, the Government has no immediate plans for specific preparations on this issue.  My immediate priorities are to secure the functioning of the devolved power-sharing institutions and the North South Ministerial Council, which are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, and to ensure the protection of the Agreement in all its parts and the gains and benefits of the Peace Process, through the ongoing Article 50 negotiation between the European Union and the UK, which are at a critical point.</p>  <p>  In the event of a future referendum within the consent provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government would make all necessary preparations in accordance with the terms of the Constitution and the principles and procedures of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  There are of course aspects of this constitutional issue which relate to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work.  In the context of Brexit, the Government has made clear its determination to ensure respect for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including those provisions relating to a possible change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status within the EU.  As a result of intensive political and diplomatic engagement by the Government, we have secured the solidarity and support of all our EU partners on ensuring the protection of the Agreement in all its parts and of the gains and benefits of the Peace Process, through the process of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union.</p>  <p>  On 29 April 2017, the European Council adopted Guidelines for the EU-UK negotiations which included a strong acknowledgment of the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland and the importance of preserving the achievements, benefits, and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement.  These Guidelines remain the basis of the Union&rsquo;s approach to the negotiations with the UK, including on the Ireland-specific issues.  Also on 29 April last year, the European Council agreed a statement acknowledging that the Good Friday Agreement provides for an agreed mechanism whereby a united Ireland may be brought about and that, in accordance with international law, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would thus be part of the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Government has been very clear that we do not see the UK exit from the European Union as a pretext or an opportunity for the holding of a border poll in Northern Ireland, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></reply>

All were in agreement that an investigation into the case is<b></b>the priority now.  In the meantime, following confirmation that Mr Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul, High Representative Mogherini has issued a statement on behalf of the European Union insisting on the need for continued thorough, credible and transparent investigation, shedding proper clarity on the circumstances of the killing and ensuring full accountability of all those responsible for it.  I join her also in expressing our deepest condolences to Mr Khashoggi&rsquo;s family.</p><p>I met with the Saudi Ambassador on 18 October, stressed the widespread shock caused by the case and the necessity for a credible and open<b></b>investigation. He informed me that the King has ordered an investigation which is in the hands of the Public Prosecutor and conveyed assurances that the investigation will be competent, thorough and transparent and will hold those responsible to account.  The Saudi authorities intend to work with Turkey in their enquiries.  While there are clearly very serious questions to answer, we must allow the investigation to proceed now, and await its outcome.</p><p>Ireland is committed to promoting and protecting freedom of expression, freedom of the media, and civil society space. The right to freedom of expression, as enshrined in international human rights law, constitutes a basic building block for an open and free society.  A free and independent media is indispensable, and journalists, together with civil society, play a vital role in holding governments to account.  At the 39th session of the Human Rights Council in September 2018, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on &ldquo;Safety of Journalists&rdquo; which was adopted without the need for a vote.  This resolution condemned all attacks and violence against journalists and media workers and urged all states to ensure accountability for such attacks.</p><p>Ireland has consistently raised issues of human rights in Saudi Arabia, at bilateral, EU and international level. Ireland makes its position known through Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Riyadh, through the Saudi Embassy in Dublin, and in cooperation with the EU delegation in Riyadh and other EU Member States. We will continue to raise our concerns about human rights issues directly with the Saudi authorities, and at EU and international levels, whenever appropriate opportunities arise.</p></reply>

We discussed developments in the ongoing negotiations between the EU and UK on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p><p>We also had a constructive exchange on the issue of fundamental rights and EU citizens&rsquo; rights in Northern Ireland, following from what was agreed in the Joint report from the negotiators of the European Union and the United Kingdom Government<b></b>of 8 December 2017.</p><p>Mr Barnier later briefed EU27 Member States at the GAC Article 50, and EU leaders at the European Council Summit (Art. 50) on 17 October, on the negotiations.</p><p>Mr Barnier reported that, despite the intensive efforts of both sets of negotiators, it was not possible to make decisive progress ahead of the October European Council.  There remains substantial work to be done, in particular in relation to the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. However, he felt overall that a deal could be done in the coming weeks.</p><p>Regarding the backstop, Mr Barnier is well aware, and has been strongly supportive, of our position that a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland must be avoided under any circumstances. As the Taoiseach made clear at Council, <i>the backstop is about peace in Ireland</i>and the EU has a shared responsibility to protect this.  Mr Barnier has been flexible and imaginative in seeking to find ways to address and de-dramatise this issue, and Ireland strongly supports his approach.</p><p>A legally operable &lsquo;backstop&rsquo; which avoids a hard border, and protects the integrity of the single market, is essential for agreeing the Withdrawal Agreement, so as to provide the certainty that no matter what the outcome of the negotiations on the future relationship, there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland.  As agreed last March, it must be in place unless and until another solution is found.  This was clearly reaffirmed by all colleagues at the GAC, and subsequently at the European Council meeting on 17 October.</p><p>We are now in the end game of these negotiations, and time is short.  We need to engage intensively over the coming weeks to make sure that we can successfully complete negotiations and agree a deal.</p></reply>

I have asked my officials to further discuss this matter with Revenue with a view to improving the data quality in this area  <b>. </b></p><p>I extended the benefit-in-kind exemption for electric vehicles until 31 December 2021 to support policies to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. This forms part of a broader series of measures to support the uptake of electric vehicles, including VRT relief of up to &euro;5,000, an SEAI grant of up to &euro;5,000, very low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum, 50% discount off tolls fees and 0% BIK on electric charging.</p><p>Having regard to value for money and tax equity considerations, a cap of &euro;50,000 on this exemption is applied such that an electric vehicle with an original market value exceeding &euro;50,000 will be subject to BIK on the amount in excess of &euro;50,000. The cap will take effect from the 2019 tax year.</p><p>In examining value for money and tax equity considerations, the quantum of tax expenditure provided annually to qualifying taxpayers in relation to the use of high end cars must be taken in account. To take the example of an electric vehicle with an original market value of, say, &euro;150,000 that has been purchased by the employer for the use of a Director, where the employer has already benefitted from VRT relief and an SEAI grant. Without the imposition of a &euro;50,000 cap, the tax expenditure on such a vehicle is the equivalent of an annual grant from the taxpayer to the employee or Director of up to &euro;23,400, for a single tax year (i.e. the tax liability of the taxpayer would be reduced by up to this amount in a single tax year). This amount is equivalent to 7 or 8 home insulation grants to low income households under the SEAI Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme, where the benefit of these grants will last for many years. Or, that the same amount, under the National Fuel Allowance Scheme, is equivalent to an allowance for about 37 low income households for one year. </p><p>I am encouraged by the fact that registrations of new electric vehicles has doubled in the year to September and am satisfied that the cap has been set at a reasonable level which maintains a strong incentive for the take-up of electric vehicles while having due regard for value for money and tax equity.</p></reply>

The outcome of these discussions and eventual adoption of the proposed legislation will clarify and establish the full scope available to Member States to alter the VAT rating of goods and services. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the proposal must be agreed unanimously by all Member States before being adopted.  As previously stated, it is expected that fundamental changes such as those proposed will be the subject of intense discussion and negotiation before legislative changes are adopted and it is not possible at this stage to predict the degree of discretion that will be available to Member States in relation to the setting of rates of VAT on any category of goods.  Accordingly, I have no plans to undertake a review of VAT rate changes that might be possible until the proposed legislative changes are fully agreed upon and adopted.</p></reply>

A key element of obtaining relief is that the contractor must be a qualifying contractor for the purposes of the Incentive.  Revenue have advised me that where the contractor does not register as a qualifying contractor, then no relief is due to an individual under the Incentive.</p>  <p>  I am also advised by Revenue that their guidance for homeowners includes material on &lsquo;Choosing a HRI contractor&rsquo;.  I understand that the guidance emphasises that it is important for a homeowner to check the Revenue system online to see that the details of works have been entered before the work commences.  The guidance states that if a contractor is not a qualifying contractor, he/she will not be able to enter the details on the Revenue online system and that the homeowner will not be able to claim the HRI tax credit.   However, if the Deputy knows of a contractor who is not co-operating with an individual to allow them make a claim under HRI, he should provide the relevant details to Revenue.</p>  <p>  Details on the operation of the HRI scheme are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/index.html. </p></reply>

Pro-cyclical budgetary policies should be avoided; this is especially true when we are facing serious issues such as the exit of the UK from the European Union (and a non-negligible possibility of a 'disorderly' exit).  </p><p>With this in mind, the more important framework for guiding fiscal policy is 'fiscal stance' - what is right for the economy at a particular point in time, so as to support sustainable, incremental improvements in public services and living standards.</p><p>The correct 'fiscal stance' can only be ascertained once account is taken of the position in the economic cycle.  If the economy is operating at full capacity, then it would be incorrect to adopt an expansionary budgetary policy. On the other hand, if there is spare capacity in the economy, then it may be appropriate to use tax and expenditure policy to help absorb the spare capacity.  </p><p>Given the many issues facing the economy and the heightened level of uncertainty (such as what form the UK's exit from the EU will take), it is only possible to assess the appropriate fiscal stance on a year-to-year basis at present.</p></reply>

No. 482 of 2016), contains a right to open a payment account with basic features with a credit institution.  This right extends to any person who is legally resident in the European Union, regardless of whether he or she has a fixed address.</p>  <p>  A payment account with basic features is similar to a regular payment account in many respects.  It allows a person to place money in the account, withdraw cash from the account, and to make payments using direct debits, debit cards, or credit transfers.  An important difference is that a payment account with basic features does not offer credit facilities, such as an overdraft.</p>  <p>  In Ireland, a payment account with basic features is free of charge for the first year for regular payment transactions in euro within the European Union.  Where less than the equivalent of the national minimum wage is lodged to the account in a year, the account stays free of charge on a year-by-year basis for up to five years.  After that, an account holder may be charged reasonable fees.  </p>  <p>  Regulation 16 of the European Union (Payment Accounts) Regulations 2016 permits a credit institution to refuse to open an account on one of two grounds.  Those grounds are set out in the legislation, but essentially are that the applicant already holds a payment account or that refusal is necessary to comply with money laundering and terrorist financing legislation. </p>  <p>  If an applicant is refused an account he or she can submit a complaint against that decision to the credit institution.  A consumer who has a complaint that is not resolved by the credit institution&rsquo;s internal complaints mechanism may make a complaint to the independent Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank is the designated competent authority for the purposes of the European Union (Payment Accounts) Regulations 2016.  It informs me that, in the period from September 2016 to the end of June 2018, 69,182 accounts that met the criteria of a payment account with basic features were opened across all six Irish credit institutions.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank collects this data from firms for the purposes of evaluation of the Payment Accounts Directive, and I do not have a further breakdown of the number of payment accounts by institution.</p></reply>

However, the study also notes that if the price of new HTB units was to increase due to the incentive, the net benefit would be reduced. </p></reply>

The sessions involved a short video piece on the budget, an address by each of the Ministers in attendance and a questions and answers session. </p>  <p>  It is not possible at this time to provide a figure for the cost of each briefing session until all payments have been processed.  While each of the Ministers used their personal cars to transport them to these events, any other costs associated with travel in respect of additional departmental attendees will be forwarded to the Deputy as part of the overall cost of the briefings when the information is readily available. </p>  <p>  There are no further regional budget briefings planned. </p></reply>

This recognises the key role school leadership has in promoting a school environment which is welcoming, inclusive and accountable.</p><p>&euro;2.75m was allocated in Budget 2017 to restore middle management positions i.e. the equivalent of approximately 1,300 middle management posts at both Primary and Post-Primary.  It should also be noted that in recent Budget announcements over 400 additional Deputy Principal posts were provided for in our Post Primary schools to focus on Leadership and Management in these schools. This brought the number of Deputy Principal positions at Post-Primary from 393 in the 2015/16 school year to 866 in the current school year. </p><p>In total over 3,000 leadership posts have been invested in our primary and post primary schools in the past year which has led to 1 in 3 (34.5%) teachers now holding promoted positions in our schools.</p><p>Circular 63/2017 was issued by the Department in September 2017 which deals and sets out a leadership and management framework for posts in recognised primary schools.</p><p>Circular 3/2018 is the corresponding circular for the Post-Primary Sector and it issued in early January. Both circulars are available on my Department's website.</p><p>Figures for the breakdown of teachers in promoted positions and for the number of APIs and APIIs which were in our schools prior to the moratorium are outlined in the attached tables. </p><p>The estimated cost of restoring the number of middle-management posts in our schools to pre-moratorium levels would be approximately &euro;50m and any further restoration would have to be considered in the context of future Budgets.

There will be scope for up to 42 clusters nationwide in the initial phase with each cluster containing between a minimum of three and a maximum of six schools. Priority will be given to applicant clusters containing at least one DEIS school. </p><p>Further funding has also been made available to extend the coaching service currently available to school principals, to the Deputy and Assistant Principals on their leadership teams. The service to date has been one to one coaching for principals only. DEIS schools will be prioritised for the extension of the coaching service to incorporate team coaching for the Principal and their leadership team, with up to four sessions being offered to 100 DEIS schools in the first instance.</p><p>These measures are in addition to the other supports recently introduced through the Centre for School Leadership including mentoring, a new postgraduate diploma in school leadership and the additional 3,000 middle management posts in schools.</p><p><b>Number of APIs and APIIs which were removed from primary and post primary schools during the moratorium</b><table><tr><th></th><th colspan="2"><div>Primary</div></th><th colspan="2"><div>Post-Primary</div></th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>2008/09</td><td>2017/18*</td><td>2008/09</td><td>2017/18*</td></tr><tr><td>APIs</td><td>1,605</td><td>958</td><td>5,600</td><td>3,178</td></tr><tr><td>APIIs</td><td>8,575</td><td>5,982</td><td>8,240</td><td>5,422</td></tr></table>*2017/18 figures include the following posts of responsibility which were restored.  </p><p>APIs - 268 at primary level and 378 at post primary level</p><p>APIIs &ndash; 1,032 at primary level and 922 at post primary level </p><p><b>Breakdown of teachers in promoted positions for the 2017/18 school year</b><table><tr><th></th><th>Primary</th><th>Post Primary</th></tr><tr><td>APIs</td><td>958</td><td>3,178</td></tr><tr><td>APIIs</td><td>5,982</td><td>5,422</td></tr><tr><td>Deputy Principals</td><td>2,686</td><td>856</td></tr><tr><td>Principals</td><td>3,324</td><td>741</td></tr><tr><td>Total in management positions</td><td>12,950</td><td>10,197</td></tr><tr><td>Total teachers</td><td>36,904</td><td>29,550</td></tr><tr><td>% teachers holding management positions</td><td>35%</td><td>34.5%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Schools were also reminded that, in considering career break applications, the needs of pupils should take precedence and they must take account of the availability of appropriate qualified replacement teachers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, earlier this year the Teacher Supply Steering Group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department, was established. The Group is considering the issues that relate to teacher supply, including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility/supply; and promotion of the teaching profession.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group is supported by a number of working groups which are looking in more detail at the issues under these broad headings. The establishment of supply panels for substitute teachers at primary level is part of that consideration. A key concern will be to ensure value-for-money and optimum provision of teaching by teachers on any such panel.</p></reply>

The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area.  Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include not only single parent rate, but those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates.  This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  This data is applied uniformly to all schools in the country in a fair and objective way, to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school.</p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 provides for a verification process with which schools can engage to ensure the accuracy of the data being used.  It is envisaged that this process will involve a re-examination of the school data used and of the application of the data by the Department, to ensure that no administrative errors occurred. </p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Services/DEIS-Delivering-Equality-of-Opportunity-in-Schools-/DEIS-Identification-Process.pdf.</i></p><p>DEIS Plan 2017 states that the improved data on the socio-demographic of schools resulting from the new identification model will have an impact not only on the assessment of schools for inclusion in the programme but also on the scaling of resources to allow for more graduated levels of support.  This in turn allows for the ultimate objective of allocating resources to best meet the identified need of individual schools.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the current identification model needs to be as accurate as possible and this will be facilitated by the use of Eircode to ensure correct inputting of addresses.  Further analysis is also required to examine other variables known to be strong predictors of educational disadvantage in the context of resource allocation.  </p><p>Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the address data and conduct further analysis, it has been decided to conduct further quality assurance on the model before extending these envisaged uses of the model.  Consequently, it is not intended to extend the DEIS programme to any further schools until this work is complete.</p></reply>

The Steering Group is leading on the identification of the issues, the development of a programme of actions on teacher supply and overseeing its implementation.

All post-primary schools and some special schools are now included in the 100Mbps programme. </p>  <p>  The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the market and financial constraints.  Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local infrastructure, and thus impact on the service that can be provided. </p>  <p>  Under the current primary schools programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, in line with contractual and budgetary requirements.  A recent drawdown from the Framework of Providers of Broadband Services saw some 1,100 primary schools awarded download speeds of 30Mbps or greater (the baseline download speed required under the National Broadband Plan).  Those schools have now been upgraded to that connectivity.  This represents more than one third of all primary schools.  This is a significant improvement over recent years, given that less than 100 primary schools were on those speeds in 2012.  Further schools are likely to be upgraded to those speeds in 2018, through EIR's 300K Rural Deployment commitment. </p>  <p>  The need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020, and as noted access to high speed broadband is one of the indicators identified in the Digital Strategy Action Plan.  An interdepartmental working group has been established to determine how best to address broadband connectivity to primary schools in collaboration with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, in the context of the National Broadband Plan and the Intervention Strategy, and proposed industry provision.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy was recently included in mini competition run by my Department and the service to that school has been awarded to a provider of high speed broadband.   The provider, is currently working to provide this service to the school.  The school will be contacted by the provider in due course to arrange the installation.</p></reply>

The new curriculum and assessment arrangements are being phased in to accommodate the development of new specifications for subjects as well as the provision of professional development for teachers and school planning.  The first phase commenced with the introduction of the new specification for English for students entering 1st year in September 2014.  New subject specifications have been introduced in each of the past 3 years with the final phase due to be introduced in September 2019 with all subjects under the framework examinable in June 2022. </p><p>Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) is a dedicated support service of the Department of Education and Skills and was established to support schools in implementing the Framework for Junior Cycle (2015).  JCT has worked with schools, including school leaders and teachers annually since the 2014-2015 school year, and continues to do so.</p><p>In the 2018-2019 school year the following are the main continuing professional development supports being provided by JCT:</p><p>-  Dedicated subject specific continuing professional development (CPD) workshops are being provided for teachers in local education centres nationwide between September and November 2018.  These workshops are repeats of the subject workshops provided during the 2017-2018 school year and are aimed at those teachers who were unable to attend the 2017-2018 workshops due to their attendance at their other teaching subject workshop during that year, or if they simply missed the opportunity to attend the workshop during that year.</p><p>A new wave of subject CPD workshops for the 2018-2019 school year for all subject teachers will commence nationwide in November 2018 and will run until April 2019.  These workshops are provided on a school clustering basis whereby between 6-10 post-primary schools in a geographical region will close on the same day to students while all of the teachers come together in their subject groupings for dedicated CPD.</p><p>- This arrangement is catered for in DES circular 0015/2017 and will take place on a continuing basis nationwide throughout the school year.</p><p>-  Two separate workshops are being provided for school leaders by JCT during 2018-2019.  The first of these workshops is set to be rolled out nationwide during November and December 2018.  The focus of this workshop will be the reforms taking place in the context of reporting on students&rsquo; progress to students themselves, and to their parents/guardians.  The second workshop will be facilitated nationwide in March and April 2019 and the focus of this workshop will be determined by the needs of school leaders, Principals and Deputy Principals.</p><p>-  JCT provides a wide range of elective CPD opportunities for teachers which take place in the evening times and at weekends, generally in education centres nationwide.  These workshops focus on a range of topics including Subject Learning and Assessment Review meetings, utilisation of management resource hours by schools in supporting the embedding of junior cycle, STE(A)M, Arts in Junior Cycle, DesignSKILLS and much more.  These elective workshops are proving very popular with teachers.</p><p>-  JCT provides online supports for schools.  The service provides a wide range of live and interactive webinars for teachers across all of the different subject areas, while all of their teaching and learning resources and materials are provided on their website for download by teachers, <i>www.jct.ie.</i></p><p>JCT also works closely with various teacher associations and groupings and will regularly attend national conferences and other events to facilitate dedicated CPD workshops.</p></reply>

After a very detailed consultation process the NCCA recommended a new approach:</p><p>- limited compulsory  subjects around basic literacy and numeracy </p><p>- 24 statements of learning</p><p>It is important to say that the 24 statements of learning include important elements which cultivate a historical perspective. </p><p>The new Junior Cycle Programme has also greatly enlivened subjects with a new emphasis on projects and self directed learning.  This new approach is particularly evidence in history which will encourage  take up of this lively and attractive subject. </p><p>The new approach gives students more choice and options which will be very valuable in their personal development.  There will be 21 subjects and numerous short courses when all subjects are rolled out. </p><p>When it comes to compulsion it should be said that history prior to the introduction of the Framework for Junior Cycle was only a core subject in voluntary secondary schools (52% of schools).  However, it is important to note that currently some 90% of students across all school types choose to study History at Junior Cycle.</p></reply>

The Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 sets out a series of detailed actions and annual targets on how the expansion commitments in the area set out in the Action Plan for Education will be met.  Over the lifetime of the plan we will see 50,000 learners register on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes. This represents a more than doubling of activity by 2020.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to doubling the number of people on an apprenticeship programme by 2020 and expanding the apprenticeship model into new sectors of the economy. Arising from our two calls for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 and 2017 sixteen new apprenticeships have now been developed in a range of new occupations, including financial services, engineering, ICT, hospitality, logistics and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships will get underway later this year and throughout 2019 in a variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture.</p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships, as the employment and economic situation continues to improve, we have seen strong growth in registrations across the craft trades nationally also with 4,508 new registrations in 2017, which represents a 20% increase on 2016. The upward trend continues this year with 3,504 new registrations recorded at the end of September, 7% ahead of the same period last year.</p>  <p>  The Government is also prioritising the expansion of traineeship offerings. To date over twenty additional new traineeships have been developed in areas such as hospitality, engineering, logistics and animation. These new programmes will complement the existing programmes on offer. The programmes have been designed by ETBs working in collaboration with employers to meet identified skill needs. Further new traineeships will get underway later this year and throughout 2019 in a variety of sectors including financial services, media and engineering.  We have also broadened the eligibility criteria on participation to include school leavers, older learners and people in employment.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, SOLAS is currently reviewing pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of underrepresented groups, including ethnic groups such as travellers.  The review will identify any barriers that may exist to participation in an apprenticeship programme. The purpose of the review is to ensure that our national apprenticeship system is more reflective of the range and diversity of our population, more inclusive of diverse backgrounds and abilities and that apprenticeship opportunities are more readily accessible to all.  The review will result in the publication of actions in this area in the coming weeks, along with the background research.</p></reply>

Irish Travellers are identified as a target group within the Plan.</p>  <p>  To support the implementation of the National Access Plan, the Department of Education and Skills (DES) established the Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) fund in 2016.  Through PATH a total investment of &euro;16.2 million will be made over the next three years and will see many new initiatives emerge that will support greater levels of access and participation by the target groups in higher education, including Irish Travellers.</p>  <p>  The 1916 Bursary Fund supported under PATH 2 provides financial support to students identified by regional clusters of higher education institutions as being most economically disadvantaged from the target groups identified in the National Access Plan 2015-2019, including Irish Travellers.</p>  <p>  The first year of implementation of the bursary scheme was 2017/18.

This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for patronage and language of instruction, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  </p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. Under the new OPPS system, patron bodies complete an application form at the beginning of the process. Information in relation to applicant patrons is provided to parents on the OPPS website which allows them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education.</p>  <p>  In general, my Department's policy is to integrate children with special educational needs into the mainstream primary school system wherever possible. Many of our new schools have special education units included within them. However, special schools are also necessary to meet the educational needs of pupils whose needs cannot be adequately catered for in a mainstream primary school. The need to establish a new special school would be identified by the National Council for Special Education in conjunction with the Department. The necessity would arise where there is a specific and quantified need that could not reasonably be met through existing provision. Any process to establish a new special school would have to take account of the views of parents who are the key stakeholders with regard to their child. </p></reply>

However, under the Directive genuine movement must be taking place by the EU national, such as taking up employment, etc.  A series of measures were taken by INIS including defending cases in the Courts, working with the Garda National Immigration Bureau to address abuses, and working in close cooperation with UK counterparts who subsequently made changes to their laws.  Since these measures were taken, the numbers of such new applicants dropped off dramatically in 2017 and this year to date.  </p><p>Legal proceedings in relation to a number of such applications have been before the courts, and a referral was made by the Court of the Appeal to the European Court of Justice.</p><p>More generally, the central concern, as with all visa services worldwide, in deciding on visa applications is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account.</p><p><b>Applications received from 1 July, 2015 to end of September, 2018 </b><table><tr><th>Nationality</th><th>July-Dec 2015</th><th>2016</th><th>2017</th><th>Jan-Sept 2018</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Pakistan</td><td>1922</td><td>3561</td><td>524</td><td>983</td><td>6990</td></tr><tr><td>Afghanistan</td><td>2001</td><td>790</td><td>44</td><td>391</td><td>3226</td></tr><tr><td>Iraq</td><td>1054</td><td>373</td><td>23</td><td>26</td><td>1476</td></tr><tr><td>Nigeria</td><td>110</td><td>305</td><td>314</td><td>256</td><td>985</td></tr><tr><td>India</td><td>146</td><td>266</td><td>200</td><td>226</td><td>838</td></tr><tr><td>Russian Federation</td><td>88</td><td>154</td><td>190</td><td>142</td><td>574</td></tr><tr><td>Bangladesh</td><td>170</td><td>236</td><td>47</td><td>119</td><td>572</td></tr><tr><td>Philippines</td><td>65</td><td>109</td><td>114</td><td>113</td><td>401</td></tr><tr><td>People's Republic of China</td><td>75</td><td>103</td><td>134</td><td>81</td><td>393</td></tr><tr><td>Ukraine</td><td>55</td><td>100</td><td>105</td><td>87</td><td>347</td></tr><tr><td>Rest of the World</td><td>706</td><td>1130</td><td>1109</td><td>1107</td><td>4052</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>6392</td><td>7127</td><td>2804</td><td>3531</td><td>19854</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a programme of accelerated recruitment, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened service through the Five Year High Level Reform and Workforce Plan to achieve an overall workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve Members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p>  <p>  Since the re-opening of Templemore College in September 2014, we have been rebuilding the Garda organisation and I am pleased that, since then, approximately 2,200 new Garda members have attested and assigned to duties in communities throughout the country. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. With another attestation of approximately 200 Garda recruits due to take place on 30 November, Garda numbers will increase to approximately 14,000 by the end of this year for the first time since 2011. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. By year end, a further 800 new Garda Recruits will have entered the Garda College in 2018. To support the Commissioner in this recruitment, I have also secured funding in Budget 2019 which facilitates the recruitment of up to 800 more Garda&iacute; next year.  The Budget also provides for the necessary civilian Garda staff to fill critical skills gaps and enable the further redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front line duties.</p>  <p>  As I said on Budget day, the Commissioner will need to consider all aspects of the funding requirement in the Garda Vote and how all resources at his disposal can be best deployed including in relation to the composition of the Service.  I expect to receive his proposals in this regard shortly.</p>  <p>  In addition to the vision of 15,000 Garda members by 2021, plans are also in place for 4,000 civilians and 2,000 Reserves. I am informed by the Commissioner that as of 31 August 2018 there were 2,330 civilians undertaking administrative and technical duties within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am encouraged that the number of civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to increase, albeit more slowly than anticipated.  It is clear, however, that progress is being made with close to 300 new civilian staff posts sanctioned to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation.  This will allow more Garda&iacute; to focus on operational policing duties where their training and specialist expertise can be put to best use. Already approximately 150 Garda&iacute; have been redeployed to operational policing duties and I expect these numbers to accelerate in the coming months and throughout 2019. Work is also continuing on a strategic review of the Garda Reserve which I expect to be concluded shortly.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware the Commission on the Future of Policing published its report on 18 September. This innovative report sets out a number of recommendations across the policing sector and in particular on the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the Garda Reserve. I am currently consulting widely on the issues raised including with the Garda Commissioner in advance of returning to Government in December with my substantive response and a High Level Implementation Plan.  </p></reply>

I am confident that these will match what is available to all other workers in the State, while at the same time reflecting the particular status and requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation.</p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to regard all forms of anti-social behaviour very seriously. </p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour is a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.  I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that officials from my Department are currently liaising and meeting with a number of Garda Business Forums around the country, to support local crime prevention initiatives and to assist with the development of policy to tackle issues such as vandalism and night time anti-social behaviour.  This process will continue into next year, and in that regard I have requested that contact is made by my officials with the local crime prevention officer in Maynooth. </p>  <p>  If the organisations in question have any specific proposals they would like to make in relation to combatting anti-social behaviour, I would be happy to make arrangements for the proposals to be brought to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that there is currently no date for the commencement of a new recruitment campaign for Garda Trainees. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware this Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the most recent recruitment campaign which closed for applications on the 7 June 2018 again received a strong response with approximately 6,300 applications received.  This compares favourably to the 2017 competition which received approximately 5,400 applications and indicates that a career in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to be regarded as an attractive and rewarding profession.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that since the re-opening of Templemore College in September 2014, we have been rebuilding the Garda organisation and I am pleased that, since then, approximately 2,200 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to duties in communities throughout the country.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to approximately 13,500 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.  With another attestation of approximately 200 Garda recruits due to take place in November, Garda numbers will increase to approximately 14,000 by the end of this year for the first time since 2011. </p>  <p>  By year end, a further 800 new Garda Recruits will have entered the Garda College in 2018 and I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  In that regard to support the Commissioner in this recruitment, I have secured funding in Budget 2019 which will facilitate the recruitment of up to 800 more Garda&iacute; next year. </p>  <p>  This is an ambitious programme of recruitment and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. </p>  <p>  Regarding the stages of the recruitment process, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 2013 the Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of the Garda Commissioner, manages the initial recruitment stages for the selection of Garda trainees.  Currently, the first three stages of the process which are conducted by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) are as follows;</p>  <p>  Stage 1: Online Assessment &ndash; Unsupervised</p>  <p>  Stage 2: Assessment Test &amp;amp; Exercises &ndash; Supervised</p>  <p>  Stage 3: Interview &amp;amp; Other Assessments</p>  <p>  Appeals for the first three stages of the process are dealt with by PAS, and I as Minister have no function or direct involvement in this process.  Following these three stages, successful candidates from the PAS process are forwarded to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  The final stages of the recruitment process in which candidates are vetted, and complete a physical competency test and a medical examination, are managed by the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct involvement in the matter.</p>  <p>  I would advise any candidate for a position as a Garda trainee to contact the PAS or the Garda Appointments Office, depending on the relevant stage of the application process, if they have any queries in relation to their application. </p>  <p>  Potential candidates should also continue to monitor publicjobs.ie for details of any upcoming competitions.</p></reply>

The panels formed from these competitions will be drawn upon as needed by the Commissioner until they are exhausted. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate&rsquo;s Review of Entry-Routes into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was published in July 2018, proposes extending the existing reciprocal arrangements with the PSNI to allow access to the Sergeant and Inspector promotion processes in both jurisdictions (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI).  The recently published Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland endorses this recommendation and the related recommendation that reciprocal arrangements with other police services should also be explored. </p>  <p>  I will be returning to Government in December with a High Level Plan to implement the recommendations in the Commission report.  As part of that, I will be addressing how the recommendations in relation to entry to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are to be progressed.</p></reply>

The report contains a wide range of recommendations which comprehensively address all the themes set out in the Commission's terms of reference. </p>  <p>  The Report makes many innovative proposals aimed at strengthening our national security arrangements; empowering the Garda Commissioner to ensure more effective management of the Garda organisation; supporting the internal governance of the Garda organisation through the introduction of a Board and reforming the method of recruitment and training of Garda&iacute;.  It also makes a number of recommendations on external oversight arrangements as well as on the Commissioner&rsquo;s engagement with the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  This is a major report on one of the key functions of the State and it is now receiving appropriate consideration.  My Department is undertaking a detailed consultation process with the new Commissioner and other agencies as well as with other Government departments which are potentially impacted by the report's recommendations.  As part of this process, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to respond to the recommendations in the report insofar as they directly concern An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have requested that this response will include an implementation plan of how he intends to take matters forward.</p>  <p>  I have also written to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality and I look forward to hearing their direct response to the Report in the coming weeks.  I also understand that Kathleen O'Toole, the Chair of the Commission, has been invited to address the Committee next month.  I am very grateful to Ms. O'Toole and the other members of the Commission for their comprehensive report and I believe this will be a very useful engagement which will allow members to hear directly from the Commission as to how it approached its task and reached its detailed findings.</p>  <p>  Once these engagements are completed, I intend to seek the Government's approval for a High-level Implementation Plan to take forward the agreed recommendations in the Report.</p>  <p>  The Commission recommends significant legislative change and my plans to progress this important aspect of the Report will form part of my proposals to Government in December.</p>  <p>  My Department, in consultation with the Department of the Taoiseach, is moving quickly to establish the Implementation Group for Policing Reform and the Implementation Programme Office as recommended by the Commission.  We expect to be in a position to appoint the independent Chair of Implementation Group shortly.  Given the whole-of-Government reach of the report, this Implementation Group and Programme Office will be based in the Department of the Taoiseach.  </p>  <p>  While the programme of reform that the Commission outlines is undoubtedly an opportunity for transformational change, it is also extremely challenging, requiring actions across Government.  It is prudent that we take some time now to ensure that the necessary structures and resources are in place to deliver this programme of transformation.  The Commission has suggested that transformation should be substantially completed by the centenary of the establishment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022.  That is, in my view, a realistic target.</p></reply>

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to regard all forms of anti-social behaviour very seriously. </p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour is a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.  I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.</p>  <p>  Clearly, Garda visibility in our communities is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a programme of accelerated recruitment, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened service through the Five Year High Level Reform and Workforce Plan, which will see an overall workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021.</p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle these problems head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone.  Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding.  These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by wider society in general.  We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately.</p></reply>

Nonetheless the Department is continuing to engage with all relevant parties to provide information on the scheme and clarify any queries arising.

For 2013 and from January to August 2014 (Table A) cases were categorised as being &quot;Residential&quot; or &quot;Non-Residential&quot;. From September 2014 (Table B) the categorisation changed to &quot;Primary Home&quot;, &quot;Buy to Let&quot; or &quot;Other/Unknown&quot;. The Courts Service has advised that data in relation to Possession Orders for 2018 to date is not yet available. </p><p><b>TABLE A </b><table><tr><th>Period</th><th>Residential</th><th>Non-Residential</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>330</td><td>33</td><td>363</td></tr><tr><td>January to August 2014</td><td>448</td><td>76</td><td>524</td></tr></table></p><p><b>TABLE  B</b><table><tr><th>Period</th><th>Primary   Home</th><th>Buy to Let</th><th>Other/Unknown</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>September to December 2014</td><td>319</td><td>103</td><td>117</td><td>539</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>918</td><td>148</td><td>218</td><td>1,284</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>854</td><td>62</td><td>172</td><td>1,088</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>733</td><td>15</td><td>130</td><td>878</td></tr></table></p><p>The Deputy should note that under section 101 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, all applications for repossession in cases of &lsquo;housing loan&rsquo; mortgages created after 1 December 2009 must be made in the Circuit Court. In addition, under section 3 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013, with effect from 31 July 2013, all applications for repossession in cases of mortgages created before 1 December 2009 on private residences or family homes must also be made in the Circuit Court.</p><p>As the figures above show, there has been a decline in the number of Possession Orders granted over the period concerned. At its peak in 2015 a total of 918 Possession Orders were granted in respect of primary homes &ndash; 77 per month. In 2017, this figure had dropped to 733 Possession Orders &ndash; 61 per month. This equates to a drop of over 20% in the three year period. I might also add that the issue of a possession order does not, in many cases, lead to a loss of ownership of the family home and can be a catalyst for a solution between lender and homeowner which will see them retaining possession of the home. The introduction of the Abhaile Scheme, from 2016, has provided help to over 10,000 households in serious mortgage arrears, most of whom are in the most serious category of arrears (exceeding 720 days), and has been a contributing factor to the decrease in Possession Orders being granted.</p><p><b>High Court:</b></p><p>The Courts Service has also indicated that High Court statistics in relation to the number of Possession Orders granted do not distinguish between Buy to Let and Private Dwelling. The number of High Court Possession Orders granted in the years 2013 to 2 March 2018 is set out in the table.</p><p><b>TABLE C</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>High Court Possession Orders</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>88 </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>65 </td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>47</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>From 1 January 2018 to 2 March 2018</td><td>14</td></tr></table></p><p>Please note that the Courts Service Annual Report figures for 2014 and 2015 included Well Charging Orders in addition to Possession Orders.</p><p>I should add that the Government recently approved the drafting of the Courts and Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Bill 2018, which will provide further protections for people in mortgage difficulties, particularly those people who, for whatever reason, have been unable to avail of a Personal Insolvency Arrangement. It is expected that the Bill will be published during the current session.</p><p>This Government&rsquo;s paramount objective in the context of resolving the mortgage arrears problem is to keep borrowers in their homes wherever feasible. We consider that repossession of private residences is a last resort when all other options have failed. In that context, I would urge all borrowers in mortgage arrears to contact their lender with a view to engaging in an effort to reach a sustainable solution which will allow them to stay in their homes.</p></reply>

Study visas at this time are being processed within four weeks. Employment and visit visas are currently being processed within seven weeks.

There are now over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA client companies located outside of Dublin, with 45% of all new foreign direct investment (FDI) jobs created last year based in regional locations. The IDA is focused, as am I, on increasing those numbers further.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland does not compile job creation data on specific towns and locations within counties. As regards County Tipperary more broadly, there are currently eleven IDA client companies based there employing a total of 3,665 people. FDI-supported employment in County Tipperary has increased by almost 9% from 2016 to 2017 with 297 net new jobs created. The IDA continues to engage with its existing client base to support them in growing their business and footprint there further. Some of the most prominent IDA client companies in County Tipperary include Abbott Ireland, Boston Scientific and Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD) who together employ 2,500 people. IDA Ireland also owns sites in Clonmel and Tipperary Town that are being actively marketed to its clients.</p>  <p>  It is important to remember that FDI only forms one part of the broader approach to fostering enterprise and job creation in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise is also, of course, responsible for a significant portion of employment growth, especially outside Dublin. My Department and all its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices, work together to ensure that jobs and investment are spread as fairly as possible across the country.</p></reply>

Enterprise development has been central to our success in reducing national unemployment from a high of 16% to 5.4% at the end of September 2018 - the lowest level in over a decade. </p><p>The Border (Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan) and West (Galway, Mayo, Roscommon) regions have seen good progress, with employment in these regions increasing by 2.6% and 12.6% in total respectively from Q1 2015 to Q2 2018, according to the CSO Labour Force Survey. </p><p>In 2017, Enterprise Ireland reported job increases in both the North West and West of 7% each; while IDA reported increases of 4% across the Border region and 5% in the West. Through partnership between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities, the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) across Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal and Roscommon have 753 client companies employing 3,410 people; and last year those companies added 267 new jobs in total. </p><p>I am happy to say that in Budget 2019, I secured an increase in my Department&rsquo;s total exchequer allocation by 9.1% year on year, up from &euro;871m to &euro;950.2m.</p><p>This is made up of a record &euro;620m in capital and &euro;330.2m in current funding, which includes:</p><p>- an increase of &euro;65m in capital &ndash; up 11.7% on this year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;555m; and</p><p>- an increase of &euro;14.2m in current &ndash; almost 4.5% more than our 2018 allocation of &euro;316m.</p><p>Regional development was one of my three main priorities for Budget 2019 and I approved a range of measures to drive indigenous enterprise development and regional growth. </p><p>I allocated an extra &euro;5m to the 31 LEOs, up 22% on 2018, which have a presence in every county, including Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal, to support start-ups and growth and in particular to support businesses to prepare for Brexit. The LEOs will work with the broad range of small and micro indigenous enterprises across sectors to ensure that they are informed and have plans in place to manage the new trading relationships on the island and with the UK more generally. This will include a new customs training programme for all businesses, exporters and importers, to be rolled out in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>The IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme is critical to encouraging more foreign direct investment into the regions. So, I was pleased to announce an allocation of &euro;10m to the next phase of the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme. Project Ireland 2040 names the Border and Midlands regions as priority areas for this Programme, and so the funding will be used to start building advanced facilities in a number of regional locations. The next phase of the IDA Regional Property Programme will see new buildings constructed in a number of regional locations, including in Sligo.<b></b></p><p>IDA Ireland is working to promote Counties Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal to a range of potential investors, but especially in the areas of global business services, research and innovation and high-tech manufacturing. The IDA also regularly engages - with a view to encouraging job creation and investment - with key stakeholders on the ground in these counties, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base and from the indigenous sector. </p><p>I was also pleased to announce an additional capital allocation &euro;2.75m to Enterprise Ireland to start developing regional innovation and technology clusters with Institutes of Technology right across the country, positioning them as drivers of world-class start-ups and growth enterprises.</p><p>Through Enterprise Ireland, I also doubled funding for the Online Retail Pilot Scheme to &euro;1.25m in 2019, which will support SMEs in the retail sector to have a stronger online presence. This new Scheme follows through on our commitment to increase the scale and internationalisation of indigenous enterprise; increase productivity in high-employment sectors; and encourage Brexit readiness. </p><p>In addition, I also secured funding for a new phase of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Seed &amp;amp; Venture Capital Scheme out to 2024. The new scheme, which is worth &euro;175m, will be oriented towards seed and early stage investments, where there is a very clear market failure.</p><p>I announced an additional &euro;1.8m investment for the Design Craft Council of Ireland (DCCOI) which will assist craft enterprises all over the country to develop and generate additional export sales and online revenue opportunities, increased market diversification so as to underpin sustainable growth. </p><p>Finally, I announced a &euro;300m Brexit Future Growth Longer Term Loan Scheme for loans of up to 10 years. The Scheme has been developed by my Department with the European Investment Bank Group, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Finance together with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. </p><p>This Scheme will provide businesses the opportunity to borrow for up to ten years to support capital investment. It addresses the lack of availability of loans in the marketplace for loan-terms of longer than five-to-seven years. </p><p>In April of this year, along with Minister Breen, I met with the Chairs of all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs committees and other regional stakeholders, to start a process to Refresh and Refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their effectiveness, relevance and impact out to 2020, particularly in light of Brexit. I had a further meeting with the Chairs of the Regional Committees last week in my offices and I am pleased with the ambition and quality of the strategic actions being developed. The refreshed West and North West Region Action Plans for Jobs will further strengthen a collaborative approach at regional level which will enhance the impact and delivery of the supports outlined in Budget 2019, and existing supports, to increase job creation and enterprise development.</p></reply>

As part of the Network, OLCHC provides cardiothoracic surgery and paediatric cardiac catheterisation for patients from Northern Ireland.  The phased implementation of the Network commenced in late 2015, with OLCHC providing surgery and cardiac catheterisation for emergency cases from Northern Ireland. Treatment of urgent cases commenced in March 2017.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the transfer of elective cases from Northern Ireland, the next step in the phased implementation of the Network, began in April this year. Plans for an extension to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) in OLCHC to accommodate all elective patients from Northern Ireland are also at an advanced stage. This is an example of the benefits for patients of North South cooperation in healthcare, with the two Departments of Health and services North and South working together in the interests of patients.</p></reply>

CervicalCheck has been successful in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland and, as Dr Scally stated in his report on the issues relating to CervicalCheck, which was published on the website of my Department on 12 September, continuation of the screening service in the coming months is of crucial importance. Dr Scally's report provided welcome reassurance about the quality management processes in the laboratories currently contracted by CervicalCheck, and confirmed that he found no reason why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV regime is introduced. </p>  <p>  The HSE has now advised that Heads of Agreement have been signed with the laboratories contracted by CervicalCheck, to extend their contracts pending the introduction of HPV testing as the primary screening test. This allows for the continuation of the service without interruption. </p>  <p>  The switch to HPV testing as the primary screening mechanism for the CervicalCheck programme will involve a reconfiguration of the laboratory work involved, and will be subject to a tendering process for any work carried out outside the public sector.</p></reply>

It has approved the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy as Government policy and the vehicle to achieve this transformational reform. I am conscious of the cross party support for Sl&aacute;intecare and will work to maintain this throughout implementation. I would like to assure the Deputy that Sl&aacute;intecare implementation is a key priority for me and the Government.</p><p>The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy was published in August. The Strategy provides the framework within which a system-wide reform programme will be advanced to deliver the Committee's vision of a health system in which care is provided in the right place, at the right time, by the right person and is always provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. The Implementation Strategy contains 106 linked actions to be delivered over the first 3 years of implementation. </p><p>In tandem, a dedicated Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office has been established in the Department of Health. This office is tasked with leading the implementation of the Strategy. An experienced Executive Director has been appointed to lead the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office and recruitment of staff is currently under way.</p><p>Other Sl&aacute;intecare implementation structures are also being established. The Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Advisory Council will hold its inaugural meeting on 24th October. Dr. Tom Keane has been appointed as Chair of the Council.</p><p>The Programme Office has commenced the preparation of a detailed action plan for 2019 which will be published before the end of this year. This will include detailed milestones and timelines for year one and the assignment of responsibility for each action.</p><p>The Programme Office is also designing an inclusive consultation and communication process for the public and staff in the health sector. Communication and consultation was identified as a critical requirement in implementation by the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.</p><p>A number of specific actions in the Implementation Strategy are already under way. The independent review of the impacts of the removal of private practice from public hospitals is ongoing and expected to report before the end of 2018.</p><p>Renegotiation of the GP contract has commenced with GP representatives on a package of measures including service improvements and reforms to the GMS contract.</p><p>Government approval has been secured for the establishment of an independent board for the HSE. The Bill has passed committee stage in the Seanad and it is hoped that it will be enacted this year.</p><p>A public consultation on the geo-alignment of Hospital Groups and Community Healthcare Organisations has been completed. This is the first step in a process of broader health service structural reform.</p><p>Finally, budget 2019 features over &euro;200m additional funding which will directly support a range of additional services including initiatives proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report and committed to in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy including: </p><p>- Ringfenced funding for the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Office;</p><p>- &euro;20m for the establishment of a new ringfenced Sl&aacute;intecare Integration Fund to drive improvements in the way we deliver care across the system;</p><p>- Funding for a new GP contract;</p><p>- Expansion of free GP care, by an increase in the weekly income threshold for GP Visit card by &euro;25 which could benefit up to 100,000 people;</p><p>- Additional funding for 100 new therapy posts to address assessment of need waiting lists for children with disabilities and funding to ensure that the needs of all those leaving school in 2019 will be addressed;</p><p>- &euro;55m in new development funding aimed at further enhancing community mental health teams for adults and children;</p><p>- Reducing user charges and out of pocket payments by further reductions in prescription charges - 50 cent reduction in prescription charges from &euro;2.00 to &euro;1.50 for all medical card holders over the age of 70 and by a &euro;10 reduction in the monthly Drugs Payment Scheme threshold from &euro;134 to &euro;124; </p><p>- Increased investment of &euro;20m in the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This funding will be used to treat 70,000 patients on waiting lists in 2019; and</p><p>- Additional funding for  care redesign and the National Children's Hospital.</p></reply>

This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses. The general scheme, although having lower income thresholds, provides for income disregards and relevant outgoings to be taken into account in the assessment process.  Furthermore, persons, including those aged over 70 years, may be deemed eligible for a medical card on a discretionary basis, if they are judged to face undue hardship in arranging General Practitioner medical and surgical services as a result of medical or social circumstances.</p>  <p>  There are no proposals at present to amend the current income limits for the granting of eligibility for medical cards for persons aged 70 and over.

All patients who are clinically suitable for outsourcing who are waiting more than 9 months for one of these targeted procedures will be offered treatment in 2018 and 2019.   </p>  <p>  In terms of treatment offers, the NTPF authorises public hospitals to offer outsourced treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. NTPF authorisations are made in respect of the longest waiting patients first.</p></reply>

The terms of this agreement provides for the establishment of a new company which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.</p>  <p>  It is vitally important that the legal and governance arrangements associated with this project are robust. Considerable work has been undertaken to develop a legal framework to protect the State's significant investment in the new hospital.  This legal framework will underpin the operational and clinical independence of the new hospital, ensuring care in the new maternity hospital will be delivered without religious, ethnic or other distinction and any medical procedure which is in accordance with the laws of the land will be carried out there. Once finalised, proposals will be subject to consideration with the parties concerned.</p>  <p>  While the approval process is one for myself, as Minister for Health, I can confirm that I intend to brief Government once the legal framework has been finalised. I will, of course, be very happy to share the agreement with the House, as appropriate, in due course.</p></reply>

It acknowledged that the pay rates for new entrants had been highlighted as a factor in this and recognised that the implementation of the settlement of the 2008 Consultant Contract claim, while necessary of itself, would serve to highlight further the differential in pay between the pre-existing cadre of consultants and new entrants. It also stated that the proposed incremental measures for new entrants across the public service, including consultants, that have now been confirmed, would not be sufficient to address the differential.</p>  <p>  In terms of the number of consultant vacancies, the Pay Commission noted that at the end of 2017 the number of serving consultants at 2,971 (whole time equivalents) was 169 below the total Establishment figure of approved consultant posts of 3,140 and that it had been advised of approximately 400 posts either vacant or filled on a temporary or agency basis.</p>  <p>  Given its analysis, the Pay Commission proposed that the Parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement jointly consider what further measures could be taken, over time, to address the pay differential between pre-existing consultants and new entrant consultants which has increased following the settlement of the 2008 Consultant Contract claim. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department have noted the Commission's views and consideration will need to be given to potential solutions which are in line with public sector pay policy and available budgets. This will be a significant challenge given the amounts involved.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to increasing the consultant workforce. Notwithstanding recruitment and retention challenges, the number of consultants employed in the public health services has increased by 118 in the 12 months to end August 2018 and by 479 in the past five years to 3,032(whole time equivalent's). Where vacancies exist, the HSE endeavours to fill essential posts on a locum or temporary contract basis to support service delivery. The HSE is also committed to improving the recruitment process, offering contracts to the Hospital Group rather than individual sites and focusing on family friendly arrangements.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan (NDP) provides for a major increase in capacity across the health system including the full complement of additional acute beds by 2028 - 3 years ahead of schedule. </p>  <p>  Arising from the recommendations in the Health Service Capacity Review, my Department engaged with the HSE this year to identify the location and mix of beds which could be opened to alleviate overcrowding in our hospital Emergency Departments for Winter 2018/19. This process culminated in the development by the HSE of a Capacity Plan, which identified over 600 acute beds and 290 residential care beds, to be phased in between 2018 and 2020.</p>  <p>  As a first step towards the implementation of the Capacity Plan, &euro;10 million in funding is being made available in 2019 to enable additional acute beds to be opened for winter 2019/2020.  My Department is currently engaging with the HSE to finalise the details of this investment.</p>  <p>  Under the NDP three new dedicated elective-only hospitals will be introduced which will increase capacity in the hospital system and provide a better separation of scheduled and unscheduled care. </p></reply>

In Budget 2019 we have further increased investment in this area, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund to increase from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019, an overall increase of 150% since this government came into office.</p>  <p>  In 2019, the NTPF plans to deliver 25,000 Inpatient Day Case treatments, an increase of 5,000 from the 20,000 procedures committed to in the Waiting List Action Plan 2018. Furthermore, 40,000 first outpatient appointments will be arranged as part of the 2019 activity.</p>  <p>  NTPF activity next year will cover approximately 50 high to medium volume procedures and will be through a combination of treating patients in outsourced facilities and supporting the public system initiatives.  In addition, the NTPF will take a targeted approach in 2019 for procedures not included in the high to medium volume bracket.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise a coherent Waiting List Action Plan for 2019 before the end of the year.  The priority of my Department is to maintain a seamless continuation of the considerable progress made this year into next year.  This will include the continuing engagement of the NTPF with the HSE and public hospitals, inviting proposals for waiting list initiatives either through the private sector or through public sector insourcing.  The NTPF will provide funding to the solutions proposed if appropriate.</p>  <p>  In terms of treatment offers, the NTPF authorises public hospitals to offer outsourced treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic.  NTPF authorisations are made in respect of the longest waiting patients first.</p></reply>

The maximum Motorised Transport Grant, which was payable once in any three-year period, was &euro;5,020. Following closure of the scheme in February 2013, no further Motorised Transport Grants have been payable.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place. This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.</p>  <p>  There are improvements  in access to a range of transport support schemes available to persons  with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out  by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services. Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and  Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility  and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p></reply>

Non- achievement of the tranche 3 of the VIP programme</p><p>3. Higher level of State Claims Agency payouts than budgeted for</p><p>4.

Higher level of spend on national reform projects</p><p>6 Higher level of spend on service areas (Acute and Social Care)</p><p>7.

These are;</p><p><b>- Aging demographics: </b>The population in Ireland  over 65 years per the CSO census data has increased 54% since 1996. Both the numbers and the age profile within the over 65yrs are contributing factors. The number of the population aged 85 and over has increased 95% from 1996 to 2016 or over 32k (Source: CSO census).</p><p><b>- Increase in co-morbidities: </b>Due to the continuous improvements in health delivery more people are living longer with more illnesses, but they require increased ongoing support from the health system e.g. diabetes, dementia</p><p><b>- Regulation:</b>There are almost 1100 designated centres in disability services that require to be registered under the National standards for residential and respite for adults andchildren with a disability. There are 25 designated centres remaining to be registered by HIQA.  A significant element of the overrun has arisen following HIQA inspections of a designated centre and the recommendations for improvements required to be implemented prior to achieving registration.</p><p><b>- Emergency Residential Places: </b>The Community Healthcare Organisations prioritized 790 individuals in 2017 who require an immediate service response in terms of new residential placements to be provided to meet identified waiting list.  An analysis of the waiting lists highlighted the Death or Incapacity of the main carer which accounts for 29.5% of total cases. Such immediate priorities frequently lead to a bed-blocking situation in local respite services, which has the knock-on implication of reducing dramatically the overall quantum of respite available to non-residential service users within the CHO area. Almost two-thirds of required residential placements (65.5%) are for individuals who require supports to be delivered at high support staffing levels and frequently at 1:1 or above.  The majority of new placements are commissioned from private providers as there is minimal capacity available in the public system.</p><p><b>- State Claims Agency:</b>An actuarial assessment for potential claims under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme is prepared annually by the State Claims Agency and a determination is taken with regard to the level of funding that will be required by year end.As the year end position is an estimate it can come in under or over budget.  In the last few years it has come in over budget, this is typically due to settlement of cases prior to the courts closing at year end.  The increasing cost of settlements is determined by the court system and not within the remit of the health system.</p><p><b>- Drugs: </b>The main drivers behind this is the expenditure on new High Tech drugs, in areas such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatology, and cancer drugs, increased spend on drugs on the Long Term Illness scheme e.g. diabetes, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy and General Medical Services Drugs &amp;amp; Pharmacy costs.</p><p><b>Pensions: </b>Health is one of the few public services which has its pension costs reflected in its Vote; changes to pension rates, and the fact that pensioners are living longer hasresulted in a significant increase in the share of the health vote which is attributable to pensions.</p><p><b>- Pay</b>: The growth in both staff numbers, pay rate premia and underlying pay costs linked to Workplace Relations Commission agreements.</p><p>It is important to note that growth in health expenditure is a feature of all health systems and is not unique to Ireland.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key health service objective. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p>  <p>  Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the patch's only licensed use in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p>  <p>  Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where more plasters were being used in Ireland than in the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p>  <p>  From September 2017, following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant applies to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. If an application is refused, the clinician may submit an appeal, making a clear clinical case for the patient, to the MMP. Information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE MMP website at: hse.ie/yourmedicines.</p>  <p>  The decision to introduce a new reimbursement approval process is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The approach set out in the Plan included insourcing of surgical procedures in the Children's Hospital Group (CHG), and the broader public hospital sector, as well as outsourcing initiatives, including private providers nationally and abroad. </p>  <p>  In 2017, as part of the outsourcing initiative, families were offered the opportunity to have their child's surgery abroad. CHG advise that in total as part of this initiative 28 patients have had their treatment abroad and that arrangements have been agreed with services in the UK to undertake follow up reviews to ensure those children who received outsourced surgery in the UK receive appropriate follow up care as per the agreed protocol. This will include face to face outpatient clinics in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin, in addition to phone call and Skype follow up, if needed. These reviews are scheduled according to the patient's clinical care plan. </p>  <p>  This year a small number of families were offered the opportunity to have their child's surgery abroad but did not avail of the offer as they did not want to travel abroad. One child did have surgery abroad in 2018; this was a procedure that was due to have taken place in 2017, but which was deferred until 2018. </p>  <p>  The CHG advise that the &euro;9 m investment in paediatric orthopaedics this year, which includes scoliosis services, has already improved access for surgery and outpatient review. By September 2018 there had been a reduction of 26% in the waiting times experienced to access surgery since the start of the year. This year the CHG aims to deliver 446 procedures, compared to 371 in 2017, and 224 in 2016.  </p></reply>

The Ombudsman has met with me and my Department, as well as other stakeholders, in relation to this matter, and consequently has stated that there is a clear and absolute commitment from all involved to address the matter of scoliosis in the best interest of the children. </p>  <p>  While the most recent update welcomed the improvements in scoliosis services, the Ombudsman's August update also pressed for the need of continued action to address waiting lists for initial assessment, access to diagnostics, and increased treatment activity, and my Department continues to work with the Children's Hospital Group to ensure that these issues are addressed, that activity levels continue to increase, and that waiting lists are reduced. </p>  <p>  The CHG advise that the investment in paediatric orthopaedics this year, which includes scoliosis services, has already improved access for surgery and outpatient review.

I recently met with the CEOs of all hospital groups to discuss improving access for patients and requested that they work with the NTPF and HSE in 2019 develop innovative proposals to address the number of long waiters on outpatient lists in 2019. </p><p>In addition, the Central Waiting List Validation function, which was established in the NTPF last month, will deliver a standardised approach to validation across all hospitals in line with best patient-centred practices. This new function will have many benefits including the identification of patients on waiting lists who are ready and available to proceed with hospital care, the reduction in the Did Not Attend rate (DNA), and an improvement in information for managing waiting lists. The NTPF estimates that 30,000 patients who no longer require treatment will come off the outpatient waiting list in 2019 as a result of this activity. </p><p>The data on Outpatient waiting times in Naas General Hospital, sought by the Deputy is outlined below:</p><p>There are currently 8,131 patients on Outpatient waiting list in Naas General Hospital, and of these 55% are waiting 9 months or less.  1,042 patients on the Outpatient list have received an appointment date.</p><p>Specialties in Naas General Hospital, with high numbers of patients waiting include, Dermatology (1,576 ), General Medicine (1,894), Cardiology (1,284) and Orthopaedics (2,122).</p><p>Outpatient Waiting times in Naas General Hospital<table><tr><th>0-3 Months</th><th>3-6 Months</th><th>6-9 Months</th><th>9-12 Months</th><th>12-15 Months</th><th>15-18 Months</th><th>18+ Months</th><th>Total </th></tr><tr><td>2355 </td><td>1285 </td><td>860 </td><td>798 </td><td>605 </td><td>571 </td><td>1657 </td><td>8131 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

This is a result both of out-of-cycle smears, and also increased uptake generally. This has impacted turnaround times for results of smear tests.  The HSE also advises that every effort is being made to ensure that tests are processed as quickly as possible, having regard to the high standards required for testing. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE.  The recent agreements reached with the contracted labs include arrangements to address the backlog in testing. </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that smear tests are a screening and not a diagnostic process, and if any women is concerned or is experiencing any symptoms, she should consult with her GP.</p>  <p>  In addition to MedLab Pathology Laboratory, services for CervicalCheck are also provided by Quest Diagnostics in the USA and the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital in Dublin. Under the terms of their contract with CervicalCheck, MedLab can redirect tests to other laboratories within their group at times when they are experiencing increased demand. This includes The Doctors' Laboratory in London (TDL).</p>  <p>  As part of his Scoping Inquiry into CervicalCheck, Dr Gabriel Scally visited all laboratories which currently provide services for CervicalCheck, including TDL. His report was published on the website of my Department on 12 September. Dr Scally has stated that he is satisfied with the quality management processes in the current laboratory sites and found no reason, on quality grounds, why the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new HPV testing regime has been introduced. This provides very welcome reassurance for women in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I place a very high priority on women's health. I am committed to returning to Government within three months, as recommended by Dr Scally, with a full plan for the implementation of his recommendations. Development of this plan is underway, overseen by the CervicalCheck Steering Committee, which I established in June.</p></reply>

The number of patients waiting over 9 months has reduced from over 28,000 to under 19,200 in the same period equating to a 32% reduction. </p><p>In Budget 2019 the Government has further increased investment in this area, with funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to increase from &euro;55m in 2018 to &euro;75m in 2019. </p><p>In 2019, the NTPF plans to deliver 25,000 Inpatient Day Case treatments, building on the 20,000 procedures delivered in 2018. In addition, 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes will be carried out, bringing to 9,000 the additional scope activity provided by the NTPF since the start of 2018. Furthermore, 40,000 Outpatient appointments will be arranged as part of 2019 activity. It is expected that as a result of validation a further 34,000 patients will be removed from the waiting lists by the NTPF Central Validation Unit.</p><p>My Department is working closely with the NTPF and the HSE to finalise a coherent Waiting List Action Plan for 2019 before the end of this year. The priority of my Department is to maintain a seamless continuation of the considerable progress made this year into next year.</p><p>More broadly, the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy, which was published on 8th August 2018, provides the framework within which a system-wide reform programme will be advanced. It is a further step in the detailed implementation process for this programme and sets out four overarching goals and ten high-level strategic actions which will be the key focus for the first three years of the reform programme. At its core, the strategy focuses on establishing the building blocks for a significant shift in the way in which health services are delivered in Ireland.</p><p>The recent Budget provided an increase of &euro;1.05 billion in Health funding. This brings the health budget for 2019 to &euro;17 billion. This is the highest level of Health investment in the history of the State. This will allow the health service to meet additional demands due to the demographic pressure of a growing and ageing population. The additional funding provided as part of Budget 2019 will directly support a range of additional services including initiatives proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report and committed to in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.  <b></b></p></reply>

This decision was taken in the context of the need to provide reassurance to women in light of the media attention surrounding CervicalCheck. I am advised by the HSE that current CervicalCheck laboratory activity remains significantly above normal levels. This is a result both of out-of-cycle smears, and also increased uptake in the screening programme generally. This has impacted turnaround times for results of smear tests.  </p>  <p>  The HSE advises that every effort is being made to ensure that tests are processed as quickly as possible, having regard to the high standards required for testing. This is a priority concern for my Department and the HSE. </p>  <p>  Heads of Agreement have now been signed with the contracted labs to extend their contracts pending the introduction of HPV testing as the primary screening test, and these include arrangements to address the backlog in testing.  </p>  <p>  It is important to emphasise that smear tests are a screening test and not a diagnostic one, and if any women is concerned or is experiencing any symptoms, she should consult with her GP. </p></reply>

Investing in additional capacity, including beds and theatre space; the progression of recruitment and retention of staff; the delivery of the NDP project, including dedicated elective only hospitals and the ambitious reform agenda in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report will improve waiting times and access for patients.</p>  <p>  In the recent Budget the Government further increased investment to tackle hospital waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF to increase from &euro;55m in 2018 to &euro;75m in 2019. </p>  <p>  The latest Waiting list figures for September, published by the NTPF show that the number of patients on the inpatient and daycase waiting list now stands at 72,700.  This represents a 16% reduction in the overall number of patients waiting for an inpatient or day case procedure from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017. The number of patients waiting over 9 months has reduced from over 28,100 to under 19,200 in the same period equating to a 32% reduction.</p>  <p>  While the total numbers on the Outpatient waiting list continues to grow, a targeted approach by the HSE and Hospital Groups in late 2017 and into 2018 has impacted on the level of growth. The period January-September 2017 saw growth of almost 57,800 while growth has reduced to 14,800 in the same period in 2018. In addition, the NTPF is working closely with Hospital Groups inviting proposals to facilitate the trialling of funded interventions, and at the end of September had approved almost 12,700 outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  In addition, the recent Budget provided an increase of &euro;1.05 billion in Health funding. This brings the health budget for 2019 to &euro;17 billion.

The additional funding provided as part of Budget 2019 will directly support a range of additional services including initiatives proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Report and committed to in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.

Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services. The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p>  <p>  With regard to persons suffering from cancer and other serious medical conditions the HSE also has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to emergency situations i.e. in circumstances where persons are in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and also for persons in palliative care who are terminally ill. These medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant. With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are followed up with a full application within a number of weeks.   </p>  <p>  I would also like to note that since 1 July 2015, the HSE adopted the position that all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer are awarded a medical card.  This card is valid for a period of 5 years.</p></reply>

Preparations and planning for Winter 2018-19 are well advanced at hospital and local level. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to ensure that these local and regional plans are consolidated and supported through policies and plans at national level to ensure the most effective response to the winter challenges to unscheduled care provision.    </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2019, an additional &euro;10m in funding is being provided in 2018 to anticipate and manage critical demand pressures for health service, most particularly in respect of emergency pressures in the initial and latter parts of the year. This funding will focus on initiatives to enable the hospital system to de-escalate before Christmas.   Supporting patients in the over 75 age group will be a priority, with measures to respond to surge in demand with home support packages, transitional care beds, GP out-of-hours and aids and appliances to support the journey home of patients following a hospital stay.   </p>  <p>  I have asked that there be a significant uplift in the provision of social care measures to promote hospital discharging in the first quarter of 2019 in response to the expected surge in demand after the Christmas period.</p>  <p>  Improving access to health services is a key priority in 2019. In the first quarter of 2019, in the region of 80 additional beds will be brought on stream, including an additional 30-bed ward in Our Lady of Lourdes Drogheda, a 40-bed modular ward block in South Tipperary General Hospital, and four high dependency beds in the Mater and Cork University Hospital respectively.  In addition, the new ED planned for Our Lady of Lourdes Drogheda is due to open early in 2019.</p>  <p>  A further &euro;10 million will be invested next year to enable additional beds to be opened to alleviate pressure on Emergency Departments for Winter 2019/20 and the years ahead, on foot of the recommendations in the Health Service Capacity Review. The Department of Health will finalise the details of this investment, in consultation with the HSE. </p>  <p>  Minister Daly has established a Working Group to undertake an independent expert review of delayed discharges, which can impact on patient flow and ED performance. This Group is due to report back to him by October 2018.</p></reply>

There are now 124 PCCs in operation, with another 83 sites at various stages of development from early planning to construction.  </p>  <p>  I have visited many of these centres and have seen first-hand the excellent work being undertaken and the myriad of services being delivered to communities.  PCCs help to support the interdisciplinary delivery of care and can enable the seamless and joined up provision of care to patients.  In addition to the core GP, nursing and therapy services delivered by Primary Care Teams, a range of additional services are available from PCCs, including child health developmental clinics, counselling services, oral health care, diabetes clinics and much more besides.  I would also note that a number of  Community Intervention Teams operate from primary care centres. </p>  <p>  In addition, the centres can facilitate community engagement and participation through the provision of meetings rooms or group spaces, while the centres also fulfil a key role in terms of facilitating meetings and training for HSE and other public service staff.  Clearly, the range and scale of services being provided by and within PCCs is helping to bring care closer to home and is having a positive impact on patient health.  The effective utilisation of PCCs will be integral to the future organisation and operation of community-based services envisioned by Sl&aacute;intecare. </p></reply>

No. 261 of 2008 &ndash; European Communities (Health of Aquaculture Animals and Products) Regulations 2008: These Regulations give effect to Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals.  </p>  <p>  - S.I. No. 290 of 2013 &ndash; European Union (Birds and Natural Habitats) (Sea-fisheries) Regulations 2013: These Regulations provide for Fisheries Natura Plans for wild fisheries that may impact on Natura 2000 sites, the appropriate assessment of those plans, a process of public and statutory consultation and for the Minister to accept, reject or amend such plans.  It provides powers for the Minister to control fishing via a permit system and Fisheries Natura Declarations and further provides for offences and penalties.  </p>  <p>  - Fisheries Natura Declaration No. 2 of 2018 (Mussel Fishing): This Declaration makes conditional and prohibits fishing for mussels in a number of Natura 2000 sites around the Irish coast. </p>  <p>  - Fisheries Natura Declaration No. 1 of 2017 (Castlemaine Harbour): This Declaration sets restrictions on the fishing of mussel seed in Castlemaine Harbour. </p>  <p>  - SI 369 of 2018 &ndash; Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction (Mussel Seed) (Opening of Fisheries) Regulations 2018: Statutory instruments are used to allow or prohibit fishing for mussel seed.

Ireland&rsquo;s contingency and preparedness planning is well advanced. Government has launched a new Getting Ireland Ready public awareness campaign, with information on the Government&rsquo;s latest preparedness and support measures.  Outreach events have already taken place this month in Cork, Galway and Monaghan, with a further event to follow in Dublin (25 October).</p>  <p>  I am hopeful that progress can be made in the short-term on both the Ireland-Northern Ireland back-stop and on the framework for the discussions on the future EU-UK relationship, so that they can be incorporated into a Withdrawal Agreement that will provide for a transition period.    </p>  <p>  Some mitigation measures are already in place while future potential measures have been identified.  The implementation of these measures will depend on the outcome of the negotiations. </p>  <p>  The Government has introduced a range of measures to deal with the short-term impacts of Brexit.  In terms of dealing with Competitiveness issues, my Department introduced a &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme and increased funding under the Rural Development and Seafood Development Programmes in the 2017 Budget.  In Budget 2018, I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, introduced a new &euro;300m &ldquo;Brexit Loan Scheme&rdquo; to provide affordable, flexible financing to Irish businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or who will be in the future - at least 40% of which will be available to seafood businesses. </p>  <p>  I have followed up these measures with further initiatives as part of Budget 2019, which contains a &euro;78 million Brexit package for farmers, fishermen, food SMEs and to cover additional costs in my Department.  &euro;7 million has also been provided to support Brexit preparedness work within my Department, namely, to meet the staffing and IT costs associated with the additional import control and export certification requirements arising from Brexit.   </p>  <p>  In line with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-coordinated  &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to Brexit, my Department is planning for an orderly Brexit which involves, inter alia, a transition period.  It is very welcome that the European Council has proposed that the whole of the EU acquis - including the Common Fisheries Policy - will apply to the UK during the transition.</p>  <p>  Our enterprise agencies are continuing to work with seafood companies to help them to deal with Brexit through making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. </p>  <p>  In recent months, I have continued to have positive, regular meetings with my European colleagues, especially those from the group of 8 Coastal Member States whose fisheries are potentially most impacted by the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  I am also working closely with key stakeholders in the Irish fishing industry and am pleased at the level of unity on these key issues.  The results of my engagement with the Barnier Task Force, in close collaboration with the T&aacute;naiste are evident in the agreed EU position on fisheries. </p>  <p>  My priority has been, and remains, to maintain existing levels of access to waters and resources.  However, in a worst case scenario of a disorderly departure in March 2019 those reciprocal arrangements could be endangered.  Such issues could not of course be dealt with in isolation from the overall scenario of a disorderly Brexit and any measures taken would have to be carefully considered by ourselves in partnership with relevant Member States, the Task Force and stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The actual agreement on a future relationship can only be finalised and concluded once the UK has become a third country, that is, after it leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.  This is why a status quo transitional arrangement is so important.  </p></reply>

Farmer participants attend group meetings and produce a Farm Improvement Plan in consultation with their KT Facilitator.

The Plan provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </p>  <p>  In January of this year the government published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Adaptation Framework which represents our national policy response to the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change. Seven Government Departments, with responsibility for twelve priority sectors, are currently preparing sectoral adaptation plans for submission to Government for approval by 30 September 2019 in line with the requirements of the Climate Act 2015. </p>  <p>  Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan (NDP) will be on climate action and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.</p>  <p>  My Department is also working closely with other relevant Departments and Agencies on the preparation of a National Energy and Climate Plan. This work has, in turn, been informed by work undertaken to prepare the Energy White Paper, the National Mitigation Plan, National Adaptation Framework and National Development Plan. An initial consultation on the preparation of Ireland's draft National Energy and Climate Plan is taking place from 9 October until 12 November. I intend that the draft Plan, once completed, will be the subject of a separate public consultation.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the Climate Act 2015, the Government must also prepare and submit to the Oireachtas an Annual Transition Statement. In support of this written Statement I, as well as other relevant Ministers, intend to provide an oral report to each House. This process ensures that responsible Ministers are directly accountable to the Oireachtas to ensure real progress is made in reducing emissions in their respective sectors. I expect to be in position to lay the 2018 Annual Transition Statement before the Oireachtas shortly.</p></reply>

This network includes 77 fast chargers, mainly on national routes. A map showing the locations of charging points throughout Ireland is available at .There are currently charging posts at three locations in Mullingar. As each charging post consists of two charging points, this gives a total of six charging points in the town. In addition, there are fast charging stations located nearby on the N4 near Ballinaleck, the M6 near Kilbeggan and the M4 near Johnstown Bridge.  Fast chargers are vital to overcome &lsquo;range anxiety&rsquo; and are generally focussed around the national road network.  </p><p>A key aspect of the work of the Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, involved examining how best to support the development of the electric vehicle charging.

Research indicates that rental properties are twice as likely to be E, F or G rated on the Building Energy Rating (BER) scale. However, rental properties present a particular challenge in terms of energy efficiency upgrades owing to the split incentive issue.  A split incentive occurs where landlords meet the cost of improvements, while tenants would reap the benefit, so neither party is motivated to upgrade the dwelling. This is why there is currently under-investment in improving the energy performance of rental properties. </p>  <p>  Grants for energy efficiency, funded by my Department and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), are already available to landlords. Improving the energy efficiency of rental properties will deliver multiple benefits, including improved living conditions and health outcomes, enhanced asset value and reduced energy bills. However, in identifying the appropriate policy interventions the priority has also been to ensure that the approach taken to address energy poverty will  also not adversely impact the housing supply situation. </p>  <p>  To find a way forward that supports action in the two critical policy areas of energy poverty and housing supply, options for improving energy efficiency in the rental sector will be consulted on as part of the new Long Term Renovation Strategy. Ireland must produce a new Long Term Renovation Strategy under the new EU Energy Performance in Buildings Directive and the consultation process for this must start in early 2019.</p></reply>

These Department are the Department of Justice and Equality; the Department of Children and Youth Affairs; the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation; the Department of Health; the Department of Education and Skills; and my own Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. </p>  <p>  The actions contained in the plan cover a range of activities including education and awareness raising, communicating with the public, putting in place robust oversight and consultative structures, and legislative measures.</p>  <p>  Action 20 provides for the establishment of a National Advisory Council for Online Safety which will provide advice to Government on online safety policy issues, identify emerging issues where Government intervention may be warranted, and provide input into the eventual renewal of the Action Plan. The Council&rsquo;s membership is drawn from key stakeholder groups, including industry and NGOs. </p>  <p>  Action 17 provides for the implementation of the revision to the Audio Visual Media Services Directive, which has been negotiated for the past two years in Brussels and the text of which will be finalised and published in November 2018. Member States will be required to put in place by means of co-regulation, a method of ensuring that Video Sharing Platform Services (VSPS) established in their jurisdiction have specific measures in place to ensure that users, but especially minors, are protected from harmful content.</p>  <p>  Much work remains to be done on the definition of a VSPS, including the issuing by the European Commission of detailed guidance on how the definition should be interpreted by Member States, and the nature of the co-regulatory system to be established. These issues are being examined in the context of the preparations of the implementation of the revised Directive, which is required to be implemented 21 months from the date of its publication.</p>  <p>  My Department will conduct a public consultation on how Ireland should approach the implementation of the revised Directive in the coming months.</p></reply>

Measures are carried out by SEAI in the basis of the findings of surveys of each home and the scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures at no cost to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, who meet the defined eligibility criteria. Measures currently available under the scheme include attic and wall insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets and low energy light bulbs, single glazed window replacement and heating system replacement. The measures are carried out free of charge.</p>  <p>  In reference to the case raised by Deputy Shortall, officials in my Department have been in contact with the SEAI and I have been informed that the applicant applied for the Scheme and had a survey carried out on 7 February 2018. I understand that the surveyor, on the day of initial inspection, explained the results of this survey to the applicant.  Upon receiving a subsequent complaint from the applicant, SEAI carried out a review of the applicant&rsquo;s survey to ensure all recommendations were correct at the time of survey.  The applicant was then contacted by phone on 31 May 2018 by SEAI and was informed that the survey recommendations were correct. </p>  <p>  SEAI operates a dedicated Customer Service helpline (1850 250 204) for the general public that can also answer queries in relation to application status and provide updates to homeowners.</p></reply>

Today more than, 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>- The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>- The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>- The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p><p>There are 290 premises in the townland of Ballygarvan, Co Cork referenced by the Deputy. 61 (21%) fall within the AMBER area and will be served under the State led Intervention. 192 (66%) of premises are in a BLUE area and are or will be served by commercial providers, while 37 (13%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be served by eir's planned rural deployment. </p><p>The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage with evaluation ongoing of the final tender received on 18 September. The Taoiseach has asked Mr. Peter Smyth, the independent process auditor to the NBP procurement to review the process. Mr. Smyth will submit a report to the Taoiseach and to me as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment within three weeks. This review will take place in parallel to the evaluation being carried out by the Department&rsquo;s procurement team on the final tender for the plan.</p><p>In April 2017, my Department signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide high speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at . A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website www.dccae.gov.ie.</p><p>Data for Q2 2018 submitted by eir to my Department indicates that the company had passed some 175,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. </p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements.</p></reply>

This was done to support the introduction of a new compliance scheme for tyres and waste tyres from 1 October 2017. The new full compliance scheme to deal with Ireland's chronic waste tyres problem, which is operated by Repak ELT with a registration and reporting role for the Producer Register Limited (PRL), is funded by a visible Environmental Management Cost (vEMC) on the sale of new tyres. The new compliance scheme provides the assurance to drivers and consumers that their old tyres will be disposed of responsibly by the retailer when they buy new tyres. </p><p>At that time, the Minister also indicated that he would look at the issue of old tyres on farms and &euro;700,000 was recently allocated to remove tyres from farms. Irish Farm Film Producers Group (IFFPG), the national farm plastics recycling compliance scheme, agreed to undertake the removal of tyres from farms through 4 bring centres around the country. The collections, which were chosen because they represent a good geographical spread, took place as follows: </p><p>- Cootehill Mart, Co. Cavan (29 September)</p><p>- New Ross Mart, Co. Wexford (9 October)</p><p>- Athenry Mart, Co Galway (13th October) and</p><p>- Gort Drum Mines, Monard, Co. Tipperary (20th October)</p><p>In total, approximately 4,253 tonnes of tyres were collected from these bring centres and the &euro;700,000 budget was fully expended.</p></reply>

These Directives also include rules on how Member States should monitor, assess and manage ambient air quality.</p><p>Under the Directives, EU Member States must designate &quot;zones&quot; for the purpose of managing air quality.  For Ireland, four zones were defined in the Air Quality Standards Regulations, 2011. The zones in place in Ireland in 2017 are Zone A: the Dublin conurbation; Zone B: the Cork conurbation; Zone C: comprising 23 large towns in Ireland with a population of more than 15,000; and Zone D: the remaining area of Ireland. Ireland currently has a nationwide network of 33 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants in the four zones. This information is delivered to the public in near real-time at www.airquality.epa.ie. The numbers and locations of the monitoring equipment for each pollutant are determined by the requirements of the Directives for ambient air monitoring in each zone. </p><p>Following a review by the Environmental Protection Agency of air quality monitoring and information provision in Ireland, a decision was taken to develop a new Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme (AAMP) which aims to enhance and build on current arrangements. One of the key objectives of the programme is to enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. The AAMP will more than double the capacity of ambient air quality monitoring in Ireland by 2022, and enhance the provision of real time air quality data to the public. My Department has committed funding of some &euro;5 million over the lifetime of the programme. </p><p>The new programme is progressing well.

In this context, the apology made by Tusla to the McCabe family is the least that could be expected.</p><p>I have written and spoken to the Chair of Tusla about the findings of the Tribunal and I will be meeting the Board of Tusla shortly to underline the need to address these and other serious shortcomings in Tusla, as identified by the report. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in March 2017, as a result of what had come to light in respect of Sgt McCabe and his family, I directed HIQA to carry out a separate statutory investigation into Tusla.  This report was published in June 2018.  </p><p>In September 2018, I received the Action Plan from Tusla's Board to address the findings from the HIQA investigation.  The implementation of this plan will also address many of the findings in the Disclosures Tribunal report. </p><p>Tusla has stated that it is addressing the findings in the Disclosures Tribunal report by:</p><p>- Reorganising and improving management and governance arrangements;</p><p>- Introducing a dedicated specialist team to manage retrospective abuse;</p><p>- Increasing supervision of the staff involved;</p><p>- Increasing quality assurance of policies on the ground.</p><p>Tusla has accepted that the practice and governance in this case was exceptionally poor and has commenced a HR process around the management of this case.  It is expected that this process will be completed in due course.</p><p>The Government has increased funding to Tusla by over &euro;30 million for 2019, which will enable these and other reforms to take effect.</p></reply>

The CCA plan establishes regional frameworks to provide outcome-focused alternatives for young people in residential or foster care, or those who may be at risk of admission to care. </p>  <p>  Following this process, in June 2018, Tusla made a decision not to renew its Service Level Agreement (SLA) with the organisation in the Galway/Roscommon area, referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the current Agreement, the organisation in question is contracted to provide a support service to 18 young people in need in the Galway/Roscommon area.  The young people are assigned an advocate that will work with them over a 6 month period. </p>  <p>  Tusla has advised that it is of the view that the organisation referred to by the Deputy does not meet the needs of high-risk young people, particularly those who require long-term intervention that is provided by professionally qualified staff. </p>  <p>  Tusla's CCA plan for the Galway/Roscommon was informed by a detailed analysis of the demographic profile of the area, rates of referrals to Tusla social workers and family services teams, and a financial analysis.  The CCA plan is also aligned with Tusla's key strategies, including its Commissioning Strategy, Prevention Partnership and Family Support (PPFS) Strategy, and Child Protection and Welfare Strategy.</p>  <p>  Tusla has also advised me that the decision to suspend the SLA with the organisation referred to by the Deputy was communicated to its CEO and Director of Services on 28 June, 2018.  A further face-to-face meeting was held in September 2018 and no change was made to the earlier decision.</p>  <p>  It is good practice for Tusla to review its services on a continuous basis, including the work carried out by Tusla staff in the Galway/Roscommon area through its CCA plan.  This may include, but does not necessarily require, input from third-party organisations that are commissioned by Tusla to provide services.</p>  <p>  Tusla will continue to work with the organisation to which the Deputy refers until the end of 2018, which is in line with the SLA signed by both parties.</p></reply>

The Department is continuing to work with the telecommunications providers to ensure that new infrastructure is targeted at the areas most in need. </p>  <p>  It was not envisaged that the data gathered through this exercise would be published due to the constantly changing nature of the information.  However, through another action in the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce report, ComReg intends to publish a composite national coverage map by the end of the year. This will allow consumers to check which mobile phone operator can provide the best coverage in their area. </p>  <p>  ComReg meets my Department on a quarterly basis to provide an update on the progress of this action and has stated that all relevant data has now been collected from the mobile operators and the composite map is currently being developed. </p>  <p>  In addition, a Focus Group was established earlier this year by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to provide guidance with respect to categories of location where high quality reliable mobile coverage should be made available as a priority. The report of the Focus Group was published in August 2018 and sets out a ranked list of categories of location where high quality mobile coverage should be available. It also recommends the level (in terms of quality and reliability) of coverage needed for these locations with respect to mobile voice and data services.</p></reply>

The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders. The draft standard was published on 6 June 2018 for public consultation and ran for a period of six weeks to 18 July 2018. The Technical Committee have finalised the review of the submissions received and it is expected that the standardised protocol will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p>The draft standard, I.S. 465 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials, outlines a protocol which will be used to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite. Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks to help decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.</p><p>This standard:<ol type="1"><li>establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of deleterious materials (free or unbound muscovite mica, or aggregate with potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite);</li><li>describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem;</li><li>describes the scope of any testing required; and</li><li>categorises buildings, in accordance with this Standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.</li></ol>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference.  Engineers Ireland has provided assurance that they will collaborate with the Department, the NSAI and others on measures to establish such a register once the standardised protocol is in place.</p><p>Last year, I visited Donegal and Mayo and met with key stakeholders, including affected homeowners, elected members and officials of the local authorities and other interested parties. On 18 December 2017, I again visited Donegal and met with key stakeholders to provide an update on the progress to date.  I made a similar visit to Mayo on 26 January 2018 and again to Donegal on 13 July 2018. </p><p>I will be in a position to provide a further update following the publication of the standardised protocol in the coming weeks.</p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government approved in principle the development of a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowners in the two counties to carry out the necessary remediation works to dwellings that have been damaged due to defective concrete blocks.</p><p>The putting in place of such a scheme is now a key priority for my Department and work is well underway on the development of such a scheme, with a view to its completion as soon as possible and funding being available in 2019.</p></reply>

Irish Water&rsquo;s primary function is to provide clean safe drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment.  Irish Water takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements.</p><p>The first ever Water Services Policy Statement, prepared in line with the Water Services Acts, which was launched on 21 May 2018, outlines a clear direction for strategic planning and decision making on water and wastewater services in Ireland, identifying key policy objectives and priorities for the period to 2025.  The Statement sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of Quality, Conservation and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans.  It will provide the context within which necessary funding and investment plans by Irish Water will be framed and agreed.</p><p>On foot of publication of the Water Services Policy Statement, Irish Water prepared a &lsquo;Strategic Funding Plan&rsquo; setting out proposed operational and capital expenditure.  Subject to its approval by me as Minister, the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan 2019-2024 will ultimately feed into annual Exchequer decisions on spending and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Based on this Strategic Funding Plan, Irish Water&rsquo;s next Capital Investment Plan for the five year period from 2020 to 2024 will set out the financial plan for capital investments to support Irish Water&rsquo;s strategic objectives to deliver improvements to water services.</p><p>I, as Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, must provide consent for all commitments for capital expenditure above &euro;20m.  </p><p>Irish Water is regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as the independent economic regulator. The CRU is responsible for setting the total level of revenue which Irish Water can receive, through Government subvention and from customers, to cover its efficiently incurred costs. This CRU process involves, inter alia, reviewing submissions from Irish Water, including on its investment plan, and thereafter setting appropriate revenue allowances for operating costs, capital costs and other items for given regulatory periods. Consequently, the actual allowed operational expenditure and capital investment is decided by the CRU.</p><p>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email to <i>oireachtasmembers@water.ie</i>or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

The scheme is one of a suite of measures available to local authorities to bring vacant properties back into use. Since the national roll out, my Department has been working intensively with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHB's) to develop and implement the scheme. There have been a number of national and local press advertising initiatives, as well as targeted online promotion, in an effort to ensure that property owners who can benefit from the scheme are aware of the benefits.</p><p>Data for Donegal County Council for end Q2 2018, is set out in the table. My Department is currently gathering data from local authorities in order to report progress in Quarter 3. <table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>Number of Applications Received end Q2 2018</th><th>Number of Lease Agreements Signed end Q2 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Donegal County Council</td><td>60 </td><td>0</td></tr></table></p><p>Feedback from local authorities indicates that in many cases properties requiring extensive repair work and therefore not suitable for the RLS, have been secured under the Buy and Renew Scheme which facilitates local authorities or AHB's to purchase vacant properties for social housing use.</p><p>It was clear from end 2017 output, that RLS has not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged. The operation of the scheme was reviewed, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and it was concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective. Accordingly, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes were being made to the scheme.</p><p>These include:</p><p>- a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;</p><p>- increasing the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and </p><p>- provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. </p><p>National data for RLS up to end Q2 2018 has shown an increase in the number of applications although given the lead in time of at least 6 months for most applications, it is probable that the true impact of the recent changes to the scheme will not become apparent until towards the end of the year. Over recent months, local authorities have indicated that the changes have been well received by property owners. </p></reply>

Housing authorities do not provide or oversee services specifically designed for victims of domestic violence. </p><p>Victims of domestic violence who seek emergency accommodation from a housing authority are generally placed in temporary accommodation which the council itself arranges or which is operated by a voluntary service provider. It is not necessary for such persons to go on the general housing waiting list to avail of short-term emergency housing. Such support can be provided where victims of domestic violence meet the homeless definition set out in the Housing Act 1988, which is not prescriptive and in practice will generally include victims of domestic violence. </p><p>Where victims of domestic violence require continued State support to meet their housing needs, housing authorities are encouraged to work with all service providers to ensure that a victim&rsquo;s housing eligibility and need is assessed in a timely manner.  This assessment is carried out in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, which includes a review of the suitability of the household&rsquo;s current accommodation having regard to a number of considerations, including whether the accommodation is &ldquo;an institution, emergency accommodation or a hostel&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;particular household circumstances&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional medical or compassionate grounds&rdquo;.  This allows a housing authority to consider a victim of domestic violence as having a housing need, and to be placed on a housing list where all other criteria are met. </p><p>The allocation of social housing support to qualified households is a matter for individual housing authorities in accordance with their allocation schemes made under section 22 of the 2009 Act.  Each housing authority is required to make an allocation scheme specifying, among other things, the manner of, and the order of priority for, the allocation of dwellings to households and classes of households on the waiting list.  Households defined as homeless are generally afforded priority in allocation schemes. Allocation schemes may also contain provisions for exceptional or emergency cases, allowing immediate housing outside of normal waiting list priorities, should circumstances warrant it. </p><p>In line with commitments in Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness(Action 1.8) and the National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 (Action 2.30), my Department has issued guidance to all housing authorities in relation to assisting victims of domestic violence with emergency and long-term accommodation needs. The guidance can be accessed using the following link to my Department&rsquo;s website:</p><p><i>. </i></p><p>The purpose of this guidance is to ensure an effective and consistent housing response for victims of domestic violence. The guidance covers a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence in seeking social housing supports, including provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the <i>Rental Accommodation Scheme</i>, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support.</p></reply>

Individuals with a housing need, who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP and avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent. At the end of Quarter 2 2018, over 37,750 tenancies were being supported by the HAP scheme, including over 9,000 additional households in 2018.   </p>  <p>  The Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies. The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 3,000 households being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme at end Q2 2018. </p>  <p>  The Place Finder Service will assist households in emergency accommodation primarily by providing access to deposits and advance rental payments. These elements are the core financial supports now being made available nationally. Local authorities have the option to enhance this service, if required, through their homeless services by assigning dedicated staff to provide assistance in:  </p>  <p>  - seeking out potential properties suitable for households currently identified as homeless;  </p>  <p>  - liaising with specific households to establish their specific needs;  </p>  <p>  - establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords; and,  </p>  <p>  - supporting those homeless households to exit emergency accommodation and secure a tenancy. </p>  <p>  Local authorities, including the DRHE, are promoting the scheme locally, and engaging with letting agents and landlords who might be interested in entering into a HAP tenancy. </p>  <p>  Where a local authority decides to enhance the Homeless HAP service beyond the financial assistance provided by my Department, the arrangement, management and oversight of the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service, including any contractual matters that may arise with relevant third parties, is a matter for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  The DRHE, in conjunction with my Department, has put in place an incentive for estate agents whereby, should they make suitable properties exclusively available to homeless families through the Place Finders team within the DRHE, and not advertise them on letting websites or elsewhere or hold reserved viewings for homeless families in emergency accommodation, then, after five properties have been secured in this manner, a payment of &euro;500 per property plus VAT will be made to the agent, following the submission of the appropriate paperwork. A further &euro;500 per property can be made for the sixth and any subsequent properties secured in this manner, provided the agent formally invoices the DRHE for each payment.</p>  <p>  The DRHE, and local authorities more generally, do not make payments in cash.  </p></reply>

The increased provision of PBSA was established as a key priority in addressing the current wider housing crisis.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills through the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Student Accommodation in examining the issue of student housing and potential policy measures to increase accommodation supply. This Group, which includes stakeholders from the Higher Education Institutes, Union of Students in Ireland and other Government Departments, highlighted important issues in developing new student accommodation projects, including the planning and development finance aspects in assembling new development projects.</p>  <p>  The work of this Group contributed directly to the initiation of reforms in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 which provided for the fast-tracking of planning applications for student housing construction projects of greater than 200 bed-spaces to An Bord Plean&aacute;la (which commenced on 3 July 2017). In addition, the legislation provides for the availability of low-cost financing from the Housing Finance Agency to the Higher Education Institutes specifically to support the delivery of new student accommodation projects.</p>  <p>  My Department also fed into the preparation of the National Student Accommodation Strategy which was launched by the Department of Education and Skills in July 2017 &ndash; a specific action committed to under Rebuilding Ireland. This policy document was developed with input from the key stakeholders in the sector and includes eight key targets and 27 actions to support the delivery of an increased supply of PBSA.</p>  <p>  These and other measures by my Department have assisted in delivering a significant increase in the level of PBSA projects coming forward nationally.</p>  <p>  Recent analysis from the Higher Education Authority has indicated that, by September 2018, over 5,500 bed-spaces had been delivered since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland and some 4,800 further bed-spaces are currently under construction nationally. </p>  <p>  In addition, over 7,900 bed-spaces have received planning permission but are yet to commence construction. The scale of this level of additional student accommodation should exert a downward pressure on the cost of such accommodation, through availability of supply and competition.</p></reply>

In the period to end September 2018, &euro;715 million has been invested in social housing construction projects.  </p><p>In addition, funding of almost &euro;68 million has been provided to local authorities under my Department's Voids Programme.

However, if the Deputy is concerned about a specific local authority or local authorities, I will have the matter explored further on receipt of the relevant information.</p><p>However, insofar as the social housing construction programme is concerned, my Department now publishes, on a quarterly basis, a comprehensive status report of all social housing construction schemes for all local authority areas showing details such as their locations, a range of information relating to their advancement, including those delivered and those progressing through planning, design and construction. The most recent of these reports covers the period up to the end of Quarter 2 2018 and lists 1,067 approved social housing construction schemes, delivering over 16,300 homes. The report can be accessed at the following link: <i></i>. Further project approvals are being added to the construction programme as projects are developed by local authorities and approved housing bodies. </p><p>More broadly, a total of &euro;1.4 billion was expended in 2017 on the implementation of the full range of housing programmes, which resulted in the delivery of social housing solutions for almost 26,000 households.  In 2018, investment of &euro;1.9 billion is being provided for housing and this was increased further in Budget 2019 with almost &euro;2.4 billion being provided for housing programmes next year.</p></reply>

As one of the policy aims of this scheme was to incentivise the construction of additional housing units, it is aimed solely at new-build and self-build properties.</p><p>While there are no grants available from my Department for this purpose, first-time buyers who are having difficulty in accessing finance through a commercial lender may be able to qualify for mortgage finance under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. This scheme was launched on 1 February 2018 following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan.</p><p>The loan enables credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range. The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first-time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise have been able to afford at a higher interest rate. </p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is targeted at first-time buyers who wish to own their own home, have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home. As with the previous local authority loan offerings, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first-time buyers only.  This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources.</p><p>Full details of the loan&rsquo;s eligibility criteria and other information are available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website<i>.</i></p><p>In addition to this, work is on-going towards increasing the availability of affordable housing in the areas of the country most affected by a lack of affordable housing supply. The Government has committed &euro;310 million to support this programme of work, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), as part of Budget 2019.  In 2019 funding of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund with a further &euro;142 million in 2020 and &euro;68 million in 2021. The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent.</p><p>Once the funding is awarded and the infrastructure is provided I expect delivery of affordable homes from 2019 onwards. Separately, all local authorities will now carry out an economic assessment of the requirement for affordable housing in their area, and the authorities&rsquo; capacity to deliver housing at affordable prices from their sites. Based on this analysis further local authorities may be considered for funding under the SSF.</p><p>I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis some 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated.  In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, under the recently commenced provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out more generally. Under the 2009 Act, the maximum discount is 40% of the market value of the home and the local authority takes a charge, equivalent to the discount, against the property, which the household must recoup at re-sale or during the charge period. The funding repaid by the purchaser is paid into a new Affordable Dwellings Fund which can then be used to fund more affordable housing. The scheme applies to new homes, and is targeted at single applicants earning up to &euro;50,000 per annum or &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.</p></reply>

In the first instance, it is a matter for local authorities to bring forward viable and appropriate development proposals. Of course, it is also a matter for each local authority to manage its own finances in a prudent and sustainable manner.  In this context, I understand the Housing Finance Agency works with individual local authorities to find the most efficient way of dealing with each authority's outstanding loans. </p>  <p>  The Land Aggregation Scheme was introduced in 2010 to assist in the gradual unwinding of loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme where loans were due to mature and where it was considered unlikely that land would be developed in the short to medium term. </p>  <p>  An initial appraisal of the sites submitted by local authorities was carried out by the Housing Agency, as well as a due diligence assessment.  Applications to the value of some &euro;163 million in loans were accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme. &euro;111 million of loans were fully redeemed and the remaining &euro;52 million are being recouped in the form of annuity loans. I understand that the site at Mount Avenue was accepted under the annuity arrangements. </p>  <p>  Local authorities were advised of the discontinuance of the Scheme, in respect of new applications, in 2013.  Notwithstanding this, my Department is committed to supporting local authorities to realise new social and affordable homes from their lands without delay.  Sites that are not suited for a full social housing development may be more suited to a mixed-tenure development including social, affordable and perhaps private housing. </p>  <p>  There is funding available to support local authorities in terms of the delivery of social and affordable housing from their own lands. Next year, &euro;2.4 billion will be invested in housing and over the four years to the end of 2019, &euro;6.6 billion will have been provided. </p>  <p>  It is important that local authorities identify the most appropriate development proposals for each site, taking all of the available funding into account. For example, I understand that the site at Mount Avenue was approved for funding of &euro;3.3m under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) for the provision of an access road which will support the initial development of 200 homes, with a potential for up to 1,200 homes on the wider lands. </p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities further to prepare their sites  for affordable housing specifically, the Government recently committed under Budget 2019 to provide &euro;310 million under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF). A first call for proposals under the Fund issued to local authorities in Dublin; the Greater Dublin Area (including Louth); Cork and Galway in June 2018, with a closing date for applications of end August.  Fifteen proposals were received from nine local authorities under this first call and are currently being assessed.  I expect this assessment process to be finalised and an announcement of the first successful bids to be made in the coming weeks.  While Louth County Council did not make an application under the first call, further calls for proposals will be made and it will be open to the Council to submit applications at that stage if it considers it appropriate.</p></reply>

The HSE operates under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  As Minister with policy and legislative responsibility for fire safety and the provision of fire services by local authorities, my primary concern, as set out in the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, is that local authority provided fire services are meeting their statutory obligations in respect of provision of fire services and fire safety. These responsibilities include the important activity of community and other fire safety initiatives as well as response to 999/112 calls. </p>  <p>  In general, there is a high degree of collaboration and co-ordination of emergency activity among the Principal Emergency Services. In some circumstances, the HSE&rsquo;s NAS calls for assistance from fire services in responding to certain categories of 999/112 emergency calls. Such calls are typically in respect of, but not limited to, ECHO (life threatening) emergencies. As well as being able to call on Community First Responders, the NAS is aware that many fire services are equipped with automatic external defibrillators and have trained their fire-fighters in Cardiac First Responder and Emergency First Responder to Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council standards. Fire services are so equipped and trained in the first instance to ensure the health and safety of their own staff, but can also use their skills and equipment where they encounter casualties at emergency incidents. </p>  <p>  Fire services generally respond to calls for assistance from external bodies in accordance with protocols operated within the three fire services Regional Communications Centres. </p>  <p>  The feasibility of fire services (outside of the Dublin Fire Brigade area of operations) being commissioned by the HSE to provide a response service in support of the NAS in responding to ECHO emergency calls was discussed at national level at the Fire Services National Oversight &amp;amp; Implementation Group (FSNOIG), which consists of fire service management and staff representatives. FSNOIG produced a discussion document which could potentially be used as the basis to underpin discussions with the Health sector. The document was discussed at the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management meeting of 18 July 2018.</p>  <p>  Any proposal for formalising such assistance needs to be subject to appropriate governance, cost reimbursement arrangements and to be set in the context of a service agreement with the HSE/NAS which will not impact on or adversely affect fire services' primary roles. It would be important in such circumstances to ensure that local authority and fire services' resources are not diverted from their statutory fire service and fire safety responsibilities, where they are providing assistance for another public body. The potential impact on the current Community First Responders schemes would also have to be assessed.  </p>  <p>  As responsibility for the provision of emergency medical services, including pre-hospital emergency care, rests with the HSE, it would be more appropriate to engage with my colleague the Minister for Health in the first instance to advance proposals in this regard.</p></reply>

In July of this year, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade presented a comprehensive Memorandum to the Government on Brexit Preparedness and Contingency Planning.  On the basis of this Memorandum, Departments were tasked with developing detailed action plans to prepare for Brexit.</p>  <p>  My Department is contributing to this process and contingency planning is well advanced.  The priorities include assessing any potential impacts on housing and our other areas of responsibility.  This is necessarily an iterative and ongoing process, monitoring the progress of the negotiations and working to mitigate the impact of Brexit, and my Department will continue to work closely in this regard with other Departments through the established structures.</p></reply>

Details in relation to build targets on a local authority basis for 2018, can be accessed on the Rebuilding Ireland website at: </p><p><i><i>.</i></i></p><p>Targets are reviewed annually and following Budget 2019, the number of social housing homes to be delivered in 2019 under Rebuilding Ireland is as follows: <table><tr><th>Rebuilding Ireland Targets</th><th>2019</th></tr><tr><td>New build</td><td>4,982</td></tr><tr><td>Part V</td><td>1,260</td></tr><tr><td>Voids</td><td>303</td></tr><tr><td>Total: Build</td><td>6,545</td></tr><tr><td>Total: Acquisition</td><td>1,325</td></tr><tr><td>Total: Lease</td><td>2,130</td></tr><tr><td>Total: Build, Acquisition and Lease</td><td>10,000</td></tr><tr><td>RAS</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>HAP</td><td>16,760</td></tr><tr><td>Total </td><td>27,360</td></tr></table></p><p>My Department is supporting local authorities in the provision of new build social housing through a range of different initiatives, including the construction of social homes on their own lands, construction delivery in conjunction with Approved Housing Bodies and also, local authorities are working in partnership with private developers to deliver social housing construction through turnkey arrangements. </p><p>Through this range of supports, local authorities now have substantial pipelines of new build social housing projects approved, details of which can be seen in the  Quarter 2 2018 Construction Status Report, which is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link: <i>.</i></p><p>The Construction Status Report includes construction schemes being delivered through a range of different programmes including turnkey projects. The latest report shows that 381 turnkey projects with 5,164 units are at different stages of planning, construction and completion under the Rebuilding Ireland Plan, with more coming on stream over the remainder of the period to 2021. These projects are being delivered as part of the overall Build Programme and as such no specific targets are set for delivery of turnkeys.</p><p>While the management of the social housing delivery programmes is a matter for individual local authorities, my Department has set the targets across the period 2016-2021 and is working closely with all stakeholders to accelerate delivery and further expand pipelines. </p><p>In relation to Part V delivery, output details for the period 2013-2017 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>. </i></p><p>My Department does not track commencements of Part V schemes specifically but additional overall statistical information on Part V delivery to end Q2 2018 is available at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Agreements on Part V arrangements are a matter for local authorities. The current options available to local authorities for Part V delivery are:</p><p>- the transfer of ownership of land, subject to the planning permission application, to a local authority for the provision of social housing remains the default option as is currently the case. The land option must be acceptable to the local authority, as well as the developer; </p><p>- the building and transfer of ownership to the local authority, or persons nominated, of completed social housing units on the site subject to the planning permission; </p><p>- the transfer of ownership to the local authority, or persons nominated, of completed social housing units on other land; </p><p>- the Part V obligation can now be fulfilled by developers through long term leasing of properties; and</p><p>- a combination of the options above.</p><p>It should be noted that the delivery of build, turnkey and Part V homes are funded as part of the overall social housing delivery programme. While it is not possible to disaggregate on a year by year basis the expenditure on turnkey and Part V social housing homes, analysis of Part V units delivered in 2017, under the Social Housing Capital Investment Programme, indicates an average cost of approximately &euro;194,500. In terms of local authority social housing homes commissioned through turnkey developments under Rebuilding Ireland, the average cost is approximately &euro;233,000 per unit.</p><p>The total expenditure for the various housing programmes for 2013 to 2017 was as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Funding (&euro;)</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>579.9 million</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>585.4 million</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>761.7 million</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>942.7 million</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>1.408 billion</td></tr></table></p><p>The total allocation for housing in 2018 is &euro;1.9 billion which will meet the housing needs of 25,500 households in 2018. Of the 25,500 housing supports, almost 8,000 new social homes will be delivered in 2018 through build, acquisition and long term leasing programmes.</p><p>The total budget for the delivery of housing programmes in 2019 will be &euro;2.4 billion, which will see the housing needs of almost 27,400 households being met. The funding for housing programmes for 2020 and 2021 will be determined, in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p></reply>

It is expected that the scheme will be completed in the third quarter of 2019.  </p>  <p>  With regard to penalty clauses, publicly funded construction contracts are regulated by the conditions of contract known as the GCCC Forms of Contract published by the Office of Government Procurement.  A requirement of the contract is that the Employer must make a pre-estimate of its loss or damages in the event of non-completion by the due date, which is included in the tender documents. It is a matter for the local authority concerned as the Employer and a contracting party to comply with the requirements of the contract. The Employer should deduct such damages from money due to the Contractor, in the event of non-completion by the due date, unless this date is extended for reasons set out in the contract. Responsibility for complying with the conditions of the contract rests with the two contracting parties, i.e. the local authority and the Contractor. </p></reply>

It is designed to leverage private capital for investment in small scale conservation projects across the country and to support the employment of skilled conservation professionals and tradespeople. I have allocated funding of &euro;2m in total for this Scheme in 2018. In 2017 and 2018 a total of &euro;100,000 was provided in grant aid under this scheme for 28 projects in County Kildare. </p>  <p>  The Structures at Risk Fund enables conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration. I have allocated &euro;1.3m for the Structures at Risk Fund nationally in 2018. Over the course of 2017 and 2018, a total of &euro;119,000 was allocated to 5 projects in County Kildare under this scheme. Details of the projects approved under both funding schemes are published on my Department&rsquo;s website and on local authority websites.</p>  <p>  In terms of future funding, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018 &ndash; 2027 represents a major capital investment scheme of &euro;1.2 billion in funding over the next 10 years, as part of Project Ireland 2040. This plan will see increased investment in protecting and celebrating our built heritage across the country. More details on the commencement and completion dates for projects and programmes, as well as the timing of the expenditure in relation to them, will emerge as we go through the process of appraisal and planning as required under the Public Spending Code.</p>  <p>  The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  It is primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports.  Grant schemes are advertised by the Heritage Council on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie.</p></reply>
