In terms of boosting the supply of housing more broadly, the Government is investing nearly &euro;300m in enabling infrastructure to open up key residential sites for early development, has streamlined planning systems through An Bord Plean&aacute;la for large-scale housing developments and also updated guidance to provide more flexibility in the design and siting of apartments.   Development finance is also to be  made available under the &euro;750m Home Building Finance Ireland initiative and policy reforms such as the vacant site levy have been introduced to deter the hoarding of land and encourage early development.</p>  <p>  In addition, the new Land Development Agency will bring together both public and private sector interests to deliver up to 150,000 new homes over the next 20 years, and will have access to capital funding of up to &euro;1.25 billion to assist it in fulfilling its mandate.</p>  <p>  All housing activity indicators continue to show encouraging trends, with almost 19,500 new residential construction commencements notified in the year to end-July 2018, up 17% year-on-year, and planning permission granted for some 26,700 new homes in the year to end June 2018, up 39% year-on-year.</p>  <p>  Progress on the different targets under Rebuilding Ireland is kept under regular review and I meet with all housing stakeholders regularly to discuss progress. While the housing system was badly damaged in the downturn and is taking time to correct, I am confident that full implementation of the comprehensive set of actions laid out in Rebuilding Ireland will result in a sustainable housing system that can meet the current and future needs of the population, with consequential wider social and economic benefits.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-27a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092700052#WRB01300"><p>The Cork boundary alteration is the most significant local government boundary alteration to be undertaken since the foundation of the State. The change, which will see a population increase in the city of some 83,000, will drive sustainable economic growth and strengthen Cork's position as Ireland's second city and an &ldquo;economic engine&rdquo; for the wider southern region, with implications for business development, population growth, housing provision and associated infrastructure.</p>  <p>  The Local Government Bill 2018 published in July 2018 provides for the boundary alteration and also for the establishment of the Cork Oversight  Implementation Committee, with general responsibility for overseeing the alteration of the boundary between the respective areas of jurisdiction of Cork City Council and Cork County Council. This will be undertaken in accordance with a detailed implementation plan  and the aim will be  to ensure, as far as possible, that such arrangements are progressed effectively throughout the implementation process. Responsibility for the detailed planning and implementation of the reorganisation process rests primarily with the local authorities, subject to guidance and oversight by the Oversight Committee and compliance with the implementation plan.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the non-statutory Cork Implementation Oversight Group has been working consistently with both authorities to prepare for the transition. Both authorities have dedicated teams in place and are engaging with an independent transition Manager as part of this process. </p>  <p>  While the boundary alteration and transfer of local authority jurisdiction will take full legal effect in mid-2019, the legislation provides appropriate flexibility in relation to operational arrangements so that transfer of practical responsibility for certain functions can proceed on a more gradual basis, as necessary, to allow time for organisational changes to be completed.</p></reply>

As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and on-line on its website. </p>  <p>  Following enquiries made by my Department with both Galway City and Galway County Councils, I understand that they are both continuing to undertake the necessary preparatory and site assessment work before entering sites on their registers.</p>  <p>  In relation to implementation of the levy provisions generally, on foot of a review of the on-line registers, I understand a total of 16 planning authorities have populated their vacant site registers with over 280 sites, of which over 160 were on registers on 1 January 2018 and in respect of which the levy can be applied in January 2019.   </p>  <p>  My Department has actively engaged with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy in order to ensure a consistent application of the levy provisions across all city and county areas and to facilitate the sharing of best practice. My Department has provided guidance and advice and also organised three separate information seminars for local authorities, most recently on 1 May 2018.  My Department will continue to engage proactively with local authorities to ensure the vacant site levy achieves its full potential.</p></reply>

The focus is on areas where increasing house prices and rents have created a significant affordability gap for first-time buyers and for those wishing to rent, those being Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow, Louth, Galway City, Cork City and Cork County.  With the local authority contribution, &euro;100 million will be allocated in total under the Fund.

The DRHE is responsible for the planning, co-ordination and administration of funding in relation to the provision of quality services to people who are homeless in the Dublin area, and for the development of responses to prevent homelessness. </p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, particularly Homeless HAP, is a significant mechanism used by the DRHE to transition qualified households from emergency accommodation into private rented tenancies. The HAP Place Finder service is a targeted support for homeless households who may it difficult to secure HAP tenancies. Between February 2015 and end June 2018, more than 3,600 households were supported by the scheme.</p>  <p>  The operation of the DRHE and its engagement with property owners to secure appropriate accommodation is a matter for the local authority in the first instance. As part of its day-to-day operations the DRHE may engage with property owners, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, to establish whether additional units are available which could be used to successfully meet the housing need of many families who would otherwise have to enter or remain  in emergency accommodation. </p>  <p>  The HAP scheme has specific rent limits for each local authority. The DRHE, in recognition of the difficulty homeless households face in sourcing and securing properties in a highly competitive rental market, have discretion to go 50% above the prescribed rent limits.

This included an analysis of the financial impact of the Eurostat decision to reclassify the majority of Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) as part of the local government sector. This was an important first step in the Government's assessment as to the impact of the Eurostat decision. </p>  <p>Following the SPU, further work has been on-going in order to fully assess the implications of the reclassification decision. My Department is continuing to engage with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, with technical support from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) and the Housing Agency (HA), in order to ensure that AHBs can continue to fulfil their full potential in the delivery of the targets set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan  .</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the AHB sector and constructive discussions have taken place with representative bodies from the sector on the issue. The sector itself has engaged its own research on the matter, and my Department is evaluating that research as part of its ongoing wider consideration of the issue.</p>  <p>  The AHB representative bodies have committed to continue to undertake further research and analysis into this issue over the coming months. This will assess the options available to create the necessary conditions to allow this classification decision to be revisited in the future. An important part of this exercise will be to examine what measures could be taken to develop the AHB sector in such a way so that it could be reclassified as being off the Government&rsquo;s balance sheet in the longer term.</p>  <p>As previously noted, the Government continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland  . It is committed to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that we maintain the momentum towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target under the Action Plan.</p></reply>

Individuals with a housing need, who in the past were reluctant to avail of full time work as they would lose their Rent Supplement support, can now move to HAP and avail of full-time work and retain their housing support, with an adjustment in their differential rent.</p>  <p>  HAP has been rolled out on a statutory phased basis since September 2014 and became a national scheme on 1 March 2017 when the nationwide rollout was completed. The phased nature of the HAP roll-out has allowed for significant learning, with new HAP authorities benefitting from the experience of those authorities where the scheme has been previously operational.</p>  <p>  At the end of Quarter 2 2018, over 37,750 tenancies were being supported by the HAP scheme, including over 9,000 additional households in 2018. There are now 21,000 separate landlords and agents currently in receipt of monthly HAP payments.</p>  <p>  As HAP is a social housing support and consequently households are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.</p>  <p>  In addition, guidelines on inter-authority movement were introduced in 2017, to allow for local authorities to facilitate movement of HAP households in cases where a tenant, currently on a local authority waiting list, wishes to access rented accommodation with HAP support in another local authority area, subject to conditions.</p>  <p>  In relation to specific HAP supports available to homeless households, the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service operating in the Dublin local authorities, and in Cork City Council, is a targeted support for homeless households who are finding it difficult to secure HAP tenancies. The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 3,000 households being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme at end Q2 2018. A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017.</p>  <p>  In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service is now available to each of the 31 local authorities, with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP Scheme.</p>  <p>  I continue to keep the operation of HAP under review but I am currently satisfied with how the scheme is operating and I consider it to be a key vehicle for meeting current housing need and fulfilling the ambitious programme set out in Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

Harnessing private investment remains an important element in the overall delivery of social housing, including through supporting local authorities in meeting the needs of households on their waiting lists.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the cost comparisons set out in the review, it remains the case that it would not be possible to deliver the same number of social housing homes in higher value rental areas exclusively through capital funded build and acquisition programmes.  This will continue to be an important consideration in the context of the future availability of capital funding and the resourcing and capacity required to escalate local authority build and acquisition programmes to the level required to meet the current level of social housing need. </p>  <p>  In relation to there being a greater emphasis on construction and acquisition, it should be noted that of the 50,000 social housing homes to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland out to 2021, 33,500 of these will be built and 6,500 of these will be acquired. In addition to these 40,000 social housing homes that will be built or acquired, a further 10,000 homes will be leased under long term leasing arrangements and a further 87,000 households will have their housing need met through HAP and RAS.  </p>  <p>  Clearly, it is important at this time that a blended approach to the delivery of social housing homes is pursued in order to deliver and provide immediate housing supports to those households on local authority waiting lists across the country. Earlier this week, I published the 2018 Summary of Social Housing Assessments, which shows that there are 71,858 households on local authority social housing lists, a reduction of 13,941 or 16.2% on the last assessment in June 2017. The findings of the IGEES review highlight the need for a blended approach to delivery at this time in order to meet urgent housing need and are consistent with the planned evolution of the composition of the social housing programme over the years ahead under Rebuilding Ireland.</p></reply>

Furthermore, public bodies, such as local authorities and the Housing Agency, engaging with the LDA in relation to their lands will also be in a position to condition their release for development to reflect their own policy requirements.</p><p>Therefore, complying with the Government's new public lands affordability requirement above, the LDA will be capable of progressing a significant level of both Affordable Purchase Scheme based and cost rental-based projects on lands forming part of its portfolio of sites, working within the broader policy framework for the delivery of affordable housing set by the Government.</p><p>In line with the general internationally accepted principle that households should not be spending more than a third of their income on housing costs, and using similar maximum gross income thresholds to the new affordable scheme (i.e. &euro;50,000 for single-income and &euro;75,000 for two-income households), my Department is working with the LDA to ensure that it can deliver housing for both purchase and rental purposes within such parameters.  </p><p>In relation to affordable homes for purchase, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan sets a maximum value of homes that can be bought/built at &euro;320,000 in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork and Galway cities, and &euro;250,000 elsewhere in the country.</p><p>A maximum dual-income threshold under the new Affordable Purchase Scheme is set at &euro;75,000 (which would enable a first-time buyer to afford repayments of around 35% of net income on a 90% LTV mortgage, using the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, of around &euro;285,000), enabling an overall maximum house purchase price of &euro;320,000.</p><p>Analysis of projects supported under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund indicates that, on just under three-quarters of all 30 sites funded, there will be homes available to purchase for less than &euro;320,000 (at today&rsquo;s prices).  <b></b></p><p>In relation to affordable rental delivery, my Department believes that, in line with the public lands affordability requirement mentioned above, the availability of such public lands at low or no cost to underpin cost rental projects, including those progressed by the LDA, would be capable of delivering rents at around 20% below comparable market rates in the area, but this will vary, depending on the development potential of a given site, costs of providing site  infrastructure, etc.</p><p>In addition, the LDA will have to demonstrate and report on how it is meeting the policy requirements under Part V and the new public lands affordability requirement, using the range of relevant affordable schemes and mechanisms. </p><p>It should also be noted that where public lands are being sold and developed by other market operators including private developers, these same affordability requirements will apply.</p></reply>

The scheme is one of a suite of measures available to local authorities to bring vacant properties back into use. Since the national roll out, my Department has been working intensively with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to develop and implement the scheme. There have been a number of national and local press advertising initiatives, as well as targeted online promotion, in an effort to ensure that property owners who can benefit from the scheme are aware of the benefits.</p><p>A detailed breakdown of the RLS data up to end Q4 2017 is set out in the following table:</p><p><table><tr><th>LA</th><th>Number of Applications Received end Q4 2017</th><th>Number of Agreements to Lease Signed end Q4 2017</th><th>Number of Properties Operational end Q4 2017</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>20</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>25</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>11</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>65</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>52</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County</td><td>63</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>91</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>49</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>18</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>15</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>31</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>40</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>SDCC</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>45</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>106</td><td>14</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>22</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>33</td><td>10</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>820</td><td>31</td><td>9</td></tr></table></p><p>While the current figures for RLS are low, it should be remembered that this is a new scheme which was only rolled out to local authorities at the end of February last year. </p><p>It was clear from end 2017 output, that RLS has not yet delivered the level of new social housing homes envisaged. The operation of the scheme was reviewed, as part of the review of Rebuilding Ireland, and it was concluded that the scheme has significant potential but there are areas where it can be improved to make it more attractive and effective. Accordingly, from 1 February 2018, a number of key changes were being made to the scheme. These include:</p><p>- a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years;</p><p>- increasing the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and</p><p>- provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bed-sit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards for Rented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. </p><p>Data up to end Q2 2018 has shown an increase in the number of applications although given the lead in time of at least 6 months for most applications, it is probable that the true impact of the recent changes to the scheme will not become apparent until later in the year. Over recent weeks, local authorities have indicated that the changes have been well received by property owners. </p><p>A detailed breakdown of the RLS activity in 2018, on a local authority basis, up to Q2 2018 is set out in the following table:</p><p><b>Table: RLS Q1 and Q2 2018</b><table><tr><th><div>LA</div></th><th><div>No. of applications received</div></th><th><div>Number of Agreements   to Lease Signed</div></th><th><div>Number of Properties   Operational</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>19</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>DLR</td><td>17</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway City</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway County</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>22</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>SDCC</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>4</td><td>33</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>45</td><td>2</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>217</td><td>60</td><td>22</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In terms of timing, and to ensure the optimal outcome from any such meeting, it would be important that the financial modelling on all the options is completed and the report submitted to my Department for review before the meeting takes place.  </p>  <p>  For my part, I have made it clear to the Council that direct Exchequer funding will be provided for any social housing element of this mixed-tenure development.</p></reply>

Local authorities generate income from a variety of sources including commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from Central Government.  Across all schemes and funding programmes, my Department provided a total of &euro;1.26bn to local authorities in 2015, &euro;1.45bn in 2016 and &euro;1.849bn in 2017.  My Department works closely with all local authorities to ensure the local government sector can meet existing and emerging challenges.</p>  <p>  In terms of local authority staffing, my Department oversees workforce planning for the local government sector and has agreed and approved workforce plans with each of the individual local authorities.  Since 1 January 2014, my Department has received 876 housing-related staff sanction requests from local authorities, 861 of which have been approved.</p>  <p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities, for which he or she is responsible.  In this regard, it is a matter for each Chief Executive to ensure that staff are optimally deployed to ensure that appropriate service levels are provided.  It is within the remit of the Chief Executive to reassign staff between programme areas to meet emerging demands and it is clear that local authorities have increased staffing numbers in their Housing Departments to deliver on increased demands.</p>  <p>  The accelerated delivery of housing, including social housing, is of critical importance to this Government.  My Department has recognised the need to support local authorities in their efforts to increase both capacity and output in this regard. In addition to substantial capital and current funding provided under Rebuilding Ireland, my Department is providing a range of staff related supports including:</p>  <p>  Local authorities have designated Vacant Homes Officers, to act as a central point of contact and to provide information and advice for owners of vacant homes and to deal with queries from members of the public in respect of private residential vacant properties in their administrative area.  My Department has provided funding for each local authority (&euro;50,000 per annum, for a period of two years (i.e. a total of &euro;100,000 to each local authority for 2018 &amp;amp; 2019) to support the work of the Vacant Homes Office.  This provision of central funding will allow for focus to be given to the role of the Office in establishing a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of their Vacant Homes Action Plans and will reinforce the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority.  The Vacant Homes Office is expected to play a key role in the co-ordination of this work within the local authority.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year my Department advised local authorities of arrangements for the appointment (where required) of a dedicated staff member to provide assistance in seeking out potential properties; establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords; and supporting those homeless households to exit emergency accommodation and secure a tenancy.  An allowance towards the staffing cost of this officer is recoupable from the      Department via the homeless services (&lsquo;Section 10&rsquo;) recoupment arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and a range of different leasing schemes funded by the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) all provide local authorities with administrative payments in respect of new households entering the schemes and for certain on-going monitoring and management expenses.  The purpose of these payments is to recognise the resources required by local authorities in respect of the set up and management of tenancies under these programmes.</p>  <p>  Local authority in-house professional services assigned to the delivery of new capital funded social housing build projects can be recouped from my Department at a percentage of the approved tender cost, with the actual percentage depending on the services provided.  Services covered include architectural and other design team professional services, contract monitoring and management and the assigned certifier role.</p></reply>

HAP plays a vital role in housing eligible families and individuals. At end Q2 2018, there were more than 37,700 households having their housing needs met via HAP and over 21,000 landlords and agents in receipt of HAP payments.</p>  <p>  In respect of the provision of HAP funding, Limerick City and County Council provides a highly effective HAP transactional-shared service on behalf of all local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Accordingly, my Department does not recoup individual local authorities in respect of HAP rental payments in their administrative areas but rather recoups all landlord costs via the HAP SSC.</p>  <p>  The amount of funding which has been paid to landlords for HAP tenancies for the past 12 months (1 September 2017 to 31 August 2018) is &euro;295 million. The HAP scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies. It is important to note that the landlord payment combines the tenant contribution (differential rent paid) and the exchequer contribution.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme by &euro;149m to &euro;301 million. This will allow for the continued support of existing HAP households and also enable the additional 17,000 households targeted under Rebuilding Ireland to be supported by HAP in 2018.</p></reply>

This Order was made under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971. </p><p>The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.</p><p>The LDA has a number of financing options available to it, including direct funding by the LDA from its own capital, the deployment of third-party capital or a combination of both. </p><p>Significant preparatory work is required in relation to the initial portfolio of eight sites and as part of this process, funding structures will be devised on a case by case basis, taking account of the scale of each project, value for money for the State, risk and pace of delivery.</p><p>To enable more delivery of social and affordable homes on public lands, the Government has, in parallel with the establishment of the LDA, approved a new affordability requirement in relation to publicly owned lands, whereby a minimum of 30% of any housing developed must be reserved for affordable purposes in addition to the 10% statutory social housing requirement under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, whether such development is being progressed by the LDA or any other market operator. Furthermore, public bodies, such as local authorities and the Housing Agency, engaging with the LDA in relation to their lands will also be in a position to condition their release for development reflecting their own policy requirements.</p><p>Therefore, complying with the Government's new public lands affordability requirement above, the LDA will be capable of progressing a significant level of both Affordable Purchase Scheme based and cost rental-based projects on lands forming part of its portfolio of sites, working within the broader policy framework for the delivery of affordable housing set by the Government.</p><p>In line with the general internationally accepted principle that households should not be spending more than a third of their income on housing costs (e.g. rent or mortgage), and using similar maximum gross income thresholds to the new affordable scheme (i.e. &euro;50,000 for single-income and &euro;75,000 for two-income households), my Department is working with the LDA to ensure that it can deliver housing for both purchase and rental purposes within such parameters.  </p><p>In relation to affordable homes for purchase, the Rebuilding Ireland Home loan sets a maximum value of homes that can be bought/built at &euro;320,000 in the Greater Dublin Area, Cork and Galway cities, and &euro;250,000 elsewhere in the country.</p><p>A maximum dual-income threshold under the new Affordable Purchase Scheme is set at &euro;75,000 (which would enable a first-time buyer to afford repayments of around 35% of net income on a 90% LTV mortgage, using the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, of around &euro;285,000), enabling an overall maximum house purchase price of &euro;320,000.</p><p>Analysis of projects supported under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund indicates that, on just under three-quarters of all 30 sites funded, there will be homes available to purchase for less than &euro;320,000 (at today&rsquo;s prices).  <b></b></p><p>In relation to affordable rental delivery, my Department believes that, in line with the public lands affordability requirement mentioned above, the availability of such public lands at low or no cost to underpin cost rental projects, including those progressed by the LDA, would be capable of delivering rents at around 20% below comparable market rates in the area, but this will vary, depending on the development potential of a given site, costs of providing site  infrastructure, etc.</p><p>In addition, the LDA will have to demonstrate and report on how it is meeting the policy requirements under Part V and the new public lands affordability requirement, using the range of relevant affordable schemes and mechanisms.</p><p>The LDA is in the process of commencing feasibility, planning and other preparatory works on its sites immediately, with construction envisaged to be commencing on the first homes in 2019 for delivery in 2020, with progress ramping up in line with an overall business plan which is also being advanced as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

Central guidance for housing developments is set out in my Department's publication 'Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities' which is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>. </i></p><p>This advises, inter alia, that good quality, sustainable housing development should be socially and environmentally appropriate, where the mix of dwelling type, size and tenure should support sound social, environmental and economic sustainability policy objectives and contribute to the integrated development of the areas in which they are located.</p><p>This guidance also recommends that in the case of social housing, the mix of dwellings should have regard to the need to achieve a balance in home types, sizes and tenure, but should be based primarily on the results of the most recent assessment of housing need and the characteristics of households likely to be accommodated in the scheme.</p><p>I consider that this guidance is appropriate and logical and will contribute to the long-term, sustainable development of communities. In applying this guidance, local authorities or AHBs are not prohibited from developing new schemes of any particular size where they are working within the guidance on sustainable communities. The current portfolio of projects under development includes a wide range of different sized schemes.</p><p>A key determinant of the scale of new social housing developments is the consideration of such proposals by elected members of local authorities, through the planning process.  I hope that they will continue to support the advancement of such projects by their councils at the required speed and scale.</p></reply>

When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided over the next four years to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  At this point, applications for funding under the Serviced Sites Fund have been received in my Department and are currently being assessed.</p></reply>

The standardised protocol will inform the course of action in relation to remedial works for all affected householders. The draft standard was published on 6 June 2018 for public consultation and ran for a period of six weeks to 18 July 2018. The Technical Committee are currently in the process of considering the submissions received with a view to publishing the final standardised protocol shortly.</p><p>The draft standard, I.S. 465 - Assessment, testing and categorisation of damaged buildings incorporating concrete blocks containing certain deleterious materials  , outlines a protocol which will be used to assess and categorise the damage in properties where the concrete blocks are suspected to contain the minerals mica or pyrite. Previously, there was no common way for engineers or homeowners to assess the damage caused by defective concrete blocks to help decide what, if any, remedial work could be carried out.</p><p>This standard:</p><p>1.  establishes a protocol for assessing and determining whether a building has been damaged by concrete blocks containing certain excessive amounts of deleterious materials (free or unbound muscovite mica, or aggregate with potentially deleterious quantities of pyrite);</p><p>2.  describes methods for establishing the extent of the problem;</p><p>3.  describes the scope of any testing required; and</p><p>4.  categorises buildings, in accordance with this Standard, providing competent persons with guidance on the appropriate measures to be taken.</p><p>With regard to Recommendation 2, my Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland in relation to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for homeowners/affected parties&rsquo; reference.

It draws together all of the strands of ongoing work in one document with a clear vision for progressing the return of vacant homes to use over the next few years.</p><p>The Strategy acts as an overarching roadmap and a focal point for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives right across Government to ensure that we are using our existing housing stock to the fullest extent possible, aiming to return as many recoverable vacant properties back to viable use as possible, increasing the supply of sustainable housing, while also revitalising the vibrancy of local communities.</p><p>While the Strategy has only recently been published, my Department and local authorities have already been very proactive in dealing with vacant properties and there are a number of schemes available to incentivise the return of suitable dwellings into the liveable housing stock. </p><p>We are regularly considering new and improved ways of reducing the number of vacant residential dwellings. While the initial national roll-out of the innovative Repair and Lease Scheme did not yield the level of response hoped for, improvements have been made to the scheme with the intention of increasing interest from those who wish to bring their vacant property back into use. We will continue to review all initiatives with a view to offering the best incentives to those who wish to bring homes back into use. </p><p>In tandem with the incentives and schemes available centrally, the website was developed by Mayo County Council in July 2017 on behalf of the local government sector to serve as a central portal for individuals to anonymously log possible vacant homes and alert local authorities so that they can follow up with the registered owners, with a view to ascertaining the potential for bringing these homes into productive use for residential purposes.</p><p>The latest statistics from the site indicate that in excess of 2,000 properties have been registered as vacant to date, with the breakdown by province being Leinster 53%, Munster 30%, Connaught 14% and Ulster 3%. Mayo County Council has informed my Department that it is also getting increased interest from property owners in relation to the updated Repair and Lease Scheme.</p><p>Local authorities have been asked to provide information regarding vacancy to the Department's Vacant Homes Unit on a quarterly basis, with material due to be submitted shortly, which will allow for further analysis of the work being undertaken at a local level in respect of vacant residential property.</p><p>The analysis undertaken by the Central Statistics Office on the number of houses connected to the ESB grid also provides some useful information on the number of vacant dwellings that have been reconnected after two or more years.  The CSO&rsquo;s latest data for Q2 2018 shows that since the start of 2016, over 6,400 vacant homes have been brought back into use across the country, adding to the significantly increasing number of new homes connected to the grid for the first time.

In addition, the NPF represents a long-term strategy for Government Departments, State agencies, State-owned enterprises, regional and local authorities and others to support communities to achieve their potential for economic, social and infrastructural development through a shared set of strategic objectives and key principles.</p><p>As a strategic document, the NPF is currently being given further and more detailed expression at the regional level through preparation, by the Regional Assemblies, of statutory Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs) for the three Regional Assembly areas. The RSES process formally commenced earlier this year and draft Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies are currently in preparation for public consultation later in the Autumn.</p><p>The finalisation of these regional strategies in the first half of 2019 will in turn prompt reviews and updates of individual county and city development plans to ensure strategic co-ordination and consistency between national, regional and local levels.</p><p>To assist in the preparation of these important plans, my Department published the Implementation Roadmap for the National Planning Frameworkin July 2018. Appendix 2 of this document provides details on transitional regional and county population projections for 2026 and 2031. </p><p>These projections take account of the fact that, cumulatively, current city and county plans are based on post-2006 population projections and provide for a quantum of significantly greater population growth than previously occurred and that also exceeds any likely scenario identified as part of the NPF/NDP preparation process. </p><p>The transitional regional and county population projections provided in the Roadmap set a growth trajectory approximately mid-way between what is currently proposed for in statutory development plans and a more evidence-based nationally coherent scenario to 2031 and 2040. </p><p>The Implementation Roadmap is available to view on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The RSES process, and the subsequent individual county/city development plan reviews, must address the growth of each region in accordance with the overall parameters set out in the NPF. The transitional population projections provided in the Roadmap are part of these parameters. The review process is intended to strengthen the settlement strategy within counties in light of more relevant and updated population projections whereby towns with capacity will be enabled to continue their logical planned growth within a coordinated county-wide strategy.</p><p>Regional and local decision-making at the appropriate level is also provided for through the approach above to shape how the development of all parts of the country can be assured and guided through to 2040, including in the matter of ensuring that housing is provided at appropriate locations across the country and in line with infrastructural and service availability in place and planned for those locations. </p></reply>

As part of the process the Housing Agency has been liaising and in direct contact with all the relevant local authorities to discuss the demand requirements and to co-ordinate the response to NAMA.  Where a demand is identified, this information is provided to NAMA and efforts are made to secure as many of the suitable properties as possible for social housing.  This process is ongoing and demand has been confirmed by the local authorities for 2,717 of the properties to end June 2018.</p><p>The properties under consideration are part of the security for loans that NAMA has acquired.  In the majority of cases, properties remain in the ownership of the original borrowers.  The remaining properties are controlled by receivers appointed by NAMA.

The provisions involved include power for the imposition of sanctions on landlords in breach of the legal requirements and power for the RTB to investigate without the need for a complaint to be made.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the RTB to appropriately resource and develop its capacity to implement tenancy law. The proposed new powers for the RTB are a crucial first step in expanding its overall role and function as part of a multi-annual change management programme to proactively enforce tenancy law. The RTB publishes its quarterly Rent Index and advises my Department on the residential rental market on a continuous basis which informs policy development in this area.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in the drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill and I hope to bring the Bill to Government in the coming weeks for approval to publish.</p></reply>

The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. Members of the Permanent Defence Force have received the pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  </p>  <p>  In addition in 2017, following negotiations with PDFORRA improved pay scales were implemented for general service recruits and privates, who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the Agreement. The first increase due from 1 January 2018</p>  <p>  has been paid to Permanent Defence Force personnel and a second increase is due to be applied from 1 October 2018. Further increases are scheduled for 2019 and 2020. </p>  <p>  By the end of the current Public Service Pay agreement (end 2020), the pay of all public servants (including members of the Defence Forces), earning under &euro;70,000 per annum, will be restored to pre FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled in the agreement.</p>  <p>  New entrants to the Defence Forces will also benefit from the measures which were recently announced in relation to amendments to the pay scales for new entrant public servants recruited since January 2011. </p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission was established to provide objective advice to Government in relation to Public Service remuneration policy.  In 2017, under my direction, the Department of Defence brought issues of recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces to the attention of the Public Sector Pay Commission (PSPC). As a direct result of that initiative the PSPC is conducting an in-depth evidence based examination of those issues. </p>  <p>  The Department of Defence has provided data as requested by the PSPC for consideration. The Commission's work is on-going. The Department of Defence will continue to engage with the Public Service Pay Commission throughout the process and will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations that arises from the work of the Commission.</p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of aid to the civil power and civil authorities.  The Defence Forces at all times keep operational plans under constant review and there will continue to be ongoing close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including through regular coordination and liaison meetings.</p>  <p>  In respect of the border, the potential implications in this regard will continue to emerge during the course of the negotiations. It is the Government's stated goal to try to ensure that the current on-island border arrangements are maintained to the greatest extent possible.  The Brexit negotiations are ongoing and all parties - the EU, Ireland and the UK - agree that there should be no return  to a hard border and as such no need for border checkpoint infrastructure or personnel on the land frontier.  In this regard, the Irish Government notes Prime Minister May's clear statement on Friday that she will fulfil her commitment of last December for no return to a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Defence Forces training is designed to enable Defence Forces personnel address all potential calls on them arising from changes in the security situation on island within the framework of any roles assigned to them by Government, including aid to the civil power and aid to the civil authorities.  Prudent planning in relation to all security situations which may require a Defence Forces response is part and parcel of the day to day operations of the Defence Forces and, as such, is addressed within existing resources. </p>  <p>  Should a situation arise beyond the contingent requirement for Defence Forces deployment already provided for in the Defence vote, this will be addressed in the normal course within the budgetary discussions on defence funding.</p></reply>

The promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy. Ireland works closely with Human Rights Defenders to protect the work they do and to promote the value of civil society space. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights sets out that every person has the right to freedom of opinion and expression. This means that people are free to hold opinions without interference and may share these opinions through the media without fear of reprisal.   In light of Mr Thirumurugan Gandhi&rsquo;s arrest, I have requested that the Irish Embassy in New Delhi raise this case with the EU Office in New Delhi. In general, it is more effective if we raise concerns through the EU rather than bilaterally. I can assure the Deputy that Embassy New Delhi will continue to take an interest in the case and that I have requested to be kept informed of developments.</p></reply>

This campaign aims to provide information to citizens on the current state of play of the negotiations, the work going on across Government to prepare for Brexit, as well as the comprehensive range of financial and other supports that are available for business and other key affected sectors. Our revamped Brexit website, is a key source of information on Brexit preparedness for citizens and businesses, as are the websites of other relevant Government Departments and agencies.As part of this campaign, a series of whole-of-Government Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public outreach events are being planned for across the country. The first phase of these events will begin on 5 October in P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Chaoimh in Cork. This will be followed by events in Galway on 12 October, Monaghan on 19 October and Dublin on 25 October. These events will showcase the extensive work of the Government&rsquo;s Departments and agencies, bringing together this experience and expertise in a &lsquo;one stop shop&rsquo; for citizens and businesses in particular.</p><p>Work to prepare Ireland for Brexit has been well underway across the Government and its agencies since before the UK even voted to leave the EU. These public outreach events provide an opportunity for interested individuals and businesses, including in the agrifood and tourism sectors, to access advice and information about Brexit preparedness and the range of support measures and resources the Government has put in place.</p><p>These events are free to attend, and interested members of the public can register via <i>www.dfa.ie/brexit</i>.</p></reply>

However, as the Deputy notes, the findings of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (IIFFM) make for harrowing reading. The report corroborates many of the eyewitness accounts which have emerged from Myanmar in recent times. It provides credible findings that human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by members of the Burmese Military (Tatmadaw) and other security forces in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States. These crimes include the widespread killing of civilians; rape and sexual violence; torture and enforced disappearances.    The IIFFM&rsquo;s report also finds that there is sufficient evidence of the crimes committed in Rakhine State being so grave that they warrant a competent court to determine the liability for the crime of genocide of those in the Tatmadaw chain of command. </p>  <p>  Having considered this evidence, Ireland would support the referral by the Security Council of the situation in Myanmar to the ICC. The Security Council is the only competent body that can take this step. </p>  <p>  However, given the political and legal difficulties that surround such a referral, our focus in ensuring accountability and investigation of the allegations is necessarily elsewhere. We are working closely with international partners in other fora including the UN Human Rights Council and the EU to ensure that measures are put in place to allow the investigation of  human rights violations and that those who have perpetrated these crimes are held to account. </p>  <p>  In particular, at the current session of the Human Rights Council, Ireland is working in Geneva with the EU and other international in support of a resolution which seeks to establish an effective accountability mechanism to hold responsible those who have committed human rights violations.</p></reply>

I was delighted that he took up this invitation last weekend, and was pleased to be able to welcome him to Ireland. The Taoiseach and I had a substantive and useful meeting with President Abbas at Farmleigh on 22 September, following on from his meeting with President Higgins earlier in the day. I also hosted a working dinner for President Abbas and his delegation that evening. The presence of a large delegation accompanying him to the UN General Assembly in New York meant that the meetings also benefitted from the presence of other senior Palestinian leaders, including Saeb Erekat, Chief Negotiator and Secretary General of the PLO; Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Ziad Abu-Amr; Foreign Minister Riad Malki; and others. This contributed to a very full and useful discussion.The topics we covered included the current situation in Palestine, and issues arising from the occupation, including settlements; the situation in Gaza; the funding crisis facing UNRWA; the international environment and prospects for any political initiative; human rights issues in Palestine, especially in Gaza; and the forthcoming United Nations Ministerial sessions and related meetings. </p><p>President Abbas and his colleagues expressed their strong hope that Ireland would soon recognise the State of Palestine. I explained the Government&rsquo;s position, our consistent support for the achievement of a fully sovereign Palestinian state, and my continuing assessment of whether and when formal recognition by Ireland could be most helpful. I made clear in my public remarks with Minister Malki that the growing general concern about the evolution of the situation on the ground  &ndash; which the Government fully shares &ndash; was itself also a relevant factor in that assessment.</p><p>I also discussed with the Palestinian delegation<font color="#004080"> </font>the idea of Ireland hosting an informal meeting of a small number of Arab and European Ministers with Palestinian representatives, to reflect privately on how to advance the cause of peace. We are working to develop this concept, in consultation with partners, over the coming weeks.</p><p>In terms of practical assistance which Ireland can offer to the Palestinian people, I announced an additional &euro;1 million in Irish Aid funding for UNRWA, bringing Ireland&rsquo;s total funding to UNRWA to &euro;7 million this year, the highest it has ever been. I underlined the Government&rsquo;s strong support for the Agency and the essential work it is carrying out under difficult conditions.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-09-27a.162.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018092700054#WRD04300"><p>There are a range of tax measures designed directly or indirectly to encourage employers to take on new employees. These include the following:</p>  <p>Key Employee Engagement Programme (KEEP):   The policy objective of KEEP is to assist small to medium size businesses in competing with larger companies when attempting to attract and retain key employees. Share options can provide key employees with a financial incentive linked to the success of the company and may improve the attractiveness of an SME employment offer. The incentive provides that the value of the benefit to the employee on exercise of a qualifying share option will be subject to capital gains tax when the employee subsequently disposes of the shares. In the absence of the KEEP incentive, such gains would be subject to income tax, USC and PRSI at the time of exercise.  </p>  <p>  As this is a new measure, there will be no immediate cost in 2018 as the share options must, with limited exceptions, be held for a minimum of twelve months before they can be exercised under this scheme. It is also likely that employees may hold the KEEP share options for a number of years before exercise, as the options must be granted at not less than market value on the date of grant, so a benefit will only arise to the employee if the shares increase in value from that date. It is estimated that the eventual full-year cost of the Key Employee Engagement Programme will be in the region of &euro;10m. </p>  <p>  Key Employee R&amp;D Tax Credit:   Separate from KEEP, this key employee provision allows for the transfer of the financial benefit of the R&amp;D tax credit from a company to an individual employee.  The key employee measure is designed to assist companies in the State to attract and retain employees with key skills in the field of R&amp;D.  Such skills are necessary to allow companies innovate, expand and develop. The generation of new products, processes and innovations should lead to more jobs being created in the economy.  The cost of the measure in 2015, the latest year for which data are available, was less than &euro;0.05m.</p>  <p>  The Employment and Investment Incentive:   The Employment and Investment Incentive (EII) is a tax relief incentive that provides tax relief for investment in certain corporate trades and is targeted at job creation and retention. The scheme replaced the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) which had been in place from 1984. The incentive allows an individual investor to obtain income tax relief on investments, up to a maximum of &euro;150,000 per annum, in each tax year up to 2020. Relief is initially available to an individual up to a maximum of 30% of the amount invested.  A further 10% tax relief is available where it has been proven that employment levels have increased at the company at the end of the specified period (3 years) or where evidence is provided that the company used the capital raised for expenditure on research and development. The cost of EII in 2016, the latest year for which data are available, was &euro;32m. A review of the scheme is currently underway.</p>  <p>  The Special Assignee Relief Programme (SARP):   SARP is aimed at reducing the cost to employers of assigning key individuals already employed by their companies from abroad to take up positions in the Irish based operations of the employer. The intention is that the recipients of SARP will assist with the establishment of additional functions for their companies in Ireland and, due to a transfer of skills, these functions will be able to operate without the assistance of SARP after a period. The existing SARP scheme is limited to existing overseas employees of companies and is not available to new hires. The cost of SARP in 2015, the latest year for which data are available, was &euro;9.5m. This scheme is subject to a sunset clause with an end date of 31 December 2020. </p>  <p>  Start Up Relief:   Three Year Start Up Relief (Section 486C TCA 1997) provides for relief from corporation tax for start-up companies in their first three years of trading. The relief was introduced to provide support to new business ventures in their critical early years of trading, thereby supporting the creation of additional employment and economic activity in the State. The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax payable on the profits of the new trade and gains on the disposal of any assets used for the purpose of the new trade. The relief exclusively supports start-up companies that create and maintain jobs, by restricting the relief available to a company by reference to its Employers&rsquo; PRSI payments. The cost of the measure in 2016, the latest year for which data are available, is provisionally set at &euro;5.7m.  </p>  <p>  Film Relief:   Section 481 of the TCA 1997 requires that a producer company that receives the relief employs a certain amount of trainees on the production for which the relief is received. The number of trainees is directly linked to the amount of corporation tax relief claimed. A production must have two trainees for every &euro;335,000 of relief claimed, this is capped at a maximum of eight trainees per production.  There isn&rsquo;t a specific costing for the trainee element of Film Relief as this measure is a requirement for obtaining the relief.</p></reply>

Such housing programmes are a matter for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>  <p>  The annual rate of return on the amounts that have been transferred to the Exchequer to date would be equivalent to the cost of issuing debt instead of utilising these funds for expenditure on public services.

In accordance with the EU VAT Directive the standard rate of VAT, currently 23%, applies to the supply of digital school books.</p>  <p>  The VAT Directive also provides that Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates to certain goods and services listed in Annex III of the Directive, including the supply of products used for contraception and sanitary protection. Under Irish legislation the supply of condoms is subject to the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5% and the supply of menstrual products, excluding sanitary towels and tampons, is subject to the standard rate of VAT, 23%.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland has retained the application of the zero rate of VAT on certain goods such as sanitary towels and sanitary tampons, but is prohibited from extending or applying this rate to other goods.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that traders are not required to separately identify the VAT yield generated from a particular product type or activity on their VAT returns. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an estimated cost of reducing the VAT rates on the specific products referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities.  This regime, which imposes higher environmental standards on coal in the State than applies in Northern Ireland, enables local authorities to undertake enforcement action to prevent the sale or distribution of coal that does not meet our standards.  </p>  <p>  European Union Single Market constraints preclude the use of any cross-border movement controls in the administration of Solid Fuel Carbon Tax.  Therefore, Revenue has no authority to stop vehicles and physically inspect loads of such fuel. Similarly, the transport or possession of solid fuel that originated in Northern Ireland are not, in themselves, Revenue offences and Revenue&rsquo;s officers have no authority to challenge such transportation or possession.  It is important to note that liability to Solid Fuel Carbon Tax does not arise on the physical presence of the goods in the State, but on first supply in the State by the supplier who is obliged to register with Revenue, make a return and pay the tax. This return must be made one month after the two-month accounting period provided for in law.</p>  <p>  I am advised that Revenue is in contact with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here, including the scope for cooperation to ensure improved compliance in the sector.</p></reply>

Section 110 companies can only hold certain qualifying assets. Real property is not an asset that these companies can hold, however they can hold loans and other financial assets that derive their value therefrom. The Finance Act 2016 changes related to the taxation of profits which were derived from Irish land and buildings and provided a restriction on the amount of interest which is deductible against such profits, thereby excluding businesses with loans which are secured over, or derive their value from, an interest in Irish land from using the provisions of section 110 to avoid payment of Irish tax on profits made on Irish property transactions. Those changes took effect from 6 September 2016.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the REIT regime introduced in Finance Act 2013 and the IREF regime introduced in Finance Act 2016.  Both regimes, which apply to collective investment vehicles, in general terms provide that profits arising from Irish rental property are taxed at the investor level rather than at the investment vehicle level.  That is, the vehicle is not subject to corporation tax or capital gains tax because the income and/or gains are taxed at the level of the investor when they receive a payment from that vehicle.  Under both regimes a 20% withholding tax applies on dividends paid out of Irish property profits or gains to non-resident investors.  </p>  <p>  There are a number of exceptions from the operation of the IREF and REIT withholding tax such as for pension schemes and charities as they are more generally exempt from tax.   </p>  <p>  DIRT does not apply to deposits held by companies who have supplied their tax reference number to a deposit taker.  I would note however while DIRT is not collected at source, such companies are subject to tax on the interest income.  There is no specific exemption from DIRT for section 110s, REITs or IREFs.  The nature of investment vehicles is such that they are unlikely to hold significant deposits for any period of time.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to calculate the amount of tax that would be paid if:</p>  <p>  - a company had not submitted a notification to Revenue that it is a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110 TCA 1997, </p>  <p>  - the REIT regime was not in existence, or</p>  <p>  - the IREF regime was not in existence. </p>  <p>  Any such calculation would require a wide range of assumptions as to what activity would have taken place in the absence of these regimes.</p></reply>

This data is not available to the Department.  </p>  <p>  Pay band data available to the Department indicates that some 96% of all public service staff are on salary points in excess of &euro;25,000 per annum. The suggested wage at &euro;11.90 per hour based on the Civil Service 37 hour standard net working week equates to an annual salary of &euro;22,975.  </p>  <p>  Data based on Civil Service staff only at the end of June 2018 indicates that only some 1% of staff (FTE) in the Civil Service are on salary points less than &euro;22,975.  The estimated cost within the civil service, which is some 11% of the overall public service, would be some &euro;3.9m (Headcount). Based on the above costing, assuming the same wage profile to the wider Public Service, it is estimated that it would cost &euro;35.4m to introduce a minimum wage across the Civil and Public Service.  </p>  <p>  However it should be noted that any of those currently on an annual salary of less than &euro;22,975 could be receiving remuneration in excess of the suggested minimum wage through additional premium payments in respect of shift or atypical working hours or are on salary scales that progress to the suggested minimum wage through incremental progression. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the pay increases under the new Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020: 1% October 2018; 1% for those earning under &euro;30,000 January 2019; 1.75% in September 2019 and 2% in October 2020 will further reduce those earning less than the rate the Deputy has mentioned.</p></reply>

This was &euro;152 million, or 0.4 per cent, below profile and &euro;2,874 million, or 7.9 per cent, higher than expenditure for the same period in 2017. Gross voted current expenditure of &euro;36,770 million was &euro;209 million, or 0.6 per cent ahead of profile and &euro;2,353 million, or 6.8 per cent ahead of the same period last year. At the end of August 14 out of 17 Ministerial Vote Groups were either broadly in line or below profile, with an aggregate underspend of &euro;207 million versus their current expenditure profiles. Health, Education and Skills, and Justice were ahead of their gross current expenditure profiles by an aggregate amount of &euro;416 million. </p>  <p>  Given the scale of gross voted expenditure, &euro;62 billion in aggregate for 2018, the need for Supplementary Estimates or the surrender of funds to the Exchequer at end-year can arise for a number of reasons. Additional funding requirements in one area may be partly offset by underspends in another area. The exact scale of any underspends is difficult to assess at this stage in the year. However, the expenditure outturns for the last two years provide an indication of the potential range. </p>  <p>  As reported in the December 2017 Fiscal Monitor, gross voted expenditure in 12 out of 17 Vote Groups was in line or below profile for the year. These profiles reflected the allocations set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2017 published in December 2016 and the Further Revised Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il on 17th October 2017. The aggregate underspend on current expenditure across these 12 Vote Groups was &euro;208 million. As set out in the December 2016 Exchequer Statement, gross voted expenditure in 11 out of 16 Ministerial Vote Groups finished the year at or below their total expenditure profile. The aggregate underspend on current expenditure across these 11 Vote Groups was &euro;238 million. Consequently, based on the level of current expenditure underspends over the last two years in Vote Groups that underspent relative to their profiles, voted current expenditure underspends in the region of c &euro;0.2 billion could be expected to partly offset the expenditure pressures emerging in Health, Education and Justice.</p>  <p>  At the end of each financial year, unspent voted allocations must be surrendered to the Exchequer. However, as set out in the Public Financial Procedures, there is an exception in relation to voted capital. Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004 provides that a maximum of up to 10% of the capital envelope of each Vote may be carried over to the following year by way of &lsquo;deferred surrender&rsquo; to be spent that year on priority capital programmes. The total amount of capital carryover at end-2017 was &euro;70.3 million. </p>  <p>  At the end of August, gross voted capital expenditure of &euro;1,679 million was &euro;361 million, or 11.9 per cent below profile and &euro;521 million ahead of end-August 2017. The Department of Housing was &euro;175 million below profile with a significant proportion of this capital underspend being due to a timing issue relating to Irish Water, which is expected to revert to profile. Consequently, excluding the Department of Housing, gross voted capital expenditure is &euro;186 million below profile. At end-August 2017, the equivalent underspend was &euro;163 million. At end-December 2017, after taking capital carryover of &euro;70 million into account, the equivalent capital underspend, excluding the Department of Housing, amounted to &euro;54 million, which is approximately 1 per cent of the overall capital allocation. However, given the nature of spending on capital projects there is a particular difficulty in assessing the potential full year outturn at this point in time.</p>  <p>  Managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of each Minister and their Departments. Taking into account the level of underspends in previous years outlined above, it is important that where Departments have expenditure pressures arising in certain programmes the scope to reallocate expenditure from other programmes is fully examined in order to mitigate the risk of an overspend. Any increase in expenditure in one sector, unless offset by expenditure underspends elsewhere, either voted or non-voted, or additional revenues, would result in a deterioration in the general government deficit from a projected 0.2 per cent of GDP this year and 0.1 per cent of GDP next year. Consequently, as part of the Budget process, work is ongoing to determine the scale of any potential Supplementary Estimate requirements for this year, the potential impact on aggregate voted expenditure in both 2018 and 2019, and potential offsetting revenue or expenditure across all areas of General Government.</p></reply>

I negotiated, together with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers. </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes, from 1 October 2018 the starting salary of a teacher will be &euro;36,318, and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692. </p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education). Addressing any issues arising from changes which are not specifically detailed in the report would give rise to additional costs over and above the foregoing figures.</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectorial issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  On Monday 24th September, I welcomed, together with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the outcome of discussions between public service employers and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay. </p>  <p>  This agreement will benefit 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants at points 4 and 8 of their scale. </p>  <p>  For example, a teachers hired in September 2011 would see their salary increase from &euro;45,200 in September 2018 to &euro;53,062 in September 2020 under the PSSA agreement and the recent outcome of the new entrant pay talks.</p></reply>

Section 5 of the 2009 Act requires my Department to undertake a review of the operation of the Act and this review is currently ongoing.</p>  <p>  The parameters of the review were published on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality as well as a call for submissions for a public consultation on the operation of the Defamation Act.  Submissions to this public consultation were also published on the Department&rsquo;s website. In announcing the review, I stated that the central focus for the review is to ensure that our law strikes the correct balance between the right to freedom of expression in a democratic society, and an individual&rsquo;s right to protect their good name and privacy against unfounded attack &ndash; rights which are protected both under our Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>  <p>  Amongst other matters, the review  is addressing whether any changes should be made to the level or type of damages which may be awarded in defamation cases, or to the factors to be taken into account in making that determination. In addition, the review is addressing whether any changes should be made to the respective roles of judge and jury in High Court defamation cases. The review is also addressing the adequacy of the current range of defences under the 2009 Act, including the defence of fair and reasonable publication on a matter of public interest.</p>  <p>  My officials have completed extensive work on the review, which includes a comparative examination of the law of defamation in other jurisdictions, including in relation to assessment of damages and the respective roles of judge and jury. The timeframe for the review was extended due to requests by stakeholders for more time to prepare their submissions, the complexity of the issues under consideration, the wide scope of the submissions received, other urgent legislative priorities for the Department, and significant intervening judgments of relevance from the European Court of Human Rights and the Supreme Court.</p>  <p>  The review will culminate in a report to that will be submitted to me and that will include a range of options for reform of the 2009 Act. My officials have informed me that it is expected that the draft report with options for reform will be submitted to me before the end of 2018.</p></reply>

The emphasis of Friends groups is on fostering active engagement between centre residents and the local community as one of the simplest and most meaningful form of integration. As the Report stated &quot;Work to develop community linkages should focus on developing reciprocal linkages with residents participating in activities in the local community and vice versa.  The centre management should consider making facilities in the centre, e.g., meeting rooms and grounds, available for meetings and other activities to create and strengthen two-way links between residents and the local community.&quot; These groups aim to encourage and facilitate the active participation of asylum seekers in local community life and the activities developed by this network promote a self-help approach.</p><p>During 2017 and 2018, in particular, many events have been organised through the Friends of the Centre groups.  Open Days were held in all family centres, helping to break down barriers, both real and perceived, between the centres and the local community.</p></reply>

This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007. There may also be a smaller number of prisoners who would be restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).</p>  <p>  The Census undertaken by the Irish Prison Service on a quarterly basis provides figures in respect of all of these categories of restricted regime prisoners.</p>  <p>  As the information is compiled on a quarterly basis, data in relation to daily averages is not available.</p></reply>

The tensions being generated on the &lsquo;outside&rsquo; are imported into the prison system resulting in an increase in tension and a feeling among prisoners that they do not wish to mix with the general population in individual prisons. The emergence of these feuds, coupled with other factors has resulted in greater numbers of prisoners seeking &lsquo;protection&rsquo;. While every reasonable effort is being taken to encourage prisoners to mix within the general population, it is also the case that there is no provision available to &lsquo;force&rsquo; prisoners off protection. The vast majority of prisoners on protection are there at their own request.</p>  <p>  The Director General of the Irish Prison Service continues to Chair a high-level group which considers various measures to reduce the number of prisoners held on restricted regimes, which includes prisoners on protection. Since the introduction of the quarterly Census of Restricted Regime Prisoners the number of prisoners on 22/23 hour restricted regime has actually decreased by 176 or 83% from 211 in July 2013 to 35 in July 2018.</p></reply>

In this capacity, he is working closely with all Ministers, including myself, to address the many challenges Brexit will present . However, I do want to emphasise that it is this Government&rsquo;s firm intention that the same border arrangements as currently apply on the island of Ireland will continue into the future. In its approach to the Brexit negotiations, the Government has ensured that protecting the gains of the Peace Process and the avoidance of a hard border is a high priority for Ireland, our partner Member States and the European Commission.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and as such is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at his disposal, including personnel. Those resources have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2018 of more than &euro;1.6 billion. This budgetary provision as well as the significant capital investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years are in support of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country, to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  </p>  <p>  Garda management keep the distribution of resources under active review in line with operational and security demands, as determined by the Commissioner, including any possible policing requirements post Brexit. In that respect, I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is preparing for Brexit with a wide-ranging focus to determine operational requirements, including personnel and technology.  I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to progress their contingency preparations, and is committed to ensuring the organisation is prepared for the associated policing implications and challenges arising therefrom. </p>  <p>  My Department is engaged on an on-going basis with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the deep and detailed work being undertaken right across Government and the public sector in response to the UK's decision to leave the EU. Indeed, in June Department officials and a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na met with the European Commission in Brussels to discuss North-South cooperation in the areas of law enforcement and police and judicial cooperation.  Earlier this week, in the latest in a series of such meetings, senior officials from my Department met with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to further discuss Brexit preparations. Furthermore, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is represented at a senior level in the ongoing discussions between my Department and the UK's Home Office in relation to the operation of the Common Travel Area. </p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works very closely with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in combatting cross-border crime, including in the pursuit of individual criminal investigations.  This ongoing close co-operation, across the full range of policing responsibilities of both services, is in place and will continue in place regardless of the final shape of Brexit. Joint working is central to the shared objectives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland to combat crime of all sorts and to promote community safety on the island of Ireland.  There are many collaborative policing initiatives in place including the cross border policing strategy, updated and published by both police services in 2016, the annual cross border policing seminar on organised crime as well as formal protocols for secondments and exchanges between the two jurisdictions.  In November 2015, the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the agreement A Fresh Start, The Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan, as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.  These measures included the creation of the Joint Agency Task Force, which builds on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational law enforcement actions.  These examples of the intensification of police co-operation are driven by a shared imperative to ensure normalisation in the security and policing environment, to promote reconciliation and to enhance community safety for all communities on the island.  It is imperative that strong political leadership is in place to drive and further develop these initiatives on both sides of the border.  In this regard I am sure that the Deputy will join me in calling for the full restoration of the Executive in Stormont as a matter of urgency.  </p>  <p>  And so I want to assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in dealing with the implications of Brexit and will provide whatever resources are required to keep our people and our communities safe. This is clearly demonstrated by this Government&rsquo;s track record of investment in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the Government plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide of whom 214 have been assigned to the Northern Garda Region. Taking account of projected retirements, Garda numbers are expected to reach 14,000 by the end of this year and 15,000 during 2021. </p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and enhance visibility within our communities and will enable the Commissioner to deploy additional resources to meet the challenges of Brexit, should he deem it necessary.</p></reply>

As the Deputy may also be aware, wardship funds are not public funds. The funds of a person who is taken into wardship move into the custody and supervision of the High Court which then holds and invests those funds as appropriate for the benefit of the ward. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has advised that the management of court funds by the Courts Service is sensitive to, and takes full account of, the needs of the wards of court in the management and investment of the available funds. The Courts Service has further advised that the Wards of Court Office appoints a case officer for each ward of court when the person is brought into wardship who meets with the committee appointed by the President of the High Court and liaises with that committee throughout the wardship to ensure that the care and monetary needs of the ward are met taking into account the initial award. </p>  <p>  It is standard procedure for funds of the ward to be brought under the custody of the court for investment by the Accountant of the Courts of Justice in accordance with the directions of the President of the High Court and the Registrar of the Office of Wards of Court. Investment of court funds is carried out in line with the strategies devised and reviewed on a regular basis by the Investment Committee, chaired by the President of the High Court.</p>  <p>  The Investment Committee reviews the investment strategies with the assistance of its investment advisors to ensure the protection and suitable investment of funds of wards, minors and others lodged in court for the benefit of those persons. Investment policies and orders made thereunder must be in accordance with the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act 1958. This procedure was examined and approved by the court in the case entitled "In the Matter of M. H., a Ward of Court" [2011] IEHC 129. </p>  <p>  The Courts Service has informed me that a conservative investment policy is followed. When deciding where and how to invest court funds, the overriding objective is the achievement of an optimal total financial return having regard to the need for liquidity and capital security, taking account of income generation and capital growth requirements. Where there is a requirement to generate a higher return to sustain the value of the funds for the longest period possible, such funds are invested in longer term growth and income generating strategies. </p>  <p>  Finally, I am delighted to inform the Deputy that I have signed the Commencement Order bringing Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 into operation with effect from 1 October 2018. The Act, which allows courts the power to award periodic payments rather than a lump sum payment in cases of catastrophic injury, will provide much needed financial security to persons requiring lifelong care and assistance following a catastrophic injury. I believe that the availability of a periodic payment to catastrophically injured persons will ensure that they will receive the care and assistance they require for the rest of their lives.</p></reply>

Waiting list figures for August 2018 show there are over 514,500 patients on the outpatient waiting list. Each year, 3.3 million patients attend hospital outpatient clinics for appointments.</p>  <p>  The HSE, in consultation with the NTPF and the Department of Health, is in the process of finalising an Outpatient Action Plan for the remainder of 2018 which will support the HSE&rsquo;s compliance with its National Service Plan targets, reduce the growth in the number of patients waiting for outpatient services. The Plan will include initiatives to improve the accuracy of the waiting list through the establishment of central waiting list validation function in the NTPF. In addition, the NTPF has invited proposals from hospital groups, which has resulted in the approval of 12,600 outpatient appointments.</p>  <p>  The NTPF will deliver additionality to the health system through both outsourcing and HSE insourcing. NTPF insourcing arrangements are governed by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the NTPF and the public hospital.  In order to avoid double payment to the public hospital, the conditions for insourcing include the following:</p>  <p>  The treatment to be provided further to the MoU is additional to and separate from treatment provided further to funding received from any other source, including treatment provided under the National Service Plan.</p>  <p>  The cost of the treatment charged to the NTPF shall only relate to the additional costs incurred by the Treating Hospital in providing the required treatment relative to the costs that would have been incurred by the Treating Hospital if the treatment had not been provided.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular question raised regarding Outpatient Clinics, the NTPF does not pay nurses and consultants, payments are made to the hospitals only. The NTPF pays for additional activity only at a marginal cost. Additional activity could cover extra OPD clinics, evening or weekend clinics for instance. The marginal cost can therefore cover overtime paid by the hospital but does not include basic pay.</p></reply>

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Progress made to date and future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.</p>  <p>  The Strategy&rsquo;s implementation was boosted at the time of its launch through a joint programme of investment by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies. This &euro;27.5 million investment allowed for a number of key actions within the strategy to be resourced and implemented. It funded the PREPARED programme, which offers education and clinical resources for GPs and Primary Care Teams; intensive homecare packages for people with dementia; the Understand Together awareness campaign; and the establishment of the National Dementia Office, which has an important role in implementing the Strategy. The Office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Additional projects are being funded through &euro;6.26 million in Dormant Accounts funding secured by the Department of Health in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans.</p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area. There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.</p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has also developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development. This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia. It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country. </p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites. An evaluation of the Dementia Adviser Service was published on 26th September. It recommends the continuation and expansion of the service to ensure equity of access countrywide.</p>  <p>  A priority action in the National Dementia Strategy is the appointment of key workers to coordinate each patient's care and promote continuity, and ensure that the patient knows who to access for information and advice. It is proposed that the key worker will be responsible for the coordinated planning and delivery of individually tailored care plans, developed in consultation with the person, their family carers and a range of health and social care practitioners. The key worker will also provide expert knowledge and leadership in dementia. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has secured funding through the 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to continue funding in 2019 for the Dementia Community Activation Coordinator post which has been co-funded through a partnership between the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the HSE during 2018. The Community Activation Coordinator is working with national organisations and key community stakeholders to support community dementia champions across Ireland. The Coordinator will seek to grow the number of champions and people within communities to take action to create sustainable dementia inclusive communities.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific request for additional support for dementia services in Co. Wexford referred to by the Deputy, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.</p></reply>

It was outlined that during inspections it has been found that some Pharmaceutical Assistants had been working outside the 1994 Code of Practice regarding covering temporary absences. Council of the PSI requested that a policy position be developed to enable and facilitate the drafting of rules in line with the requirements of Section 30(2) of the Act. </p>  <p>  In March 2017, the PSI Council considered the matter of temporary absence and a proposed draft set of rules under section 30 of the Act. At this meeting the Council heard a presentation from the Chair of the Pharmaceutical Assistants&rsquo; Association, following an invitation. The Council decided to reject the proposal presented at that time and requested further examination of the issue of temporary absence, and what would be covered within the scope of the rules. </p>  <p>  A Working Group was established to produce a report, which was submitted to Council on the 17 May 2018.  The membership of the Working group was based on competency requirements, and the Group would provide expertise, advice and input to assist in developing policy options, and drafting rules.</p>  <p>  The working group comprised of persons combining expertise across the areas of operation of, management of, and supervision of an Retail Pharmacy Business (RPB) including where there is practical use of &ldquo;temporary absence cover&rdquo; as currently understood and operated; professional registration and continued competence; regulation; inspection of RPB; risk and quality expertise; public and patient interest/advocacy and policy development. </p>  <p>  The Pharmaceutical Assistants Association were invited to nominate a member to the Working Group and nominated its Chairperson. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the Group (Remit and Terms of Reference of the Group considered and agreed at its first meeting on 21 June 2017) and the competencies of its members are contained in Appendix 2 of the Working Group Report, which is available on the PSI website. </p>  <p>  The Working Group Report details the considerations of the group, which were informed by an independent report from UK NARIC benchmarking the Pharmaceutical Assistant qualification, and centred on patient safety, public protection, and risk in proposing how long a pharmacist may be absent from a pharmacy. The Group considered the current legislative provisions pertaining to pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland under the Pharmacy Act 2007; the governance and accountability requirements provided, and the regulatory framework which provides patients with the expectation of appropriate regulatory protections. Pharmaceutical assistants fall outside the current regulatory disciplinary mechanism with no disciplinary recourse available against the actions taken by any individual pharmaceutical assistant, and outside the mandatory competence assurance schemes notwithstanding that individual registered pharmaceutical assistants would undertake CPD and CE.</p>  <p>  The draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018, were produced on foot of the Working Group Report and were subject to a public consultation process. These draft Rules were approved by the PSI Council on September 20th and have yet to be submitted for my consent as required by the Act.</p></reply>

Under the Inpatient Day Case Action Plan, launched in April, the NTPF commits to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 9 months for a cataract procedure. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan 25% (5,000 out of 20,000) of the planned National Treatment Purchase Fund procedures has been allocated for treatment for cataract patients. </p>  <p>  In addition, under the Plan my Department continues to work with the HSE and the NTPF to identify sustainable initiatives to improve waiting times. In line with the Action Plan, July marked the opening of a dedicated Cataract theatre in Nenagh Hospital. The HSE advise that since the service commenced, 53 patients have been treated and it is expected that over 200 cataract procedures will be undertaken by year end. </p></reply>

In the Inpatient Day Case Action Plan, launched in April, 25% (5,000 out of 20,000) of the planned National Treatment Purchase Fund procedures were allocated for cataract patients. </p>  <p>  Under the Action Plan, the NTPF commits to offer treatment to all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 9 months for a cataract procedure. </p>  <p>  The impact of the Action Plan can be seen in the improvements to the Waiting Lists for Cataracts which have seen a reduction of over 3,100 over the past 13 months. August figures for cataracts show that there are now 6,868 on the waiting list, compared to over 10,000 in July 2017. The number of patients waiting over 9 months for a cataract procedure has gone from over 4,300 in July 2017 to 1,078 in August 2018, with 64% of patients waiting 3 months or less.</p>  <p>  While the Department does not routinely collect data at procedure level by group, waiting list figures from the NTPF indicate that since July 2017, the numbers on the Inpatient/Daycase list for ophthalmology in the SSW hospital group has fallen from 3,509 to 2,826 at the end of August 2018. Cataracts would make up a significant proportion of the ophthalmology waiting lists. The percentage of ophthalmology patients on the IPDC list  waiting 9 months or more at the end of August 2018 is 27%.</p>  <p>  I will ask the NTPF to provide information on the number of cataracts patients in SSW to the end of August and I will provide this information to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

This legislation provides that all equines must be identified with a passport no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the animal. Each equine must be implanted with a microchip by a veterinary practitioner, the number of which must be recorded on the corresponding passport, on the database of the issuing Passport Issuing Organisation (PIO) and on the central equine database maintained by my Department. This establishes the link between the animal and its passport document.</p>  <p>  The implantation of a microchip in an equine by a veterinary practitioner became a requirement under the provisions of Commissions Regulation (EU) 504/2008, which came into effect on 1st July 2009 in respect of all equines identified with a passport from that date.</p>  <p>  Equines identified with a passport prior to 1st July 2009 are deemed to be properly identified even though they have not been implanted with a microchip.  </p>  <p>  Proper identification of an equine cannot be established visually. The physical identification document issued in respect of an equine records the required identification details of the animal, and it is from that data that the requirement for a microchip is determined. </p>  <p>  Enforcement of equine identification legislation is largely undertaken by authorised officers across the regional offices my Department who liaise with authorised officers in the Local Authorities and other organisations as required.</p>  <p>  While S.I. 62 of 2016 (as amended) provides for the prosecution of keepers who have unidentified equines in their care, it also provides for the issuing of compliance notices. My Department's policy is to adopt a fair and proportional approach in dealing with breaches of equine identification legislation. In this regard, authorised officers engage with keepers to ensure that they understand their responsibilities and where breaches of the legislation are identified, they generally provide an opportunity for non-compliant keepers to rectify the position within a specified timeframe. This approach is considered to be effective.</p>  <p>  There have been no prosecutions since January 2013 with regard to the failure of owners to chip their horses.</p></reply>

One of the eligibility criteria under the 2018 schemes is that the young farmer must have successfully completed a recognised course of education in agriculture giving rise to an award at FETAC Level 6 or its equivalent by the closing date for receipt of applications of 15th May 2018.  Where an applicant has completed the course by 15th May 2018 but has not received final verification, the applicant should submit a Confirmation of Education form which is available for downloading as part of the online application facility.  This form should be signed and stamped by the education course provider and also signed by the applicant to confirm that the applicant has fully completed his/her course, including exams, practicals and course work by the 15th May.</p>  <p>On 8th May 2018, in support of the application to the schemes, the applicants submitted a letter from Teagasc confirming the young farmer was a registered student, he was progressing through the relevant education course and would on successful completion of the course be issued with a certificate in September 2018.

The disease has been spreading in Europe since it first entered the Eastern part of the European Union in 2014. The disease has spread to a number of EU Member States including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and more recently Belgium, where the disease was confirmed in wild boar. The disease does not affect other animal species or humans and there are no food safety implications.</p>  <p>  Specific EU legislation (Directive 2002/60/EC) is in place that sets out the control measures to be implemented in the event of an ASF outbreak in an EU member state in order to control the disease and prevent any spread. These control measures include, for example, culling of animals in affected herds, animal and animal product movement restrictions, investigation into the source of disease and surveillance of susceptible populations.  These control measures are being implemented in the affected countries. </p>  <p>  ASF has never been detected in Ireland. A significant risk factor for the introduction of ASF into Ireland would be the illegal or inadvertent importation of meat or meat products from infected pigs particularly as the virus is very stable and can survive for months in uncooked or cured pork and pork products e.g. salami, sausages. The feeding of such products to pigs could then result in a disease outbreak here. A further risk would be the inadvertent spread of the virus by humans on clothing, footwear etc, who may have been exposed to the virus in affected countries. Wild boar which are also affected by the disease have played a major role in the spread of ASF in Eastern Europe. Ireland does not have a sustained population of wild boar. </p>  <p>  DAFM has a contingency plan in place setting out the procedures and protocols that would be followed in the event of a suspected or confirmed case of ASF here. DAFM also has an ongoing early warning system and awareness campaign in place for all exotic diseases including ASF. Measures to protect the Irish pig industry from the threat of ASF have been stepped up in recent months and include for example:</p>  <p>  - Close monitoring of the situation in EU member states and liaising with our EU neighbours on a regular basis.</p>  <p>  - Circulation of regular information on ASF to targeted stakeholders to keep them informed of the current situation in Europe and the risk to Ireland. These documents are also made available at the disease control section of the DAFM website.</p>  <p>  - Production of disease factsheets on ASF for both vets and farmers and their circulation to stakeholders for example as part of the annual pig census. They are also available on the DAFM website.</p>  <p>  - Production of a multilingual poster warning of the dangers of visitors or staff returning from affected regions of the EU and bringing back meat or meat products onto Irish pig farms and its circulation to over 300 commercial pig farms in recent months.</p>  <p>  - Biosecurity advice detailing measures that can be taken to prevent entry of the disease is available on the disease control section of the DAFM website for both the intensive commercial sectors and the less intensive pig farmers such as organic and outdoor production systems.</p>  <p>  - Posters advising members of the public of the risks of ASF are in place at airports and ports.</p>  <p>  -Specific advice regarding the risk of ASF was recently circulated to Irish livestock transporters who may travel to or transit through areas of the EU affected by ASF this summer.</p>  <p>  - DAFM regularly tweets exotic disease information including biosecurity advice for farmers and specific information on ASF.</p>  <p>  - Staff from DAFM&rsquo;s veterinary service manned an information stand at the Ploughing Championships 2018 where ASF was a featured disease.</p>  <p>  The Department continues to review all aspects of its contingency arrangements in relation to ASF in light of any emerging veterinary or scientific information and introduces such measures as are considered appropriate.</p></reply>

This Regulation does not apply to potatoes. However under the "Food Information to the Consumer Regulation" (Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council) the country of origin must be labelled on potatoes offered for sale where a failure to declare the country of origin might mislead the consumer.  For example potatoes offered for sale in Ireland must have their country of origin labelled if they were not grown in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is involved in enforcing both of these pieces of legislation.</p></reply>

From an agri food perspective, this will include the provision of the necessary infrastructure and resources to carry out import controls at ports and airports on animal, plants, and products of animal and plant origin imported from the UK, as well as to provide any necessary export certification required by the UK in respect of such products. We will also have to ensure that arrangements are in place to facilitate rapid transit of product via the UK landbridge between Ireland and other Member States.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of these measures will involve the allocation of significant additional infrastructural, staffing and IT resources at ports, airports, exporting plants and Department offices. From a staffing perspective, my Department's immediate planning relates to the phased recruitment of staff for Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS), and fisheries controls over the period to 2021. This will commence with Phase One in 2019, which will involve the recruitment of an additional 116 SPS and fisheries control staff, as agreed by Government on 18 September. Arrangements are currently being put in place to commence this recruitment process.</p></reply>

I note also the broad agreement among Member States at the Trade Policy Committee meeting in Brussels on 14 September that this issue should be resolved quickly, a view that Ireland shares. This is a long-standing issue, with both political and economic sensitivities, and the most important consideration is the need to avoid a return to sanctions.</p>  <p>  I have been in close contact with Commissioner Hogan on this issue. The intention is that the existing hormone-free beef quota of 45,000 tonnes will remain at exactly the same level, with the main change arising in relation to the amount of the quota to be &ldquo;ring fenced&rdquo; for the US. This amount is still to be finalised, but Irish and European beef producers need have no fears that the adjustment to the quota arrangements would see any more than the existing quota limit of hormone-free beef enter the EU. It is also clear that any change in the existing arrangements will have to be in compliance with WTO rules. </p>  <p>  On the question of increased market access into the EU for beef from third countries, Ireland's position is well-known, in that we vigorously defend the interests of the Irish and EU beef sectors against any outcome from trade negotiations that would have negative consequences for the sector. For example, all through the EU-Mercosur negotiations Ireland has been very strong in its opposition to concessions from the EU in relation to beef, a position that has been maintained by myself, my colleague Andrew Doyle, the Taoiseach, and by my colleagues in Government, as well as by my officials and officials from other Departments in the course of our ongoing engagement with EU institutions at all levels. </p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of trade negotiations. I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector. I will also continue to work very closely with Member State colleagues in this regard. In particular, I believe full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.</p></reply>

The Directive is therefore seeking to contribute to    ensuring a fair standard of living for those producers who are particularly vulnerable to UTPs, who have the least bargaining power, and are least able to address UTPs without negative effects on their economic viability, particularly as  agricultural products are  perishable and seasonable, and subject  to adverse weather conditions. </p>  <p>  The issue of the scope of the proposed Directive in terms of the size of the entities concerned has been a key issue for debate at the working groups and  the Special Agriculture Committee.  Some Member States have suggested that, rather than being confined to small sellers and large buyers, the scope should be extended to also provide protection to large sellers, and that the Directive should also apply to small SME buyers.</p>  <p>However, the Council and Commission Legal Services have both advised that the legal basis of Art 43.2 of the EU Treaty, which is being used for the proposed Directive, would be open to a legal challenge if the scope of the Directive is extended. It is on the basis of this legal advice that Ireland,   while recognising the desirability of extending the scope of the Directive to address the issue of unfair practices irrespective of the size of the entity, acknowledged  at the recent SCA meetings the concerns of the legal services about the legal basis for further extending the scope.  Ireland also recognised the possibility, set out in Article 8 of the draft Directive, for Member States to lay down or maintain stricter rules, to extend the scope to other types of buyers and suppliers and to prohibit other UTPs in national legislation.</p></reply>

This process has unfortunately taken longer than envisaged, due to data protection issues that have arisen since the introduction of GDPR.  </p>  <p>  Subsequent to the announcement of the support, my Department has continued to engage with the HSE, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and other relevant stakeholders in an effort to complete the roll-out of the scheme. I can assure the Deputies that I am committed to introducing the annual support as soon as practically possible in conjunction with relevant agencies and stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The figure of &euro;75 represents the estimated average cost of disposal (at landfill or waste to energy plants) for medical incontinence products and was arrived at following an analysis of the issue and discussion with groups representing those with lifelong or long-term medical incontinence. My focus is on getting the scheme up and running and while I have no plans at this time to increase the level of support available, it will be subject to review in the future. </p>  <p>In line with the commitments set out in A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland,   published in 2012, and in the interest of encouraging further waste prevention and greater recycling, flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection are being phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018, as customers contracts come up for renewal. The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure. </p>  <p>  As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced. Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Price Monitoring Group has considered twelve months of data to date. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability. </p></reply>

They have extended the scheme payments on several occasions since then and last year they decided to continue payments up until the end of 2018.  No other electricity supplier has chosen to provide such a tariff, to either domestic or commercial customers, although they have been invited to do so by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU). Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the CRU, which is an independent statutory body.    Last year, my Department assessed micro generation, across a number of renewable electricity generating technologies, as part of the economic analysis to underpin the new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). The assessment identified technical and financial challenges which may need to be addressed before a broader support scheme for micro generation can be introduced. This is in line with international and EU experience, where many member states who have introduced supports for micro generation have had to reform them or cancel them altogether. In March 2017 the UK Government closed down the Renewables Obligation (RO) Scheme to new applicants.  Under the RO scheme generators (including homeowners and farmers across Northern Ireland) received payment for each unit of electricity they produce from solar PV. Interestingly, prior to closing the scheme, the UK Government had reduced the generation tariff from 16p per unit of electricity generated, to 12p and finally down to 8p.</p>  <p>  The reality is that bringing micro generation onto a system designed for large generators is complicated. It impacts how we pay for the network, how we manage regulation and how we technically manage the system. </p>  <p>  In July, I announced details of a new pilot scheme to support micro generation, initially targeting solar PV, homeowners and self-consumption. The data gathered during the pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for micro-generation in Ireland that may be appropriate, as we align with the ambition and requirements of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED) that recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers. </p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to work closely with the micro-generation sector and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) to better understand how to validate and further develop these policies in a fair and cost effective manner.</p></reply>

Fishing for eel was by way of public licence and therefore the issue of compensation does not arise. However, both Minister Naughten and I have secured Exchequer funding for a support measure.    Officials have engaged with the European Commission in relation to Ireland's proposals to fund a support scheme for former eel fishermen and the Department has received written advice from the Revenue Commissioners as regards the tax treatment of any payments under such a scheme. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the scheme will be open to former fishermen who held an Inland Fisheries Ireland eel fishing licence or a permit from ESB in the period prior to the closure. Officials are liaising with IFI and ESB to verify catch records declared by fishermen and I expect that an announcement of the scheme and a call for applications will be made shortly.</p></reply>

Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels and has had the effect of significantly improving public health. Research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.   In light of its significant health and environmental benefits, I decided to extend the ban to the entire territory of the State beginning this Autumn. This process is on-going but necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission, relevant Government Departments and Agencies and the residential fuel industry. Discussions with all these stakeholders on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed nationwide ban are underway.</p></reply>

The detailed monitoring and reporting shows that there has been a steady increase in efficiency achieved from c.5% in 2009 to c.20% in 2016.  The figures for the 2017 performance will be available later this year once all of the data has been analysed.  The cumulative energy savings from 2009 to 2016 also amount to 2.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions reduction and &euro;737m in energy spend avoided.</p>  <p>  To further drive the effort required to achieve the 33% target, I published the first Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy in 2017.  It introduces new governance structures, enhanced support measures, and provides clarity on the retention of financial savings achieved by public sector bodies from the energy efficiency measures they implement.  Since the launched of the Strategy in 2017 all government departments have appointed a designated Energy Performance Officer (EPO) to drive the Strategy and provide the necessary strategic leadership to the bodies within their groups.  My Department, along with the SEAI, and the OPW have been engaging pro-actively with Departments and their EPO&rsquo;s through workshops and individual advisory sessions.  The main focus is to support EPO's to work with the bodies in their sector to identify and develop energy efficiency projects and avail of the advice and supports available.  </p>  <p>  Since 2017, to further support the Strategy I have also provided &euro;14m in funding to the SEAI to engage and work with the OPW and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills on two pilot projects.  These are delivering energy retrofit upgrades, and crucially, informing and developing replicable and scalable models for energy retrofit investment that can be more widely deployed.</p></reply>

This is in line with other areas of environmental enforcement such as waste, where such an approach has proved successful.</p>  <p>  Complaints regarding the sale of prohibited fuels, smoky emissions or other breaches of the regulations should, in the first instance, be reported to the Environment Section of the Local Authority concerned.</p></reply>

Section 17 of the Act allowed for the  setting up of an Advisory Council of a Chairperson and 23 ordinary members.  Under the Act, a majority of the Council would comprise officials and elected members of the various local / regional authorities in the GDA. </p>  <p>  However, given that the remit of the Authority has been broadened over the years since 2008 especially by bringing national transport issues within its remit (rather than exclusively GDA matters), establishing an advisory council solely for GDA transport (as enabled by the legislation) would probably no longer be appropriate.</p>  <p>  However, I am open to considering the merits of a broader national level advisory council and this is one of the broad range of matters that is within the scope of the Public Transport Policy Review which my Department is currently undertaking.

It is therefore open to local authorities to fund these types of works either from their DG allocation or alternatively from its own resources should it so wish. </p>  <p>  In addition I have recently supplemented funding for the purchase of salt by &euro;700,000 in order to further rebuild salt stocks for the forthcoming winter.

For weekly earnings of &euro;352 or less no PRSI is charged.  Once weekly earnings exceed &euro;352, Class A PRSI at the rate of 4% is charged on all earnings.  Prior to the introduction of the PRSI credit in January 2016, the weekly PRSI charge for employees whose earnings for the first time exceed &euro;352 increased from nil to &euro;14.08. This &quot;step effect&quot; created a significant poverty trap for those who received an increase in their earnings or who increased their engagement in the workforce.</p><p>The PRSI credit was introduced in 2016 to address this &quot;step effect&quot; by reducing the weekly PRSI charge from &euro;14.08 to &euro;2.08, at earnings of &euro;352.01.For weekly earnings between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424.00, the maximum weekly PRSI credit of &euro;12 is reduced on a tapered basis.  At earnings of &euro;424.01, the credit is exhausted. </p><p>The fact that the PRSI credit applies between &euro;352 and &euro;424 means that the measure is targeted at those in the earnings range directly affected by the previous &quot;step effect&quot; and ensures the cost efficiency of the measure.  It is estimated that the credit will have a cost of &euro;18.3m in 2019.While it is appreciated that there is a calculation involved in the determination of the level of credit to apply to individual employees, this calculation is fully explained on the Department's website, <i>www.welfare.ie</i>and in the Department's information guides and leaflets.</p><p>Increasing the PRSI employee threshold to &euro;424 would lead to the creation of a new &quot;step effect&quot; where no PRSI charge would arise at &euro;424 but an increase in pay would mean a charge of &euro;16.94 would arise. This new, higher, &quot;step effect&quot; would create a new poverty trap which would have to be alleviated by the introduction a new PRSI credit.  This would incur further costs to the Social Insurance Fund.  </p><p>Increasing the employee PRSI threshold to From &euro;352 to &euro;424 would cost &euro;25.8m and affect 102,000 employees.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It was renamed guardian&rsquo;s payment in July 2006, in recognition of the fact that the original remit of the scheme had been extended to include certain children who had not lost both parents through bereavement. </p>  <p>  There are two Guardians Payment schemes: Guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), based on the PRSI contributions of the orphans parents or step-parent; and guardian&rsquo;s payment (non-contributory), which is based on the means of the orphan.  </p>  <p>  A Guardians payment is made to a person caring for a child who satisfies the definition of an &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; under social welfare legislation.   A child is considered an orphan if they are under 18 (or 22 if in full time education) and both parents are deceased; or one parent is either dead or unknown or has abandoned and failed to provide for the child and the other parent is unknown or has abandoned and failed to provide for the child. </p>  <p>  Currently, there are around 1,600 people receiving guardian&rsquo;s payments in respect of approximately 2,300 children; approximately 1,100 are in receipt of guardians payment (contributory) and approximately 500 are in receipt of guardians payment (non-contributory).  Expenditure on guardian&rsquo;s payments schemes (contributory and non-contributory) was        &euro;19.7 million in 2017. </p>  <p>  If either of the child&rsquo;s parents or step parents paid 26 weeks social insurance contributions, the orphan is entitled to Guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), provided they satisfy the other conditions.   If no entitlement to guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory) exists, an assessment for entitlement to  guardian&rsquo;s payment (non-contributory) is made.  Qualification for guardians payment (non-contributory) is determined based on the means of the orphan - not the person receiving the payment.  </p>  <p>  Means assessments for qualification for other services and supports are a matter for the relevant authority.  For example, there no automatic entitlement to a medical card for a child in respect of whom a guardian&rsquo;s payment is being made and any proposal to extend medical card eligibility to these children is a matter for consideration by the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory) and guardian&rsquo;s payment (non-contributory) are, respectively, social insurance and social assistance (means-tested) payments made to a person caring for a child, where that child is defined as an orphan under social welfare legislation.  The purpose of the guardian&rsquo;s payment scheme is to provide income support in respect of those children whose parents are unable to provide for them, through death or other circumstances. </p>  <p>  Currently, there are around 1,600 people receiving guardian&rsquo;s payments in respect of approximately 2,300 children.  Expenditure on guardian&rsquo;s payments schemes (contributory and non-contributory) was &euro;19.7 million in 2017.  </p>  <p>  The guardian&rsquo;s payments scheme was reviewed in 2011.  The main recommendation from that review was that my Department should consult with the Department of  Children and Youth Affairs [then the Department of Health and Children] regarding the possible alignment of the foster care allowance scheme and guardians payment.  That consultation has highlighted that there are very different policy perspectives and principles governing both schemes, that the nature and purposes of the schemes are diverse, and that the qualifying and operating conditions of the schemes vary considerably.     </p>  <p>  Since that review, budget increases of &euro;20 per week have been implemented in Budgets 2017 and 2018.

Prior to this cap on expenditure the rate of payment to operators participating in the scheme was reviewed regularly and adjusted on the basis of changes in rates of fares.  Funding for the scheme was increased by &euro;3m in Budget 2016 to allow more operators join the scheme and by a further &euro;10m in 2018, bringing the current allocation to &euro;90m. </p>  <p>  Payments to private travel operators participating in the free travel scheme are determined by way of a survey of their passenger numbers.  An average fee is agreed on foot of surveys undertaken over a six month period and based on the operator&rsquo;s own fare charges.  This is then discounted by 30% to reflect the fares foregone nature of the scheme. New private operators seeking to enter the scheme or existing operators seeking an increase in their payments must engage in this survey process. At any given time, there are some private operators engaged in the survey process.</p>  <p>  In relation to the CI&Eacute; Group, rather than carrying out specific surveys of usage, my Department moved many years ago to a service model based on the transportation infrastructure and the introduction of new services e.g. DART, LUAS and removal of the restrictions on free travel during peak hours. At each stage, my Department has negotiated rates and discounts to reflect these developments. </p>  <p>  My Department pays the CI&Eacute; Group centrally in respect of transport services provided nationwide by Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO routes.

These include the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST) payment where the youngest child is aged 7-13 years (inclusive) and the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) payment which may be paid to lone parents where the youngest child is aged 14 or over.  The Working Family Payment (WFP), is also available to lone parents who are working 19 or more hours per week.  Lone parents who move to WFP may also apply for the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD).</p>  <p>  The concurrent payment of JST and WFP contradicts the policy goal of the changes to the OFP scheme, which were to tackle long-term social welfare dependency - and its associated poverty risks - through a tapering of income supports and a more active engagement process offering enhanced educational, training and employment supports.  </p>  <p>  Lone parents currently on JST who increase their working hours to 19 or more per week can transfer from JST to WFP.  A lone parent in receipt of WFP is not at risk of poverty and so the goal of income adequacy is met without the need for the concurrent payment of JST and WFP. </p>  <p>  The cost of concurrently paying JST and WFP or of increasing the age limit for a qualified child for the jobseeker's transitional payment (JST) to while the youngest child remains in secondary school is not easily estimated. </p>  <p>  There are significant barriers to undertaking such an exercise.  For example, customers may no longer be within the welfare system, while others could seek to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance (JA), the Working Family Payment (WFP) and the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) back to JST.  It would be difficult for my Department to estimate the magnitude of this flow into and between schemes with any degree of accuracy. </p>  <p>  Likewise, the number of young people 18 years of age and over who are still in secondary education, and the proportion of those who are the children of lone parents in receipt of benefits is not readily available or easily estimated.  As these unknown factors are critical to providing a reliable costing my Department is not in a position to provide the costing requested.</p></reply>

Child Benefit is currently paid to almost 628,000 families in respect of over 1.2 million children, with an estimated expenditure of more than &euro;2 billion in 2018. </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for payment of child benefit, a person must satisfy what is known as the Habitual Residence Condition. It is not possible to predict with any degree of accuracy the cost of removing the habitual residency condition for access to Child Benefit. </p>  <p>  For example, and to consider just one group of people who may not meet this condition, according to figures produced in July of this year by the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) there were just over 1,500 children resident in RIA accommodation. However, as this Department does not hold information regarding their ages or school attendance records it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the numbers eligible or the cost of extending child benefit to these children.  Other groups who may not initially meet the HRC condition could include returning immigrants or people temporarily resident or resident for short stays, who retain a centre of interests elsewhere.  As these numbers vary constantly a reliable estimate of cost is not possible.</p>  <p>  As a general guide on cost, every 1,000 additional Child Benefit claims would cost &euro;1.68 million.</p></reply>

These include the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) payment which may be paid to lone parents where the youngest child is aged 14 or over, and the Working Family Payment (WFP), available to lone parents who are working 19 or more hours per week.   Lone parents who move to WFP may also apply for the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD).  </p>  <p>  There are significant barriers to accurately estimating the cost of extending the jobseeker's transitional payment (JST) until the youngest child is eighteen years of age, and until a child finishes secondary school.  For example, some customers may no longer be within the welfare system, while others could seek to move from alternative payments such as Jobseekers Allowance (JA), the Working Family Payment (WFP) and the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) back to JST.  It would be difficult for my Department to estimate the magnitude of this flow into and between schemes with any degree of accuracy. </p>  <p>  Likewise, the number of young people 18 years of age and over who are still in secondary education, and the proportion of those who are the children of lone parents in receipt of benefits is not readily available or easily estimated.  As these unknown factors are critical to providing a reliable costing my Department is not in a position to provide the costing requested.</p></reply>

Where a person has weekly maintenance payments of more than &euro;95.23, the next &euro;75 is disregarded in full with 25% of any additional maintenance above &euro;170.23 also disregarded. The contribution towards a customer&rsquo;s rent is the aggregate amount of: &euro;95.23 primary payment disregard plus 75% of any maintenance payments in excess of &euro;170.23 plus the customer&rsquo;s &euro;30 minimum contribution. The interaction between rent supplement, the primary scheme and maintenance ensures that recipient retains their full primary payment entitlement whilst making a reasonable contribution towards their accommodation costs.</p>  <p>  Any alteration in the amount of maintenance payment being disregarded for rent supplement would have to consider reciprocal alterations in the disregards of the respective primary payments. Any unilateral changes to the rent supplement scheme, i.e., not altering primary payment schemes&rsquo; disregards, could only be considered in a budgetary context and within the scope of the overall resources available.  </p>  <p>The cost impact of this exercise, of a unilateral removal of the &euro;95.23 rent supplement provision, is not possible to calculate at this time  .</p>  <p>  The calculation of differential rents for HAP with respect to maintenance payments is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p></reply>

This Strategy is spearheaded by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting vulnerable households from energy poverty through a combination of supports, investment in schemes to improve energy efficiency, and energy efficiency awareness initiatives.  One of the best ways to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.  The Warmer Homes Scheme, administered by Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, is designed to do that.  Earlier this year, this scheme was expanded to include recipients of Domiciliary Care Allowance and further expansion to include carers is under consideration.  I understand the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is reviewing the scheme and my officials will participate in that.  It is clear that, in addition to assisting Ireland in reducing carbon emissions, it will also reduce the impact of carbon tax on householders which have benefitted from this scheme.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Insurance Committee, a sub-committee of the County and City Management Association (CCMA) with representatives from the CCMA, local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency, as well as my Department and has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities since 1 July 1986.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the group policy scheme is that it is obligatory for all borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.</p>  <p>  The local authority MPI is designed to provide an appropriate level of insurance cover to those who wish to avail of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. It offers a number of additional features over and above the standard MPI products available on the market. Standard MPI products are individually priced, based on a member&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement, offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme also provides other benefits over standard MPI products. These include the payment of mortgage repayments if there is a valid claim as a result of disability; an additional payment of &euro;3,000 in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, separate to life cover; and members are also covered for death up to age 75 rather than 65 as is the case under standard MPI cover. </p>  <p>  The insurance scheme is subject to periodic review and competitive tendering, in accordance with the terms of EU Directives relating to the award of public service contracts.

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. </p>  <p>  Under the 2006 Fire Service Capital Programme a proposal by Laois County Council to build a new fire station at Rathdowney was received by my Department and approval in principle was granted to proceed to the planning stages. Laois County Council submitted cost and design plans on 2 June 2009 for consideration by my Department. At that time Laois County Council were asked to review these plans with a view to finding savings as it was felt the project offered insufficient value for money.  </p>  <p>  A re-assessment of fire station projects was undertaken in 2015. This graded proposals on the basis of:</p>  <p>  -  Area Risk Categorisation of the Fire Station (population, fire risks etc.)</p>  <p>  -  Established Health and Safety Needs </p>  <p>  -  The state of development of the project (is site acquired etc.?)</p>  <p>  -  The Value for Money offered by the proposal</p>  <p>  In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on an annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres. Under this programme, the list of priority projects to be progressed will be kept under review on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  A fire station project for Rathdowney is not included in the current 5 year programme, but my Department will have regard to Laois County Council&rsquo;s priorities and the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide for funding in further considering any proposal. Refurbishments of Fire Stations in Mountmellick and Mountrath are included in the 5 year programme and my Department continues to work with Laois County Council to progress these projects.</p></reply>

Replacing the time-limited claw-back which applied under the various affordable housing schemes in operation previously under the scheme now being introduced, the local authority will have a fully repayable equity stake equivalent to the discount provided (relative to the market price), repayable on re-sale or within the charge period of at least 25 years.</p>  <p>  An Affordable Dwellings Fund, managed by the Housing Finance Agency, will be established under the legislation into which funds accruing, in due course, from repayments of equity stakes by purchasers will be lodged, providing a long-run funding stream for affordable housing.</p>  <p>  The scheme is targeted at low- to middle-income households with a maximum gross income of less than &euro;50,000 (single applicants) and &euro;75,000 (joint applicants).

The increased provision of PBSA was established as a key priority in addressing the current wider housing crisis.</p><p>My Department is continuing to support the Department of Education and Skills, through the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Student Accommodation, in examining the issue of student housing and potential policy measures to increase accommodation supply. This Group, which includes stakeholders from the Higher Education Institutes, Union of Students in Ireland and other Government Departments, highlighted important issues in developing new student accommodation projects, including the planning and development finance aspects in assembling new development projects.</p><p>The work of this Group led directly to the initiation of reforms in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 which provided for the fast-tracking of planning applications for student housing construction projects of greater than 200 bed spaces to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. In addition, the legislation provides for the availability of low-cost financing from the Housing Finance Agency to the Higher Education Institutes specifically for new student accommodation projects. </p><p>My Department has also assisted in the preparation of the National Student Accommodation Strategywhich was launched by the Department of Education and Skills in July 2017 &ndash; a specific action committed to under Rebuilding Ireland. This policy document was developed with input from the key stakeholders in the sector and includes eight key targets and 27 actions to support the delivery of an increased supply of purpose-built student accommodation.</p><p>These, and other measures by my Department, have assisted in delivering a significant increase in the level of purpose-built student accommodation projects coming forward nationally.</p><p>Recent analysis from the Higher Education Authority has indicated that, by May 2018, approximately 3,000 bed spaces had been delivered since the publication of Rebuilding Ireland and some further 7,250 bed spaces are currently under construction nationally. In addition, over 7,000 bed spaces have received planning permission but are yet to commence construction and a further 1,200 are seeking planning permission. The scale of this level of additional student accommodation is on course to meet the 7,000 new bed space target by 2019 identified in Rebuilding Ireland and the 21,000 new bed space target by 2024 identified in the National Student Accommodation Strategy  . </p><p>In tandem with measures to increase new purpose-built student accommodation supply, my Department has supported the initiative of the Minister for Finance in increasing the availability of student accommodation in private homes through the &quot;rent a room&quot; provisions whereby a tax exemption for the homeowner of up to &euro;14,000 per year can be availed of.</p><p>Since 2016, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, my Department has also provided funding to the Union of Students in Ireland for their &lsquo;Homes for Study&rsquo; campaign &ndash; this essentially funds a website and activities to match students with rooms in private houses through the following weblink:<i></i>.</p></reply>

These guidelines are applicable to assessing the implications of coastal flooding which may arise from climate change  or major weather events. Clear technical guidance is given as to how to assess the implications of flooding (including coastal) in the context of spatial plan-making and the assessment of development proposals. It is considered that current planning policy is robust and sufficient to effectively assess, mitigate and manage the implications of climate change on our coastline and its effects on coastal communities.  </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland is currently developing a National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) to stand as a marine parallel to the National Planning Framework  . The NMPF will enable the Government to set a clear direction for managing our seas, to clarify objectives and priorities, and to direct decision makers, users and stakeholders towards more strategic and efficient use of marine resources. It will inform decisions about the current and future development of the marine area, aiming to integrate needs. The NMPF will bring climate change into decision-making around marine planning, through considering climate change from two perspectives; how actions under the marine plan may help to mitigate climate change and how actions under the plan need to be adapted to take account of the effects of climate change. </p>  <p>  The Government published its NMPF Baseline Report on 18 September 2018 for a three-month consultation period.  I expect to be in a position to publish the first draft plan in mid-2019 with the final statutory NMPF due for adoption by 2021.</p></reply>

The intention was that this investment would be off-balance sheet and in Budget 2015, the Government announced that &euro;400m of public investment would be made available, including the proceeds from the sale of Bord G&aacute;is, to provide 2,000 homes. The objective was that this investment could leverage private sector finance from the EIB, ISIF, pension funds, credit unions and other financial institutions.</p>  <p>  A structured, formal process was put in place to facilitate engagement with these bodies.  A body called the Social Housing Investment Proposals Clearing House Group was established to examine and consider proposals and to meet with the companies, groups and institutions involved. However, despite a detailed investigation of options to use the available funding in this way, including a high level of engagement with potential social housing providers and potential financiers of social housing, no new model that would, of itself, be capable of providing and/or financing social housing on an off-balance sheet basis could be identified that would be capable of utilising the available funding.</p>  <p>In response to this outcome, it was decided to modify the original commitment in relation to the &euro;400m funding to provide &euro;10m per annum, indexed for inflation, over a longer period (20 years). As indicated in the Government's 2018 Expenditure Report, this &euro;10 million allocation is built into my Department&rsquo;s current ceiling for 2018, and is being utilised to support the delivery of social housing programmes in accordance with the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan,   as outlined in previous Parliamentary Question replies. As also outlined previously, the affordable rental concept is now instead being progressed on publicly owned  lands, using a cost rental approach, through two initial projects being rolled out in Dublin, with others to follow.</p></reply>

To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p>  <p>  The Housing (Sale of Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 governing the Scheme provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, houses specifically designed for older persons, group Traveller housing and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living. </p>  <p>  Local authorities may also, within the provisions of the Regulations, exclude certain houses which, in the opinion of the authority, should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.

As signalled in Budget 2018, the rate of the levy has increased to 7% for sites on the register from 2019 onwards.</p>  <p>  My Department does not maintain a central register of vacant sites, as each local authority administers the vacant site register in respect of their functional area. As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website. However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that there are collectively almost 290 individual sites currently on the local registers.  Over 160 of these sites were entered on the local vacant site registers on 1 January 2018 and will therefore be subject to the levy in 2019, unless development works are activated in the interim. </p>  <p>  The specific information sought by the Deputy in relation to the amount of the levy that would be raised in particular circumstances is not available in my Department. However, based on current legislative provisions and a recent review of the sites currently listed on local authority registers, it is estimated that the levy proceeds nationally could be &euro;8.3m in 2019 (applying the current 3% levy rate) and &euro;29.4m in 2020 (applying the increased 7% levy rate). The latter estimate for 2020 is based on the number of sites currently included on the local vacant site registers and in respect of which market valuations have been attached to the registered sites. It is expected that the number of registered sites in respect of which market valuations will be obtained will increase in the coming months which should result in an increase in the estimated levy proceeds nationally for 2020.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being effectively applied, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.</p></reply>

This included an analysis of the financial impact of the Eurostat decision to reclassify the majority of Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) as part of the local government sector. This was an important first step in the Government's assessment as to the impact of the Eurostat decision. </p>  <p>  Following the SPU, further work has been on-going in order to fully assess the implications of the reclassification decision. My Department is continuing to engage with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, with technical support from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) and the Housing Agency (HA), in order to ensure that AHBs can continue to fulfil their full potential in the delivery of the targets set out in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the AHB sector and constructive discussions have taken place with representative bodies from the sector on the issue. The sector itself has engaged its own research on the matter, and my Department is evaluating that research as part of its ongoing wider consideration on the issue.</p>  <p>  The AHB representative bodies have committed to continue to undertake further research and analysis into this issue over the coming months. This will assess the options available to create the necessary conditions to allow this classification decision to be revisited in the future. An important part of this exercise will be to examine what measures could be taken to develop the AHB sector in such a way so that it could be reclassified as being off the Government&rsquo;s balance sheet in the longer term.</p>  <p>  As previously noted, the Government continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to delivery of social housing under Rebuilding Ireland. It is committed to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that we maintain the momentum towards meeting the ambitious 50,000 social housing target under the Action Plan.</p></reply>

To this end, details of some 1,700 hectares of land in local authority and Housing Agency ownership were published on the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map, with the potential to deliver some 42,500 homes nationally. This includes circa 135 hectares in the functional area of Kildare County Council. These mapped sites can be viewed at the following link:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Local authorities will continue to maximise the use of publicly owned lands for social housing, affordable purchase, and cost rental.</p><p>In addition to the active management of the publicly owned land bank, assessments of population and housing need are required. The Summary of Social Housing Assessments is conducted annually, specifically assessing the social housing needs of the population. The 2018 summary which has been published this week and is available on the Department's website, show that 71,858 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of a social housing support as of 11 June 2018; this represents a decrease of 13,941 households or 16% on the last assessment in June 2017. Indeed, since Rebuilding Ireland, the numbers of those waiting on social housing homes, has dropped from 91,600 to 71,858.  In Kildare, there has been a 22% in 2018 in the number of households qualifying for social housing support, down from 5,103 households in June 2017 to 3,962 in 2018.</p><p>With specific reference to Co Kildare, the Council has prepared the Kildare County Development Plan 2017-2023, which seeks, amongst other things, to address housing needs specific to Kildare, particularly in section 2.8 - Population and Housing Growth. The plan is available at the following link:</p><p><i>www.kildare.ie/countycouncil/Planning/developmentplans/KildareCountyDevelopmentPlan2017-2023/</i>.</p><p>Also, an overall Housing Need Demand Assessment (HNDA) will be required to be undertaken in future planning, in accordance with the vision as set out in Project Ireland 2040 and the National Planning Framework.</p><p>With regard to social housing delivery in County Kildare, this data is published quarterly. The most recent report which I published today, reflects the position at the end of Quarter 2 of 2018 and is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>This latest report shows 544 homes added to the social housing stock in County Kildare through build, acquisition and leasing in the first six months of this year.</p><p>Regarding affordable housing, a multi-pronged approach is being pursued, targeting households on low to moderate annual gross incomes of maximum &euro;50,000 for a single applicant and maximum &euro;75,000 for joint applicants.  </p><p>In terms of affordable housing for purchase, the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 have now been commenced.</p><p>In terms of affordable rental I am determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live as well as work. Two cost rental projects have previously been announced for Emmet Road, Inchicore, and at Enniskerry Road, Dundrum. On foot of these pilots, cost rental will be rolled out across other suitable sites.</p><p>In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing Exchequer funding of &euro;75 million for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund over the four years to 2021.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be available under the Fund to offset the costs of providing both on-site and off-site enabling infrastructure for sites in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing. </p><p>A total of &euro;15 million Exchequer funding has been allocated for 2018, to which the local authority minimum contribution of &euro;5 million will be added. This should enable the provision of infrastructure for some 500 affordable homes this year, based on a maximum level of &euro;40,000 infrastructure investment per home. The bids that have been received from 9 local authorities, including from Kildare County Council, under the first call are now being assessed, and I expect to make initial funding awards next month.  </p><p>From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites for at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority owned land.  </p><p>In addition, the Government has now launched the Land Development Agency, which will be aiming to deliver some 150,000 new homes over the next 20 years. The new Agency has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites, and will deliver at least 40% of any housing potential on such lands for both social and affordable housing purposes.</p><p>My Department is continuing to work with all local authorities and State bodies to ensure that housing is delivered from appropriately located and publicly owned sites to meet our current and future housing requirements.</p><p>My Department does not maintain a record of private contractors. Rather, construction tenders are publicly available online at <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>, where contractors may tender for public construction work available in local authority areas.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>The accepted benchmark of housing affordability is that households, particularly low- to moderate-income households, should not be paying more than one third or 35% of their disposable income on accommodation costs and the income thresholds for access to social housing support generally achieve this. Recognising that there are people who do not qualify for social housing but find it very challenging to purchase or rent at market rates, the Government has brought in new measures specifically targeted at delivering affordable homes. </p><p>Affordable housing is generally targeted at households earning a maximum gross income of &euro;50,000 (single applicant) or &euro;75,000 (joint applicant). Affordable homes to buy will be delivered under a new statutory Scheme; the relevant provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 have been commenced and regulations &amp;amp; guidance are being finalised. </p><p>This new Scheme replaces all previous affordable purchase schemes; is led by housing authorities; is a shared equity scheme with a fully repayable equity share/discount; eligibility and priority are set out in the legislation and will be expanded upon in the regulations; and the equity repayments will be pooled into a strategic affordable housing fund managed by the HFA. </p><p>The Scheme is complementary to other Government schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was introduced from 1 February 2018, following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan. The new loan enables credit worthy first time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise be able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p><p>Single applicants for the loan may earn up to &euro;50,000 gross per annum, while the combined income of joint applicants may be up to &euro;75,000 per annum.  These income limits are unchanged from the previous local authority loan offerings. The maximum dual-income threshold also applies to the new Affordable Purchase Scheme which will enable a maximum purchase price of c. &euro;320,000, which is in line with the purchase limits set out under the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.</p><p>It is important to note that there are no set minimum income limits for the scheme; however, applicants must be capable of repaying the mortgage in accordance with the statutory credit policy underpinning the loan.</p><p>Full details of the loan&rsquo;s eligibility criteria and other information are available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website:</p><p><i></i>.  Subject to certain conditions, any person who meets the eligibility criteria may apply for a loan regardless of whether or not they are on the local authority housing list or qualified for social housing support.</p><p>There is also a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, in order to support housing affordability, national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live as well as work. Cost rental is an important component of progressive housing systems around Europe and after detailed financial modelling by my Department, the National Development Finance Agency and the European Investment Bank/Housing Finance Agency, Dublin City Council is working on the first major cost rental project  to deliver over 300 cost rental homes at Emmet Road, Inchicore, as part of a mixed-tenure development of some 470 homes in total. </p><p>In parallel, the Housing Agency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working on a smaller-scale cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, the tenders for which have been issued.  Learning from these pilot projects, cost rental will now be rolled out across other suitable sites.</p><p>As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports is underway. The Housing Agency is carrying out the detailed statistical work which will underpin this review on behalf of my Department. The review will obviously have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The Action Plan is supported by &euro;6 billion in funding, which means that local authorities have the financial support available to them to deliver on their local targets.  </p><p>I have provided all local authorities with their individual social housing targets across all delivery streams, including build. Details of these targets are available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>.  </p><p>My Department also publishes information on the approved social housing construction projects in all counties via quarterly Construction Status Reports.

I am keen, however, that all local authorities, further accelerate their programmes and I have assured them that the necessary funding to support their activity is available. This includes developing their own land banks and working with approved housing bodies and developers on all new opportunities. </p><p>Logistical challenges will always arise with a significant programme of new construction but my Department works with all local authorities, approved housing bodies and other statutory bodies to overcome these. My Department's engagement with the local authorities regarding the delivery of social housing includes ongoing contact on a very regular basis on individual projects and structured quarterly meetings to review progress on all projects. These engagements can also involve site visits to review project activity at first hand. </p><p>Elected Members play an important role in relation to social housing delivery in terms of approving new projects under the Part 8 process. They can also play an important role in overseeing their authority's work to make sure projects are advanced in a timely manner. Elected members on Housing Strategic Policy Committees can play a particularly important role in scrutinising delivery.</p></reply>

The most recently conducted SSHA, carried out in June 2018, details the number of households on all local authority waiting lists as at 11 June 2018 (the count date). </p><p>The results show that, on the count date, 71,858 households were assessed as qualified and being in need of a social housing support.  This represents a decrease of 13,941 households or 16.2% on the last assessment in June 2017. Since commencing Rebuilding Ireland, Action Plan for Housing and Homeless in 2016, the numbers of households on social housing waiting lists have dropped from 91,600 to 71,858 &ndash; a reduction of 22%.  </p><p>Under Rebuilding Ireland, a total of 50,000 social housing homes will be delivered through build, acquisition and leasing programmes.  In addition to this, 87,000 additional households will be supported through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP) and the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS). </p><p>The combination of 50,000 social housing homes and 87,000 HAP and RAS social housing supports, which are being funded by the Government in the period 2016 to 2021, means that over 137,000 long term and flexible options will be made available to those on housing waiting lists under Rebuilding Ireland. </p><p>The Government, working with the local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies and other delivery agents, is already exceeding the delivery targets set for the first two years of Rebuilding Ireland.

My Department does not directly collect information on the number of loan applications received by each local authority.</p><p>However, as is currently the case, my Department will continue to publish information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns.  Information up to Q4 2017 is available on the Department's website at the following link:</p><p><i></i>, and this information will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional data is compiled.</p><p>In addition, the Housing Agency provides a central support service which assesses loan applications that are made to the local authorities and makes recommendations to the authorities as to whether loans should be offered to applicants.  I have asked the Agency to centrally compile figures on the numbers of applications that it has assessed and the most recent figures, as at the end of August, indicate that the Agency had received a total of 2,628 applications for assessment from local authorities. Of the 2,628 applications received, 2,074 were deemed to be valid. Of these valid applications, 1,989 had been assessed and 1,024 of these (51%) had been recommended for approval. </p><p>As has been the case since the introduction of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, applications are made directly to the local authority in which the applicant wishes to purchase a property. Applications are then processed by the local authority before being sent to the Housing Agency for assessment. Based on this comprehensive financial analysis, the Housing Agency makes a recommendation to the local authority on each application. </p><p>Each local authority must have in place a credit committee which makes the final decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the statutory credit policy issued in accordance with the Regulations and having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency.</p><p>The purpose of the scheme is to enable credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range, where they have been unable to obtain sufficient mortgage finance from a commercial lender.  However, in accordance with the statutory credit policy, as with any other loan, potential borrowers must be credit-worthy and must demonstrate that they have the ability to repay the loan. It would be irresponsible to give individuals approval for loans that may see them placed under undue financial strain. The creditworthiness checks that are part of the approvals process for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and which may result in individuals being refused, help to safeguard against this eventuality and assist in protecting both the applicant and the Exchequer.</p><p>Of the 1,989 applications underwritten to the end of August 2018, 49% were not recommended for approval. Reasons for applications not being reconsidered under the scheme include an inability to satisfactorily demonstrate sufficient repayment capacity for the loan, or having an unsatisfactory savings record.</p></reply>

I understand that it is a condition of the Basic Payment Scheme that farmers must be compliant with the requirements of the Habitats and Birds Directives.</p>  <p>  In order to avoid both accidental or deliberate damage in designated sites, it is necessary to have a system by which potentially damaging activities require consent before they can be carried out. This consent is required from me as Minister or, as appropriate, from another licensing or permitting authority. Each regulatory authority must take into account the requirements of the Habitats and Birds Directives before consenting to an activity, as is the case of the approval of GLAS plans by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. In some cases, planning permissions may be required.</p>  <p>  Where consents are required of my Department, these are referred to as Activities Requiring Consent.  The Activities Requiring Consent are most often applicable to new activities, or an intensification of existing activities, but this is not always the case. Depending on the scale and type of activity proposed, my Department's staff may be able to make a determination on consent or may require further information to make such a determination. This is not a matter of qualification or experience - it is incompatible with the Directives, and Irish law, to make such determinations without adequate information. </p>  <p>  This matter is one of the subjects under discussion in a series of meetings currently underway between my officials and  the farming organisations.
