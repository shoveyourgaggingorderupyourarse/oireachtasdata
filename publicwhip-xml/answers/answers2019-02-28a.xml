The Central Bank have advised the following:</p>  <p>  "When a consumer takes out a loan from a regulated lender (&ldquo;the original lender&rdquo;) it is subject to all the relevant Irish and EU consumer protections.  Most loan agreements include a clause that allows the original lender to sell the loan on to another firm. </p>  <p>  &ldquo;Under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018, which came into effect on 21 January 2019, if a loan is transferred, the holder of the legal title to the credit must now be authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm.  Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA).&rdquo;</p>  <p>  &ldquo;However, while the legislative framework has been expanded to include the regulation of both loan owners and credit servicing, this does not give the Central Bank a statutory role in the setting of interest rates, which is a commercial decision for each regulated entity.  Credit servicing firms (similar to any regulated lender) are entitled to make certain commercial decisions in relation to borrowers outside of the regulatory arena.&rdquo;</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-28a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022800062#WRA01400"><p>The Deputy refers specifically to a figure of &lsquo;almost &euro;100 million in relief carried forward&rsquo; which he suggests could be offset against tax in future. I assume the Deputy is referring to the information provided in Row 47 of Table 3 of the 2016 Revenue report entitled &lsquo;Analysis of High Income Individuals&rsquo;, specifically with regard to the 346 cases where excess relief was carried forward under section 485F of the Taxes Consolidation Act, totalling &euro;97,808,596.  It should be noted that this table refers to the actual amounts of specified reliefs, including excess relief, that were used in 2016 by those affected by the restriction, not relief which is due to be carried forward in the future. </p>  <p>  The High Income Individuals&rsquo; Restriction, was announced in Budget 2006 and came into effect from 1 January 2007. The aim of the measure is to limit the use of certain tax reliefs and exemptions, known as &lsquo;specified reliefs&rsquo;, by those on high incomes. Prior to the introduction of this restriction, such individuals, by means of the cumulative use of various tax incentive reliefs, had been able to reduce their tax liability to very low levels or to zero. The restriction works by limiting the total amount of "specified reliefs" that a high income individual can use to reduce his or her tax liability in any one tax year.</p>  <p>  The restriction, as originally introduced, was designed to ensure that individuals with adjusted income exceeding &euro;500,000 paid an effective rate of tax of approximately 20% on that income. Where adjusted income was between &euro;250,000 and &euro;500,000, a tapering system ensured that there was a graduated introduction of the restriction, with the effective rate of tax increasing towards 20% as adjusted income increased towards &euro;500,000. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2010, changes to the restriction from the 2010 tax year were announced. Those individuals with adjusted income exceeding &euro;400,000, as a result, now pay an effective income tax rate of approximately 30% on that income, while individuals now become subject to the restriction and the associated taper, where adjusted income is &euro;125,000 or greater and where they claim &euro;80,000 or more in specified reliefs.</p>  <p>  The policy intention of the restriction is to seek to improve the balance between promoting tax equity in relation to those on high incomes, while at the same time maintaining the incentive effect of the various tax reliefs which were introduced to achieve a particular public good.</p>  <p>  In his question, the Deputy makes reference to the provision under section 485F of the restriction, which allows for the carry-forward of the total amount of relief not used in a particular year as a result of the restriction. This is known as &lsquo;excess relief&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  Section 485F provides that excess relief can be carried forward to the following year (or years) and used as a deduction from the individual&rsquo;s total income in arriving at his or her taxable income for that year. Other relief to which the individual is entitled, including other specified reliefs for the particular year, is given priority to the excess relief carried forward. </p>  <p>  Reliefs carried forward as excess relief lose their character in that they are pooled together in a single amount and the pooled amount is then treated as a separate tax relief in its own right. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the pooled excess relief is treated as a &lsquo;specified relief&rsquo; in the year in which it is used for the purposes of deciding whether the restriction applies in that year. As such, the ability to carry-over excess relief does not affect the policy intent of the High Income Individuals&rsquo; Restriction, which is to ensure that high income individuals are subject to a certain minimum effective rate of income tax year-on-year. On that basis, I do not propose to amend the restriction as proposed by the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-02-28a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022800062#WRA01700"><p>Over the last decade, the household sector has undergone a significant period of active deleveraging. Since its peak of &euro;204 billion in Q3 2008, the level of household debt has decreased by 32 per cent, or &euro;66 billion. At end-Q3 2018, household debt stood at &euro;137.5 billion, or &euro;28,316 per capita, and is now at its lowest level since Q3 2005. </p>  <p>  Irish household debt stood at 48 per cent of GDP in 2017, down from a peak of 117 per cent in 2009.  A similar trend is seen when expressed as a share of GNI*, a measure of national income that controls for most of the multinational related distortions to GDP, with household debt now standing at 77 per cent of GNI*, down from 147 per cent in year 2009.</p>  <p>  Recent data from both the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Statistics Office indicate that the sustainability of household debt in Ireland has also continued to improve. From a peak of 215 per cent in Q3 2011, household debt as a share of disposable income has fallen to 126 per cent in Q3 2018, its lowest level since Q4 2003. </p>  <p>  However it should be noted that although household debt is now broadly back to pre-crisis levels, there still exist pockets of high household debt amongst certain households. The Irish household sector remain one of the most indebted in the EU. On a household debt per capita basis, current data shows that Ireland is the 6th   highest in the EU at &euro;29,000 per person. Thus the risk associated with household debt remains an issue which I closely monitor. Indeed many policy initiatives introduced in recent years, particularly in the area of mortgage arrears, along with Central Bank lending regulations, have had a very positive impact on household debt levels. </p>  <p>  Lastly in considering the role that debt plays in the economy, it is important to note, and also not lose sight of the fact that debt performs an important economic function for households and businesses, allowing them to spread and smooth their consumption and investment across time. Households require debt to purchase assets, entrepreneurs to start businesses, while established businesses require debt to invest and expand, all of which promotes economic growth.</p></reply>

This consultation process involved a wide range of stakeholders representing the different voices within this sector, including representative bodies, the major individual motor insurance providers and interest groups.  The impact of excessive premiums being charged to consumers from all counties across the country was a feature of this engagement process with industry.  </p><p>In addition, Department officials regularly raise specific issues affecting consumers across the country during their ongoing engagement with Insurance Ireland. Furthermore, I have separately met with representatives from insurance companies and other stakeholders in relation to a number of issues and the problems resulting from high insurance premiums have been discussed during these engagements.</p><p>Quarterly progress updates on the implementation of the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>and the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance</i>provide more detailed information on the implementation of each of the recommendations and actions.  The seventh quarterly update was published in November and is available on the Department&rsquo;s website the eighth quarterly report is expected to be published in the coming days. </p><p>Alongside delivering fairer premiums for consumers, a key objective of the Working Group is to create a more competitive insurance market overall in this country.  I believe that the full implementation of all of the recommendations will make Ireland more attractive to new entrants, thus increasing capacity as well as competition.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that the nature of the EU Single Market is such that insurance undertaking authorised in other member states are allowed conduct business in the Irish market on either a freedom of service basis or a freedom of establishment basis, consequently there are no restrictions preventing such companies entering this market if they wish.  You should also be aware that Recommendation 5 of the <i>Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance</i>called for the Department to support efforts and raise awareness of the need to improve cross-border insurance at EU level.  Accordingly, the Department is monitoring developments at EU level on an ongoing basis and has instructed the Permanent Representation in Brussels to hold consultations with relevant institutions on issues raised in the Working Group&rsquo;s Reports.  </p></reply>

The Order of the Government establishing the Commission is set out in the Commission of lnvestigation (National Asset Management Agency) Order 2017 (S.l. No. 267 of 2017). Under that Order, the Taoiseach was appointed as the specified Minister, for the purposes of section 3(3)(b) of the Act. The Honourable John D. Cooke, retired judge of the High Court, was appointed as sole member of the Commission.</p>  <p>  The Rules and Procedures of the Commission were drafted and formally adopted by the sole member on 22nd August 2017, pursuant to section 15 of the Act.  The Rules and Procedures of the Commission contain General Guidelines on the Payment of Legal Costs.  These guidelines were prepared by the Taoiseach (as specified Minister) following consultation with the Commission and with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as required by the Act.   </p>  <p>  The Rules and Procedures of the Commission allows for legal fees to be recovered from the Commission in certain circumstances.  In short these are where: i) the good name or conduct of the witness are called into question by any evidence received by the Commission; or (ii) other personal or property rights of the witness are at risk of being jeopardised as a result of any evidence received by the Commission.  The Rules and Procedures set out the basis and process for recovery of costs from the Commission in further detail, and cap the costs relating to legal representation before the Commission as follows:</p>  <p>  Senior Counsel: &euro;788.27 per diem (excluding VAT);</p>  <p>  Junior Counsel: &euro;394.14 per diem (excluding VAT); and </p>  <p>  Solicitor: &euro;624.00 per diem (excluding VAT).</p>  <p>  The Commission has called on two former officials of the Department and one current official to give evidence.  With the approval of the Office of the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office has instructed one junior counsel to provide legal representation to these witnesses in accordance with the Rules and Procedures of the Commission.  The same junior counsel is representing each witness.  The two witnesses who have appeared to date gave evidence over a half-day each.  It is expected that the third witness will also be called for less than one day. To date transcripts have only been provided to these officials in respect of their own evidence, thereby minimising any additional legal costs.  </p>  <p>  The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office will discharge the fees incurred in the provision of the services provided by the junior counsel in this case.  I am advised by the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office that no fees have been discharged to date. </p></reply>

The annual Action Plans under the IFS2020 strategy for 2017, 2018 and 2019 included measures to support a regional development. </p>  <p>  Employment in the sector under the IFS2020 Strategy has not been limited to Dublin.  Over a third of the jobs are located in other areas of the country. </p>  <p>  The sector has a significant presence in a number of regional locations including Cavan, Clare, Cork, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Leitrim, Limerick, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.</p>  <p>  A number of international financial services companies have chosen to build centres of excellence in regional locations in Ireland, taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the higher staff retention rates associated with operations outside of Dublin.</p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies actively promote the advantage of regional locations for the sector to both existing and target clients.  IDA Ireland has an active &lsquo;second site&rsquo; strategy where companies in Dublin are encouraged and supported to establish a second office in a regional location. Groups such as State Street in Kilkenny, Northern Trust in Limerick, MetLife in Galway and First Data in Nenagh have successfully established a regional presence through this channel.  Other public sector bodies that are identified in Action Plan 2019 as supporting the enterprise agencies include my Department and the nine Regional Skills Fora established under the Action Plans for Jobs. The agencies will report in the fourth quarter of 2019 on this work to the public sector High Level Implementation Committee, which is chaired by Minister of State Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy announced at the recent European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle that regionalisation will be a horizontal priority in the successor to the current strategy for international financial services. A number of action measures will be considered over the life of the future strategy and my officials will consult all stakeholders before undertaking annual action plans. The new Strategy and action plan will explore whether there are specific sectors of international financial services that can be identified and developed with the regions in mind.</p></reply>

The realisation of this surplus depends on the redemption of NAMA&rsquo;s remaining subordinated debt by March 2020 and completion of its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes.  </p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA must first use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its senior and subordinated debt. The Agency announced in October 2017 that it had redeemed all of its &euro;30.2bn in Senior Debt which was guaranteed by the State and since April 2018 it has commenced the redemption of its &euro;1.6bn in subordinated debt. Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full, which is expected to be in 2020. Following this NAMA will be in a position to start transferring its expected &euro;3.5bn surplus to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid, while Exchequer positive, will not impact the general government balance, in line with Eurostat rules. It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised within the framework of the fiscal rules at that time. The intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs. </p></reply>

However, it is clear that all forms of Brexit will have a negative impact on the Irish economy. The more disorderly the UK&rsquo;s exit is from the EU, the larger the economic impact will be. Further the implications for our economy will be disproportionate relative to those for the rest of the EU. The most negative impacts are likely to be in agri-food and indigenous manufacturing sectors.</p><p>While my Department&rsquo;s central economic and budgetary planning scenario remains an orderly exit based on the UK leaving with a transition arrangement in place, the risk of a disorderly Brexit has increased.</p><p>The UK is one of Ireland&rsquo;s most important trading partners. In 2017 the Department of Finance published a paper on <i>trade exposures</i>[*] which shows that relative to other EU Member States, Irish exports are substantially more exposed to the UK in a number of goods sectors. </p><p>The top five most exposed included the Irish agri-food sub-sectors Cereals, Vegetables and Fruit, and Live Animal products. In services, Ireland is in the upper range of the most exposed EU Member States, particularly in Financial Services. </p><p>The paper also finds that the share of exports going to the UK has increased in a number of sectors over the past 15 years, including the agri-food sector, contrary to the trend decline in the importance of the UK as export destination for overall Irish exports.</p><p>Maintaining the closest possible trading relationship between the EU and the UK is therefore one of the Government&rsquo;s key Brexit priorities. The Government will continue to work to improve the business environment &ndash; to make it more competitive, to assist exporters to diversify markets, and to provide better infrastructure. </p><p>Longer-term, we need to mitigate against the potential of regulatory divergence between the UK and EU standards given its potential implications for trade, investment and the competitiveness of our businesses. We will therefore be working to minimise this impact and to ensure a level playing field. </p><p>Since the referendum result in 2016, we have been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy so that we have the capacity to deal with adverse economic shocks. This includes building up our Fiscal Buffers &ndash; by balancing our books and reducing our debt burden - and establishing the Rainy Day Fund. </p><p>The Government is continuing to work to prepare our economy for the challenges of Brexit, including through the Ireland Connected Trade and Investment Strategy and the 10-year National Development Plan. In addition, recent budgets have introduced specific initiatives, such as loan supports for agri-businesses, aimed at supporting those businesses most affected by Brexit. </p><p>[*] Department of Finance (2017) <i>Trade Exposures of Sectors of the Irish Economy in a European Context</i>.</p></reply>

An appeal is therefore being brought before the European Courts. Such an appeal takes the form of an application to the General Court of the European Union, asking it to annul the Decision of the Commission. The Attorney General prepared the legal grounds in support of the annulment proceedings and the application has been lodged in the General Court of the European Union. As is normal practice, a summary of these have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.  They were also published on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website in December 2016. The case has been granted priority status and has been progressing through the various stages of private written proceedings before the General Court of the European Union.

Since 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 21 per cent.  </p>  <p>  The restoration of competitiveness has been hard-won through improvements in productivity, along with wage and price moderation. Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. For 2018 as a whole, the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices averaged just 0.7 per cent. This subdued level of inflation has continued into 2019, with annual inflation of just 0.8 per cent recorded in January. </p>  <p>  On the pay side, while average hourly earnings grew at just over 3 per cent in 2018, a noticeable increase on the growth rate of 1.7 per cent recorded in 2017, this came on the back of a near decade of low or negative growth in earnings. While gains in household incomes are welcome, particularly given the sacrifices made over the last decade, we need to avoid a significant acceleration in wages, given competitiveness considerations.</p>  <p>  Despite the competitiveness gains made over the last number of years, the risks to our economy are numerous and primarily external in nature. First and foremost is the potential fallout from a more adverse-than-expected outcome from Brexit. Secondly, given Ireland&rsquo;s position as a small open economy with a high degree of integration in global value chains, any further escalation in trade protectionism or a slowdown in global growth would have a disproportionate impact on the Irish economy.  In addition, a faster-than-expected normalisation of monetary policy, changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime and rising geopolitical uncertainty all have the potential to undermine growth in the economy.</p>  <p>  As many of the risks we are facing are external and thus beyond our control, the best way we can mitigate against them is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies, particularly those that increase productivity. Through the National Development Plan in particular, we are investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the recovery, such as the need for residential development and public infrastructure investment. This should ensure that our economy remains competitive and avoid the build-up of bottlenecks that could limit our growth potential.</p></reply>

The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are set out in an Action Plan.  </p><p>Work is ongoing on the implementation of the recommendations by the relevant Government Departments and Agencies and there is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare regular updates on its progress.  The seventh such update was published last November and shows that of the 59 separate applicable deadlines within the Action Plan set to the end of Q3 2018, 45 relate to actions which have now been completed.  Substantial work has also been undertaken in respect of the nine action points categorised as &ldquo;ongoing&rdquo;. </p><p>Key recommendations from the Motor Report that are currently being implemented are: </p><p>- The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 commenced in January 2019 to enable the Database to become fully functioning and to report later this year; this should provide a greater level of transparency in order to understandfor instance how claims costs impact premiums.</p><p>- The Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and forwarded to the President for his consideration and signature; this will  allow amongst other things  the review of cases where there is a non-attendance at medicals and where there is refusal to provide details of special damages.</p><p>- The finalisation and publication of the two reports by the Personal Injuries Commission, which are currently being actively considered with a view to seeing what can be done to deliver interim guidelines relating to appropriate general damages award levels for the soft tissue/whiplash injury category. </p><p>It is envisaged that the implementation of all the recommendations cumulatively, with the appropriate levels of commitment and cooperation from all relevant stakeholders, should achieve the objectives of delivering fairer premiums for consumers and a more stable and competitive insurance market.  </p><p>In this regard, it should be noted that the CSO CPI statistics indicate that pricing in the private motor insurance market has stabilised over the last year or two and I welcome the direction of travel which this index has displayed since it peaked in July 2016.  However, it is accepted that premiums may still be at a high level for many people.</p><p>Finally, it is expected that the next <i>Progress Update</i>will be completed in the coming days and published shortly thereafter. The Update will concentrate in particular on outlining the definitive position in relation to all of the 33 recommendations from the Motor Report as the last of the deadlines within its Action Plan passed at the end of 2018.</p></reply>

These powers enable the Central Bank to ensure that the people in senior roles are capable, competent and act with integrity. </p><p>The Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 also provides that if a person has engaged, is engaging or is about to engage in a contravention, the Bank may apply to the Court for an order restraining the person from engaging in the conduct. </p><p>The Central Bank (Amendment) Bill which I intend to bring forward this year will further enhance the Fitness and Probity Regime and put a greater onus on individual accountability in the financial sector. </p><p>Regarding the pay and compensation rules for banking executives, the European regulatory framework includes specific controls and restrictions in how remuneration can be delivered within financial institutions, including in Ireland. The Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) was amended in 2010 and 2013 (CRD III and CRD IV) to introduce a standardised regulation of remuneration practises across EU banks and promote sound, effective risk management. </p><p>This EU wide regime introduced new rules and controls designed to ensure that some of the excesses of the past are no longer permissible, including clawback and <i>malus</i>provisions, deferral criteria, and limits on the extent of variable vs fixed remuneration. </p><p>In Ireland we went significantly further, introducing extensive restrictions on remuneration in the three banks in which the State has an investment (AIB, BOI and PTSB). This includes a ban on variable pay and benefits, which impacts all 23,000 staff at every level in those banks. Base fixed pay is capped at &euro;500,000. </p><p>In 2011 the D&aacute;il introduced a &lsquo;Super Tax&rsquo; marginal rate of 89% on bonuses over &euro;20,000 in the three banks.</p><p>The Department is currently finalising a review of Government policy in this regard to determine whether it remains fit for purpose, and it is expected that it will be published in Q1 2019.</p></reply>

These plans are currently being assessed. The Central Bank will also conduct a thematic review of diversity in the insurance sector in 2019.</p><p>The Central Bank is committed to driving diversity at senior levels in regulated financial services firms, and focuses on diversity in its intensive and intrusive supervision approach. Lack of diversity at senior levels is a leading indicator of heightened behaviour and culture risks. </p><p>Despite a focus on gender in recent years, the Bank sees diversity extending beyond that. Different personality types, educational background, ethnicity, and diversity of thought can mitigate the risk of groupthink, improve decision-making, increase the effectiveness of internal challenge and enhance firm culture.</p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Corporate Governance Code for Credit Institutions and Insurance Undertakings 2015 requires that firms establish a written diversity policy for selecting persons for nomination as board members. </p><p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) has outlined that &lsquo;best practices have evolved to reinforce the importance of diversity at the management body of regulated financial services providers across Europe.&rsquo;  EBA &lsquo;Guidelines on the assessment of suitability&rsquo; state that; &lsquo;The diversity policy for significant institutions should include a quantitative target for the representation of the underrepresented gender in the management body&rsquo;.</p><p>The Capital Requirements Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive also prescribe diversity requirements for in-scope firms. </p><p>The Central Bank has reported on the lack of females in senior financial services roles for a number of years. Its annual report on the demographics of the applications for approval for the most senior roles in regulated firms will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p>In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s senior officials continue to address this topic with the CEOs of regulated firms directly and through a comprehensive series of speaking engagements.</p><p>I am informed by the Bank that it has put significant emphasis on the importance of diversity and inclusion within the financial services sector in recent years, and will continue to do so. However, in the absence of improvements in diversity at senior levels in regulated firms, the Bank will consider whether it is necessary to introduce further requirements.</p></reply>

Additionally, securitisations were becoming more prevalent during the 1980s and 1990s.  If the member's mortgage was sold to a third party or had been securitised, the mortgage customer lost the right to vote on conversions. </p><p>The Code of Practice required that borrowers must consent to their mortgages being transferred and the lender was required to provide a statement containing sufficient information to enable the borrower to make an informed decision.  The Code of Practice was issued as a voluntary Code (as opposed to the other Central Bank Codes of Conduct issued under Section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989).  Consequently, the Central Bank's regulatory powers, including the use of its Administrative Sanctions powers, do not apply to the Code of Practice. </p><p>I have been informed by the Central Bank of Ireland that it is considering the possibility of revoking or removing this Code of Practice as it leads to confusion regarding the protections available to consumers whose loans are being transferred.  The mortgage market has changed significantly since the introduction of the Code in 1991, and mortgage contracts now generally include a clause that the borrower's loan can be sold, which the borrower consents to when signing their mortgage contract.  As outlined above, the consumer protection framework around the transfer of loans has also evolved significantly since the voluntary Code of Practice was issued and the Central Bank is of the view that the voluntary Code of Practice is not appropriate in the modern financial environment.  </p><p>The Central Bank of Ireland and I are both of the view that the regulatory framework currently in place provides sufficient protections to consumers whose loans are being sold. The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 ensures that consumers whose loans are sold to another firm maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank.The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 that came into effect on 21 January 2019, ensures that all transferees of credit are now entities which are regulated by the Central Bank, i.e. loans cannot be transferred to an unregulated entity.  Under Provision 3.11 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 (the Code), a regulated entity must notify the Central Bank immediately and provide a consumer with at least 2 months' notice before transferring all or part of its loan book covered by the Code to another entity. </p><p>Finally, the statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) was put in place to ensure that relevant regulated firms have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears.  The Central Bank of Ireland published its <i>Report on the Effectiveness of the CCMA in the context of the Sale of Loans by Regulated Lenders</i>in November 2018.  It found that for borrowers who engage with the process, the CCMA is working effectively and as intended in the context of the sale of loans by regulated lenders.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in respect of particular categories of vehicles.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my officials have engaged with Insurance Ireland in order to get a greater sense of this specific issue and, as a follow-up exercise, Minister of State D'Arcy held a series of meetings with the Chief Executives of the major motor insurers.  At those meetings, insurers pointed out that in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply, they will, aside from the age of the vehicle, use a combination of other rating factors, which include the age of the driver, the type of vehicle, the relevant individual claims record and driving experience, the number of drivers, and how the car is used.  In addition to the above factors, they indicated that they will price in accordance with their own overall past claims experience and in this regard, almost all insurers stated that their data indicates a notable deterioration in the levels of claims associated with vehicles once a certain age threshold is reached.  </p>  <p>  However, I also understand from the above engagement that it would appear that there has been positive movement in respect of the acceptance criteria and the vehicle age threshold levels used by some providers in recent times, particularly at broker level and in respect of renewals.  This is an issue which my officials will continue to monitor.</p></reply>

In Letterkenny, Pramerica has a sizeable operation, as does the UnitedHealth Group.</p>  <p>  The IFS2020 annual action plan 2017 included an increased focus on the regions and contained an action measure to promote international financial services on a regional basis. It also contained a measure to map research and innovation activities in financial services across Ireland. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland continue to actively pursue opportunities across a number of sectors. </p>  <p>  The focus on balanced regional development was reiterated in the action plans for 2018 and 2019. An action measure in the 2019 action plan is to &lsquo;Promote regional locations for second-site operations to support growth by IFS companies located in or near Dublin&rsquo; and the IDA has an active &lsquo;Second Site&rsquo; strategy where companies in Dublin are encouraged and supported to establish a second office in a regional location. Work on this action plan measure will be led by both Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The agencies will report in the fourth quarter of 2019 on their work on this measure to the public sector High Level Implementation Committee, which is chaired by Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy. The focus on regions will continue as part of the new Strategy as recently announced by the Minister of State at the European Financial Forum in Dublin Castle. </p></reply>

The OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework was given a clear mandate by the G20 in March 2017 to develop this work, which led to the publication of an Interim Report on the Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation in March 2018.  </p>  <p>  Currently, a series of proposals are being discussed at the OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework with a view to further amending the international tax system.  There are two proposed pillars to this work: </p>  <p>  - The first pillar is a re-examination of rules on profit attribution. Differing proposals are being discussed but all have the intention of ensuring some additional profit is allocated where consumers or markets are located. </p>  <p>  - The second pillar looks at addressing remaining BEPS challenges that may enable profits to be taxed at very low effective tax rates. </p>  <p>  The OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework have now published a Policy Note outlining the intention to examine the two pillars further, on a without prejudice basis.  A Public Consultation document on the proposal has been launched and a meeting will take place at the OECD in Paris on 13-14 March to allow stakeholders to air their views.  It is important the views of wider society are reflected as the discussion develops.  This will feed into further work with a view to agreeing a detailed work plan at the BEPS Inclusive Framework in May 2019.  A progress report will subsequently be presented to G20 Finance Ministers in June 2019. Work will continue over the next 18 months with a view to reaching final agreement by end 2020.  </p>  <p>  Ireland recognises that further change to the international tax framework is necessary to ensure that we reach a stable global consensus for how and where companies should be taxed.  A certain, stable, and globally agreed international tax framework is vital to facilitate cross border trade and investment.  We remain convinced that the OECD BEPS Inclusive Framework is the correct forum for this work to be carried out.   </p></reply>

As a result, I believe that there is a strong understanding at EU level of the unique and disproportionate impact that Brexit will have on Ireland. </p>  <p>  This has been reflected in a number of concrete measures and commitments to date, such as the EIB&rsquo;s support for the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Loan Scheme. In its Contingency Action Plan of 13 November, the European Commission confirmed that it would support Ireland in finding solutions addressing the specific challenges of Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  In March last year, the European Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources, Mr Gunther Oettinger visited Dublin and met with the Taoiseach, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy and I, to discuss the negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s post-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). During that visit, the T&aacute;naiste met with Mr Oettinger to discuss the negative consequences to the Irish economy resulting from Brexit, and the possibility of EU assistance was raised, particularly in relation to the PEACE and INTERREG programmes. Following that meeting, the T&aacute;naiste has been in further contact with Mr Oettinger to outline a number of key areas in which the MFF can help to address the macroeconomic and trade implications for Ireland of Brexit and has identified a number of EU programmes in the next MFF which could be well placed to assist Ireland in addressing these Brexit impacts.    </p>  <p>  Minister Creed also held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan in late January to discuss the potential impact of a no deal Brexit on the Irish agri-food and fisheries sectors.</p>  <p>  Separately, Minister Humphreys met with Commissioner Vestager in Dublin on 24 January, where Ireland&rsquo;s particular concerns were again discussed. </p>  <p>  The Government will continue to take a whole of Government approach in engagement with the European Commission on possible sources of funding from the EU to assist Ireland with the fall out from a possible no deal Brexit. My colleague in Government, the T&aacute;naiste, Mr Simon Coveney, T.D will continue to co-ordinate and lead Ireland's Brexit approach in that regard.</p></reply>

The profiles each company receives remain consistent each month so that the CSO can use a continuous "like with like" comparison in the best way possible and in this regard each company is sent a representative set of profiles for their consumer base.  The risks vary based on the detail contained in each of the profiles in order to get a larger spread of the realistic market.  </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that these statistics represent a long established series of pricing information, which a number of years ago indicated a sharp increase in the cost of motor insurance, prompting the establishment of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, and which now indicate that pricing in the private motor insurance market has stabilised over the last year, albeit it is accepted that premiums may still be at a high level for many people.  I remain satisfied that the CSO statistics are representative of motor insurance price development, and I welcome in particular the direction of travel that the CSO index has displayed since it peaked in July 2016.</p>  <p>  Finally, by way of further information to the Deputy, I understand that the CSO recently presented the Working Group with its Report into the feasibility of collecting price information on the cost of insurance to businesses, in accordance with Recommendation 1 of the Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Employer Liability and Public liability Insurance.  </p>  <p>  The CSO is preparing to publish this Report shortly.</p></reply>

In recognition of the nature of the production cycle and the long lead in times needed for productions to be undertaken, the credit was extended from its original end date of 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2024. Additionally, it was legislated to require production companies to apply for payment of the tax credit under the self-assessment system.  This brings the operation of the credit within the normal penalty and prosecution provisions for incorrect claims.

Maintaining and administrating transaction accounts used for the services specified by this subsection, including issuing statements.</p><p>&lsquo;Charge&rsquo; includes a penalty or surcharge interest by whichever name called, being an interest charge imposed in respect of arrears on a credit agreement or a loan, but does not include any rate of interest or any charge, cost or expense levied by a party other than a credit institution in connection with the provision of a service to the credit institution or the customer and that is to be discharged by the customer.</p><p>Relevant charges are assessed by the Central Bank in accordance with the specific assessment criteria laid down in the legislation as follows:</p><p>- the promotion of fair competition between credit institutions;</p><p>- the commercial justification submitted in respect of the proposal; </p><p>- the impact new charges or increases in existing charges will have on customers; and</p><p>- a credit institution passing any costs on to its customers in proposing to impose or change any charge.</p><p>Having considered the proposed charge(s) under the assessment criteria as set out under the legislation, the proposed charges are either rejected, approved at lower levels than requested by the entity or approved in full.</p><p>Approvals are issued in the form of a letter of direction and the entity is legally bound to comply with this letter of direction.  The letter of direction sets out the maximum amount the credit institution is allowed to charge. Credit institutions are free to impose any pricing differentials for the service up to the permitted maximum and are free to waive fees at their discretion.</p><p>If customers are unhappy with their current account provider for any reason, including cost, they have the right to switch to a different provider.  </p><p>The website of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) lists the various charges imposed by the various financial institutions in Ireland for different types of transactions <i>www.ccpc.ie</i>.</p><p>Irish financial institutions have varying models for charges and have different regimes and conditions under which they are willing to grant transaction free banking.

My Department has run two media campaigns as part of a range of competition measures agreed with the European Commission to raise awareness and promote customer switching in the retail financial product area.  This was agreed in the context of the restructuring plans for AIB and PTSB.  The campaign is being funded entirely by the two banks.  The campaign website <i>www.switchyourbank.ie </i>provides straightforward practical information and support on switching and I would strongly encourage people to visit it.</p></reply>

A Credit Institution means:</p><p>(a) an undertaking whose business is to receive deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant credits for its own account, or </p><p>(b) an electronic money institution. </p><p>The register can be viewed on the Central Bank of Ireland website. Further details are included below. </p><p>In addition, to carry out banking business a banking licence is required and all banks have received the necessary approvals from the Central Bank.  </p><p>Being granted a banking licence authorisation in one Member State opens the possibility that a credit institution can passport throughout the rest of the European Union without the need to establish a subsidiary in another Member State. </p><p>Passporting can be effected through either the establishment of a branch in another Member State (subject to notifying the home member state) or by the provision of services in another Member State (i.e. services are provided in another Member State but no physical presence is established in that State), also subject to notification requirements.  </p><p>In accordance with Article 35 of the Capital Requirements Directive 2013/36/EC (CRD IV) any EEA credit institution wishing to exercise the freedom to provide services within another EEA Member State by establishing a branch shall notify the competent authorities of the home Member State of their intention to do so.  </p><p>In accordance with Article 39 of CRD IV any EEA credit institution wishing to exercise the freedom to provide services on a cross border basis within another EEA Member State shall notify the competent authorities of the home Member State of their intention to do so.</p><p>The Central Bank also informs me that where an entity is operating as a bank, it is then required to hold a banking licence and therefore if it issues a loan as a bank it will have a banking licence.  However, it is possible that loans currently on a bank's balance sheet may not have been issued by them originally as they could have bought the loan from another entity, which may not have been a bank when the loan was issued.</p><p>With specific regard to KBC Bank Ireland plc, this is a public limited company incorporated in Ireland under the Companies Acts 1963 to 2006 (no. 40537) on 14 February 1973 under the name Irish Inter-Continental Holdings Limited. On 25 April 1973, it changed its name to Irish Intercontinental Bank Limited. On 10 January 2000, it changed its name to IIB Bank Limited. On 29 March 2006, it re-registered as a public limited company under the name IIB Bank plc. On 24 October 2008, it changed its name to KBC Bank Ireland plc. The Transferee carries on a banking business in Ireland from its registered office at Sandwith Street, Dublin 2 and is the holder of a licence in relation thereto granted on 17 May 1973 under Section 9 of the Central Bank Act 1971.</p><p>Link to Financial Service Providers Register: .</p></reply>

The report included an estimate for the increase in bank credit required to fund the Institute&rsquo;s estimate for housing supply. The ESRI used COSMO &mdash; the structural econometric model of the Irish economy &mdash; to generate estimates of both the mortgage credit required to purchase projected housing supply and the construction credit required to build it. </p><p>Last year, the Department of Finance undertook to update the work of the ESRI. Given the importance of housing to the macro economy it was deemed appropriate to amend the supply projection to a hypothetical 50,000 units by 2024. The report estimated that if such a level of supply was funded exclusively by the domestic banks, the loan to deposit (LTD) ratio of the aggregate Irish banking system would rise from 70 per cent as of Q4 2017, to 160 per cent in Q4 2024. Of course, housing supply is not funded exclusively by domestic banks and other sources of funding already exist in the Irish market.</p><p>Over recent years a number of non-bank entities have emerged to fund residential development. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), pension funds, private equity providers and specialist lenders are now active in the market providing equity and debt to developers. Given the demand/supply imbalance that currently exists, the increase in funders willing to fund construction is most welcome. There are also wider benefits to this process of diversification. As well as being consistent with the EU&rsquo;s Capital Markets Union agenda, such non-bank investment in the residential sector releases bank capital for alternative forms of lending. </p><p>It is important to note that the LTD ratio is also an insufficient metric by which to measure the ability of the Irish banking system to fund their lending activities. It is similarly an insufficient gauge by which to measure banking stability. In fact, under Basel III, LTD ratio requirements were removed and replaced with two quantitative liquidity management regulations &mdash; the Net Stable Funding Requirement (NSFR) and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The NSFR takes the liquidity value of assets into account, while the LCR aims to ensure credit institutions hold a sufficient reserve of high quality unencumbered liquid assets that can be converted into cash under stressed conditions. Further, banks have many other sources of funding available to support their lending activities. Debt issuance, securitisation and covered bonds are just some examples of options available to the banking system. </p><p>Officials from the Department of Finance are currently working on the bank funding paper, which remains in draft form. The Department intends to publish the work in the near future. </p></reply>

These are set out in regulations made by the Bank under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013. These mortgage measures are now a permanent feature of the mortgage market and the Central Bank is satisfied that they are operating in line with their stated objectives of enhancing the resilience of banks and borrowers to future shocks and reducing the risk of credit - house price spirals from developing. </p><p>The Central Bank introduced proportionate limits, or exemption allowances, for new lending above the stated loan to value (LTV) and loan to income (LTI) caps which apply to new residential mortgage lending. The proportionate limits allow lenders to make credit decisions based on an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances, subject to the overall exemption limit amounts as permitted by the lending regulations. Notwithstanding these proportionate limits, lenders are still required to assess an individual borrower&rsquo;s affordability and to lend prudently on a case-by-case basis, in line with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Code and other regulatory requirements.  The utilisation of these exemption allowances are monitored on an annual basis by the Central Bank in order to check compliance by lenders, and are evaluated relative to mortgage drawdowns.</p><p>The current calibration of the mortgage lending exemption measures permits lenders, in respect of the LTV limits, to provide up to 5% of new lending to first time buyers (FTBs) above the applicable 90% LTV cap and for non-first time buyers (non FTBs) to provide up to 20% of new lending above the 80% LTV cap. For buy to let mortgages, up to 10% new lending can exceed the 70% LTV cap. In respect of the 3.5 times LTI limit which applies to all PDH lending, up to 20% of new lending to FTBs and up to 10% of new lending to non FTBs can exceed this cap. (In addition certain types or categories of mortgage lending will also fall outside the LTV or LTI or both restrictions). </p><p>The table attached provides the number and value of PDH and BTL mortgages which received either an LTV or LTI exemption allowance from the time the lending rules were introduced in February 2015 to end June 2018. <table><tr><th></th><th></th><th>PDH LTI Allowances</th><th></th><th>PDH LTV Allowances</th><th></th><th>BTL LTV Allowances</th></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>No. </td><td>Value (&euro;m) </td><td>No. </td><td>Value (&euro;m) </td><td>No. </td><td>Value (&euro;m) </td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1,976</td><td>442.22</td><td>1,322</td><td>329.33</td><td>34</td><td>4.37</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2,655</td><td>663.15</td><td>2,058</td><td>591.92</td><td>25</td><td>3.69</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>4,471</td><td>1,220.02</td><td>1,892</td><td>546.20</td><td>34</td><td>7.58</td></tr><tr><td>2018H1</td><td>1,883</td><td>556.10</td><td>753</td><td>237.10</td><td>14</td><td>2.30</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Further, I understand that the Central Bank of Ireland does not have access to market-wide data on claims paid and premiums received for Employers Liability and Public Liability Insurance.  For example it does not have data with respect to firms that are passporting into Ireland on a freedom of services basis.   </p>  <p>  I would note however, that the Cost of Insurance Working Group, in its Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance, published data in relation to both types of insurance that it had received from Insurance Ireland, in Chapter 4 of the Report.  In this context, there is financial year data provided for the years 2011 to 2016 relating to the number of claims reported in each of the years, certain key financial indicators such as gross earned premium, investment income, gross incurred claims, gross management expenses and gross commissions.  The Deputy may find this useful in relation to his immediate enquiries.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note also that Recommendation 4 of the Report requires the Department of Finance to publish a Key Information Report for employer and public liability insurance.  In this context, the Department has asked Insurance Ireland to provide a more detailed data on claims paid and incurred claims, to be augmented with data on settlement rates, policy counts, and disaggregated by an accident year basis.  This request was submitted to Insurance Ireland in the first half of 2018.  The Deputy will also note that it has not been possible for the Department to fully implement this Recommendation as Insurance Ireland, who do not routinely collect such information either, has found the exercise of compiling this data complex and has signalled to my Department that it needs further time to complete this exercise.  I am hopeful that Insurance Ireland will be able to submit the requested data shortly so as to allow my Department to commence production of its Report.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Oireachtas recently passed the legislation to provide relevant powers to the Central Bank of Ireland to establish the National Claims Information Database.  The Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 was commenced by the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 (Commencement) Order 2019 (S.I. 2 of 2019) on Monday 28 January 2019.  The Central Bank plans to collect claims data for the National Claims Information Database from insurance undertakings in the first half of 2019, with a view to publishing its first annual report under the legislation in the second half of the year.  It is expected that the Central Bank will collect and publish motor insurance claims information in respect of the last 10 years, including the number of claims reported and settled, the amounts paid on claims, the incurred cost on claims (i.e. the amount paid plus the outstanding amount to be paid, if any), and the actuarial estimate of the final cost of claims i.e. ultimate costs.  </p>  <p>  While the National Claims Information Database will focus on private motor insurance initially, the underpinning legislation has been developed in such a way as to allow its scope to increase over time. In this regard, the Cost of Insurance Working Group recommended in its Report on the Cost of Employer liability and Public liability Insurance that by the end of this year, the Central Bank produce a report on the merits and feasibility of collecting employer liability and public liability insurance data for inclusion in the National Claims Information Database.</p></reply>

This is a particular type of life assurance taken out for the term of the mortgage and designed to pay it off on the death of the borrower or joint borrower.</p><p>In most cases, a lender is legally required under Section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to make sure that a mortgage applicant has a mortgage protection insurance before granting a mortgage loan, with some exceptions.  These exceptions apply where:</p><p>(a) the house in respect of which the loan is made is, in the mortgage lender's opinion, not intended for use as the principal residence of the borrower or of his dependants, </p><p>(b) loans to persons who belong to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to an insurer, or which would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally,</p><p>(c) loans to persons who are over 50 years of age at the time the loan is approved,</p><p>(d) loans to persons who, at the time the loan is made, have otherwise arranged life assurance, providing for payment of a sum, in the event of death, of not less than the sum referred to in subsection (1).</p><p>Under the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (&ldquo;CMCAR&rdquo;), lenders are restricted from making the approval of a mortgage contingent on the purchase of another product.  These Regulations came into operation on 21 March 2016 on foot of EU legislation in this field, and replaced Provision 3.17 of the Consumer Protection Code 2012 in the case of activities coming within the scope of those Regulations.  Regulation 13(1) provides &lsquo;<i>Subject to the provisions of this Regulation, a creditor or mortgage credit intermediary shall not sell, or offer to sell, to a consumer a credit agreement to which these Regulations apply in a package with other distinct financial products or services or conveyancing services, auctioneering services or other services relating to land which that person may require whether or not in connection with the loan where that credit agreement is not made available to the consumer separately</i>&rsquo;.  <i></i></p><p><i></i>In addition, Regulation 13(7) provides that &lsquo;  <i>If a creditor requires a consumer to hold a policy of insurance related to the credit agreement, the creditor shall accept a policy selected by the consumer (and which can be from an insurance provider different to the preferred supplier of the creditor) provided that such a policy has a level of guarantee equivalent to the one the creditor has proposed and in any event shall be no greater than an amount that would be required to guarantee repayment of the outstanding credit or to insure the value of the security. This is without prejudice to the requirements of sections 124, 126 and 127 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995&rdquo;.</i></p></reply>

The day to day supervision of insurance undertakings is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland, and so my officials have consulted with the Bank in respect of the information sought. </p>  <p>  In this regard, I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that, during 2017 (the latest available figures), 20 insurance undertakings, which are prudentially supervised by the Central Bank, wrote general liability business in Ireland.  It has also indicated that in 2017, there were 13 insurance undertakings, which are authorised in the UK, that were writing general liability business via Freedom of Service (FOS) or Freedom of Establishment (FOE).  A further figure which the Central Bank has provided my Department with is the fact that there are currently 139 insurance undertakings, which are authorised in the UK, that are notified to write general liability insurance on a Freedom of Service (FOS) basis in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the point about competition raised by the Deputy, it is accepted that there is a lack of availability of employer/public liability insurance providers for certain types of small businesses.  For instance, I am aware of the particular difficulties currently being faced by the play centre sector. It would appear that the main reason for these difficulties is due to a lack of capacity in the market which I understand has been driven to some degree by the overall claims level in the sector. In determining their willingness to enter into or remain in a particular sector of the market, insurers will generally make an assessment of what they consider the overall risk to be.  Therefore unfortunately even in situations where there have been no claims,  part of their assessment of what premium level to charge, or whether to offer cover in the first place  will be based on what they consider the general likely trend for claims in the sector will be, based on their overall past experience.  This difficulty is reinforced by the fact that award levels in this country are significantly higher in this country than for instance the UK.</p>  <p>  Consequently, these difficulties in the employer/public liability insurance sector explain why Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy is placing such an emphasis on implementing the recommendations of the second PIC Report as both of us are of the view that bringing our award levels more in line with other jurisdictions is essential if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs in the near future.  If this were to occur, I have no doubt that that there would be more entrants into the Irish market and more competitive pricing.</p>  <p>  With regard to Brexit and its impacts, the decision of the UK to exit the European Union undoubtedly poses challenges for the Irish insurance market, given the level of cross-border insurance business.  This will be the case no matter what the outcome is of negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  However, in terms of general liability insurance (including employer and public liability insurance in particular), I understand that the majority of the main non-life insurers operating in Ireland also write this type of business.  In addition,  the Central Bank has advised that in 2017, 40% of the domestic Irish liability market was provided by UK authorised insurers, with one large UK insurer accounting for 22% of that total liability exposure. The Central Bank notes that: </p>  <p>  - this insurer has implemented its Brexit plan for both new and existing business; </p>  <p>  - the majority of undertakings providing liability insurance have developed and are currently progressing and implementing their Brexit plans on time for 29 March.</p>  <p>  As liability insurance is a commercial insurance product, the Central Bank expects that insurance brokers are reviewing the capacity of the insurance market and ensuring that their commercial clients are provided with suitable products from insurers to match their commercial client needs.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, my view is that the impact of Brexit on the provision of insurance should not be that significant.  I think of much more importance to the general health of the sector is the need to address the high award levels for soft tissue injuries in line with the recommendations of the PIC.</p></reply>

My Department continually analyses and prepares briefing on short and medium term macroeconomic trends in European and international economy. This includes informing me of the latest forecasts of the global economy and of our key trading partners from the international institutions.</p>  <p>  The Economic and Fiscal Outlook published with Budget 2019 identified a number of external risks relating to trade disruptions and Brexit. My Department&rsquo;s latest macroeconomic outlook, including the external risk assessment, will be contained in the Stability Programme Update which will be published in April.</p>  <p>  At European level, through both the ECOFIN and Eurogroup meetings, ministers work alongside the European Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to take stock of the latest economic situation, including the risks to the European economy&rsquo;s growth prospects. </p>  <p>  The latest forecasts from the international institutions show a sharp deterioration in the external environment. There are strong indications that the global economic expansion, underway since 2016 and for longer in the EU and the US, has peaked. Momentum in the global economy has been slowing since the second half of 2018. Global GDP growth is projected to ease gradually from 3.7 per cent in 2018 to around 3&frac12; per cent in 2019 and 2020. </p>  <p>  Short-term indicators are pointing to a slowdown in the pace of growth. This reflects continuing risks relating to Brexit, tighter global financial conditions, geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism. </p>  <p>  Escalating trade conflicts are negatively affecting the growth outlook in all countries. Indicators such as trade volumes, industrial production and manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMIs) are all declining. The key issue for Europe and the world economy is to safeguard the open, rules-based, global trading system which has been associated with raising living standards throughout the world. </p>  <p>  Ireland, as a highly open, export focussed, economy is particularly sensitive to a slowdown in world trade and overall economic growth. The slowing world growth momentum and the implications for Ireland&rsquo;s economy, underline the importance of improving the resilience of the economy by building fiscal buffers and focussing on competitiveness. </p></reply>

Accordingly it is a matter for the ECB to set official interest rates and to operate the other tools for the implementation of its monetary policy decisions.  In the context of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the ECB also plays a key role in the prudential supervision of European banks and the maintenance of the stability of the overall banking system.  </p>  <p>  While the ECB will have an interest in matters relating to the transmission of monetary policy, the ECB does not have a role in the setting of lending or deposit interest rates by individual banks or other financial institutions.  That is a commercial and business matter for individual banks.  Nevertheless, when he appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach in November 2018 with the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, the President of the ECB acknowledged that lending rates in Ireland are high.  More particularly, this is the case in relation to the provision of new mortgage credit.  As the Deputy is aware, there are a number of factors for this such as the cost of funds, the need for lenders to reflect the level of credit risk (and which is still an important factor in Ireland as a consequence of the banking and property collapse) and the need for banks to build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks.  The high level of concentration in the market for the provision of new mortgage credit is also a relevant factor.  </p>  <p>  I also maintain close contact with the Governor of the Central Bank and it should be noted that the Bank has recently made a number of changes to the Consumer Protection Code which are designed to facilitate and promote mortgage switching through enhancing the transparency of the mortgage framework, to provide additional protections to consumers who decide to switch mortgage provider and overall to help consumers make savings on their mortgage repayments.</p></reply>

It is a statutory Code first introduced by the Central Bank in February 2009, with the current CCMA becoming effective from 1 July 2013.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework, aimed specifically at the process to be followed by relevant firms, to ensure borrowers in arrears or pre-arrears in respect of a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence are treated in a timely, transparent and fair manner.</p>  <p>  Banks, retail credit firms and credit servicing firms are all required to comply with the CCMA.  The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears, and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  It sets out the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), a four-step process that regulated entities must follow:  </p>  <p>  Step 1: Communicate with borrower;</p>  <p>  Step 2: Gather financial information;</p>  <p>  Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and</p>  <p>  Step 4: Propose a resolution</p>  <p>  Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.  The CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered.  </p>  <p>  Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it has made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment arrangement (ARA) with the borrowers and other clear requirements are met or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating.</p>  <p>  This framework requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of ARAs offered before taking action which may result in the borrower losing his/her home (whether by voluntary sale or repossession).  During the legal process, borrowers have opportunities to re-engage with lenders to find a solution.  In some circumstances, however, loss of ownership may be unavoidable.</p>  <p>  The arrears handling provisions in Chapter 8 of the Consumer Protection Code (the Code) apply when the loan is not a mortgage loan to which the CCMA applies.  The Code requires that regulated entities have in place written procedures for the handling of arrears.   Where an account is in arrears, a regulated entity must seek to agree an approach that will assist the personal consumer in resolving the arrears.  Specified information in relation to arrears must be made available to personal consumers, including general information to encourage the consumer to deal with arrears and stating the benefits of dealing with arrears.</p>  <p>  Where an account remains in arrears for 31 calendar days after the arrears first arose, a regulated entity must inform the consumer of the status of the account and other specified information. This includes the amount of the arrears to date and the interest rate applicable to the arrears, details of any charges in relation to the arrears that may be applied and the importance of the personal consumer engaging with the regulated entity in order to address the arrears.  This must be updated every three months, where the arrears persist. </p>  <p>  Where a regulated entity reaches an agreement on a revised repayment arrangement with a personal consumer, the regulated entity must provide the personal consumer with a clear explanation of the revised repayment arrangement and clarification on what data relating to the consumer&rsquo;s arrears will be shared with the Irish Credit Bureau or any other relevant credit reference agency.</p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the Abhaile scheme, the aim of which is to ensure that people who are at risk of losing their homes to address their mortgage arrears and to help them wherever possible, to remain in their homes. The Insolvency Service of Ireland have stated that if a debtor can, at least, service the current market value of their home, irrespective of the mortgage balance, a Personal Insolvency Practitioner will be able to secure a permanent solution that returns the debtor to solvency and allow them remain in their family home. In over 90% of Personal Insolvency Arrangements, the debtor has remained in their home notwithstanding the fact that the majority of such cases were in long term arrears. </p>  <p>  Since Abhaile was established in 2016, over 10,000 households in mortgage arrears have received free financial, legal and insolvency advice from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner or a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears Practitioner under the scheme.

The recovery in the economy in part reflects improvements in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness over the last number of years. As measured by the Central Bank&rsquo;s Real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved by over 21 per cent from the low point in 2008. </p>  <p>  Despite the rapid rate of recovery, the main signs of overheating &ndash; for instance pay developments, credit growth, and inflation - do not yet suggest that overheating pressures have emerged. While price pressures have been seen in the housing market, these are more a function of structural imbalances between supply and demand, which we are actively seeking to alleviate, rather than evidence of over-heating.</p>  <p>  The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has seen the unemployment rate fall from a peak of 16 per cent in early 2012 to 5.7 per cent in January 2019.  Despite the improvements in the labour market, the economy is not yet operating at full capacity, with the unemployment rate still above the level considered to represent full employment in Ireland. Although, average hourly earnings grew at just over 3 per cent in 2018, this follows nearly a decade of low or negative earnings growth. </p>  <p>  Importantly the recovery in the economy has not yet given rise to inflationary pressure. For the sixth consecutive year inflation, as measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, has been below 1 per cent. This trend has continued into 2019, with inflation of just 0.8 per cent recorded in January 2019. </p>  <p>  As in any healthy economy, the pickup in credit growth has taken hold, albeit at a modest pace. However, since the financial crisis, a number of additional safeguards have been put in place to prevent the unsustainable build-up of credit, most notably the introduction of the macro-prudential regulations by the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  Over the medium term, with the domestic economy expected to drive growth, it is important that we remain cognisant of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, which could give rise to a loss of competitiveness. Indeed, in order to prevent overheating pressures emerging we must focus on maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies, whilst avoiding pro-cyclical policy measures.  To this end, the Government will continue to implement budgetary policies designed to ensure economic stability and fiscal sustainability. This prudent approach to our public finances will help to mitigate against any future downturn in economy activity. </p></reply>

Prior to the launch of the Scheme, and since its commencement, regular consultation in relation to the operation of the Scheme has taken place with a wide range of relevant stakeholders, including the members of the Advisory Group for the Policy on Gaeltacht Education. </p>  <p>  The overall objective of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education is to promote the use of Irish as the main language of Gaeltacht communities through the delivery of high quality education through the medium of Irish and by extending the use of Irish in school communities. The objective of the Scheme is to allow participating schools, following consultation with their local communities, to seek to achieve Gaeltacht School Recognition over a 5 year period on the basis of the implementation of specific language-based criteria, including the implementation of a total-immersion approach.  Currently there are 105 primary schools and 28 post-primary schools participating in the Scheme. A report, summarising the views of schools about the implementation of the Scheme, as reported to inspectors during advisory visits to the schools, was published in December 2018. The report indicates that the experience of Gaeltacht schools implementing the Scheme has been largely positive. </p>  <p>  The additional language support hours allocated to schools participating in the Scheme are based on the enrolment figures recorded in the previous year, which is in line with Department norms.  In recognition of the difficulties which some small isolated Gaeltacht schools face in relation to the recruitment of part-time teachers, for the 2018/19 school year, schools participating in the Scheme were given the option to combine their additional language support hours with other primary schools in the locality to form clusters, which would allow for the creation of a temporary full-time teaching post shared by the primary schools in the particular cluster. For the 2019-20 school year, the further option of combining additional Irish-language support hours and/or special education teaching hours to form full-time temporary teaching posts which may be shared by primary schools in a particular cluster has been provided. The primary school concerned has been given these options.</p>  <p>  In relation to general staffing levels, the current staffing schedule in primary schools operates at a general average of 1 teacher for every 26 pupils which is the most favourable position ever seen at primary level.  Any additional improvement will be considered as part of the next annual budgetary process alongside the many other demands from the education sector.</p>  <p>  The general staffing allocation arrangements for 2019/20 are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  As has been the norm for the past number of years, these staffing arrangements allow for more favourable retention rates in Gaeltacht schools than in other schools.</p></reply>

This project is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that under the National Development Plan (NDP), increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme.  This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities.

After a very detailed consultation process the NCCA recommended a new approach:</p><p>- limited compulsory subjects around basic literacy and numeracy</p><p>- 24 statements of learning</p><p>It is important to say that the 24 statements of learning include important elements which cultivate a historical perspective. </p><p>The new Junior Cycle Programme has also greatly enlivened subjects with a new emphasis on projects and self directed learning.  This new approach is particularly evidence in history which will encourage  take up of this lively and attractive subject. </p><p>The  new approach gives students more choice and options which will be very valuable in their personal development.  There will be 21 subjects and numerous short courses when all subjects are rolled out. </p><p>When it comes to compulsion it should be said that history and geogrpahy prior to the introduction of the Framework for Junior Cycle were only a core subjects in voluntary secondary schools (52% of schools). However, it is important to note that currently some 90% of students across all school types choose to study History at Junior Cycle with 92% choosing to study Geography.</p><p>Shortly after arriving in this Department, I requested the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a review of the optional nature of history under the new Framework for Junior Cycle.  It is expected that the review will be completed by the end of March 2019.  </p></reply>

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.   </p>  <p>  In general, it takes 6 months for a fully completed standard application to be processed from the date it is received to the date a decision is made. The nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases can take longer than others to process. </p>  <p>  The INIS Service Improvement Plan 2018-2020 commits the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department to significant investment in technological developments including the roll-out of online forms and payments for citizenship applications.  Such developments are expected to deliver significant improvements to customer experiences.  </p>  <p>  Processing timescales can be impacted due to incomplete applications having to be returned, further documentation being required from the applicant, or where payment of the required certificate fee is awaited, or the applicant has not been engaging with INIS.  In certain instances delays can arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which requires to be considered.  In other instances the applicant themselves may request that a hold be put on their application.</p>  <p>  The final stage requires the applicant to attend at a citizenship ceremony.  Citizenship ceremony days take place periodically throughout the year, at which up to 3,000 candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State, give an undertaking to uphold the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values and receive their certificate of naturalisation. The date a decision is made on an application in relation to when the next available ceremony is due to take place can also impact on the length of time between the submission of the application and the applicant becoming an Irish citizen.</p>  <p>  INIS devotes a considerable resources to the processing of these cases. It also operates a dedicated phone helpline and email helpdesk available for all applicants interested in the progress of their application, details of which are available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  </p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements, not only within the State but also at European Union as well as international level.  It is therefore important that appropriate procedures are in place to ensure that the integrity of the regime for granting Irish citizenship through the naturalisation process is held in high regard both at home and internationally.</p></reply>

This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  -  be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  -  have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and</p>  <p>  -  have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded. </p>  <p>  In accordance with this legal framework, I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that on 29 November 2018 the Data Protection Commission issued a note (available on its website www.dataprotection.ie) confirming that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the DPC confirmed that: &ldquo;Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community-based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner. Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  I understand that the Data Protection Commission is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV as part of a wider inquiry into surveillance through the use of technologies for law enforcement purposes.  We expect the findings from the CCTV module of this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems.  A grant-aid scheme is administered by my Department to support groups wishing to install CCTV systems in their localities.  Under the scheme, eligible groups including community groups and local authorities can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of &euro;40,000 per scheme.  </p>  <p>  I am keen to ensure that all interested groups have the opportunity to avail of the grant aid in question.  If the Deputy is aware of any interested groups, I would encourage them to review the details of the grant aid package, available on my Department's website www.justice.ie or to make contact with my officials through the direct access email address communitycctv@justice.ie for further assistance. </p></reply>

The International Protection Appeals Tribunal may be contacted either by email to info@protectionappeals.ie, by telephone at 01-4748400 (or Lo-Call 1890 201 458), or in writing to Corporate Services Division, The International Protection Appeals Tribunal, 6-7 Hanover Street East, Dublin D02 W320. </p>  <p>  Following the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 on 31 December 2016, new arrangements for the investigation and determination of applications for international protection (refugee status and subsidiary protection) and cases involving permission to remain in the State have been introduced.

No. 199 of 2004, places the onus on all economic operators &ndash; manufacturers, distributors, importers &ndash;  to ensure that only safe products are placed on the market.  If economic operators become aware that products on the market present a potential hazard they must take appropriate measures, up to and including recall of the items, to ensure that the risk is removed. Any action taken by an operator must be notified to the relevant Market Surveillance Authority: in Ireland this is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), which is statutorily independent in the carrying out of its functions.</p>  <p>  Where the CCPC finds unsafe products on the Irish market, it will act to ensure economic operators remove the product from the market until it is in compliance with the legislation. The CCPC is part of an EU wide network (known as Safety Gate) that allows for the rapid exchange of information between national market surveillance authorities on dangerous products found on the EU market. </p>  <p>  Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations of unsafe products.

FDI flows into the country have been particularly significant in recent years with pronounced growth in total job numbers and investment projects. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that significant progress is also being made in increasing FDI in the regions, with 58% of all IDA employment now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside the capital in the history of the Agency. 2018 also saw more IDA-supported jobs added in the regions than at any time over the past 17 years.  </p>  <p>  The Government is nevertheless very much conscious of our need to remain as competitive as possible in FDI terms. We are working to retain and promote our competitive advantages and to secure new investment projects. That means improving on our already compelling and attractive offering for multinationals to invest here. These include our stable and competitive corporation tax regime, the long established pro-enterprise policy environment in this jurisdiction and our country's highly-educated workforce. </p>  <p>  Through Project Ireland 2040, Government is committed to delivering a step-up in investment in road, energy, water and broadband infrastructure and in education and research facilities. Investment levels in Ireland will continue to increase at a sustainable rate and, very importantly, our infrastructure investment will allow our companies and economy to continue to compete with the best in the world.  </p>  <p>  By reinforcing these strengths and others, I am confident we will be able to continue attracting more investment by overseas companies for years to come. </p></reply>

The &euro;23 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) has been leveraged to provide a fund of up to &euro;300 million over the lifetime of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The scheme features a two-stage application process. First, businesses must apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to confirm their eligibility for the scheme. Businesses can use guidelines provided on the SBCI website to determine if they are eligible, and if so, to complete the eligibility form. As part of the process, businesses must submit a business plan, demonstrating the means by which they intend to innovate, change or adapt to meet their Brexit challenges. The SBCI assesses the applications and successful applicants receive an eligibility reference number.</p>  <p>  Successful applicants can then apply for a loan under the scheme with one of the participating finance providers using their eligibility reference number. Participating finance providers are the Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and Allied Irish Bank. Approval of loans is subject to the finance providers' own credit policies and procedures.</p>  <p>  As of 19 February, there had been 462 applications made to the SBCI for eligibility under the scheme. Of these, 413 have been deemed eligible and 10 ineligible (the remaining 39 applications are in progress). 81 of these applications have progressed to sanction at bank level, to a total value of &euro;17.32m.</p></reply>

That&rsquo;s why Government, working with industry bodies and business groups, started developing supports for businesses from the time when Brexit first became a possibility. Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that businesses around the country can manage risks and avail of any opportunities. This has informed the range of advisory and financial supports that are in place. </p>  <p>  The &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme launched last year is open to eligible businesses of up to 499 employees which have been demonstrably impacted by Brexit, or which will be in the future. The Brexit Loan Scheme provides working capital funding to businesses to innovate, change or adapt in response to Brexit-related challenges. Loan amounts range from &euro;25,000 up to &euro;1.5 million, for terms of up to three years and at a maximum interest rate of 4%. Loans of up to &euro;500,000 are available unsecured. This may be useful for businesses whose cashflow has already been impacted by Brexit. </p>  <p>  Beyond this, my Department and its agencies are fully engaged in preparing Irish businesses for Brexit and have participated in the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s series of Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in Cork, Galway, Monaghan, Dublin, Limerick and Donegal. As part of awareness-raising activities, Enterprise Ireland continues to roll out regional Brexit Advisory clinics. To date, these clinics have been held in Letterkenny, Tralee, Portlaoise, Claremorris, Cootehill, Charleville, Dublin, Galway, Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick. Further events are planned in Galway, Cork, Letterkenny and Dublin ahead of the withdrawal date. </p>  <p>  EI has also been running a PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the Brexit SME Scorecard and the PrepareforBrexit.ie website, which offers information on the likely impacts of Brexit on Irish businesses and how these impacts might be mitigated. The Brexit SME Scorecard is an interactive online platform that can be used by all Irish businesses to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. </p>  <p>  Funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% and they, along with InterTradeIreland, are offering a range of Brexit-focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. InterTradeIreland continues to offer its Brexit: Start to Plan voucher scheme, which makes available financial support of up to &euro;2,250 towards professional advisory services to address Brexit-related challenges.</p>  <p>  The LEOs offer Brexit supports to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide, including tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges, and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges.</p>  <p>  For further information, as well as details of the information and advisory supports available, businesses should consult my Department's Getting Business Brexit Ready page at dbei.gov.ie/BrexitReady.</p></reply>

Under this architecture the Commission represents Ireland and other Member States at the WTO taking into account the needs of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union. As such, the EU is leading on all negotiations relating to Brexit. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be fully aware, the EU and UK negotiators agreed in December 2018 the Withdrawal Agreement. This Agreement was the product of two years of negotiation taking into account the UK&rsquo;s &lsquo;red lines&rsquo; and the EU&rsquo;s requirement to protect and support the single market and the Good Friday Agreement.  It is unfortunate that the UK Parliament have been, to date, unable to pass the Withdrawal Agreement that would provide certainty and clarity as to the relationship between the UK, Ireland and the EU after March 29. </p>  <p>  The Withdrawal Agreement provides the foundation stone to the creation of a new relationship between the EU and the UK and Ireland is fully engaged at every level within the EU regarding the negotiations. The final terms of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU have yet to be determined and the EU continues to actively engage with all Member States, including Ireland, to achieve the best outcome possible for all Members notwithstanding the inevitable negative consequences of Brexit, once the precise terms of the UK&rsquo;s exit are settled.  As An T&aacute;naiste and An Taoiseach have both said in recent days, Brexit is a lose, lose, lose scenario. Nonetheless, were the UK&rsquo;s intentions for the future partnership to evolve further, the EU has made clear that the Union is prepared to reconsider our offer and adjust the content and level of ambition of the Political Declaration.   </p>  <p>  The Future Trading Relationship phase of negotiations, post March 29, is designed to ameliorate as much as possible the negative impacts on trade and employment that will arise from Brexit. All obligations and benefits of WTO rules will be considered in that context, but those considerations cannot be pre-determined at this time. </p>  <p>  Specifically, in relation to Article XXI of GATT, there are a limited number of instances where article XXI has been invoked, most recently by the United States to enable the application of tariffs on Steel and Aluminium products imported into the US, but more usually at time of conflict, war, and so on. This action by the US has been challenged by the European Union and several other WTO members and is currently being pursued under the Dispute Settlement Framework of the WTO. As with any trade related action, the use of Article XXI, which would have to be by the EU, would be open to challenge by other WTO members, if any so chose.  It could be argued that for the use of Article XXI to be effective the UK would have to adopt a similar approach.  </p>  <p>  I don't believe it is helpful for us to speculate on the use of such exceptional mechanisms, when we have concrete, worthwhile, proposals before us.  The Withdrawal Agreement provides a solid legal framework for the UK to depart the European Union through the commencement of the transition phase, followed by negotiations on the Future Trading Relationship.  The Government has repeatedly maintained that the best and only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and protect the Good Friday Agreement is to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement and this remains our priority. </p>  <p>  Finally, I might note that the Government has, this week, brought the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019 (the &lsquo;Omnibus Bill&rsquo;) to second stage in the Dail.  This piece of legislation allows the Government to amend a number of domestic laws in order to manage the negative sectoral impacts in the event the UK leaves the EU without reaching agreement on their withdrawal.  Additionally, the Government on both a domestic and international level are fully engaged with preparing for Brexit.  Along with our EU colleagues, our focus is on ensuring that the UK passes the Withdrawal Agreement which provides the clearest and legally unambiguous platform in which to begin talks on the future relationship, whilst, at the same time, ensuring that our most vulnerable sectors are protected from the worst impacts of Brexit.  In that regard, my Department has been at the forefront of delivering, with our Enterprise Agencies, a range of measures aimed at assisting businesses navigate the economic turbulence attendant on Brexit.</p></reply>

The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules.  Much has been achieved by this Working Group.  It has examined and explored a range of opportunities within State Aid rules including the development of the Future Growth Loan Scheme under GBER rules, the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Rescue and Restructuring Scheme to include Temporary liquidity aid and the Group is currently working closely with DG Agri to explore the range of opportunities under the Agriculture and Forestry State aid guidelines.  It has looked at regionally important, exposed clients and their building resilience in their response to Brexit by using environmental and innovation aid.</p>  <p>  On 24th January 2019, I met with the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager.  The focus of the meeting centered around the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports.  It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner's team in addressing any State aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implications become known.   Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing State aid rules, this will be raised as part of the Group discussions.  The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p></reply>

In responding to these questions and in recognition of the complexity of the matters arising, I requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:</p><p>a) the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and b) an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.</p><p>Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies. The report has been informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.</p><p>The Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.</p><p>The Report makes 19 recommendations including:</p><p>-  the development of patient information and informed consent materials;</p><p>-  surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;</p><p>-  the development of clinical guidance;</p><p>-  the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;</p><p>-  ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and</p><p>-  ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.</p><p>The report was completed and published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018.</p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, until a number of key recommendations are implemented. </p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations.  I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed through this Group. The HSE has advised that many women have already engaged with this pathway system and have attended centres for second opinion and follow up appointments.  </p><p>The Secretary General of my Department wrote to the HSE on November 27 2018 to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, to be approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website within three months of receipt of the report, or sooner if completed. It was also requested that a copy of the Implementation Plan, together with an interim report on the implementation of those recommendations on which work has already commenced, should be submitted to the Department at the time of publication of the Implementation Plan. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE in a recent letter to the Secretary General has advised that the final version of the Implementation Plan will be published on its website and submitted to my Department in mid-March 2019.</p></reply>

This bulletin provides detailed analysis of the first set of data on the extent of gambling in Ireland.  The bulletin is published on the Department of Health website, www.health.gov.ie. </p>  <p>  The report show that 64.5% of people in Ireland engage in various forms of gambling and that 41.4% report gambling on a monthly basis or more often.  For many there are no issues arising from their gambling.  However, the report indicates problem gambling prevalence at 0.8%.  For the small percentage of people for whom gambling is a problem, we need measures to reduce problem gambling and its impact on individuals and their families. </p>  <p>  This survey provides a baseline of data to assist in policy formulation and future planning and action on gambling.  It contributes to the evidence base to ensure that the policy and legislative approach to addressing the complex issue of gambling and problem gambling is fit for purpose. </p>  <p>  The next drug prevalence survey for the period 2018/19 will again include gambling and will allow for data on trends in gambling to be compiled. </p></reply>

There are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain, and these additional stocks, together with planning by Revenue to allow the fast-tracking of essential drugs into Ireland, where necessary, will help deal with any delays that may arise.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that there is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines, or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions. To do so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines for other patients.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the HPRA developed and launched a multi-stakeholder Medicine Shortages Framework to anticipate and manage medicine shortages when they occur. The health system is therefore well placed to anticipate and respond to any additional shortages, should they arise because of Brexit.</p>  <p>  As an additional safeguard, my Department requested that consideration be given to those categories of medicines which are considered most essential to public health, including compounded chemotherapy treatments. As a result, HSE and HPRA technical experts are undertaking a process to verify the contingency planning in place for the continuity of supply of medicines essential to public health, in order to determine those medicines that have the potential to be vulnerable to supply disruption and, where necessary, identify clinically appropriate alternatives. Work on this process is ongoing and will continue in the months before and after Brexit.  </p>  <p>  Both the HPRA and HSE have been in contact with manufacturers and suppliers to verify capacity, availability of raw materials and consumables, and contingency planning for supply routes of finished products. To date, no major issues have been identified through this process.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.  </p>  <p>  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme at this time. However, I wish to inform the Deputy that it is proposed that the LTI Scheme would be included as part of a review of the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, to be carried out under commitments given in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Strategy.</p></reply>

The purpose of the survey was to measure employee sentiment and engagement within the publicly funded Health Sector.  I understand that within the National Ambulance Service there was a 50% response rate. </p>  <p>  As with all surveys, it raised a number of both positive and negative results.  These results have prompted the National Ambulance Service to take a range of measures to address the areas where improvements could be made.  </p>  <p>  I am clear that bullying or harassment in any workplace must not be tolerated and any such instance must be addressed in accordance with the appropriate grievance and disciplinary policies and procedures.  Any employee who experiences or witnesses work place bullying or harassment should be aware that they can report these instances under the Dignity at Work Policy for the Health Service.</p>  <p>  The NAS is also developing anti bullying work place initiatives in line with the Positive Workplace Programme and bespoke sessions for the NAS are currently in development.  Staff Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing initiatives and programmes are ongoing in the NAS as part of Healthy Ireland including significant focus on staff health initiatives such as mental wellbeing, physical activity, health checks and improving the workplace environment.</p>  <p>  There are a number of other ongoing programmes and initiatives being undertaken and supported by the National Ambulance Service.  For example, a number of NAS managers across the country have undertaken Leadership Development Programmes including Continuous Quality Improvement courses using the Lean Sigma process.</p>  <p>  The NAS has also established a National Staff Engagement Forum as well as local Engagement Networks.  The role of the Forum is to create a space for conversations about what matters to staff in terms of engagement and to gather suggestions on how to improve it by building on existing approaches and continually looking for new ways to engage staff.</p>  <p>  In addition, the NAS has strengthened representative bodies and increased the number of NAS staff representation in order to provide further regular and scheduled discussion around areas such as improvement in internal and upward communication, raising awareness around dignity at work issues, and health and wellbeing initiatives.</p></reply>

Workplace bullying and harassment adversely affect the quality of patient/client care by undermining employee morale and can result in absenteeism, stress-related illnesses and higher turnover of staff.  </p>  <p>  A Dignity at Work Policy for the Health Service is in place.  This policy was produced on a partnership basis by a Working Group comprising representatives from the HSE, Voluntary Hospitals and Intellectual Disability sectors, HSE-Employers Agency, IBEC and the health sector trade unions. </p>  <p>  This Policy covers sexual harassment and harassment as outlawed by the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2008 and workplace bullying and reflects the experiences of  both employers and union representatives in dealing with complaints of bullying  and harassment.</p>  <p>  I can advise that the National Ambulance Service (NAS) is developing anti bullying work place initiatives in line with the Positive Workplace Programme and bespoke sessions for the service are currently in development.  Staff Health &amp;amp; Wellbeing initiatives and programmes are ongoing in the NAS as part of 'Healthy Ireland' including significant focus on staff health initiatives such as mental wellbeing, physical activity, health checks and improving the workplace environment. </p></reply>

Unite and FORSA also represent some ambulance grades.  As a result, the HSE deducts subscriptions at source for those ambulance staff that are members of those unions.  However, the National Ambulance Service Representative Association (NASRA) is not recognised by the HSE and, therefore, does not have negotiating rights.  </p>  <p>  Whilst individuals have a right to membership of any trade union, if they choose to join an association which is not recognised by their employer, such membership is not facilitated by their employer. This means that the HSE does not facilitate the deduction of union subscriptions for this particular Association.  </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that the PNA has taken industrial action, it is not possible to negotiate with a union which is not recognised as having negotiating rights for ambulance grades.  I have asked my Department to engage with the HSE to explore ways forward to see if we can progress a resolution to this dispute. These discussions are still ongoing.</p></reply>

The loans can be used for future working capital requirements or to fund innovation, change or adaptation of the business to mitigate the impact of Brexit. </p>  <p>  Applications for eligibility assessment must be made to the SBCI who, on approval, assign an eligibility reference number. This reference number along with the loan application may then be provided to a participating lender. </p>  <p>  At 22 February, there were 462 eligibility applications received, of which 413 are approved and 10 are ineligible.

As a result there is no centralised reporting or record keeping of enforcement action taken. Evidence available points to a high level of compliance with microchipping of dogs within the country.</p>  <p>  Enforcement efforts to date under the Act have generally focused on cases which have come to the attention of authorised officers where there is neglect or recklessness regarding animal health and welfare of animals and incidence of animal cruelty.</p>  <p>  A further effective approach in terms of microchipping enforcement has been to focus on occasions and locations where dogs are being exported - as evidenced by the on-going spot checks conducted at Dublin Port.</p></reply>

The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning. </p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan at the end of January to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agri-food sector, and on the beef sector in particular. We discussed the unique exposure of the sector to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and the food industry, including through traditional market supports such as intervention and Aids to Private Storage (APS), through exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, and through increased flexibility under State Aid regulations. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves.  </p>  <p>  Since then officials of my Department have had meetings with Commission officials to examine potential options in more detail and these contacts are ongoing.</p></reply>

Within an overarching conservation ethos and focus, the <i>National Strategy</i>sets out three strategic objectives for angling:</p><p>- To make angling accessible and attractive through information, infrastructure and support. </p><p>- To develop tourism through the promotion of our angling resource. </p><p>- To recognise angling as a key leisure and recreation pursuit.</p><p>To date, my Department has provided &euro;2 million directly for capital projects under NSAD and a further &euro;537,000 has been provided under the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development The Salmon Conservation Fund and Midland Fisheries Fund, both sustainably funded from licence and permit income, are managed in parallel with the NSAD. For clarification, the total funding available to Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) to date is &euro;3.437 million across all aspects of fisheries development, which are to be delivered under the umbrella of NSAD. </p><p>Projects with an investment of &euro;1.473 million have been completed to date, representing some 43% of the available funding. Of this, &euro;1.275 million has already been drawn down and a further &euro;200,000 is due for drawdown shortly. </p><p>Drawdown of funds under NSAD, as with other grant-aided programmes involving public funds, is subject to all governance, environmental and other project requirements. In addition, the environmental and habitats window for undertaking fisheries works is short and often dictates the need for staged work and the delivery of projects over a number of years. It was always expected that delivery could take up to a three year period which reflects the often complex nature of fisheries projects. </p><p>My Department has separately funded project officers for IFI to promote capacity building and a collaborative approach within the sector and to address shortfalls in expertise within voluntary organisations delivering projects. The officers engage with these groups to progress projects through governance and into delivery phase. </p><p>To date, all calls for projects under the NSAD &euro;2 million capital works element have been oversubscribed and IFI are concentrating on delivery of existing approved projects before additional project calls can be considered. I have commended IFI on its delivery of NSAD and other investment schemes so far and would point to the following milestones, which demonstrate significant progress: </p><p>- Funding has been has been allocated to 174 fisheries development and management projects nationwide; </p><p>- 45% of the projects have been completed to date; </p><p>- Angling access has been upgraded in 78 locations with a further 22 due for completion in 2019; </p><p>- Over 20 Information and Education initiatives supported, introducing approximately 1000 people to angling and informing visiting anglers. This provided equipment to the value of &euro;60,000 to angling events, signage, marketing and promotion; </p><p>- Riparian enhancement, conservation and regeneration work completed on river channels; </p><p>- Anti-poaching equipment purchased and installed; </p><p>- 10 organised angling events funded to encourage positive social inclusion in communities; </p><p>- Over 5,000 hours of engagement and communication from IFI local staff and Projects Office to provide mutual support, information, assistance and advice. </p><p>- In respect of 2019, an additional &euro;393,000 has been allocated to IFI to fund initiatives to promote increased participation in angling by young people and novice anglers.</p></reply>

In that context, licences are valid for the statutorily defined commercial fishing season during the year of their issue. They are public licences and do not confer any property or other rights on the holder. </p>  <p>  However, annual licensing is based on the most recent track record in the fishery of the participants/applicants as set out in the relevant annual statutory provisions. Consideration of such track records can obviously only reference the years in which the rivers were open to harvest and the closure of a river does not impact the issuing of licences in this manner.</p></reply>

The operation and enforcement of the framework is principally a matter for each Local Authority.   The National Litter Pollution Monitoring Survey (NLPMS) is undertaken nationwide annually by Local Authorities. It provides a detailed overview of the litter pollution situation nationally, based on surveys undertaken by individual Local Authorities which are then, with the financial support of my Department, collated into a national report. The most recent results, for 2017, are available to the public on www.litter.ie . </p>  <p>  The data obtained from the NLPMS helps Local Authorities to provide more effective litter management planning for their areas, to assess the effectiveness of their litter management strategies, and to ensure the optimum allocation of resources to tackle litter. It provides vital information to the Department on the national picture regarding litter pollution. The results demonstrate that the percentage of areas surveyed deemed to display a high level of cleanliness increased from 48% in 2002 to over 79% in 2017 (latest available data). </p>  <p>  The methodology used by Local Authorities to gather litter data, including within the context of the NLPMS, is largely a matter for Local Authorities themselves. However, I am aware that a number of Local Authorities already use technology to gather litter data and, based on their experience, that it does offer the potential to reduce the administrative and time burden in carrying out this important task. I welcome the use of emerging technologies in this context where such benefits arise, and my Department is currently considering the scope for the wider use by Local Authorities of such technology for litter data collection, in consultation with a number of Local Authorities.</p></reply>

This allows motor vehicles to travel freely between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain as well as within other EU countries.  </p>  <p>  If the UK leaves the EU with a transition period, there should be no immediate change in the position regarding travel.  If the transition period is followed by a lasting arrangement which allows for travel under the current terms, there will be no further changes.  Should a no deal Brexit occur, the UK (including Northern Ireland) will no longer be party to the Motor Insurance Directive. This means that a Green Card will be required to demonstrate to the authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain that valid motor insurance cover is in place for those vehicles, and vehicles from the UK coming to the State will likewise require a Green Card as proof of insurance.  However, even in the case of a no deal scenario, the EU Commission would be able under the Motor Insurance Directive to declare that vehicles entering the EU from the UK would not require a Green Card.  It would be a matter for the UK authorities to determine whether they required a Green Card for Irish vehicles.  My Department continues to liaise with the European Commission on this issue.</p>  <p>  As part of necessary contingency preparations, the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) has advised that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Green Cards will be begin to be issued to affected policyholders in March 2019 and policy holders are advised to contact their insurers a month in advance of their expected travel date.  This is an example of prudent advance planning by the MIBI and the wider insurance sector. </p>  <p>  The Green Card is used as proof of insurance.  The Department understands that the vast majority of Irish motor insurance policies already include cover for travel in the UK. In such cases drivers will continue to be insured to drive in the UK even in a no-deal Brexit. However, they will need to carry the Green Card as proof of insurance if no other agreement is reached with the European Commission in the meantime.  </p>  <p>  Not all policies may include such cover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In that eventuality, drivers who may be travelling to or through Northern Ireland or Great Britain should check their motor insurance policies and, if in doubt, check with their insurers that such travel would be covered.</p></reply>

In 2018, Tusla provided some &euro;6m in funding to a range of organisations that provide child and adolescent counselling and psychotherapy services.</p>  <p>  Children and young people who have been exposed to domestic violence may access specialist services either while residing in emergency domestic violence accommodation units or through community based domestic violence services. Those who have been assessed as needing psychotherapeutic intervention, may avail of Tusla funding on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  Tusla currently funds two specialist intervention programmes which are targeted at children and non-abusive parents who have been exposed to domestic violence; Domestic Abuse Recovering Together (DART) and TLC Kidz.  These programmes are not classified as psychotherapeutic programmes. </p>  <p>  In 2018, Tusla also provided funding for the delivery of ten courses, based on the DART or TLC Kidz models, throughout the country. Funding was also provided to plan for the future expansion of the aforementioned programmes for delivery in other locations throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Tusla is commissioning a review of the current provision of therapeutic services for young people by Tusla - funded sexual violence organisations, or rape crisis centres. The review is due to be completed this year and will inform Tusla's future commissioning of therapeutic services for older children who are victims of sexual violence. </p>  <p>  Tusla will continue to work closely with service providers to support children and young people at risk and the effective functioning of families.</p></reply>

This retirement age is set at 55 due to the physically demanding nature of the fire-fighter role. The retirement age for retained fire fighters is 55 with an extended period to age 58, subject to a formal application process including a compulsory medical assessment. </p>  <p>The enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 1989, underpinned by subsequent legislation, outlined in statute the duty of each fire authority, as an employer, to avoid placing employees at unnecessary risk. The retirement age was considered in this context given the physically demanding nature of the role.     </p>  <p>  A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved (SIPTU and ATGWU) in November 2002.  This collective agreement provided, inter alia, for the appointment of an expert group which would advise on the retirement age for retained firefighters. The Report recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age. Following on from the Report a circular was issued by my Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained firefighters.</p>  <p>  In general, any major changes to the terms and conditions of fire-fighters, proposed by either management or unions are discussed and negotiated, as appropriate, under the established industrial relations processes. In this regard, I understand that the retirement age for firefighters was discussed recently as part of preliminary discussions on a range of issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, between the Local Government Management Agency (representing the employers) and SIPTU.</p></reply>

Consequently, since 1 April 2011, RAS  tenants are now considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing. </p>  <p>  Recognising that tenants housed through RAS prior to this change might have had reasonable expectations in regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued from the Housing Agency in 2011 recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway for pre-2011 RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support. The arrangement effectively allowed these households to be designated as a &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; applicant and to maintain their position for allocation as they had on the main waiting list.</p>  <p>  All tenants allocated RAS accommodation post 1st April 2011 (and thus under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009) were informed at the time of offer and allocation, that because RAS is now a social housing support, their housing need is met and that they will no longer remain on the main social housing waiting list.</p>  <p>  However, it is recommended that allocation schemes also provide a &lsquo;transfer pathway&rsquo; for new RAS tenants ,whereby households in RAS have access to the transfer list in the same way as tenants in local authority accommodation. </p>  <p>  Where a vacant property arises, it is a matter for individual housing authorities, in accordance with their allocation schemes, to determine whether the allocation is made to a household on the main waiting list, or to a transfer applicant, such as a household from RAS, and the method of such allocation. It is open to housing authorities to specify in their allocation schemes the proportion of allocations which will be reserved for transfers, and within this, how many may be reserved for households seeking transfers to other forms of social housing support.</p></reply>

The scheme applies to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities. One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all borrowers, who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme, except where their application has been rejected by the current insurance provider. Where a prospective borrower fails to qualify under the local authority MPI scheme, they must source comparable and alternative adequate cover elsewhere and provide evidence of this cover to the local authority. Therefore, for each Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan that has been drawdown to date, mortgage protection has also been taken out.</p>  <p>  While there is provision under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, that where a lender offers a particular mortgage protection policy, in accordance with the requirements of that Act, the borrower can source an alternative policy to suit their needs, that provision does not apply to local authorities.  </p>  <p>  The local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme is overseen by the Mortgage Protection Committee which is a sub-committee of the County and City Management Association and consists of representatives from the CCMA, local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and my Department.  The policy is subject to periodic review and competitive tendering to ensure value for money for the policy holders over the entire life of the mortgage.</p>  <p>  As the previous MPI contract (2012-2016) was ending on 31 December 2016, it was necessary to undertake a public procurement competition for the provision and administration of a new scheme from 1 January 2017 for a period of 3 years.   As a result of the competitive process undertaken, there was no change in the insurance provider for the Scheme.</p>  <p>  According to the most recent RIHL figures from the Housing Agency, as of the end of January, the average loan amount for all applications recommended for approval to date is &euro;188,924.  The current rate for the MPI scheme since the 01 January 2017 is 0.555%, therefore the estimated average monthly repayment for MPI is &euro;87.38.</p></reply>

As you will be aware, 2018 marked the centenary of a new era for women with the passage of the <i>Representation of the People Act</i>and the <i>Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act</i>.  On the centenary of passage of the former last February, I launched a State programme to commemorate these significant legislative changes.  The changes came from years of agitation by the suffrage movement and from the significant social change across Britain and Ireland that arose during World War One.  My Department supported a number of initiatives during the year under the commemorative programme.</p><p>On 21 November last, I announced the Markievicz bursaries initiative to assist artists to produce new work that reflects on the role of women in the period covered by the centenary commemorations and beyond.  Awards will be made to up to five artists/writers under the scheme each year (2019-2023) to a value of &euro;20,000 per individual or group.  The Arts Council is administering the bursaries on behalf of my Department and will begin accepting on-line applications from artists shortly under the initiative. </p><p>In bringing forward plans to mark the significant historical events that took place between 1919 - 1923, my approach will continue to be informed and supported by the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations and developed in consultation with the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations.</p><p>It is, I believe, very fitting that local authorities have a leading role in supporting inclusive, respectful and meaningful community-led commemorations, augmented as appropriate with support from the State, which will be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>In recognition of the very important role that local authorities have played to date, and will continue to have, in encouraging measured and authentic citizen engagement which is sensitive to the local context, I have requested my officials to organise a special Decade of Centenaries forum for the local authorities, to take place on 13th March.</p><p>While the overall commemorative programme for the period, comprised of the measures set out above, will be subject to further development, there is at present no funding available from my Department for the purpose in question.</p><p><font color="#FFFFFF">End of Take</font></p></reply>
