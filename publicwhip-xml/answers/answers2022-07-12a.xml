In the case of a vulnerable person including an asylum seeker looking to access the service, it is my understanding that in any situation where a person requires a Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) to access urgent or emergency medical services, but hasn&rsquo;t yet been assigned one, the Department of Social Protection can and will allocate a PPSN for that purpose.</p>  <p>  There is regular ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to facilitate the operation of the service and to resolve any issues that may arise and we will continue to ensure the positive rollout and enhancement of these healthcare services.</p>  <p>  The Review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 which is currently underway will assess the effectiveness of the operation of the legislation. This purpose of the review is to facilitate monitoring of the operation of the legislation in practice, as well as of the delivery of services in the area. </p></reply>

However, similar to other hospitals in remote locations, staff recruitment challenges have unfortunately had an impact on bed capacity. Cork Kerry Community Healthcare continues to endeavour to recruit staff in order to increase the number of community beds for the region and maximise the services available. The goal is to ensure that the maximum number of people that can be safely accommodated in our community hospitals are being accommodated. I can assure the Deputy that all efforts are being made to increase both staff numbers and bed capacity in West Kerry.</p>  <p>  In terms of the current complement of staff in West Kerry, there are a total of 15.7 Whole-time Equivalent nursing staff, 21.8 Whole-time Equivalent Healthcare Assistants and 11.8 Whole-time Equivalent Other staff. At the beginning of 2022 there were 12.5 Whole-time Equivalent nursing staff, 20.8 Whole-time Equivalent Healthcare Assistants and 8 Whole-time Equivalent Other staff.</p>  <p>In terms of recruitment of staff, one Registered General Nurse commenced employment in May, one has returned part-time, two are due to start this month, while another is in the recruitment clearance process. In terms of Healthcare Assistants, one began employment in February; another in March, and two more were interviewed in May and have been placed on a panel.  </p></reply>

The number of COVID-positive patients in our hospitals exceeded 1,000 this week. </p>  <p>  Recent high levels of Emergency Department attendances, especially when combined with increased COVID-19 prevalence, have also resulted in additional curtailment of elective activity in some hospitals, all of which is negatively impacting our ability to remain aligned to our ambitious waiting list reduction targets. </p>  <p>  However, to date the loss of activity has been broadly compensated by lower additions to waiting lists. Lower hospital waiting list referrals is likely another impact of the COVID-19 surges, but enhanced direct access to diagnostics for GPs in the community is also helping. </p>  <p>  There are recent indicators that hospital waiting list additions and removals are now returning to projected levels which means the HSE and the NTPF are focusing on the challenges of ramping up their additional activity levels, funded by the Plan, over the coming months to ensure we remain aligned with the targets set out in the Plan.  </p>  <p>  Despite these challenges, patients waiting more than 6 months for 15 &lsquo;high volume procedures&rsquo; are on target to receive an offer of treatment by the NTPF in 2022. These procedures are currently being expanded to 20 and represent approximately a third of people currently on the IPDC waiting list.</p>  <p>A Waiting List Task Force, co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and HSE CEO, meets regularly to oversee and drive delivery of the Plan.  </p></reply>

Unfortunately, all services within the HSE are currently experiencing significant recruitment challenges due to shortages of Health and Social Care Professionals, including Occupational Therapists. This has, regrettably, led to significant waiting times for services. The HSE advise that it is reviewing all options to address the current level of vacancies as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

Officials are now working to progress payments to those members of the Defence Forces redeployed to front-line covid-exposed clinical settings in the HSE. </p><p>This is a complex task because:</p><p>-  these employees are not normally paid by the public health service,</p><p>-  duplicate payments need to be avoided, and</p><p>-  there are many other organisations to be covered alongside the Defence Forces as the payment is rolled out.</p><p>With that in mind, figures are not yet available for the number of staff eligible.

A key commitment of this Government is to continue implementing the National Dementia Strategy so that people living with dementia can live well for as long as possible. </p><p>In 2022 there was &euro;15million of increased investment dedicated to dementia specific supports and services, on top of the &euro;12.9million additional funding from 2021. This unprecedented level of increased funding for dementia specific services has allowed for substantial advancements across a number of areas including:</p><p>- Dementia diagnostic services with two new regional specialist memory clinics and 9 new memory assessment and support services</p><p>- Enhancement of acute care pathways for people with dementia through the recruitment of dementia specific posts and the implementation of a clinical guideline </p><p>- Post diagnostic supports through the enhancement of memory technology resource rooms across the country </p><p>- Increase the proportion of home support hours ringfenced for people with dementia to 11% </p><p>In addition, funding in 2021 allowed for an expansion of the Dementia Advisor Network from 8 to 29 advisors providing support to people with dementia across the country. </p><p>A Model Care for Dementia has been developed by the HSE. This outlines care pathways for people with dementia from early signs/symptoms through to assessment, diagnosis, disclosure, care planning  and post-diagnostic support. </p></reply>

It applies to the assessment process for both single people and to family assessments. This measure gave effect to an important recommendation of the Make Work Pay for People with Disabilities report. It enables people in receipt of the disability allowance to have a higher level of earnings and still retain their medical card. </p>  <p>  The HSE does not routinely collate information to facilitate a detailed breakdown in the manner sought. The HSE has, however, provided a high-level analysis which indicates that 3,000 persons approximately are estimated to have benefited from the measure. The substantial increase in allowable earnings introduced in 2018 acknowledges that a Medical Card is a particularly significant support and ensures that people with disabilities can continue to be supported to access care when needed.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, people who have been on a disability payment for at least a year can retain a Medical Card for a further three years on return to work, provided they were in receipt of the payment for a period of at least 12 months prior to commencing employment. </p></reply>

It is clear that action is required there on multiple fronts- the ED, beds, diagnostics and staffing.</p><p>I am pleased to say that the interim ED is nearing completion. This includes additional resuscitation spaces, support accommodation, and improved infection prevention and control measures. </p><p>It is expected that new facilities would be available for patients and staff over the summer.</p><p>While improving service delivery capability, the interim ED will also serve as enabling works for the larger project; freeing up the site required for the proposed new block.</p><p>I am aware that this project has been discussed for over 10 years and I spoke with the team there about this. I subsequently asked for the development of the SAR to be prioritised by the HSE. </p><p>One of the reasons that the project is still in development phase is that there has been a very significant increase in the scale and ambition for the solution there.</p><p>Proposals are now costed in the hundreds of millions. As the Deputy will be aware, all projects proposed in excess of &euro;100m must be subject to the full scrutiny of the Public Spending Code process.</p><p>If the SAR is passed, a preliminary business case will be updated by HSE and be brought forward for further review.</p></reply>

There is a considerable backlog of unmet needs, alongside the growth in numbers requiring residential care due to demographic changes where more older people with disabilities are living with elderly parents. The Disability Action Plan is in the process of being finalised.</p><p>The scale of emergency residential care needs as assessed by the HSE has meant that in recent years, most new residential care provision has gone to meet such needs, with little scope for planned moves before situations reach an emergency point. To begin to refocus towards planned provision, budget 2022 has provided funding for a pilot project on planned residential care provision. This is a joint project between the Brothers of Charity and Ability West in CHO4, which will provide for 32 people to move in a planned way to a home of their own. </p><p>HSE Disability Services provide a wide range of supports to those with physical, sensory, intellectual disability whose needs cannot be met by mainstream services or at primary care level.  </p><p>Residential services are provided according to the needs and requirements of the individuals through a range of housing types from congregated settings to individual supports to people who may live semi-independently. </p><p>There are approximately 90 service providers providing residential services to more than 8,300 individuals throughout the country. It should be noted that people accessing residential services are not a homogenous group but have hugely differing and changing needs.</p><p><b><i>The 2022 National Service Plan</i></b></p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s residential services seek to support individuals in a person-centred way in community settings.</p><p>In the 2022 National Service Plan, the HSE plans to provide a range of residential supports creating 106 additional places and packages in response to current and demographic need. Specifically, the planned breakdown of investment is: 50 places responding to priority needs, 36 planned residential places, 10 supported living places and 10 intensive home support packages to support transitions and discharges from acute services and the National Rehabilitation Hospital.</p><p>The HSE aims to provide 143 people with a disability living in congregated settings with more person-centred homes in the community. A budget of &euro;5 million in funding has been allocated toward this.</p><p>The 2022 National Service Plan has also provided for &euro;5.5m in funding to support a further 63 people to move from nursing home settings to homes of their choosing in the community.</p></reply>

From January 2022 to the end of June 2022 the average wait time in the ED in MUH was 6.7 hours.</p>  <p>  MUH are utilising the unit that was used exclusively for Covid for other ED attendances which will help  improve the wait time for patients. The present changes in the Covid streaming is also having an immediate positive impact for the patients presenting to the ED by ambulance.</p>  <p>  On the 9th of May,  the hospital opened the Acute Medical Assessment Unit (AMAU) which will ensure appropriate patients are transferred from the ED. GPs will also be able to refer patients directly to the AMAU rather than the ED. </p>  <p>  The hospital are currently recruiting nursing staff  to open 6 additional medical beds in St John&rsquo;s ward in the Sacred Heart Hospital which will improve patient flow and reduce wait times for patients in MUH ED. </p>  <p>  Quality improvement meetings are taking place with consultants, senior nursing staff and hospital management ensuring all opportunities for improvement are maximised. </p>  <p>  A capital submission in relation to a proposed new extension to the existing emergency department at MUH was received by the HSE from the Saolta hospital group and the local capital and estates office in January 2021. The project has been included in the HSE capital plan 2022 to progress to the design phase of the project.</p>  <p>  The HSE have confirmed that the design team has since been appointed and initial surveys and design work have commenced in preparation for the preliminary business case which will be prepared in line with public spending code. Given the early stage reached into design and planning of the project it is not possible to provide specific project details or timeline at this point.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have requested that the HSE set out short-term immediate actions to alleviate the pressure on EDs, including in MUH, and to ensure that our hospitals are ready for winter. I also requested the development of a longer-term plan for reform and improvement of unscheduled care, in line with expected increases in demand driven by population growth and an aging population. This plan will build on the substantial investment over the past two years in initiatives such as additional capacity, more staff, increased home care packages and greater GP access to diagnostics. </p></reply>

This evaluation will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past two years. This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type of emergency arrives. </p>  <p>  I recognise how difficult it has been for the families of nursing home residents who died during this pandemic, which has presented one of the greatest and most wide-ranging public health challenges internationally in recent history. Throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, particularly those resident in nursing homes. </p>  <p>  This included the establishment of a structured nursing home support system, in line with National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendations, to provide enhanced supports to public and private nursing homes. A comprehensive package of direct and indirect supports was established in early 2020 and many of these remain active across the country to support nursing homes on a proactive basis.     </p>  <p>  In addition, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established early in the pandemic in May 2020  to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing response. </p>  <p>  One of the most important things we can take from the sadness, illness, and death experienced over the last two years is our learning and understanding of the challenges facing the nursing home sector. Through engagement with key stakeholders in the nursing home sector, including residents, their families and advocacy groups, we are committed to implementing the recommendations of the Nursing Homes Expert Panel and a programme of reform is ongoing across health agencies and stakeholders to ensure an improved quality of service and experience for residents into the future.   </p></reply>

In the tables for Cork University Hospital and Mercy University Hospital enclosed, the Median ED PETs by age cohort for the month of June 2022 as per the available date are listed. These median PETs account for both patients that are subsequently admitted from the ED to a ward and those that are discharged. Please note that we do not have data for July 2022 as requested at this stage. </p><p>To calculate the average PET across all age cohorts, a weighted average PET for June 2022 has been calculated using the total ED attendances for each age cohort. For CUH it is 7.94 hours, and for MUH it is 7.01 hours. These averages represent a marked improvement over the May 2022 average of 10.60 hours and 9.20 hours respectively, however, it is important to note that the June PETs are currently provisional pending national validation. </p><p>The HSE advised that May 2022 was a challenging month for Cork Hospitals with regard to ED wait times and significant work has been undertaken by the Hospitals in conjunction with the South/South West Hospital Group to address the situation. This has involved a cooperation with Cork/Kerry Community Healthcare to improve discharging and promote alternative care pathways, and engagement with the National Ambulance Service to in relation to the volume of ambulances presenting to the two Cork Emergency departments. </p></reply>

BreastCheck invite this age category because international evidence shows the incidence and mortality from breast cancer in this age group means it is effective to screen women in this age range. </p>  <p>  The National Screening Service (NSS) advises that BreastCheck delivers its services in line with international criteria for screening programmes, based on the best international evidence, which they kept under constant review. </p>  <p>  Regarding any further changing or lowering the age eligibility for BreastCheck, it is important to note that any future decisions about changes to our national screening programmes, including reducing the age range in breast screening, will be made on the advice of our National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC). This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria.  </p>  <p>  It is important that we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms. </p>  <p>  The Committee's first Annual Call for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes received a significant response. Following submissions received from several sources, including from BreastCheck, the Committee decided to ask HIQA to look at the evidence to extend the age ranges for breast screening. The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme later this year once it has considered all proposals submitted. </p>  <p>  It is an important message to remind that screening is for healthy people without symptoms.? If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact their GP who will arrange appropriate follow-up care. It is important that every woman is breast aware.  This means knowing what is normal for them so that if any unusual change occurs, they will recognise it. The National Screening Service and BreastCheck have useful information in relation to breast health on their website.</p></reply>

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) kept emerging evidence and guidance in relation to the modes and mechanisms of COVID-19 transmission under constant review to ensure that the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) used to mitigate and minimize the risks of viral transmission in different environments and settings (self-isolation if symptomatic, contact tracing and outbreak control, physical distancing and the avoidance of crowding especially indoors, face coverings, ventilation and hand and respiratory hygiene) were based on the best available evidence and public health experience of the management of cases and outbreaks. The NPHET&rsquo;s advice to Government consistently and repeatedly highlighted the importance of ventilation as a key mitigation measure and as part of a layered approach. Appreciation of the role of ventilation has evolved in the context of developing experience and evidence. Guidance, training and measures implemented reflect this learning, and the importance of ventilation in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 is embedded in Government communications. </p><p><b>Sector Specific Guidance for Healthcare Settings</b></p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control Division (AMRIC) was established in early 2019, under the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer.  HSE AMRIC provides expert advice on the practical and safe implementation and application of antimicrobial resistance and infection control measures in health and social care settings. HSE AMRIC guidance promotes adequate ventilation as one of a number of measures to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>On 10<sup>th</sup>May 2022, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) published updated IPC guidance for acute hospitals and community settings: </p><p>www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/infectionpreventionandcontrolguidance/buildingsandfacilitiesguidance/Infection%20Control%20Guiding%20Principles%20for%20Building.pdf </p></reply>

Following a call for submissions, I established a cross-departmental Strategic Workforce Advisory Group to examine factors affecting the care sector workforce in March of this year.</p>  <p>  The remit of the Group is to identify&mdash;and formulate recommendations to address&mdash;strategic workforce challenges in the home-support and nursing home sectors. Accordingly, the Group is examining issues such as the recruitment, retention, training, career-development, and pay and conditions of front-line carers in these sectors so that solutions can be found.</p>  <p>  To date the Group has met five times with the most recent meeting being held last week. The Group&rsquo;s deliberations have been informed by a structured programme of stakeholder-engagement consisting of a series of bilateral meetings and a facilitated workshop. Engagement with key stakeholders in the home-support and nursing home sectors continues to inform the Group&rsquo;s exploration of the issues arising.</p>  <p>  In addition, the work of the Group will be informed by an evidence review of the role, function, and supply of home-support workers in four European countries, which the Department of Health has  commissioned from the Health Research Board. This will provide insight into home-support workers&rsquo; employment-conditions internationally.</p>  <p>  A report outlining the Group&rsquo;s key findings and recommendations will be submitted to me by September 2022.</p></reply>

Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. This increase helps to ensure that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  With regard to the estimated cost of the Deputy's proposal, the data required to model this is not readily available and it is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the associated cost.</p>  <p>  However, I wish to assure the Deputy that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds under review and any changes that may be required are considered in the context of Government policy, the annual budgetary estimates process and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

The Review will assess the effectiveness of the operation of the legislation and will be conducted in a fair and transparent manner. </p>  <p>  The Review comprises of 2 main phases. As part of the first phase of the review, information, and evidence on the operation of the Act is being collected from women who use the service, from health professionals that provide the service, and from the public. The three elements within the first phase of the Review have initiated:</p>  <p>  - Public Consultation. The public consultation provided organisations, stakeholders, advocacy groups working in the area and all other interested parties with the opportunity to inform the Review of the operation of the legislation. The consultation closed on 1st April. Submissions received as part of this process are currently being reviewed.</p>  <p>  - Service User Perspective. Research to inform the service user strand is being carried out by Dr Catherine Conlon who is progressing a qualitative study to investigate unplanned pregnancy and abortion care. This study, which was commissioned by the HSE&rsquo;s Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme in September 2019, will generate an in-depth understanding of the experiences of women who have accessed abortion care services since the commencement of the Act. This study report is due to be published imminently.</p>  <p>  - Service Provider Perspective. Research to inform the service provider strand is being carried out by Manchester Metropolitan University. This qualitative research will capture the views/experiences of termination of pregnancy service providers.</p>  <p>  The second phase of the Review is being led by an independent Chair, Marie O&rsquo;Shea BL, who will assess the extent to which the objectives of the 2018 Act have been achieved, analysing in that regard the findings of the three major research inputs.</p>  <p>  A final report will be submitted to me in late 2022 for consideration.</p></reply>

The role of the Civil Service is to support the Government of the day to develop and implement its policies. The Public Servants employed by the HSE deliver the service to the citizens of Ireland. There are a great range of opportunities available to those working within the Health Service which provide employees with the opportunity to work on initiatives that will help Ireland respond to the challenges of a changing world. The Health Service has a diverse and inclusive workforce, with ample opportunities for progression and upskilling. </p>  <p>  There are a huge variety of roles to suit professionals at all levels of skills and experience. In any organisation one can expect a turnover of staff for a variety of reasons. The recovery in the economy has led to increased opportunities for many organisations to attract senior staff from both the private and public sector. The Health Service has seen recent resignations from senior posts for a variety of reasons such as wishing to spend more time with family or a wish to self-develop by moving to a new organisation. These are normal movements in organisations across the world.</p>  <p>  As with any organisation when a staff member moves on, either for career progression or to spend more time with family, the objectives of the organisation remain and it is important for the organisation to go to the market to fill the vacant position with the best talent available for the post. I&rsquo;m pleased to say that some posts have been filled already and process of filling the soon to be vacant post is in progress.</p>  <p>  Staff movement is a normal part of business in any Government Department.  It is not particularly unusual for staff to resign from the Department and they do so for a variety of reasons.  There have been two recent resignations from senior posts in my Department, both from members of staff who have had considerable years of service. It is a personal matter for any individual as to their reasons for leaving the Department, whether on retirement or to take up a different post elsewhere.  </p></reply>

Senior officials in my Department have engaged closely with patient groups and other stakeholders over the past year, to finalise the terms of reference and set up this inquiry.</p>  <p>  This inquiry will be designed around giving a voice to patients and their families while looking at the use of sodium valproate in Ireland since it was first licensed. It was important that enough time and resources were invested in scoping out the work to be done and engaging with patient groups. There were a lot of factors to consider, and I wanted to develop a terms of reference that would deliver on our goals. One important aspect is to create an environment that supports families who want to tell their story during this inquiry, and my officials are working to ensure that supports are in place to facilitate this.     </p>  <p>  There are lots of different groups involved here, including the manufacturer, prescribers of the drug, and our medicines and pharmacy regulators.  As a result, there is a lot of preparatory work involved in laying the groundwork for this inquiry. However, I would like to see the inquiry commencing this year, and my officials will continue to engage with the patient groups in order to make that happen. </p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on the issue of flu vaccination in the future.</p>  <p>  Prior to 2020/2021, the seasonal influenza vaccination was available without charge to Medical or GP Visit card holders in one of the HSE-defined at-risk groups. Those in the at-risk groups, who did not hold a medical card or a GP visit card were provided the vaccine without charge and typically paid an administration fee to have the vaccine administered. </p>  <p>  In 2020/2021, given the potential for the winter influenza season to coincide with a resurgence of COVID-19 and the importance of minimising hospital attendance for the treatment of influenza, the Government expanded the provision of vaccination without charge to all of those in the at-risk groups, regardless of eligibility status.</p>  <p>  This expanded programme ensured that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza had access to vaccination without charge. This was intended to encourage uptake and thereby result in a reduction in the number of influenza-related hospital admissions and in the overall spread of influenza in the community. This expanded programme will be continued during the 2022-2023 flu season.</p></reply>

This aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged and ensure greater capacity in the future. It will also help to address waiting lists on a national level through the provision of dedicated, standalone facilities in Cork, Galway and Dublin.</p>  <p>  As agreed by Government, the elective care scope of service will be developed in two phases. The first phase will commence with day cases, diagnostics, and outpatients. The provision of in-patient treatment will be considered in a subsequent phase. The need for this future in-patient care will be factored into the detailed planning and design phase of the elective facilities.  </p>  <p>  The development of the elective hospital proposals is following the process outlined in the updated Public Spending Code. This sets out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning, and management of large public investment projects. A programme Preliminary Business Case (PBC) has been finalised by my Department and shared with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A project-level PBC for Cork is complete and is being reviewed under the required Public Spending Code&rsquo;s External Assurance Process. Once this is complete, it will be assessed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Major Projects Advisory Group, following which Government approval-in-principle to proceed with the project will be sought. It is intended that the project-level Preliminary Business Case for Cork will make a recommendation on a preferred site option.</p></reply>

Criteria for eligibility of payment for HSE and Section-38 staff was published on 19 April.<b></b>Since 1July, over 75,000 of these staff have received payment. Payment is being prioritised across all services and will be made to all eligible workers as soon as possible. </p><p>The payment will also be rolled out to eligible employees of specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the Government decision. This roll out is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention. </p></reply>

It is important that the local community of Dublin 18 &ndash; and indeed communities across the country &ndash; have access to public health nurses when they need them. </p>  <p>  This is why the Government is investing &euro;195 million this year to deliver the Enhanced Community Care Programme and establish 96 Community Health Networks nationally. These networks will be central to the development of improved primary care services and will enable an expansion of primary care capacity.  There will be eight such networks across the suburbs of Dublin South and South East. </p>  <p>  As part of the ECC programme, 3,500 additional staff will be recruited nationally, with a particular focus on nursing and health and social care professionals. Latest figures show that over 2,000 of these staff are recruited or at an advanced stage of recruitment.     </p>  <p>  The ECC programme and associated recruitment will boost public health nursing services within Dublin South and Dublin South East, with an additional 15 nursing posts allocated to the area. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, it is the case that the HSE has identified challenges to attracting and retaining nurses that are particular to the Dublin area and affecting recruitment in Dublin 18. These challenges include the availability of property to rent and to buy, cost of living expenses, childcare expenses, and commuting issues.  These factors also apply to difficulties in accessing agency staff.</p>  <p>  The HSE are working to mitigate these challenges as far as possible at both local and national level. This includes the implementation of an accelerated recruitment campaigns as well as planned engagement with third level institutions in order to recruit newly qualified graduates.  </p>  <p>  The HSE also plan to boost international recruitment efforts.  These initiatives have the potential to address the recruitment challenges being experienced in Dublin 18. At the same time, it is important to recognise that the recruitment challenge is not straightforward and that we are competing in a competitive international marketplace for skilled nursing staff.    </p>  <p>  It is also the case that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted on the capacity of the Public Health Nursing to deliver core child health services.  Since March 2020, many Public Health Nurses have been redeployed to support COVID-19 related clinical activities, including vaccination. </p>  <p>  As COVID-19 testing and vaccination services are scaled back, available public health nurses are being reassigned from vaccination centres to their core duties with child development check services prioritised.  I am optimistic that this will result in improved service delivery across the country, including Dublin 18.  For example, the HSE have advised that three nurses have recently been reassigned from the Shoreline Vaccination Centre to Dublin South East. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health recognises the need to improve access to the wide range of services provided by public health nurses. I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the HSE to address the challenges that exist in Dublin 18.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-12a.269.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071200072#WRG01900"><p>The Government has established two concurrent citizens' assemblies; one dealing with biodiversity loss and the other with the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin. It is proposed that a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use will directly follow these two assemblies, with the intention of running it concurrently with the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the Future of Education, if learnings from the concurrent running of assemblies suggest that this operational model is the best way forward.</p>  <p>  In line with this decision, the Department of Health has commenced preparations for the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use, and, to this end, detailed discussions regarding the assembly took place at the most recent meeting of the National Oversight Committee for the National Drugs Strategy. These preparations are being undertaken to ensure that there will be no delay in establishing this citizens&rsquo; assembly when the two assemblies which are currently operating complete their work before the end of this year or in quarter 1, 2023 at the latest. This will allow a period of over one year for the Government to consider its recommendations. </p>  <p>  The Government is pursuing a health-led approach to drug use through the health diversion programme, which offers compassion, not punishment to people who are in possession of drugs for personal use. The programme will connect participants with health services and provide a pathway to recovery. It will also allow participants to avoid a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly for younger people.</p>  <p>  As we prepare for the Citizens Assembly on Drug Use, work continues to implement the health diversion programme and the strategic priorities for the remaining four years of the national drugs strategy. One of these priorities is to promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences. This priority aligns with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan, 2021 &ndash; 2025, which actively encourages Member States to scale up alternatives to coercive sanctions and to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness for drug using offenders and for people arrested, charged with or convicted for drug-related offences or people found in possession of drugs for personal use.</p>  <p>  I am very positive about the potential contribution of the citizens assembly to the government's health-led response to drug use. Drug use affects all members of society, whether directly or indirectly, and imposes very significant social and financial costs. Involving citizens in decision-making on drugs policy is therefore appropriate. </p></reply>

One of these actions is to develop and agree a multi-annual waiting list reduction plan to support the achievement of the Government maximum wait time targets.</p>  <p>  Our immediate priority under the Action Plan during the first half of 2022 has been to focus on identifying and funding additional activity to reduce the number of people waiting, with a particular focus on long waiters. The HSE and the NTPF are currently delivering this additional activity. Implementation of the Action Plan is being governed by a Waiting List Task Force, co-chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and the CEO of the HSE, who are meeting regularly. </p>  <p>  The focus of the Task Force for the remainder of 2022, in addition to overseeing and driving additional activity, is now turning to delivery of a multi-annual waiting list reduction plan that will provide direction over the coming years to implement longer-term reform measures.</p>  <p>  Such reform measures include modernising patient care pathways to bring care closer to the community and reduce the pressure on our hospitals, and greatly enhancing the availability and analysis of waiting list data and information. In this area, we have already seen the initial roll out to hospitals by the HSE of a health performance visualisation platform (HPVP) to introduce a new automated approach to acute hospitals information management that will produce timely, meaningful insights and reports.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan will both positively impact the numbers of people waiting in 2022, as well as bring about real and lasting change to our waiting lists in the future by being the first year of a comprehensive and strategic multi-annual waiting list reduction and reform programme, the plan for which will be published during Q4 of this year, as was previously specified in the Sl&aacute;intecare Action Plan 2022 published by my Department on 8th June.</p></reply>

Any proposed model involving salaried GP positions would require careful consideration to ensure the required level of service could be provided for medical card and GP visit card holders.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is committed to increasing the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement additional annual expenditure provided for general practice has to date been increased by &euro;206.6m and is set to increase to &euro;211.6m per annum next year when the Agreement is fully rolled out. This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  The GP Agreement includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement, to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future.  Preparatory work on the review will commence this year. The review will examine the broad range of issues affecting general practice, and will set out measures necessary to deliver a sustainable service into the future. </p></reply>

My Department is currently engaging with the HSE in relation to this process, with a view to it being completed within a matter of weeks. </p>  <p>This process will need to be completed before I consider a definitive date for the implementation of proposed changes.

This includes the &euro;150 million I secured in Budget 2021 to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services and to provide 5 million additional hours of home support.     </p>  <p>  In 2021 some 20.4 million hours was provided to over 55,000 people. This is about 2.9 million more hours compared to 2020, an increase of 17%.  In 2022, our aim is to provide 23.67 million hours of home support.  </p>  <p>  At the end of May preliminary data shows that 55,392 people were receiving home support and over 8.7 million hours has been delivered year to date.  The preliminary data also shows significant inroads have been achieved in reducing waiting lists for funding approval for new or additional service from over 7,800 in January 2020 to 348 in May 2022.  This reduction has been achieved through a combination of validation of the waiting list and availability of additional funding to address those waiting.  However, there can be a lag between funding approval and the actual delivery of home support hours.  Certain geographical areas that are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability are particularly affected.</p>  <p>  At the end of May provisional information shows that there were 4,720 people assessed and approved for Home Support but were awaiting a carer to be assigned. In January 2020, there was about 1,300 people in this category. Despite the increase, it is important to note that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to 5,068 at the end of May 2022. </p>  <p>  The number of home support hours in communities is increasing, in line with enhanced investment. Delivering this enhanced capacity requires substantial recruitment. This has been affected due to the strategic workforce challenges in the sector.  </p>  <p>  I have established an Advisory Group to identify the specific obstacles to recruiting carers.  The Group is committed to providing me with a set of recommendations by September.  </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to advertise for Health Care Assistants.  In my ongoing engagements with the Chief Officers I have recommended that they consider a renewed focus in advertising these positions locally.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy refers to home care issues in Mayo, these would be operational matters and I have therefore referred this part of your question to the HSE to reply directly to you.</p></reply>

As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement additional annual expenditure provided for general practice has to date been increased by &euro;206.6m and is set to increase to &euro;211.6m per annum next year when the Agreement is fully rolled out. This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021.  258 places will be available this year. The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead. The ICGP aims to have 350 training places available for new entrants per year by 2026.</p>  <p>  These measures make general practice in Ireland a more attractive career choice and will see an increase in the number of GPs working in the State, improving access to GP services for patients throughout the country. </p></reply>

The NIAC makes recommendations on vaccination policy to the Department of Health based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practices in relation to immunisation.</p>  <p>  Following the recommendation for use of vaccines against COVID-19 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and authorisation for use by the European Commission, the NIAC develops guidance for their use in Ireland which is contained in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. These guidelines are continuously updated and include guidance on all new vaccines as they are approved for use in Ireland.</p>  <p>  You can view the guidelines here: www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/guidelines/covid19.pdf</p>  <p>  The NIAC has recently advised a second booster dose for people over 65 and people with a weak immune system aged 12 and over. The Committee will continue to examine emerging evidence regarding booster vaccines for others in the population where there is evidence of waning immunity and reduced effectiveness and will make further recommendations if required.</p></reply>

In 2020 and 2021, public information campaigns played a vital role in communicating the various strands of the pandemic. The campaigns informed people of all stages of restrictions as they were introduced and subsequently lifted. Public information campaigns were also used to communicate with people on the supports being made available by Government to get through the pandemic. Campaigns featured across national and local radio, national and regional newspapers, and social media platforms. The centralised approach adopted helped to ensure effectiveness of advertising spend, consistency, coherence and amplification of the public health messaging across the various public awareness campaigns, and a focus on hard to reach audiences. To date in 2022, COVID-19 information campaigns undertaken by the Department of the Taoiseach have focused on encouraging people to be more aware of the risk of COVID-19 to themselves and others, in particular vulnerable people.</p></reply>

These reviews are guided by relevant research and a public/stakeholder consultation. The views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group and relevant policy Departments are also taken into consideration. </p>  <p>  Account is taken of upskilling and training initiatives and other known contextual factors, such as the ending of the pandemic unemployment payment schemes and their impact on the labour market. Changes to the employment permit occupations lists are made where there are no suitable Irish/EEA nationals available, development opportunities are not undermined, a genuine skills shortage exists, rather than a recruitment or retention problem, and Government education, training and economic development policies are supported.</p>  <p>  Demand for Employment Permits increased by over 50% in April 2021 and has increased further into 2022.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  This increased demand is estimated to see up to 35,000 applications processed in 2022.</p></reply>

Energy costs are one of the prime factors in the increase in business costs to which the deputy refers, and we have already implemented several measures to help ease the impact on enterprises of energy price increases including reductions in VAT and excise on some fuels, as well as a temporary grant scheme to hauliers in the supply chain. Businesses from Cork benefit from these nationwide programmes. </p><p>Minister Donohoe recently announced the extension of the 9% Value Added Tax (VAT) rate for the tourism and hospitality industry for a further six months; a measure for which &euro;250 million is the estimated cost to the exchequer.</p><p>Furthermore, the Government has recently launched its &lsquo;Reduce Your Use&rsquo; public information campaign. This highlights the range of supports that are available to households and businesses ranging from practical advice to financial supports.</p><p>Businesses can view these on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/Energy-supports/Energy-supports-for-business.html</i></p><p>Practical advice includes the Climate Toolkit 4 Business, launched late last year by my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. This allows SMEs to input simple information to get an estimate of their carbon footprint and a personalised action plan to reduce it.</p><p>From the Local Enterprise Offices, the Green for Micro initiative offers mentoring to micro-enterprises looking to become greener. Meanwhile, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides direct grants such as the support scheme for renewable heat, project assistance grants, the EXEED grant scheme, tax incentives available through the Accelerated Capital Allowance, and funding for energy audits. Further training is available via the SEAI&rsquo;s Energy Academy.</p><p>Finally, there are loans available for businesses absorbing the numerous economic shocks of recent years. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland offers the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme, offering loans from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million, and the Credit Guarantee Scheme for businesses responding to the impact of COVID-19. These loan facilities may also be helpful to businesses struggling with increased energy costs.</p><p>Microenterprises can also avail of loans of up to &euro;25,000 from Microfinance Ireland which they may not be able to avail of from commercial lenders.</p><p>Additionally, the Lean for Micro scheme works with LEO clients to help build resilience.</p><p>Government Departments have been consulting with stakeholders on specific measures that could be considered to ameliorate the short to medium term challenges to energy security. The Energy Supply Emergency Group is an inter-departmental and inter-agency group with responsibility for informing the Government response to the impact of rising energy costs on business, in addition to security of energy supply more generally, and a longer-term reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s dependency on imported oil and gas.</p><p>Under the aegis of this Group, my Department has established the Business Energy Users Sub-Group to lead on consultations with business and industry to learn about the specific impacts on Irish businesses, and to hear their concerns and perspectives on the appropriate and most effective tools for policy action. The work of this sub-group, as part of the wider Energy Supply Emergency Group has informed the National Energy Security Framework which was launched by the Government on 13 April 2022.</p></reply>

Irish recyclers are competing for waste materials, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, in an open market.</p><p>There are recycling facilities for PET plastic in Ireland. While my Department does not have the power to direct waste to a particular facility or to keep it within Ireland for recycling, there are funding measures in place to encourage domestic recycling and discourage the export of waste for recycling.</p><p>Repak, the national packaging Extended Producer Responsibility scheme, has a funding system in place which promotes the proximity principle and ensures that maximum funding is available to operators who collect, separate and reprocess PET plastics in Ireland:</p> <blockquote> 	- For household collections, an additional reprocessing subsidy was introduced in 2020 and is only available to plastic reprocessors with operations in Ireland. In 2022 this subsidy increased from &euro;35/tonne to &euro;50/tonne.<br /><br />- For commercial collections, there is a stepped system in place with the highest subsidy payable where material is recycled in Ireland, mid-range funding where material is recycled in EU/UK, and a reduced subsidy for material sent outside Europe. </blockquote>  <p>The Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy sets out a roadmap for the introduction of a Deposit Return Scheme (DRS) for PET plastic bottles and aluminium cans. The Scheme will be launched later this year and will increase the quantity of those materials being collected for recycling. Open tendering processes will be used to source operators for the separate collection, sorting and recycling of this material and DRS will adopt green procurement principles to ensure those services are provided with minimal impact on the environment.</p></reply>

The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland and Europe is high international gas prices where we are a price taker. Gas prices are now unprecedentedly high, which feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.</p>  <p>  Such measures include the Electricity Costs Emergency Benefit Payment which credited domestic electricity accounts with &euro;176.22 (excl. VAT), in addition to the range of measures introduced on 10 February to address increasing costs of living, including the lump sum payment for people on the Fuel Allowance of &euro;125, which was paid to recipients in March.

The wider package of energy efficiency supports, available from SEAI, make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades. These include changes to the Warmer Homes scheme which sees a significant increase in the number of free energy upgrades for those most as risk of energy poverty - from 177 upgrades per month last year to 400 per month. </p>  <p>  On 13 April, in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Government published the National Energy Security Framework, which details of consumer supports and protections that are already in place and that are being enhanced including:</p>  <p>- an additional &euro;100 Fuel Allowance payment,</p>  <p>- a new targeted &euro;20 million scheme for the installation of Photo Voltaic (PV) panels for households that have a high reliance on electricity for medical reasons</p>  <p>- a reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of May until the end of October. </p>  <p>  In addition, under Response 6 of the Framework the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will implement a package of measures to enhance protections for financially vulnerable customers and customers in debt by quarter 3 - ahead of the next heating season. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on June 14th Government announced a package of measures to secure electricity and an indicative annual saving of &euro;75 on household bills through a further reduction in the PSO levy.</p>  <p>  Government continues to monitor this unprecedented and evolving situation closely to inform ongoing consideration of further action.</p></reply>

To date, the level of connections is increasing on a daily basis and is in line with projections with some areas exceeding expectations.</p><p>My Department has worked with NBI to agree an Updated Interim Remedial Plan (UIRP) which recalibrated the targets for 2022 to take account of the knock on effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other delays to the programme. The revised target is 102,000 premises passed by the end of January 2023 (cumulative). My Department continues to work closely with NBI to determine the targets for 2023 and this target will be agreed later this year.</p><p>NBI are implementing a number of measures to help lessen the impact that delays have had on the rollout.

On 4 July, Government approved the project in principle at Decision Gate 1 of the Public Spending Code. This decision was informed by a range of potential costs. These costs were developed in line with international best practice and combine reference class forecasting and expert assessment. The estimated construction costs at P50, with medium inflation, and P95, with high inflation, are set out in the table below; the 'P' value indicates the probability that the project will be delivered at or below a certain cost. <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>P50 <br /><br />(with medium inflation) </th>       <th>P95 <br /><br />(with high inflation) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Base Cost (Q4 2021 Prices) </td>       <td>&euro;5.80bn</td>       <td>&euro;5.80bn</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Risk Uplift </td>       <td>30% </td>       <td>182% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Risk Allowance </td>       <td>&euro;1.74bn</td>       <td>&euro;10.55bn</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Inflation Forecast </td>       <td>&euro;1.96bn</td>       <td>&euro;7.03bn</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Cost </td>       <td>&euro;9.50bn</td>       <td>&euro;23.39bn</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>As shown in the table, the base cost for MetroLink remains the same in both scenarios but the risk allowance and inflation forecast is much higher for the P95 figure. To be clear, the P95 figure of &euro;23.39 billion is not considered representative of the expected project cost. The independent review of the preliminary business case conducted by JASPERS notes that the risk uplift at P50 is already high compared to similar projects but prudent for a project at this early stage of development. The P50 risk allowance is 30% of the base cost whereas the risk allowance at the P95 level is 182% of the base cost.</p><p>I intend to publish the Preliminary Business Case and supporting documentation in the coming weeks, with commercially sensitive information appropriately redacted.</p></reply>

On 4 July, Government approved the project in principle at Decision Gate 1 of the Public Spending Code. This decision was informed by a range of potential costs. These costs were developed in line with international best practice and combine reference class forecasting and expert assessment. The estimated construction costs at P30, P50 and P80 are set out in the table below. The 'P' value indicates the probability that the project will be delivered at or below a certain cost, and the P30 to P80 range is considered to represent the credible cost range at this stage of development.   <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>P30 <br /><br />(with low inflation)</th>       <th>P50 <br /><br />(with medium inflation)</th>       <th>P80 <br /><br />(with high inflation)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Base Cost, &euro;m</td>       <td>5,800</td>       <td>5,800</td>       <td>5,800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Risk Allowance, &euro;m</td>       <td>410</td>       <td>1,740</td>       <td>3,030</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Inflation Allowance, &euro;m</td>       <td>960</td>       <td>1,960</td>       <td>3,420</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total, &euro;m*</td>       <td>7,160</td>       <td>9,500</td>       <td>12,250</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Rounding may affect totals</p><p>Approximately three-quarters of total construction expenditure is expected to be funded by the Exchequer, with the remainder funded through public-private partnership (PPP) which will be repaid after services begin operation. The proposed PPP element of MetroLink construction covers project integration and contract interface risk. The PPP partner will design and construct the track, supply the rolling stock, fit out the depot, and commission the control signalling, along with other supporting tasks. This approach allows the project to draw on the expertise and efficiency of private sector firms that have experience in creating metro systems.</p><p>The estimated annual current cost of MetroLink after services commence will be subject to detailed revenue and financial analysis ahead of Decision Gate 2 of the Public Spending Code. It is expected that the PPP partner will operate the MetroLink service for a number of years following opening and that the unitary charge paid to the PPP partner by the Exchequer will cover operational costs, in addition to repaying finance provided during the construction phase.</p></reply>

It is understood that the MoU seeks to address traditional ships that often operate on national safety certificates, and which cannot comply with international rules such as the SOLAS Convention or rules within the European Union or individual member states. It is understood that the MoU is mainly designed for traditional ships participating in maritime events in other countries and also contains recommendations for the performance of day trips in the waters of the member countries. The memorandum is not legally binding, and it does not provide a legal basis for the operation of such ships which are regulated by international, EU and national legislation. </p>  <p>  The safety of traditional ships is a matter of importance, and many traditional ships are sailing ships. In Ireland there have been several very serious marine casualties involving such ships and it is very fortunate that there has been no loss of lives in these casualties. Full details of these casualties and the issues raised with such ships may be found in the marine casualty reports on the &ldquo;STV Asgard II&rdquo; and &ldquo;STV Astrid&rdquo; published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board. </p>  <p>  Ireland is a party to the main international conventions regulating maritime safety most notably the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS Convention as well as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, MAPROL Convention, the International Convention on Load Lines and the International Convention on the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers. Any ship calling to an Irish port must comply with these conventions and under EU Directive 2009/16, as amended, on port state control Ireland is obliged to inspect foreign flagged ships calling to Irish ports and must enforce the requirements of these international conventions. The referenced memorandum of understanding does not alter or amend these legally binding obligations. </p>  <p>  Additionally, under Irish national legislation any ship carrying more than twelve passengers is a passenger ship and must comply with the Merchant Shipping Acts and hold a passenger ship safety certificate and any vessel carrying twelve or less passenger must hold a passenger boat licence. These are legally binding legislative requirements, and the referenced memorandum does not alter or amend these requirements. </p>  <p>  Given the above and the importance of maritime safety, the Department has no plans to become a party to the referenced Memorandum.</p></reply>

It is a multifaceted issue with a range of different contributing factors, including the Covid pandemic, Brexit and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which have clearly had a significant impact on the labour market for many sectors.</p><p>My Department established the National Logistics and Supply Chain Skills Group in 2019, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sectors in Ireland. The Group includes haulage and logistics sector industry representatives, education, and training providers and all of the relevant Government Departments and Agencies.</p><p>Last year I asked the Group to examine the HGV driver shortage and make recommendations, with specific regard to actions that could be taken by Government and the industry. The recommendations were finalised at the end of 2021 and have been published here on the Department&rsquo;s website. The recommendations are aimed at improving the supply issue, without undermining the working conditions and health and safety of drivers or other road users. The Logistics and Supply Chain Skills Group, which meets quarterly, is also responsible for monitoring the implementation of these recommendations.</p><p>The promotion of education, training, careers and sustainable employment in the sector is also crucial, along with skills development and career progression for existing workers. A number of new education and training programmes have been recently developed to address the skills gap in the sector. These include the new Transport Operations and Commercial Driving Apprenticeship, which is being offered by Atlantic Technological University Sligo and which is the country&rsquo;s first academic qualification linked to the profession of HGV driving.</p><p>The Logistics and Supply Chain Skills Group has recently published a comprehensive overview of all of the training and educational offerings currently available, which can be found on the group&rsquo;s webpage. </p><p>Furthermore, there is ongoing engagement between my Department and the Department of Social Protection (DSP), which has dedicated employer relations teams offering a range of supports and services to employers to fill vacancies including recruitment campaigns, specialised jobs fairs and through the online portal <i>JobsIreland.ie</i>.</p><p>Regarding recruitment of drivers from abroad, DSP organises events in the EU/EEA labour market for sectors where there are particularly acute labour shortages and recently ran such a transport-focused recruitment event.</p><p>HGV drivers from outside the EU/EEA must have a valid employment permit and a visa, if coming from a visa required state as defined by the Department of Justice. Following engagement with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the quota for employment permits for HGV drivers from outside the EU/EEA was removed in October 2021.</p><p>These drivers must also exchange their HGV drivers licence for an Irish licence. Ireland has licence exchange agreements with several countries and the Road Safety Authority, which oversees these agreements, is engaging with a number of other countries with a view to progressing further licence exchange agreements.</p><p>Labour and skills issues will be further considered in the 10-year strategy for the road haulage sector which, as outlined in the Programme for Government, will focus on generating efficiencies, improving standards, and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.</p><p>Work on the Haulage Strategy is ongoing with a plan for further consultation with stakeholders following publication of a draft strategy in the Autumn. This Strategy is expected to be finalised and published by year-end.</p></reply>

If end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) are not managed properly, they can be a threat to the environment as well as a lost resource of millions of tonnes of materials. Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles aims to minimise the impact of ELVs on the environment and to improve the environmental performance of all the economic operators involved in the life cycle of vehicles. The Directive contains provisions on the collection, treatment, recovery and recycling of ELVs. The production of vehicles has undergone important changes since the adoption of the Directive 20 years ago and it is currently under review by the European Commission with the aim of promoting changes in the design of products and promoting high quality recycling and facilitating the uptake of recycled materials in new products. </p>  <p>   The evaluation of the ELV Directive concluded that it largely delivered on its initial objectives and Ireland recently submitted our ELV data to Eurostat which confirmed Ireland achieved the ELV reuse and recycling rate of 90.33% and a reuse and recovery rate of 97.12% in 2020, in compliance with current EU targets. This is the third year that Ireland achieved full compliance with the ELV Directive targets which were fully met for the first time in 2018. Ireland will continue to improve the reuse, recycling and recovery of valuable material from ELVs as part of our transition to a circular economy.</p>  <p>  The statistical data requested by the Deputy is contained in my Department's National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF).

Half-yearly or quarterly renewals involve additional costs to process and administer. The rate for the half-yearly option is 55.5% of the annual rate, and, for the quarterly option, 28.25% of the annual rate. These ratios have remained generally consistent since the 1960s. The loss of income from equalising rates for these options would have a negative impact on motor tax revenue and would have to be borne elsewhere in the motor tax system or in the taxation system generally. The potential loss to the Exchequer has been estimated at just over &euro;37m, based on the volume of transactions in 2021. Given the sum involved, any proposed change is a matter for consideration in the context of Budget preparations.</p>  <p>  The current cost per transaction in issuing a motor tax disc has not been established. Any such costing exercise would have to factor in the indirect costs of running local motor tax offices, as well as the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division of my Department, which is responsible for the maintenance of the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF), the central vehicle database, as well as supporting systems in motor tax offices. The Department of Housing publishes the Amalgamated Audited Annual Financial Statement for all the local authorities on an annual basis. The most recently published Statement is for 2019 and gives the total cost of running the local authority motor tax service at &euro;29.4m for the year. The annual cost of running the NVDF is currently some &euro;22.9m, excluding staff costs. However, the NVDF also supports road traffic enforcement, vehicle testing and the road transport operator licensing system and the allocation of overheads across each of these functions, as well as the provision of the motor tax service, cannot be easily ascertained.</p></reply>

In addition, a number of smaller ports will be required for ORE Operation and Maintenance activities. A number of ports and private entities are already progressing plans to provide the facilities and infrastructure required to support the construction and maintenance of offshore wind farms and to assist the ORE sector to develop in Ireland.</p>  <p>  While Irish Ports receive no exchequer funding, as part of endeavours to maximise EU funding, following extensive engagement with other Member States and the Commission, the Department successfully obtained changes to the Ten-T CEF criteria to allow EU funding of port infrastructure for ORE in the 2021-2023 funding stream. On its own, CEF funding does not have any State aid implications and successful applicants can obtain significant grant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and up 30% of infrastructure works costs.  </p>  <p>  A call opened in 2021 for applications and closed last January for funding for transport infrastructure projects. Bearing in mind the confidential nature of the process, individual applications cannot be commented on. However, four ports/private entities that are eligible under TEN-T applied for funding for studies which will effectively allow them to prepare for lodgement of planning applications in 2022 and 2023 onwards for ORE port developments. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, none of these applications were successful in the first call. These are competitive processes, and typically oversubscribed and we are engaging with the Commission to understand the decisions. The companies involved continue progressing their plans and are also engaging with the Commission before preparing applications for the next call due to open in September this year. The Department will continue to assist, as appropriate, eligible applicants with the application process. </p>  <p>  The Department also continues to encourage engagement between the ports and developers so they are best placed to exploit the opportunities that will arise from the development of the ORE industry. From DoT engagements, it is known that ports and private entities are engaging in their own commercial discussions with ORE project developers to underpin the business case for the port infrastructure developments.  Progression of projects and timelines remains subject to results of ORESS auctions, substantive engagement from  ORE developers directly with ports, establishment and resourcing of MARA, MAC consents for ports and planning consents for the necessary port infrastructure.</p></reply>

The electric small public service vehicle (eSPSV) grant scheme was put in place to support the greening of the taxi sector. The Scheme is funded by the Department and administered by the NTA. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use, and &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric. </p>  <p>  The 2022 eSPSV Grant Scheme (eSPSV22) received 1,146 applications to end May 2022, including 935 applying for the higher-end grant for scrapping their older vehicle. 125 new eSPSVs have been licensed to date in 2022. </p>  <p>  eSPSV22 was paused for new applications in April to allow operators with grant offers the time to finalise their car purchase and draw down funding. The Department announced on 26  June 2022 that eSPSV22 will re-open for applications on 1 August, and the application form will be published on the NTA's website that same day. Applications will be accepted up to 30 November 2022 for this Scheme, with no extension being considered.  Vehicles must be licensed (passed the suitability inspection) by 31 December 2022 to get the funding. If this has not happened, operators must wait and apply to any future grant Schemes which might be launched by the Department. </p>  <p>  You may be aware that Microfinance Ireland is still providing the so-called eSPSV Business Loan, which is available to support SPSV owners that are unable to secure finance from banks and asset finance providers, and are availing of the eSPSV Grant Scheme to replace their vehicle with a more sustainable model (electric/hybrid).  These loans range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000, with a fixed interest rate of 4.5% if submitted through a Local Enterprise Office, and with no additional fees or charges.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility regarding vehicle age limits, I have referred your question to the NTA for direct reply to you.

Driver licensing laws are intended to ensure drivers on our roads meet high safety standards. Testing standards are set at EU level.</p>  <p>  All EU driving licences are exchangeable when moving between Member States. For non-EU jurisdictions, Ireland may make bilateral agreements on licence exchange. This is not a straightforward matter and reaching them is not a matter of political will. The core principle is to ensure the continued safety of Irish road users. Agreements can be made only when the authorities in each jurisdiction have studied and compared the licensing regimes, so that each side is satisfied that standards are compatible. For Ireland, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).</p>  <p>  Since 2014, the RSA has been working on driving licence exchange agreements with Canada. Agreements have been completed with Ontario, Manitoba, Newfoundland &amp;amp; Labrador, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and New Brunswick to date. </p>  <p>  The RSA has previously explored exchange agreements with the USA. However, US driver licensing operates at state, rather than federal, level, meaning that there are 50 licensing systems with widely varying standards. Agreement with any one state would mean taking into account the exchange relations between that state and the other 49. The RSA determined that agreement would not be feasible.  </p>  <p>  When people come to Ireland with a non-exchangeable licence, they may obtain an Irish licence through the standard statutory process. A person with a full but non-exchangeable licence can avail of shorter Essential Driver Training of 6 lessons, instead of the usual 12, and they do not have to wait 6 months before taking a driving test. Further details can be found on the National Driver Licence Service website at www.ndls.ie.</p>  <p>  The Road Traffic (Recognition of Foreign Driving Licences) (Ukraine) Order 2022, which came into effect on 22 April 2022, allows Ukrainians admitted to Ireland as residents under the Temporary Protection Directive to exchange their Ukrainian licences for Irish licences. Such licences are valid for 12 months and only apply to category B (cars and light vehicles). This is a short term measure, taken in response to the immediate and extraordinary humanitarian crisis arising from the conflict in Ukraine. </p></reply>

A draft national charging infrastructure strategy for the development of EV charging infrastructure, covering the crucial period out to 2025 was published for consultation in March. The draft strategy sets out the government&rsquo;s ambition regarding the delivery of a public EV charging network to support up to 194,000 electric cars and vans by the middle of the decade. Responses and submissions received as part of the consultation are currently being considered in the development of the final Strategy for publication. </p>  <p>  There is a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible such as on-street and residential charging, destination charging, and workplace charging. </p>  <p>  Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland is to be launched next Thursday. This Office will play an important role in our transition to zero emission vehicles. It will co-ordinate measures to support the uptake of EVs and the rollout of charge point infrastructure including the development of a number of new infrastructure schemes. A significant increase in funding for local authorities to deliver EV charging points will be rolled out in the latter half of this year.</p>  <p>  The existing Public Charge Point Scheme continues to be available during 2022 to provide local authorities with a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of the scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate owners of electric vehicles, who do not have access to a private parking space, but instead rely on parking their vehicles in public places near their homes to charge their EVs. Mayo County Council has not as yet applied for funding under this scheme in 2022. </p>  <p>  My Department has reviewed the Scheme and the draft Strategy sets out a number of additional actions to support delivery by local authorities, such as funding capital costs for civil and electrics works, as well as charge point installation, through a new Residential Charging Scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department is also developing a new scheme which will support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as visitor centres and parks. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.</p>  <p>  &euro;10 million was committed from the Climate Action Fund to support ESB investment in the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB, with the infrastructure to be in place by the end of 2022. This intervention alone will result in:</p>  <p>  - 90 additional high power chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles - Seventeen high-power chargers distributed across 14 multi-vehicle hubs have been delivered as part of the programme to date.</p>  <p>  - 52 additional fast chargers, which may replace existing standard chargers - This work is completed at 36 locations.</p>  <p>  - 264 replacement standard chargers with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points - This work is substantially complete.  258 of the chargers have now been successfully replaced.</p>  <p>  Further details on the progression of this project can be found at esb.ie/ecars/our-network/network-upgrades. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage directly with stakeholders to ensure that a sufficient number of chargers, as well as a sufficient spread of charger types, will be in place to meet demand as we move towards our 2030 target of almost1 million EVs on the road.</p></reply>

The properties are owned and controlled by their registered owners, or appointed receivers in the event of enforcement. The Receiver is an agent of the debtor, not NAMA.</p>  <p>  The referenced property is a private residential development consisting of a number of apartment blocks and houses. Each apartment owner owns their own individual unit and the various residential units are owner occupied or rented. NAMA owns certain loans which are secured by 15 individual residential units in the development. These units are under the control of a NAMA appointed receiver, John McStay of McStay Luby. </p>  <p>  NAMA understands from the appointed receiver, Mr. McStay, that it is not the case that the apartments cannot be insured until fire works are completed. The receiver has advised NAMA of his understanding of the current position regarding block insurance. The current insurer (QBE) is exiting this aspect of the Irish market, thereby necessitating a change of insurer. Subject to a fully completed proposal, which must include the claims history and a plan to remedy any known defects to the common areas, it is understood that cover can be made available. The insurance broker for the receiver has offered to assist the OMC (Owners Management Company) with the matter.</p>  <p>  NAMA has been advised by the receiver that he has been engaging extensively with the OMC, and its appointed legal and insurance advisors, in relation to the insurance and any queries raised. In addition, the receiver, in his capacity as agent of the developer and without any legal obligation or requirement to do so (as recently determined by the Court of Appeal in separate proceedings, entitled  Grehan &amp;amp; Ors v Maynooth Business Campus Owners&rsquo; Management CLG [High Court record number 2018/5042P]) has carried out very substantial remediation works to the development which were funded by NAMA.  It is therefore simply incorrect to suggest that NAMA or the appointed receiver has, in some way, dealt improperly or unfairly with the private owners or residents of this development. In fact, the contrary is true.</p>  <p>  In addition, I am advised that there is extant litigation between the receiver and the OMC in relation to the referenced development. Given the on-going litigation (which is hopefully reaching a final conclusion) you will appreciate that NAMA is not in a position to substantively engage in certain issues, which it is understood are the subject of disputed claims in the ongoing pending litigation.</p></reply>

The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of the Irish culture.</p>  <p>  Finance Act 2018 introduced a short-term, tapered regional uplift for productions being made in areas designated under the State aid regional guidelines. The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs, to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector.</p>  <p>  The uplift originally provided an increased level of credit for four years, with 5% available in years 1 and 2 (2019 and 2020), 3% available in year 3 (2021), 2% available in year 4 (2022). However in recognition of the detrimental impact the COVID-19 crisis had on the audio-visual sector, Finance Act 2020 amended the regional uplift to provide for an additional 5% year in 2021, in effect to replace the incentive year lost as a result of the COVID-related public health measures. The tapered withdrawal of the uplift then restarted this year with a reduction to 3%, it will reduce 2% in 2023, and Nil thereafter.</p>  <p>  There are currently no plans to increase or extend the regional uplift, or to introduce alternative regional specific changes to the film tax credit. However I would note that the main film tax credit will remain available to qualifying productions in all areas of the country following the winding-down of the uplift.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are a number of other supports already available to ensure the continued growth of the film industry across Ireland. I am informed by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (DTCAGSM) that Screen Ireland, the national development agency for the Irish film, television and animation industry, has recently announced an investment of over &euro;2 million towards the establishment of five new National Talent Academies in Wicklow, Limerick, Galway and Dublin for film and tv drama, animation and production crew. These new Talent Academies will build on the success of the Section 481 skills model to develop and drive opportunities for diverse and regional talent on a national level.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in 2021 Screen Ireland launched funding for crew development hubs. These Regional Development Talent Academies will focus on regional talent development and inclusion, ensuring opportunities and support for new and diverse talent. This will ensure an overall national approach to creative talent, crew and workforce development in line with the significant growth ambition for the industry and commitment to social cohesion.</p>  <p>  Also in 2021, Screen Ireland announced the Creative Futures fund as part of a commitment to grow strong and resilient companies throughout the country. The fund is designed to help support companies to strengthen and hone their expert creative capabilities and ambitions and build cultural resilience to enable high quality cultural projects. I am informed by DTCAGSM that 35% of successful companies were based regionally (outside of Dublin and Wicklow).</p></reply>

A preliminary analysis of this data was published  by Revenue on 6 July 2022, and is available at: </p><p>www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/information-about-revenue/statistics/local-property-tax/lpt-stats-2022/index.aspx.  It should be noted that LPT applies only to habitable residential properties, and derelict or uninhabitable properties are not captured under the LPT system.</p><p>The preliminary analysis indicates that levels of vacancy among LPT liable properties are low across all counties and lie within a range that is considered to be in line with a normal functioning housing market.  The analysis also indicates that many of the reasons are given for vacancy are genuine and acceptable and that the vacancy is temporary, for example, where a property is for sale, between lettings, undergoing refurbishment, where the property is subject to a probate application or other legal proceedings, holiday homes, or in cases where the owner is in long-term care. </p><p>The Revenue analysis provides a basis for my Department to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax, and how best such a tax might be designed. This work has already commenced and I intend to bring forward proposals on a targeted measure that achieves an appropriate balance between incentivising owners of vacant habitable residential properties to bring their properties back into use, and ensuring any such tax does not arbitrarily or excessively penalise home-owners in a discriminatory way.</p></reply>

Only one credit can be claimed by a couple, regardless of the number of people being cared for. </p>  <p>  To obtain the full tax credit (&euro;1,600 for the 2022 year of assessment), the home carer&rsquo;s income for the year must not exceed &euro;7,200 (excluding Carer's Allowance payments made by the Department of Social Protection). In cases where the home carer&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;7,200, the tax credit available is reduced by one half of the excess amount earned over this limit. The home carer tax credit will, therefore, not be available for the 2022 year of assessment where the home carer&rsquo;s income exceeds an upper threshold of &euro;10,400.  </p>  <p>  It is not possible to claim both the increased Standard Rate Cut-Off Point for dual income couples and the home carer tax credit. Couples may choose whichever option is more beneficial to them, based on their personal circumstances.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's specific question regarding the estimated cost of increasing the income threshold for the home carer's tax credit, as there is no data available on additional potential claimants that might qualify under an increased threshold and given that it may be more beneficial in many instances for couples to avail of the additional standard rate band granted to a second earner rather than claim this credit, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the potential cost of changing the threshold values for this credit. </p>  <p>  I am however informed by Revenue that the estimated cost of increasing the amount of the home carer tax credit itself can be found in Revenue's Ready Reckoner, available at the following link: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/ready-reckoner.pdf (See page 5) </p>  <p>  For ease of reference of the Deputy, a &euro;50 increase in the value of the home carer's tax credit (to increase the credit from &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,650) would cost &euro;3m in the first year and &euro;4m in a full year. Amounts other than that shown in the Ready Reckoner may be extrapolated using a straight line or pro-rata calculation.  </p></reply>

However also, within the EU Directive there is provision for derogations from the general rules which allows an individual Member State to continue certain historic tax treatments.  By way of special derogation from the general rule, Ireland maintains several standstill provisions and derogations, including the availability of either an exemption or application of the reduced rate of VAT of 9% to the promotion of and admissions to live musical performances (excluding dances) &ndash; the exact VAT treatment depends on whether food or drink is available for consumption. </p><p>Under Irish VAT law the supply of services by writers, composers and performing artists are subject to the standard rate of VAT, currently 23%.  The providers of such services are required to register for and charge VAT where their supplies exceed &euro;37,000 per annum, and &ndash; in line with normal VAT rules &ndash; if the recipients of the services are registered for VAT and use the supplies in the course of their taxable business activities, then the VAT charged on the supply is deductible by the recipient.</p><p>  Under the VAT Directive, there is no provision to permit the introduction of an exemption to the supply of services by writers, composers or performers.  Section 9 of Annex III  provides that Member States may apply a reduced rate to such services; however, any consideration of this possibility would need to assess the benefit of making such a change &ndash; given that the VAT charged on services supplied to a VAT-registered business is already deductible by the recipient of the supply, under the normal VAT rules.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on policy decisions in advance of Budget Day.  </p></reply>

On this basis, an indicative range as a share of GDP was provided.

However, it is not possible for the Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank in carrying out its regulatory functions to advise or comment on the management of loans (and/or the treatment of any security which may be associated with a loan) by regulated entities as such issues are a business matter for the individual regulated entity.  </p>  <p>  However, at a general level, the Central Bank advises that loan arrears cases have individual circumstances, many of which are complex, that require real sustainable solutions and there is not a 'one size fits all' solution the issue of distressed debt.  Nevertheless, holding a high stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) can affect the credit supply channel, by restricting the amount of capital that could be otherwise lent or used for more economically and socially useful activities, and can cause serious dysfunction for the banking system and hence its ability to serve the economy and its customers. </p>  <p>  Therefore, the Central Bank expects credit institutions with a high proportion of NPLs to set, at a minimum, clearly defined realistic yet ambitious quantitative targets to reduce the level of NPLs. Where assets which acted as security for a loan are realised (such as properties in possession) are material, a strategy in respect of such assets should be defined or, at least, reduction targets should be included in the NPL strategy in respect of such assets. </p>  <p>  Where this is a part of a credit institution&rsquo;s NPL strategy, it should also monitor the volume, ageing, coverage and flows of such assets at a sufficient level of granularity to take into account material types of assets. The performance of such assets vis-a-vis the predefined business plan should be monitored. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank acknowledges that resolution of NPLs might involve an increase in the number of properties in possession of regulated entities for the short term, pending the sale of those assets. However, this timeframe should be clearly limited as the aim is a timely sale of the assets concerned.</p>  <p>  In relation to the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), it advises that its loans are primarily segregated and managed by borrower/debtor connection as this was the most efficient way to manage the cross-secured loan portfolios originally acquired by NAMA and that the property assets securing NAMA's loans remain in the ownership and control of their registered owners (NAMA debtors) or appointed receivers, in the event of enforcement. Furthermore, NAMA has indicated that less than 1% of its remaining loan portfolio is secured by assets located in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of neglected buildings, the responsibility for dealing with derelict sites is a matter for the relevant local authority and there is a statutory duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps to ensure that any land situated in their respective functional area does not become or continue to be a derelict site.  </p></reply>

The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child. </p>  <p>  Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies, the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment as between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.   </p>  <p>  Persons aged 65 or over may also avail of the age tax credit, which currently amounts to &euro;245 per year for single persons or &euro;490 per year for married couples or civil partners. Reduced rates of USC also apply for persons aged 70 or older where their total income is &euro;60,000 or less. </p>  <p>  As such, the current tax arrangements for persons aged 65 or older compare favourably with the tax treatment of the generality of taxpayers. </p>  <p>  Additional guidance on the range of tax credits and reliefs that may be available for individuals over 65 years of age can be found in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-26, which can be located at the following link &ndash; Tax and Duty Manual: </p>  <p>  www.revenue.ie/en/tax-professionals/tdm/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax/part-15/15-01-26.pdf </p>  <p>  With regard to cost of living increases, and as evidenced by recent actions and decisions, the Government is acutely aware of the cost pressures currently facing businesses and households, including people aged 65 years or over, and has responded to help alleviate some of this burden.  On a cumulative basis, the Government has announced &euro;2.4 billion in cost of living measures since last October.  These measures include changes in tax and social welfare, the provision of an energy credit for households and a temporary reduction in the rate of VAT on the supply of certain energy products. </p></reply>

Prior to that date, the relief was available at the taxpayer's marginal rate. The rationale for standardising health expenses relief was to widen the tax base and bring the rate at which relief was granted into line with the majority of tax expenditures.  In addition, the standard rating of the measure has made the tax system fairer in that all beneficiaries may receive tax relief at the same rate,  currently 20%.  </p><p>In my view, the availability of tax relief at the standard rate of income tax for health expenses, including qualifying dental expenses, is the most appropriate use of limited fiscal resources. As such, I have no plans to change the position at this time. </p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion to reinstate a tax credit for refuse collection, this measure was abolished in with effect from 2011, in line with a recommendation of the 2009 Commission on Taxation. Recommendation 11.22 of that Commission's report stated that: &ldquo;<i>The polluter pays principle should continue to underpin waste charges to ensure that all consumers pay for their own waste</i>.&rdquo; The Commission considered that there was no sound rationale for tax relief on service charges and therefore recommended that the relief be discontinued.  </p><p>There are no current plans to reinstate this credit. </p></reply>

LPT has yielded over &euro;4 billion for Local Authorities since its introduction.   </p>  <p>  All property owners benefit from the essential local services LPT helps to fund. The proper functioning of these services is important for every community and household.  Accordingly, it is equitable that the cost of providing the services should be shared by as broad a spectrum of owners as possible.  If the tax were abolished, the funding gap would ultimately need to be met by the Exchequer in the form of increased general taxation.  For these reasons, I do not plan to abolish the Local Property Tax. </p>  <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 fulfils the Programme for Government commitment to bring forward legislation in relation to LPT on the basis of fairness and that most homeowners would face no increase in their LPT liability. The Act provides for a cut in the main rate of the tax and widening of the valuation bands to make the changes affordable.  As these changes were implemented for the 2022 LPT year, this meant that the majority of homeowners saw either a decrease or no change in their LPT liability. Where increases arose, the majority were by a single band. </p>  <p>  The LPT legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax. A qualifying person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax. Where a person qualifies for a full deferral then 100 per cent of the liability can be deferred. Where a person qualifies for partial deferral, then 50 per cent of the liability can be deferred. The balance of 50 per cent of the tax must be paid. The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed. Interest is charged on the deferred amount.  The interest charge is 4% per annum for LPT deferred for years 2013 to 2021; and the rate was reduced to 3% per annum for LPT deferred for the year 2022 and subsequent years.  The income thresholds were increased in 2022 and are now &euro;18,000 for a single person and &euro;30,000 for a couple to qualify for a full deferral. The income limits to qualify for a partial deferral are &euro;30,000 for a single person and &euro;42,000 for a couple.  It is also possible to apply for a deferral on the grounds of hardship if a person suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant loss or expense as a result of which a person cannot pay their LPT liability without suffering financial hardship.  Further information regarding the deferral of LPT is available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/documents/lpt/guidelines-for-deferral-of-lpt.pdf.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it has engaged extensively with residential property owners who are experiencing financial difficulties, to agree flexible LPT payment arrangements that best suit their circumstances and avoid unnecessary hardship, and Revenue has assured me that this will continue to be the case.  </p>  <p>  Any property owners experiencing financial difficulties can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options both in respect of 2022 liabilities and for any previous years where liabilities remain outstanding. The full range of payment options, which includes phased arrangements, are available to property owners on the Revenue website at:  www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/index.aspx.</p>  <p>  The LPT payment compliance rate for 2022 currently stands at 95%.  Payment of the LPT for 2023 is not due until January 2023, at the earliest.  </p>  <p>  Finally, property owners experiencing difficulties in meeting their LPT obligations can contact Revenue through MyAccount at www.revenue.ie or by calling the LPT helpline (01) 7383626.</p></reply>

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. ETD provisions on mineral oils are transposed into national law in Finance Act 1999 (as amended) and this Act provides for the application of excise duty, in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT), to specified mineral oils that are used as motor or heating fuels. MOT is comprised of a non-carbon component and a carbon component. The carbon component is commonly referred to as carbon tax and the non-carbon component is often referred to as &ldquo;excise&rdquo;, &ldquo;fuel excise&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuel duty&rdquo;. It is important to note that both components of MOT are excise. Total MOT rates are what are considered in terms of compliance with ETD minimum rates.</p><p>In accordance with the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act, 2010, VAT is chargeable on petrol and auto-diesel at the standard rate, currently 23%, on the total amount which the supplier is entitled to receive including taxes, duties, levies and charges but excluding the VAT itself. A levy is also charged on petrol and diesel to cover the costs related to maintaining security of oil supplies. While both MOT and VAT are administered by Revenue the levy is administered by, and paid directly to, the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA).</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in March this year, in response to the current fuel crisis, I introduced significant reductions in the MOT rates for petrol and auto-diesel. These reductions, along with further reductions that came into effect on 1 April, are legislated to run until 11 October this year. Currently the rate of MOT applying to auto-diesel is &euro;405.38 per 1,000 litres and the MOT rate on petrol is &euro;465.98.</p><p>The following table provides a breakdown of the current taxes and the NORA levy applying to petrol and auto-diesel, based on the average retail prices as per the EC Weekly Oil Bulletin of 4 July 2022.  <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Petrol </th>       <th>% of retail price </th>       <th>Diesel </th>       <th>% of retail price </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>&euro;/litre </td>       <td>&euro;/litre </td>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Pre-Tax &amp;amp; NORA Levy </td>       <td>1.27 </td>       <td>59% </td>       <td>1.32 </td>       <td>61% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>NORA Levy </td>       <td>0.02 </td>       <td>1% </td>       <td>0.02 </td>       <td>1% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MOT non-carbon </td>       <td>0.37 </td>       <td>17% </td>       <td>0.30 </td>       <td>14% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>MOT carbon </td>       <td>0.09 </td>       <td>4% </td>       <td>0.11 </td>       <td>5% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>VAT (23%) </td>       <td>0.40 </td>       <td>19% </td>       <td>0.40 </td>       <td>19% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Tax &amp;amp; NORA Levy </td>       <td>0.89 </td>       <td>41% </td>       <td>0.82 </td>       <td>39% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Retail Price </td>       <td>2.16 </td>       <td></td>       <td>2.14 </td>       <td></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.</p>  <p>  An increase in the supply of new housing remains a priority aim of Government policy. HTB is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to support the construction of an additional supply of such properties. For a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a dwelling, having not been previously been used as a dwelling.</p>  <p>  In respect of the maximum purchase value for a qualifying property to be eligible for HTB, data from the Central Statistics Office, relating to April 2022, indicate that the average sale price in the case of first time buyer owner occupiers nationally is &euro;372,900.  For Dublin, the equivalent figure is &euro;472,100. Also, when we look at the breakdown of HTB claims by house price set out in Revenue's annual statistical report on the scheme for 2021, it sets out that some 76% of successful HTB claims in 2021 were for properties below &euro;375,000 in value. While not necessarily conclusive in terms of providing a guide as to the maximum purchase price that should apply under the scheme, these figures offer a perspective on the current maximum of &euro;500,000.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that work by external consultants, Mazars, on the review of HTB is nearing completion. The outcome of this review will help to inform decisions on the future of the scheme beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2022. However, this is a matter that will fall to be considered by Government in the context of the Budget 2023 process and it would not be appropriate for me to offer further comment at this time.</p></reply>

Pillar 2 introduces a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent. </p><p>My Department and the Revenue Commissioners previously estimated that the cost of this agreement could be up to &euro;2 billion annually when both pillars come into effect. However, this is an extremely challenging exercise, both in terms of timing and magnitude. Although there are two pillars to this agreement, it is important to understand that they are intended as integral parts of a single agreed solution. How they interact and the degree to which that interaction influences business behaviour is very difficult to predict.</p><p>It should also be stressed that what we have at the moment is a broad high level agreement on the main features of a solution. The agreement is planned to come into effect from 2024, but this requires a huge amount of technical work on how it will be implemented. These discussions have been ongoing since the agreement was concluded and will continue throughout this year. As technical discussions continue, officials from my Department and from Revenue will keep the position under review.</p><p>As I have highlighted on many occasions, the level of concentration in the corporate tax base represents a very real risk to the public finances. Our medium-term strategy over the next two budgets will be to invest in our public services, phase out temporary COVID-related spending and repair the public finances. In doing so, we will restore a fiscal buffer to be able to withstand the next crisis.</p></reply>

It will ultimately bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework, based on a shared understanding of where value is created in digital business models.</p>  <p>  This is a global issue, which requires global action to solve in a coordinated way, in order to avoid the proliferation of unilateral tax measures and trade tensions. The EU Directive is the best method for implementation of the Pillar Two minimum effective tax rate within the EU, as it will allow for a consistent transposition, consistent with European law, by all Member States.  </p>  <p>  While the EU Directive has not yet been agreed, significant progress towards agreement was made during the French presidency of the Council of the European Union, and it is my expectation that unanimous agreement will be reached on the Directive this year.</p>  <p>  The decision to join the global agreement was not taken lightly but I firmly believe this agreement brings a unique opportunity to reframe the international taxation architecture which has largely remained in place for almost a century.</p>  <p>  Ireland looks forward to final agreement of the Directive soon and we remain actively engaged at the OECD where we are helping shape the detail of how the Pillar Two rules will work in practice, as we believe it is the best avenue to provide certainty for businesses.</p></reply>

The European Commission published its proposal for the EU Minimum Tax Rate Directive on 22 December 2021. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been fully engaged on the technical work regarding the proposed Directive throughout the first half of 2022. Though agreement has not yet been reached by all Member States, Ireland looks forward to this happening later this year. Ireland fully supports the proposal as it is balanced and provides the certainty and stability which businesses need by avoiding divergent, unilateral measures in different countries.</p>  <p>  It is essential, both for businesses and Revenue authorities, that the administrative processes for implementation of the agreed global minimum tax are clear and operable in practice, and further Pillar Two technical work is continuing at the OECD on matters such as information filing obligations. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the revised implementation timelines also now allow for a more considered implementation, in consultation with stakeholders.  The European Commission initially proposed that the Pillar Two rules would be effective from 1 January 2023, however, the current draft Directive now provides that the rules will be applied within the European Union for periods of account beginning on or after 31 December 2023. With filing not due until 18 months after the initial period of account, for most companies this would mean that the first Pillar Two returns would not be due until mid-2026.</p>  <p>  Ireland is mindful of the need to maintain an environment of certainty for businesses. We intend to follow through on our commitment made in October 2021 to the OECD agreement as the best means of achieving that certainty. </p></reply>

This paper details the specific allocation of carbon tax funds in line with the Programme for Government commitments and provides some detail on the programme areas that will receive additional funding.</p><p>In 2022, the carbon tax revenue available for investment is &euro;412m. This is comprised of the revenue made available in 2021 (&euro;148m) and 2020 (&euro;90m) and an additional &euro;174m in 2022. </p><p>&euro;202 million of this additional carbon tax revenue has been allocated to residential and community energy efficiency in 2022. This funding has permitted the launch of a range of new and expanded supports for energy efficiency, including 80% grants for attic and cavity wall insulation and grant support of up to 50% for deep efficiency measures. More than half of these funds are also being used to provide free of charge energy efficiency upgrades to households in, or at risk of, energy poverty. </p><p>A further &euro;174m of carbon tax revenues in 2022 are being spent on targeted social protection measures, such as increases in the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance, and the qualified child payment. Analysis has demonstrated that this allocation to compensatory welfare measures means that the net impact of the carbon tax is progressive in 2022. Households in the bottom four income deciles will see all of the cost of the carbon tax increase offset. Households in the bottom three deciles are better off as a result of the carbon increase and the compensatory welfare measures. </p><p>The remaining revenues (&euro;36m) were allocated to fund the continuation of the 2020 and 2021 Carbon Tax Investment Programme. The specific programme allocations are detailed on the Department's website and include support for the Just Transition Fund, peatlands rehabilitation, the Greenway and Urban Cycling programmes, grants for Electric Vehicle purchase and infrastructure, green agricultural pilot schemes and  a contribution to the Green Climate Fund, which provides financial support to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries and to help vulnerable societies adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. </p><p>A table with the breakdown of the allocation of carbon tax revenues to date is presented below:</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Programme/Scheme</b></th>       <th><b>Department</b></th>       <th><b>&euro; m-<br /><br />2020</b></th>       <th><b>&euro; m-<br /><br />2021</b></th>       <th><b>&euro; m-<br /><br />2022</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>1.

A further reduction was imposed in 2011 primarily to control spending under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. These reductions were underpinned by Government decisions and formed part of a broader Government need to reduce costs across the public service.  </p>  <p>  Turning firstly to address the issue of restoration to other public sector employees, Section 43 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 had the effect, from 1 January 2020, of restoring the fee rates reduced by regulations made under Section 9(1) or Section10 of the FEMPI Act of 2009 to the rates prior to reduction other than where new regulations have been made by the relevant Minister under Section 42.  However, counsel fee reductions were not made under FEMPI legislation but rather:</p>  <p>  - formed part of a broader Government agenda to reduce escalating legal costs</p>  <p>  - were introduced by way of Government decisions</p>  <p>  State Solicitors pay has an established link with the Assistant Principal or AP grade within the Civil Service. Therefore, the remuneration of State Solicitors comprises a personal element for the individual State Solicitor equivalent to first point of the AP salary, a staffing element related to Clerical Officer grade and an expenses element that increases in relation to certain Consumer Price Index movements. The personal and staffing elements attract changes as per National Wage Agreements.</p>  <p>  Since 2016, my Department has engaged constructively with the Bar of Ireland, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Justice in relation to these matters.  I fully acknowledge and appreciate the very important work undertaken by barristers who prosecute criminal work on behalf of the State and my Department has engaged constructively with key stakeholders including the Bar Council of Ireland, the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Justice in relation to this matter.  In particular it has sought evidence to support any claims that the reductions imposed are linked to significant recruitment and retention issues, thereby potentially adversely impacting the administration of justice.  While my Department has not yet been provided with evidential data to support such claims, it remains available to review any further information that may be provided.  </p>  <p>  My Department continues to give careful consideration to this matter which will be informed by the advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office.</p></reply>

As part of the total &euro;6.7 billion budget package for 2023 an amount of &euro;3 billion is indicated as for &lsquo;budgetary decisions&rsquo;.  This category comprises provision for Existing Levels of Service (ELS) costs and the planned core capital expenditure increases under the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  Under the approach set out in last year&rsquo;s Summer Economic Statement, 3% of the core current expenditure base is being set aside each year to meet ELS costs. These include costs arising from demographic pressures in areas such as Social Protection, Health and Education; carryover costs from measures already introduced in prior year Budgets; and public service pay commitments. </p>  <p>  The division in the core current expenditure amount available for allocation each Budget between ELS costs and new measures provides an indication of the expected costs in meeting ELS. The 3% provision set out is based on assessment of previous budgets and the prevailing position in advance of Budget 2022. </p>  <p>  Agreement on the level of expenditure required to maintain ELS is a key part of the Estimates process. This involves detailed analysis requiring validation at programme level. A number of factors are taken into consideration including actual demand in the current year compared to that underpinning the budgetary allocation, the potential impacts of existing initiatives on demand and utilisation patterns, impact of demographics on demand, specific price pressures, as well as any capacity constraints that may exist. </p>  <p>  Inflationary pressures are generally dealt with on a year-by-year basis as part of the normal budgetary process, with an expectation and responsibility across all Departments and agencies to generate efficiency dividends and promote productivity where possible. </p>  <p>  The &lsquo;to be allocated&rsquo; line in Table 1 indicates the amount available for new tax and expenditure measures. Any new policy decision taken as part of Budget 2023 will need to be funded from this amount. This includes any core expenditure measures that may be introduced to assist citizens with costs of living pressures. </p>  <p>  Where analysis undertaken as part of the estimates process results in ELS costs being lower than expected, this would increase the amount available to fund new measures. The converse would apply if analysis during the estimates process showed higher ELS provision were required in any given year. As set out in Expenditure Report 2022, following this detailed analysis during the estimates process last year the amount provided in respect of ELS costs in Budget 2022 was &euro;1.6 billion. The amount included as ELS costs for 2023 in the SES is &euro;2.2 billion.</p></reply>

The ceilings detailed in the National Development Plan 2021-30 (NDP) are cognisant of the overall capability of the construction sector to deliver on the NDP and of the appropriate share of National Income being devoted to infrastructure. The levels of capital spending, at close to 5% of GNI*, are already among the highest in the EU and are close to the limit of the overall capability to deliver in the coming decade.</p>  <p>  The use of the Framework is voluntary, but participation by the parties is strongly encouraged. It represents a pragmatic and proportionate response to the current challenges caused by inflation that are not within either party&rsquo;s control.</p>  <p>  The Framework facilitates both parties to engage with one another for the purpose of addressing the impacts of this most recent onset of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption and operates on an ex-gratia basis. It sets down the approaches and the parameters within which parties to a public works contract calculate additional costs attributable to material and energy price fluctuations, on an ongoing basis, using the specified price indices published monthly by the Central Statistics Office.</p>  <p>  The measures available under the Framework strike an important balance between the additional costs incurred by the State to support Contractors engaged on public projects and the State&rsquo;s ability to deliver the NDP including housing delivery, whilst providing value for money for the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  The Framework applies to payments made from 1 January 2022 in recognition that inflationary pressures were further building from this point in anticipation of the invasion of Ukraine.  The extent of additional payments that will arise on projects going forward will depend on the materials that are to be incorporated, the stage of the project&rsquo;s development and further movement in prices which is extremely difficult to forecast at this moment.</p>  <p>  At this point, parties have begun their initial engagement and any agreement (and costs associated with inflation) will take a period of time to be worked through.  Once the initial engagement is complete and the retrospective payments are made, the specified formulae will be applied to each interim payment in the manner set out in the template agreement to determine the cost adjustment (if any) that is due for inflation.</p>  <p>  The cost associated with the implementation of the Framework will not be collated centrally.  It is managed at a project level by contracting authorities and reported to approving authorities so the impact on their overall capital ceiling can be assessed and the programme adjusted accordingly.</p>  <p>  The 2022 capital allocation is &euro;11,403 million. This is an increase of &euro;0.9 billion or 8% on the 2021 allocation and an increase of almost &euro;2.3 billion or 25% on the actual spend (exclusive of carryover) in 2021. In aggregate, including capital carryover, there is &euro;12.2 billion available for capital spending this year. In the NDP, it was clarified that there will need to be an agile approach to funding allocations and in-plan reprioritisation of funding, particularly where underspends and policy changes are apparent.</p>  <p>  In relation to the use of capital carryover to fund any additional costs associated with the Inflation Cooperation Framework, Section 91 of the Finance Act, 2004 makes statutory provision for capital carryover by way of deferred surrender.  Carryover amounts are published in the Appropriation Act at Vote level and at subhead level in the Deferred Surrender Ministerial Order, which must be made before 31 March in the second financial year.  When the resolution approving the Order is passed by the D&aacute;il, the carryover amounts become the first charge against the subheads designated in the Order and are typically spent early in the year.   </p>  <p>  Virement of deferred surrender amounts, as designated by subhead in the Ministerial Order, is not permissible under any circumstances. Therefore, any deferred surrender amounts that are not spent under the designated subhead by the end of the second year must be surrendered to the Central Fund.</p></reply>

This included an increase to the 2022 and 2023 core expenditure growth rates to 6 per cent and 6&frac12; per cent respectively. These adjustments were made to respond to the challenging economic context, in particular regarding inflationary pressures. </p>  <p>  To protect public services, core spending will increase by 6.5 per cent next year. This will result in a core expenditure ceiling of &euro;85.8 billion in 2023. This ceiling will provide for an expenditure budgetary package of &euro;5.65 billion over 2022 and 2023. This significant annual increase in expenditure balances the need to protect core public services and help to mitigate the cost of living pressures while ensuring that budgetary policy does not become part of the inflation problem.</p>  <p>  As set out in the SES, &euro;3 billion of this overall expenditure increase is required to fund the increase in capital expenditure set out in the National Development Plan, and to provide for costs relating to existing levels of service (ELS). These estimated ELS costs of c. &euro;2.2 billion include funding for pressures in respect of demographics, carryover from Budget 2022 decisions and existing public service pay commitments. The National Development Plan has provided a further &euro;0.8 billion of capital expenditure for 2023. </p>  <p>  This leaves approximately &euro;2.7 billion for new measures in Budget 2023, with &euro;0.4 billion of this amount phased into 2022 to allow for early implementation of measures.  Costs in relation to a new public service pay deal would be met from within this overall amount available for new measures. </p></reply>

This includes almost forty thousand refugees arriving in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Given the evolving nature of the situation, it is difficult to provide exact costings as the number of arrivals fluctuate on a daily basis. The demographic profile of arrivals, a key determinant of costings, is also subject to considerable change.  A number of other assumptions are also required. The cost per refugee is highly sensitive to the accommodation solution provided&mdash;accommodation solutions are currently being developed and may change over the medium term&mdash;this complicates providing an annual cost per refugee.</p>  <p>  However, given the expected significant level of supports required for arrivals to Ireland fleeing Ukraine, a contingency provision of &euro;3 billion for 2023 was set out in the Stability Programme Update to meet these costs. This exceptional provision is included as temporary non-core spending in the Summer Economic Statement. This estimate, alongside other non-core expenditure requirements, including requirements in respect of Covid-19, will be reconsidered as part of Budget 2023 as more information becomes available.  </p></reply>

Some &euro;3 billion of this was allocated at Departmental level, while &euro;4 billion contingency funding was held in reserve centrally to allow Government flexibility to respond to emerging needs during 2022. Following some additional allocations as part of the Revised Estimates in December 2021, &euro;3.9 billion of this funding remained unallocated. </p><p>Due to the impact of rising costs of living, Government announced a package of measures in February to provide support for households. This included the Electricity Credit to domestic account holders, which had an estimated cost of &euro;400 million. This measure required a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications. This was brought before the D&aacute;il in March to provide an additional of &euro;271 million with the remaining cost funded through reallocation of existing resources within the Vote. </p><p>As of 30 June 2022, the allocation to Vote 29 is the only one that has been voted by the D&aacute;il since the Revised Estimates. Resulting from this, the remaining contingency balance not yet allocated stood at just under &euro;3.7 billion.</p><p>While this is the only additional draw down from the contingency funding allocated in Departmental Estimates this year to end June, there are significant pressures and commitments on the remaining funding including:</p><p>1. An additional Supplementary Estimate of &euro;110 million was presented to the D&aacute;il at the beginning of July for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to make funds available to address security of energy supply for winter 2023/24 as set out in the <i>EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Bill 2022.</i></p><p><i>2.</i>Further Covid support measures, including the response to the Omicron wave will require additional funding over that foreseen at the time of Budget 2022. This includes income and employment support schemes in the Department of Social Protection, Department of Health Covid-19 response, the targeted Commercial Rates Waiver for Q1 2022 and Department of Education Covid response measures. These Covid-19 expenditure pressures are evident in the end June expenditure reported in the Fiscal Monitor with gross current expenditure in the Department of Social Protection &euro;292 million ahead of profile and &euro;284 million ahead of profile in the Department of Health.</p><p>3. In addition, there will be further Covid-19 related spending requirements during 2022, in particular depending on developments in the trajectory of the virus over the winter period.</p><p>4. Additional allocations may be required to fund the other cost of living measures announced during the course of 2022.</p><p>5. Costs related to the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine will also need to be provided and will be significant. To date approximately &euro;186 million has been spent across a number of Departments. </p><p>Further allocations from the contingency will be considered later in the year taking account of any offsetting underspends.</p></reply>

This is a significant scheme within the Office of Public Works (OPW) &euro;1.3 billion flood relief investment programme nationally, as part of the NDP, from which the relevant funding for the Enniscorthy scheme will be made available.  On completion, the scheme will protect 236 properties in the town.</p>  <p>  The scheme was submitted through the confirmation process under the Arterial Drainage Acts to the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform for assessment in mid-2020.  In March 2022 the OPW received a decision from the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) to refuse the Scheme under Section 7E(1)(b) of the Arterial Drainage Acts (as amended by the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019) due to a number of inadequacies with the Environmental Impact Assessment Report.</p>  <p>  Following this decision the Project team is now examining how to address the questions raised in the DPER decision and consequently identify what the preferred approach will be. The project team, including consultants Mott MacDonald (MMD), have been meeting regularly to progress and address these issues.</p>  <p>  This involves looking at the various approval mechanisms available. MMD have been tasked with identifying the optimum solution to progressing a scheme through the approval process. Before a decision can be made in this regard, we are obliged to undertake significant additional analysis (incl. further assessment of alternatives). The road map to this goal is currently in development.</p>  <p>  The preferred approach will be established as the required additional analysis, survey work and evaluation of options is completed. Whatever the planning route, it has been identified that additional survey work and further detailed options assessments (i.e. assessment of alternatives) will need to be carried out. The scheme consultants are working on the options assessment and have identified all the time sensitive survey worked required which are currently under way.</p></reply>

This represents a significant expansion of the scope of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. </p>  <p>  Commencement of the new legislation following enactment is a priority, not least because the deadline for transposition of the Directive has passed.

This total sum of &euro;288.5 million represents an increase of &euro;67.5 million over the 2021 allocation. The allocation includes &euro;50 million for business continuity supports and a &euro;35 million increase to the Tourism Marketing Fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. Due to the devastating impact of COVID-19, the full effects of Brexit on our tourism sector may not become apparent for some time.</p><p>As part of its marketing strategy, Tourism Ireland has established a recovery framework which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. The organisation has a flexible, three-phase plan to RESTART, REBUILD and ultimately REDESIGN demand. Over &euro;80 million is being invested in the programme in 2022, allowing Tourism Ireland to ramp up its campaigns in key international markets. The UK is a very important market for tourism to the island of Ireland, delivering 42% of all overseas visitors and around 25% of all overseas tourism revenue in 2019. </p><p>Tourism Ireland will continue to work with airlines and ferry companies through a programme of jointly funded marketing initiatives to support the restoration of air and sea access routes which are so vital for tourism&rsquo;s return to growth.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland unveiled plans in early 2022 to support a sustained and sustainable recovery of the tourism industry this year. The plans include a doubling of domestic marketing investment to &euro;10 million to drive domestic demand including short breaks all year round. </p><p>The agency is providing further investment in the digital presence of tourism businesses, including enhancing the digital capabilities of over 400 tourism businesses through F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s &quot;Digital that Delivers&quot; programme.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also focusing on staffing and skills issues in the tourism and hospitality sector, including the first-ever Excellent Employer Programme. The agency will assist businesses in their immediate recruitment efforts and help them to commit to driving long-term change, to making the industry an appealing and rewarding workplace that can attract and retain talent.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland will continue its investment in new and enhanced &quot;best in class&quot; visitor experiences. Projects that will open between now and 2025 will be dispersed throughout the country and will help drive visitor growth with a strong focus on the outdoors.  This will be complemented by a strong network of festivals and events.  </p><p>A Tourism Recovery Taskforce was established in May 2020 and it adopted a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector could adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment. Later that year, I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group to oversee the implementation of this plan. This group has reported regularly to me and has provided valuable inputs to the Government on the measures required to assist the sector. </p><p>The Recovery Oversight Group is continuing its work and will report to me with updates on implementation of the Tourism Recovery Plan and recovery in the sector more generally.</p><p>Looking to the longer term, my Department has initiated the development of a sustainable tourism policy. The development of this new policy will involve consultation with the tourism industry and with communities to help set out a path for the coming years which will support sustainable recovery and growth in the sector.</p></reply>

The report of the Future of Media Commission and its recommendations were considered by Government and the report is now published. It is important to note that Government has agreed in principle to accept 49 of the Commission&rsquo;s 50 recommendations. </p>  <p>  Having carefully considered the Commission&rsquo;s funding recommendations the Government is of the view that a move to an Exchequer-based funding for Public Service Media raises certain concerns for the actual and perceived independence of media funding. The additional burden for the Exchequer in moving to such a model at a time of significant budgetary pressures was also a factor in the Government's decision.   </p>  <p>  The Commission did not recommend, nor did Government decide, that the Revenue Commissioners should replace An Post as collection agent. Rather Government decided to reform and enhance the current TV licence fee system and to establish a technical group to examine how this can be achieved and to report back to the Minister and to Government in November of this year. </p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants. </p>  <p>  Due to the quasi-judicial nature of work of the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me as Minister or this Department to comment on, provide legal advice or to intervene in the specifics of any individual case. All of their mediators, adjudicators and tribunal members have independent decision-making powers, in the same way as judges have within the Court system. As the RTB has replaced the courts in resolving residential tenancy disputes, it has a responsibility towards all parties involved in a dispute to ensure that a fair hearing is conducted and that each party will have the opportunity to set out their case. Any decision made is based on the facts and evidence of a given case.</p>  <p>  In setting a rent, a landlord cannot exceed the market rent. In general, a rent in respect of a dwelling cannot be reviewed more frequently than annually in a Rent Pressure Zone (RPZ), or biannually outside of a RPZ. In reviewing a rent, a landlord must complete the Notice of Rent Review (available on the RTB&rsquo;s website) which must be served on the tenant at least 90 days before the new rent becomes payable and requires details of the rent last set for the dwelling and, if the dwelling is in an RPZ, comply with procedures providing for the rent increase restriction and use the Rent Pressure Zone calculator on www.rtb.ie to ensure compliance with the rent setting laws.</p>  <p>  A landlord must include details of 3 comparable rents in the Notice of Rent Review.</p>  <p>  Where a tenant is unsure as to the validity of a Notice of Rent Review served, he or she may refer the matter to the RTB for dispute resolution, with redress available to the tenant including a possible direction to pay a refund of any unlawful rent amount paid and an amount of damages of up to &euro;20,000.</p>  <p>  Since 1 July 2019, the RTB is empowered under Part 7A &ndash; Complaints, Investigations and Sanctions &ndash; of the Residential Tenancies Acts to investigate improper conduct by landlords including unlawful rent setting in RPZs and to impose sanctions, where appropriate. The RTB has the power to impose sanctions if improper conduct by a landlord is found to have occurred, ranging from a formal written caution and/or a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and/or costs up to &euro;15,000.</p>  <p>  I have no plans to alter the Residential Tenancies Act in this regard at this time but I do keep the operation of the Acts under constant review and I will make timely amendments, as may be required. The targeting of rent controls to RPZs is necessary to respect and limit the State's interference with the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords.

The making or amending of such rent schemes is generally a matter for local authorities within broad principles set out by my Department, including that rent levels should be based on income and reflect tenants&rsquo; ability to pay. </p>  <p>  Local discretion and flexibility are inherent in the devolved administration of rent schemes and different approaches are taken to rent setting across local authorities.  Decisions regarding the sources of income included and disregarded for rent assessment purposes, including disability allowance, are a matter for individual local authorities. There is no requirement for standardised treatment of such allowances. </p>  <p>  That said, local authority differential rent schemes are income-based. Those who earn more pay more. Accordingly, an increase in income, including an increase in an assessable allowance, may result in increased rent. However, differential rent schemes are also progressive meaning only a proportion of increased income can be charged in rent.  </p>  <p>  While all tenants, whether HAP or local authority tenants, pay a differential rent on the same basis, rents charged must reflect a tenant's ability to pay. Accordingly, local authority rent schemes generally make allowances for specific hardship cases. In such cases, they may accept lesser amounts for a specified period if they consider the amount of rent due would cause undue hardship for the tenant.</p></reply>

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority, as are the costs of collection.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates form an important element of the funding of all local authorities. However, the legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  The Government recognised the need to modernise the collection of rates and the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 was passed by the Oireachtas and enacted on 11 July 2019.</p>  <p>  It had been intended that the bulk of the provisions of the Act would be operational for the 2021 local authority budget cycle, in November 2020.  However, preparations have been delayed due to the impact of the COVID crisis and work on the government funded rates waivers.  While plans to commence the legislation were delayed by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is intended to advance this work this year.</p>  <p>  The Debt Management Project Implementation Board, on which my Department was represented, was established by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in February 2015, to progress the recommendations of the Debt Management Review, which was published in 2014.  The Project Implementation Board concluded its work in 2016 and recommended that a Central Collection Agency was not justified at that time.  This was due to the fact that the improvements which had been made by the Public Sector Bodies (PSBs) and the targets set for those PSBs for the period to 2018 were close to those that might be expected of a Central Collection Agency.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have made significant strides in recent years to improve efficiency in rates collection.  The average national rates collection percentage increased each year from 2013 to 2019.  The percentage of rates collected in 2019 was 89%.  Rates collection figures for 2020, at 79%, are impacted by COVID-19.  Following the conclusion of the rates waiver schemes in 2020, 2021 and Q1 2022 rates collection is being monitored by local authorities to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  My Department also continues to monitor the collection of rates by the Local Government sector.  There are no current plans to significantly alter the nature of rates collection.</p></reply>

This set out the high level objectives of the Vacant Homes Unit including the establishment and provision of funding to local authorities in order to establish a vacant homes office in each local authority area and also for Vacant Homes Officers who are responsible for driving implementation of the actions identified in the Reuse Strategy at local level. Due to staff changes and other priorities within the planning area (such as the development of the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund), the role of this Unit changed over the period.  Its role was reviewed last year in the context of Housing for All. </p>  <p>  Housing for All (published in September 2021) provides a new housing plan for Ireland to 2030 with the overall objective that every citizen in the State should have access to good quality homes through a steady supply of housing in the right locations, with economic, social and environmental sustainability built into the system. The strategy sets out, over four pathways, a broad suite of measures to achieve its policy objectives together with a financial commitment of in excess of &euro;4 billion per annum.</p>  <p>  In light of these priorities, my Department decided that work on this pathway merits a dedicated Principal Officer-led Vacant Homes Unit. As part of this process, the Unit moved from the Planning Division to one of the Housing Divisions. At present, the Unit contains a full time Principal Officer, Assistant Principal Officer and Executive Officer with further staffing planned as work advances. The Unit will play a key part in delivering on the Government commitments under Housing for All, pathway four designed to tackle vacancy and ensure the more efficient use of our existing housing stock.</p>  <p>  The Unit is working on a suite of measures under the pathway to addressing vacancy and efficient use of existing stock including:</p>  <p>  - The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe (Towns) Fund which will be delivered by local authorities for the provision of serviced sites for housing, to attract people to build their own homes and to support the refurbishment of vacant properties, enabling people to live in small towns and villages, in a sustainable way.</p>  <p>  - Funding support for the work of the Vacant Homes Office in local authorities including a vacant homes officer to ensure that vacant homes officers are full-time officers.</p>  <p>  - A new local authority-led programme to help Local Authorities buy or compulsory purchase 2,500 vacant homes in their areas which can then be sold on the open market to ensure their use as homes.</p></reply>

These matters include that the relevant planning authority shall be satisfied that: the development has commenced; that substantial works have been carried out; that the extension is required to enable the development to be completed; and that Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and appropriate assessment (AA) are not required for the proposed extension. The provision applies to extant permissions due to expire and as well as to permissions which expired between 8 January 2021 and 8 September 2021. </p>  <p>  This further extension period takes into account the restrictions on construction and disruptions in logistics, supply chains as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and applies equally to all development types.

In order to deliver housing at the substantial scale we need across the country, capital from all sources, including private investment is required.  </p>  <p>  Housing for All is focused on tackling supply and affordability issues in the rental market. Guaranteed State investment of over &euro;4 billion per year in housing is aimed at increasing supply. An increased supply of all properties, including cost rental and other purpose built rental accommodation, will relieve the pressure on existing rental market stock and rent prices.</p>  <p>  On-campus purpose-built student accommodation can also alleviate pressure on the private rental market and may also be available to international students and/or English language students during the summer months. Universities have developed significant numbers of student accommodation units in recent years, through borrowing from the European Investment Bank via the Housing Finance Agency. Borrowing for student accommodation by traditional universities is off-balance sheet, but such borrowing by Technological Universities and Institutes of Technology is on-balance sheet and subject to Government approval. Section 21 of the Technological Universities Act 2018 provides for borrowing by Technological Universities. </p>  <p>  I will continue to work closely with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on this matter. </p></reply>

Local Authorities have already purchased c.750 homes for social housing use. I have asked Local Authorities to increasingly target vacant and derelict properties that can be brought back to use as part of new public housing delivery, particularly where good value for money can be obtained and there is no impact on the local property market and I have assured them of my Department's support in this regard.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities will continue to tackle such vacancy and dereliction through an increasingly construction-led approach to deliver new social homes on existing sites and to support town centre and urban improvements. The Buy and Renew Scheme will remain a social housing delivery mechanism and given the current demand for social housing across all local authorities, the principal aim of the scheme remains the provision of social housing.</p>  <p>  Cost Rental is a new form of private rental tenure the conditions for which are set out in Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Act 2022. Any owner of a property can apply to the Minister for its designation as a Cost Rental dwelling under the provisions of section 29 of the Act.  More broadly, funding for the provision of Cost Rental homes by local authorities is already available through the Affordable Housing Fund (AHF), with funding to Approved Housing Bodies via the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL). The AHF provides a direct Exchequer subvention of up to &euro;100,000 per unit to a Local Authority, with the remaining funds being generally provided through Housing Finance Agency provided competitive rates of borrowing.  The tenant rent is utilised to repay these loans and cover the ongoing costs of provision, rather than requiring the full amount from Exchequer sources.</p>  <p>  This AHF grant funding for affordable homes, including Cost Rental homes, is being targeted at new build properties in order to increase the overall housing stock. Cost Rental also works best when undertaken on projects which deliver a significant number of homes, where the economies of providing, managing and maintaining groups of properties can reduce the overall costs of provision when modelled over the 40-year cost calculation period. </p>  <p>  At present, there are no plans to extend the buy and renew scheme to include of Cost Rental homes.</p></reply>

The Local Government Reform Act 2014 allows local authorities to offer less than 100% refund and to vary the level of refund for vacant properties at its annual budget meeting. Since the introduction of the Act, a number of local authorities have taken the decision to reduce the percentage refund of rates available. In agreeing budgets for 2022, 19 local authorities made the decision to offer less than 100% refund to vacant properties, ensuring in those local authorities that some rates are paid on vacant commercial properties, helping discourage prolonged vacancy.</p><p>The Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 modernised the legislation governing commercial rates<b></b>and contains provision for schemes for the abatement of rates on vacant properties<b>.  </b>Section 9 of the Act provides that the Minister may specify the maximum vacancy relief to be applied and that schemes can be made to provide abatement to a specific class or classes of vacant property. The main objective of section 9 of the Act is to discourage commercial vacancy and incentivise occupancy. This marries with the main objectives in &ldquo;Town Centres First&rdquo;, &quot;Housing for All&quot; and &quot;Our Rural Future&quot;.</p><p>Amendments are required to address key issues in the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019. The remaining provisions of the Act, including section 9, cannot be commenced until these issues are addressed. Plans to achieve necessary amendments, commence the legislation and introduce associated regulations were delayed due to the COVID crisis but it is intended to advance this work this year.</p><p>Action 19.13 of Housing For All commits to commencing section 9 of the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019. Guidance for elected members on the making of schemes under section 9, and on the flexibility and potential provided by the provision, will be key to empowering them to make schemes that will affect improvements locally to commercial vacancy. It is expected that guidance in this regard will issue to local authorities concurrently with the commencement of the legislation and taking effect of associated regulations.</p></reply>

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.</p><p>Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes; 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026.  A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery in the period 2022-2026. All local authorities submitted their Housing Delivery Action Plans to me in December 2021 and my Department has worked closely with the local authorities to review and finalise the Plans, having regard to the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. My Department has completed the review of all Plans and all local authorities have been advised to publish their Housing Delivery Action Plan on their websites.</p><p>Local authorities are independent corporate entities with full responsibility under law for the performance of their functions and the discharge of their governance and other responsibilities. My Department is working closely with the local authorities to ensure that they have the necessary funding and resources to deliver the social and affordable targets set out in Housing for All.  In this regard, a central element of Housing for All is to build institutional capacity and Housing for All commits to strengthen the capacity of local authorities to initiate, design, plan, develop and manage housing projects and recognises that this requires the resourcing of the housing services of local authorities. Funding has been approved for 250 new posts for local authorities to support the delivery of social housing and work is nearing completion to identify additional resources required to support the delivery of Affordable Housing. </p></reply>

This was an important first step in the Government's assessment as to the impact of the Eurostat decision. The Department of Finance undertook an analysis of the implications for General Government Expenditure and General Government Debt and concluded that there are no direct Exchequer implications and the projections do not present any particular issue in the context of the fiscal rules.</p><p>In addition, my Department engaged with AHB sector representative bodies (namely, the Irish Council for Social Housing and the Housing Alliance) to examine proposals, including proposals which were presented by those bodies, as a possible means to achieve reclassification. The proposals are complex as they cut across a wide range of social housing policy issues and require extensive analysis.</p><p>An important part of this exercise is to examine the feasibility of measures which can be taken to develop the AHB sector in such a way so that it could be reclassified as being 'off-balance sheet', without undermining the foundations of social housing policy. In this context, it must be accepted that this will more likely be a more longer term objective.  </p><p>Constructive discussions took place with AHB representative bodies over a number of months and these informed a pathway for dealing with the issues involved. It was agreed that a working group would be established to consider these issues further.</p><p>The AHB Classification Working Group comprises of representatives from:</p><p>- My Department;</p><p>- Department of Finance;</p><p>- The Housing Agency;</p><p>- The Housing Finance Agency;</p><p>- Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH); and</p><p>- The Housing Alliance </p><p>The group is tasked with examining and making recommendations in relation to the following:</p><p>- Clarify the impact of the CSO&rsquo;s classification decision on General Government Debt and General Government Expenditure;</p><p>- Assess the impact of the classification decision on the AHB sector (administrative, reporting, Tiers of AHBs, etc.) and assess the impact on delivery of housing under the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan; and</p><p>- Examine the detailed sectoral proposals to achieve reclassification in the context of social housing policy more generally.</p><p>Notwithstanding the decision by Eurostat, the Government continues to see a central role for the voluntary housing sector in contributing to the delivery of social housing. It is committed to using all mechanisms and schemes, including through the AHB sector, to ensure that momentum is maintained towards meeting the ambitious social housing targets as detailed in Housing for all. This statistical classification will not affect these ambitious plans.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of local authorities in addressing homelessness at a local level.  </p>  <p>  Under the Housing Act 1988 it is a matter for each local authority to determine whether a person is homeless; section 2 of the Act sets out the requirements in this regard. This allows local authorities to provide an immediate response to ensure households are provided with the accommodation and supports required while the ultimate aim is to work with households to exit homelessness in the shortest timeframe possible. When a household has been assessed as homeless, section 10 of the Housing Act 1988, provides that a local authority may provide accommodation and related services to that household. </p>  <p>  Any household assessed as homeless may be placed into temporary emergency accommodation without the requirement to undergo a social housing assessment, allowing local authorities the flexibility that is essential to respond quickly and effectively to the various needs of cases that may arise. Local authorities also assess applications for social housing supports, ensuring housing supports are available to households unable to meet their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p></reply>

Where a couple was in a relationship but not married, and the relationship has ended, the Fresh Start Principle can apply.</p>  <p>  - Applicant(s) that previously purchased a residential property, but have been divested of this through insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, are eligible to apply. The applicant must be discharged from bankruptcy proceedings.

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I announced a new fire services capital programme for the period 2021 to 2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61 million. My Department&rsquo;s Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021 - 2025 allows for continued investment at an appropriate level in our Fire Services, infrastructure, fleet and equipment. The new programme will see six replacement fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments, as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines.</p>  <p>  Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p>  - Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (this may be impacted by population or fire risks within the area)</p>  <p>  - established Health and Safety needs, </p>  <p>  - state of development of the project (for example, if the selected site had been acquired) , and</p>  <p>  - value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the current economic situation faced by the State because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the speed and extent to which proposed expenditure can stimulate local economies will also be a key consideration in the first few years of the new programme.</p>  <p>  Longford County Council has indicated that the replacement of Ballymahon Fire Station, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.7 million (revised in August 2021), would be their priority. The Council has submitted a preliminary appraisal and outline plans to the Department, and I understand that a site has been identified.</p>  <p>  Project consideration stages in my Department include, submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals; submission of design brief; selection of site; application for approval in principle; appointment of design consultants; submission of a preliminary design; planning application; submission of preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans; and tender process and construction stages. Each step is subject to approval from my Department.</p>  <p>  While a new fire station at Ballymahon is not currently included in the Department&rsquo;s 2021 &ndash; 2025 Fire Services Capital Programme, it has been included in a list for review. Projects in the capital programme are to be reassessed in Q3 2022, in order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding. This includes consideration of additional fire station projects from fire authorities which fit the normal fire station project criteria and where an appropriate business case is presented. An additional consideration of the review will be the inflation in construction costs related to materials, energy and the added uncertainty of supply chains. Priority can be adjusted to bring forward projects offering best value-for-money and to take account of the state of readiness of the projects. </p></reply>

All other elements are also based on 2021 figures, including the LPT baselines, the 80:20 local retention model, the equalisation contribution and self-funding of housing and roads from surplus LPT. LPT allocations to local authorities for 2022 amount to &euro;523.9m. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government 'Our Shared Future', commits to bringing forward LPT reforms including providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county. The Government has signalled its intention that the move to 100% local retention of LPT will be introduced over the 2023 and 2024 budgetary cycles. It is expected that the LPT yield will change following revaluation last November and the distribution model will be reviewed when new yield per local authority is fully quantified; final figures are not yet available. </p>  <p>  Given the need for timely information to be provided to local authorities for their budgetary process and the need for final LPT figures to inform that, I do not expect that baselines will be reviewed in advance of the 2023 local authority budget process. Each local authority situation is complex and it is important that sufficient time is taken to analyse and assess potential options in that respect. Preliminary census data will also form an important input to that deliberation. My Department will, however, be considering, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the potential for a move towards 100% retention for 2023. LPT allocations for 2023 have, therefore, yet to be decided.   </p></reply>

Since the programme commenced in 2013 over 75,000 homes have been retrofitted with a total exchequer spend of &euro;184 million under the scheme. </p>  <p>  In response to the Programme for Government commitment, my Department launched a newly revised ten year Energy Efficiency Programme in 2021 for local authority owned housing. This new programme set a BER performance requirement of &ldquo;B2&rdquo; or cost optimal level. The upscaling of the works included in the programme sees a substantial overall increase in funding being made available for insulation, windows and doors and heating upgrades, specifically the installation of a Heat Pump and associated works.</p>  <p>  An annualised breakdown of the total funding provided and the number of properties upgraded under the Energy Efficiency Retrofit programme for the years 2013-2021 is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/668c1-energy-efficiency-retrofitting-programme-expenditure-output/.   </p>  <p>  My Department also introduced a pilot Midlands Energy Retrofit Programme (MRP) in 2020-2022, the details of which are found below. A further 146 properties were retrofitted to a BER of B2/ Cost Optimal Equivalent and these figures are in addition to the National Retrofit Programme. </p>  <p>gov.ie - Midlands Energy Retrofit Programme - Expenditure and Units (www.gov.ie)   </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, my Department announced that funding of &euro;85 million will be provided for the upgrade of approximately 2,400 social homes in 2022. Each local authority received an individual allocation along with a minimum target of homes they are required to retrofit. </p>  <p>  Under the 2022 EERP programme, my Department funds costs of up to &euro;48,850, plus project management fees, on individual local authority homes. The actual cost of retrofitting works on each home will depend on its pre-works BER but can be as low as &euro;16,350 in some cases. Targets set and funding allocated to local authorities under the new programme calls for local authorities to undertake retrofitting on a variety of house types, from those requiring minimal investment to those requiring major investment, in order to achieve the B2/Cost Optimal BER. Local authorities are asked to ensure that the average cost per home drawn down under the programme is circa &euro;36,000, including project management fees. Adhering to this average will ensure that the maximum number of homes can be retrofit with the available budget and limit the exposure of the LA to additional costs.</p>  <p>  An official from my Department met with the relevant local authority last week to consider the issues which have arisen. My Department is also currently reviewing claims submitted from the local authority  in relation to their 2021 works programme with a view to recouping the cost of all eligible works carried out.</p></reply>

At the end of Q4 2021, over 100,000 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were nearly 62,000 households actively in receipt of HAP support, including 1,711 households in Wicklow. </p><p>At the end of Q1 2022, over 102,500 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were nearly 61,500 households actively in receipt of HAP support, including 1,694 households in Wicklow. </p><p>Local authorities have had discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It is a matter for each local authority to determine whether the application of a discretionary increase is warranted, and the level of such an increase, on a case-by-case basis. </p><p>I have now introduced an increase in the HAP discretion rate to 35% and, for new tenancies, expanded the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.</p><p>I have signed the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. No. 342 of 2022) providing for these changes, which took effect from Monday, 11 July 2022.</p><p>A breakdown of the number of HAP tenancies at end Q4 2021and Q1 2022 with the average discretionary increase paid for each of the municipal districts in Wicklow is detailed in the table below:-</p><p>Wicklow Q4 2021 Discretion Rate <table>    <tr>       <th>Municipal Area</th>       <th>Active Tenancies @ end Q4 2021</th>       <th>No. of tenancies that   received discretion</th>       <th>Average Discretion Rate</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arklow</td>       <td>682</td>       <td>190</td>       <td>16%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Baltinglass</td>       <td>163</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>16%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bray</td>       <td>227</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Greystones</td>       <td>170</td>       <td>82</td>       <td>19%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>375</td>       <td>128</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other*</td>       <td>93</td>       <td>64</td>       <td>18%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Wicklow Q1 2022 Discretion Rate <table>    <tr>       <th>Municipal Area</th>       <th>Active Tenancies @ end Q1 2021</th>       <th>No. of tenancies that   received discretion</th>       <th>Average Discretion Rate</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Arklow</td>       <td>673</td>       <td>191</td>       <td>16%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Baltinglass</td>       <td>159</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>16%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Bray</td>       <td>226</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Greystones</td>       <td>160</td>       <td>78</td>       <td>19%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>378</td>       <td>130</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other*</td>       <td>98</td>       <td>68</td>       <td>18%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Inter-authority movements, whilst the tenant is registered with Wicklow County Council, the tenancy is located outside of the county.</p><p>I am committed to decreasing our reliance on the HAP scheme and we will only do that through significantly scaling up our social housing supply. &lsquo;Housing for all&rsquo; sets us on a pathway to delivering 90,000 social homes between now and the end of 2030 including 9,000 this year. </p></reply>

To this end, funding was initially targeted at the less intrusive cavity wall insulation as well as attic/roof insulation. </p><p>Phase 2 focused on the fabric upgrade works to those remaining dwellings with solid/hollow block wall construction and includes the provision of heating upgrades.</p><p>The previous programme was withdrawn in 2021 with the introduction of a new holistic Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme that focuses on ensuring that the fabric of the home is upgraded and an energy efficient heating system is provided. The programme will see a significant upscaling on what has been completed by local authorities in previous years.</p><p>This new enhanced ten year energy efficiency programme was launched in response to a commitment made under the Programme for Government, which called for the 'retrofit' of 500,000 homes to a B2/Cost Optimal Equivalent BER standard by 2030, of which approximately 36,500 are expected to be local authority owned homes. </p><p>The 2022 Energy Efficiency Retrofitting programme has seen a significant increase in funding support to local authorities to &euro;85 million, allowing approximately 2,400 homes nationally to be upgraded to a B2 or Cost Optimal Equivalent Standard.</p><p>A breakdown of the funding provided and the output per local authority since 2013 can be found on the Department website below: www.gov.ie/en/publication/668c1-energy-efficiency-retrofitting-programme-expenditure-output/  </p><p>My Department also introduced a pilot Midlands Energy Retrofit Programme in 2020-2022, the details of which are found below. A further 146 properties were retrofitted to a BER of B2/ Cost Optimal Equivalent and these figures are in addition to the National Retrofit Programme.</p><p>gov.ie - Midlands Energy Retrofit Programme - Expenditure and Units (www.gov.ie)  </p><p>Work in relation to the 2022 programme is underway but it will be later this year before significant recoupment claims are lodged with my Department. Full details in relation to the 2022 Energy Efficiency Retrofitting programme will be available early in 2023.</p><p>Separately details in relation to those properties that fall below the B2 BER rating should be available directly upon request from the local authority themselves.</p></reply>

At the end of Q4 2021, over 100,000 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were nearly 62,000 households actively in receipt of HAP support.</p><p>At the end of Q1 2022, over 102,500 HAP tenancies had been set-up since the scheme commenced, of which there were nearly 61,500 households actively in receipt of HAP support, including 1,495 households in Wexford. </p><p>Local authorities have had discretion, because of local rental market conditions, to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to 20%, or up to 50% in the Dublin region for those households either in, or at immediate risk of homelessness. It is a matter for each local authority to determine whether the application of a discretionary increase is warranted, and the level of such an increase, on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>I have now introduced an increase in the HAP discretion rate to 35% and for new tenancies, expanded the couple&rsquo;s rate to single persons. This will secure more tenancies and prevent new entries to homelessness.</p><p>I have signed the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. No. 342 of 2022) providing for these changes, which took effect from Monday, 11 July 2022.</p><p>A breakdown of the number of HAP tenancies at end Q4 2021 and Q1 2022 with the average discretionary increase paid for each of the municipal districts in Wexford is detailed in the table below:-</p><p>Wexford Q4 2021 Discretion Rate <table>    <tr>       <th>Municipal Area</th>       <th>Active Tenancies @ end Q4 2021</th>       <th>No. of tenancies that   received discretion</th>       <th>Average Discretion Rate</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enniscorthy</td>       <td>314</td>       <td>146</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gorey/Kilmuckridge</td>       <td>338</td>       <td>231</td>       <td>21%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>New Ross</td>       <td>294</td>       <td>149</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rosslare</td>       <td>100</td>       <td>52</td>       <td>18%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford Borough</td>       <td>422</td>       <td>263</td>       <td>20%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other*</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>19%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Wexford Q1 2022 Discretion Rate <table>    <tr>       <th>Municipal Area</th>       <th>Active Tenancies @ end Q1 2022</th>       <th>No. of   tenancies that received discretion</th>       <th>Average Discretion Rate</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Enniscorthy</td>       <td>319</td>       <td>162</td>       <td>18%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Gorey/Kilmuckridge</td>       <td>326</td>       <td>228</td>       <td>21%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>New Ross</td>       <td>298</td>       <td>152</td>       <td>17%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Rosslare</td>       <td>102</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>18%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford Borough</td>       <td>399</td>       <td>260</td>       <td>20%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other*</td>       <td>51</td>       <td>25</td>       <td>19%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>*Inter-authority movements, whilst the tenant is registered with Wexford County Council, the tenancy is located outside of the county.</p><p>Section 43 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, gives the Minister the power to determine the appropriate amount of rent for qualified households, where the household class is not already prescribed for in the HAP regulations.  This is mainly used for larger families. The figure for Gorey/ Kilmuckridge municipal district is above the 20% discretion available to local authorities, as there was a number of Section 43 determinations included in the calculation.</p><p>I am committed to decreasing our reliance on the HAP scheme and we will only do that through significantly scaling up our social housing supply. &lsquo;Housing for all&rsquo; sets us on a pathway to delivering 90,000 social homes between now and the end of 2030 including 9,000 this year.</p></reply>

This programme has seen improved energy efficiency and comfort levels in over 75,000 Local Authority homes over the period 2013 to the end of 2021 at a total cost to the exchequer of some &euro;183 million.</p><p>For the period 2013 &ndash; 2020 Energy Efficiency Works were carried out in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1aimed to ensure that the entire social housing stock would have, as a minimum, wall insulation and attic insulation (300mm). To this end, funding was initially targeted at the less intrusive cavity wall insulation as well as attic/roof insulation.</p><p>Phase 2focused on the fabric upgrade works to those remaining dwellings with solid/hollow block wall construction and includes the provision of heating upgrades.</p><p>This previous programme was withdrawn in 2021 with the introduction of a new holistic Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme that focuses on ensuring that the fabric of the home is upgraded and an energy efficient heating system is provided. The programme will see a significant upscaling on what has been completed by local authorities in previous years.</p><p>This new enhanced ten year energy efficiency programme was launched in response to a commitment made under the Programme for Government, which called for the 'retrofit' of 500,000 homes to a B2/Cost Optimal Equivalent BER standard by 2030, of which approximately 36,500 are expected to be local authority owned homes.</p><p>The 2022 Energy Efficiency Retrofitting programme has seen a significant increase in funding support to local authorities to &euro;85 million, allowing approximately 2,400 homes nationally to be upgraded to a B2 or Cost Optimal Equivalent Standard.</p><p>A breakdown of the funding provided and the output per local authority since 2013 can be found on the Department website below:</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/668c1-energy-efficiency-retrofitting-programme-expenditure-output/</i>.</p><p>Work in relation to the 2022 programme is underway but it will be later this year before significant recoupment claims are lodged with my Department. Full details in relation to the 2022 Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme will be available early in 2023.</p><p>Separately details in relation to those properties that fall below the B2 BER rating should be available directly upon request from the local authority themselves.</p></reply>

It is important to note that any transfers of staff to become permanent employees of Irish Water will be on a voluntary basis, and will have no implications for the security of tenure of the staff concerned.   </p>  <p>  Water services staff who choose not to transfer to Irish Water will remain in the direct employment of their current local authority. They may continue to work in water services, under the management and direction of Irish Water, until 31 December 2026. Local authorities will no longer have any involvement in the direct provision of water services to the public beyond that date. </p>  <p>  Further opportunities for staff who do not seek to transfer to Irish Water will be identified during the transition period, including reassignment, redeployment (within the wider public service where feasible), upskilling and training programmes. </p>  <p>  Finally, a Voluntary Redundancy scheme will be made available during 2024 to relevant local authority water services staff members who at 30 June 2024 are under preserved pension age and have already accrued entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits under a local government scheme. </p></reply>

At a strategic level, the National Planning Framework, developed in consultation with both the public and across the whole of Government, sets out the national planning and infrastructure vision for the next 20 years.</p>  <p>  Within the wider national and local planning context, planning authorities must make their decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications. In making decisions on a planning application, a planning authority, or the Board as appropriate, must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan including any zoning objectives, any submissions or observations received from the public and the statutory consultees, and any relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.</p>  <p>  Furthermore planning authorities in pursuance of discharging their functions particularly in relation to plan making and the consideration of planning applications are obliged to take account of wider Government policies, where relevant,  for example those relating to renewable energy being led by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications  </p>  <p>  A comprehensive review and consolidation of planning legislation is currently underway; led by the Attorney General who has established a working group of professionals with planning law expertise to assist him in this work.  It is due to be finalised by the end of the year. Extensive work is underway on the review and my Department is engaging with the Attorney General and the working group on it. </p>  <p>  &ldquo;Housing for All &ndash; A New Housing Plan for Ireland&rdquo; outlines the key policy aims of this review, which include ensuring that the major debate, in line with objectives of compact urban growth and environmental sustainability, is focused on the plan-making rather than the planning application stage.  This will facilitate greater clarity and long-term visibility in planning outcomes, whilst ensuring appropriate account is taken of the nature of planning decisions, which require careful balancing of public policy, public participation and environmental issues. All provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, will be examined in the context of this review. </p></reply>

FBR staff have since processed over 7,400 FBR applications while also continuing to provide support to Passport services due to the unprecedented levels of passport demand.</p>  <p>  The FBR Service provides an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Such applicants may continue to contact the Passport Service directly.

This has seen the Passport Service taken on over 560 staff since June 2021.</p>  <p>  The unprecedented level of staff currently working in the Passport Service will be maintained in the months ahead.

I am also shocked at the tragic deaths of at least 23 migrants and injury to many other migrants, as well as to Moroccan and Spanish personnel.  My thoughts and sympathies go to all those who lost loved ones and to those who sustained injuries.</p><p>I welcome that the Spanish authorities have announced an investigation into this incident. It is important that the facts of this tragedy be clearly set out in order to avoid the re-occurrence of such episodes in future. Morocco&rsquo;s National Council for Human Rights (CNDH) has also established an information commission which will meet with all relevant parties and whose findings will be published in due course.</p><p>The safety of migrants and refugees, refraining from the excessive use of force and upholding their human rights in accordance with international law, including international human rights law and international refugee law, as applicable, must remain a priority for the international community. I would take this opportunity to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the <i>Global Compact for safe, orderly and regular Migration</i>and the <i>Global Compact on Refugees</i>. Ireland emphasised this commitment on 29 June 2022 when this incident was discussed at a meeting of the UN Security Council. At that meeting, we also welcomed the announcement that an investigation would take place and underlined the importance of the protection of migrants&rsquo; human rights.</p></reply>

A major recruitment drive, in partnership with the Public Appointments Service, has been underway over the past several months. This has seen the Passport Service taking on over 560 staff since June 2021.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service recently ran its own recruitment competition for Temporary Clerical Officers with a view to maintaining staffing levels throughout the year to meet the demand expected. The Department has also worked with the HSE to provide opportunities to contact tracing staff to transfer to the Passport Service. Beginning on 20 June, previous contract tracing staff have been assigned to the Customer Service Hub, which has further increased the number of staff answering customer queries. The Passport Service is seeing a significantly positive impact from this on its call handling figures.</p>  <p>  The turnaround time for first time applications has also been positively impacted by the recruitment of additional staff. Turnaround time for these complex types of applications has reduced by 40% since March, down from 40 working days to 25 days. The Passport Service is focused on reducing this turnaround time even further in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the additional staff that have been assigned and will continue to be recruited over the coming weeks will continue to have a positive impact on processing times and the provision of enhanced customer service.</p></reply>

A Better World, Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, commits to a new initiative on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), building on our partnerships in health and HIV and AIDS. Access to health services, including access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, is essential for transforming women&rsquo;s health outcomes. This is especially important during humanitarian crises and in fragile contexts, where health services can be extremely limited.</p>  <p>  To inform the development of an effective SRHR initiative, my Department has deepened our engagement with key partners in this area since the launch of A Better World. This includes support to UN agencies including UNFPA, UNESCO and UNAIDS. It also includes innovative partnerships with organisations such as the International Partnership for Microbicides that are working to develop sexual and reproductive health products tailored to women's needs. Recently, in response to the crisis in Ukraine, my Department provided further support to UNFPA&rsquo;s essential work in protecting women and girls from multiple forms of gender-based violence. Also informing the development of the initiative are the learnings from the gender sensitive interventions supported through the international development programme, frequently in partnership with the HSE, as part of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with partners on SRHR, HIV and maternal health, and explore further avenues to take forward programming in line with our commitment in A Better World. </p></reply>

In Budget 2022, &euro;1.044 billion was allocated to Official Development Assistance (ODA), the highest ever amount allocated by any Government. This is an increase of &euro;176 million on the 2021 allocation of &euro;867 million or, in percentage terms, a 20 percent increase in the overall cash allocation. The budget day estimate was that this would equate to 0.32% of GNI in 2022: the final figures are calculated at year end, when full ODA eligible spending has been agreed in a statistical exercise conducted to agreed OECD standards and are published in the Government of Ireland Annual Report on International Development.</p><p>While the increased allocation for this year is significant, sustained increases in funding will be required if the 0.7% target is to be met. My Department, which accounts for approximately 60% of ODA expenditure this year, is currently reviewing and building systems that will enable our development programme grow further, including as a proportion of GNI, in a sustainable and responsible way. This also includes working in coordination with other Government Departments and bodies involved in spending Official Development Assistance, and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on how a growing ODA allocation can be managed most effectively and responsibly across all Departments. This work informs the path to 0.7% for 2030 considering inflation and the current trends in the economy.</p><p>My Department has previously charted out an indicative pathway to 0.7%: allocations to ODA are made annually as part of the normal budget process. The numbers in the indicative pathway will change depending on a number of factors, including annual allocations to ODA and economic growth.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Potential ODA* requirement<br /><br />&euro; Million**</th>       <th>Annual increase required </th>       <th>ODA/GNI % Target</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 </td>       <td>1,044 </td>       <td>152 </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2023 </td>       <td>1,250 </td>       <td>206 </td>       <td>0.34% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2024 </td>       <td>1,525 </td>       <td>275 </td>       <td>0.39% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2025 </td>       <td>1,800 </td>       <td>275 </td>       <td>0.44% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2026 </td>       <td>2,125 </td>       <td>325 </td>       <td>0.50% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2027 </td>       <td>2,400 </td>       <td>275 </td>       <td>0.55% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2028 </td>       <td>2,700 </td>       <td>300 </td>       <td>0.60% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2029 </td>       <td>3,000 </td>       <td>300 </td>       <td>0.65% </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2030 </td>       <td>3,350 </td>       <td>350 </td>       <td>0.70% </td>    </tr> </table> *Total ODA is estimates to the nearest 25 million.</p><p>**with the exception of 2022, these numbers are indicative and will change in accordance with future budget day allocations to ODA and evolving GNI growth.</p></reply>

In spring 2022, the EU Commissioner for the Environment, Virginijus Sinkevicius, visited the region, including the Brazilian Amazon, and discussed EU environmental concerns with Minister Leite. The situation of indigenous, environmental and human rights defenders in Brazil is also regularly raised by the EU through the EU-Brazil mechanisms for political dialogue and cooperation, including by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, in December, and again by Commissioner Sinkevicius during his recent visit.</p>  <p>  The EU has stressed that fighting climate change and the loss of biodiversity must be a top priority for both the EU and the Latin America and Caribbean region. Before COP26 in 2021, the EU announced a &euro;1 billion contribution to the Global Forests Finance Pledge, as well as a new edition of the EUROCLIMA+ programme, which will support LAC partners with &euro;140 million to achieve their commitments under the Paris Agreement. This comes in addition to the EU&rsquo;s planned multi-country Team Europe initiative focusing on the Amazon basin, which aims to address root causes of key challenges affecting the region, including deforestation and forest degradation. Continuous engagement with civil society is another important component of the EU&rsquo;s ongoing work in this regard.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Brasilia also remains actively engaged on issues of climate and environmental protection in Brazil, including through engagement with civil society organisations and support to indigenous communities in the Amazon region. In May 2022, the Irish Ambassador to Brazil visited the city of Manaus and met with the Secretary of the Environment of the State of Amazonas. The Irish Embassy also participated in an EU Delegation-led demarche on Brazil ahead of COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 to encourage stronger action on climate change, and again earlier this year ahead of COP15 on Biodiversity, calling for increased global ambition on biodiversity objectives, while addressing climate goals and Sustainable Development Goals.</p></reply>

It has been an open and inclusive European democratic exercise that has offered citizens from across the EU the opportunity to provide their views on the EU&rsquo;s optimal future directions. Whilst the first stage of the Conference has formally concluded, the real work and conversations about Europe&rsquo;s future are to some extent only starting. Over 320 measures and recommendations have been presented during the Conference, spanning virtually the entire spectrum of EU activity.</p>  <p>  Both the European Commission and Council have undertaken formal assessments of the proposals which have been published in recent weeks and EU leaders briefly discussed the results of the Conference at the European Council meeting last month, noting the recommendations and requesting each Institution to follow up in accordance with its own competences. In their assessments, both the Council and the Commission have expressed the view that the vast majority of the proposals can be implemented, if agreed, through existing policies, without the need to re-open the European treaties. Ireland has also consistently underlined that the EU&rsquo;s immediate focus should centre on progressing those proposals that can be realised within the parameters of the existing treaty framework.</p>  <p>  Arising from its assessment, the European Commission intends implementing some of the recommendations within the framework of the Commission Work Programme to be published later this year.  President von der Leyen will outline intentions in her State of the Union address in September.</p>  <p>  The General Affairs Council, in its responsibility for overall policy coordination, institutional issues and horizontal files affecting several Union policies, will be responsible for the Council's follow-up to the Conference on the Future of Europe. The Government stands ready to work constructively with our Partners within the Council and with the European Parliament and Commission to help implement those changes that deliver a better Union for our citizens.</p>  <p>  Nationally, a detailed assessment of all the recommendations will be carried out across all relevant government departments within the coming months, overseen by my Department.</p>  <p>  A very small number of the recommendations would require changes to the current EU treaties in order to be implemented. These include making health a shared competence of the EU, switching from unanimity to qualified majority voting (QMV) in both the European Council and Council, and increased powers for the European Parliament.</p></reply>

In the cases of children's applications, witnessed identity and consent forms are required to ensure that guardians have consented to the issuance of a passport for the child. </p>  <p>  In cases where insufficient or incorrect documents are received by the Passport Service, every effort is made to let the applicant know as soon as possible. It is currently not possible for the Passport Service to address issues with applications earlier in the process due to the volume of applications that are being received. Applications enter a queue and are checked in order of date received.</p>  <p>  The turnaround times outlined on my Department's website apply to fully complete and correct applications, and that they are estimates based on current average processing times. Applications that are incomplete or incorrect will take longer. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service has a system in place to ensure that when an application is incomplete and further supporting documents are required and requested, these applications are prioritised once the supporting documents have been received from the applicant. The Passport Service aims to process these applications within 15 working days of receiving the supporting documents.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has been scaling up resources to deal with anticipated demand for passports since June of last year. A major recruitment drive has been underway for several months which has seen the Passport Service taking on over 560 new staff since June 2021. </p>  <p>  This recruitment drive has directly contributed to the significant reduction in turnaround times for online first time applications. Turnaround time for these complex applications has been reduced by 40% since March, down from 40 working days to 25 working days currently. The Passport Service is focused on reducing this turnaround time even further in the coming weeks. These additional staff are also helping to reduce the overall processing time for incomplete applications that require additional supporting documents. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Passport Service has taken the following steps to deal with the unprecedented demand seen so far this year and to improve processing times:</p>  <p>  - The Passport Service has worked with senior management at An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (AGS) to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified by the Passport Service directly with the Garda station. This new system assists in reducing the number of passport applications that are delayed due to a failure to verify witness details.</p>  <p>  - The Passport Service released new video guides in May to assist citizens in submitting the correct photos and consent forms for children&rsquo;s applications. These short videos provide tips to ensure that photos and children&rsquo;s consent forms will meet the Passport Service requirements. The videos are available on the Department&rsquo;s website and social media and are attracting encouraging numbers of views.</p>  <p>  - Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff is ongoing to increase the resources that can process complex applications.</p>  <p>  - The Passport Service is prioritising first time applications and directing increased resources to processing these complex applications with a view to further reducing the current turnaround time.</p>  <p>  - Passport Service staff are working overtime with a focus on prioritising first time applications.</p>  <p>  These recent service improvements further enable the Passport Service to provide this essential citizen service in an efficient and effective manner. I am confident that the increase in resources allocated to the Passport Service will continue to improve customer experience and the provision of this service. </p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p><p>The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware I recently announced initiatives to assist families with back to school costs.  </p><p>In recognition that this is an expensive time of year for families, I have put in place measures worth over &euro;17m which will ensure free school transport for families availing of the school transport scheme in the 2022/2023 school year.  This measure will provide families with savings of up to &euro;500 on the cost of tickets.  </p><p>Families have already applied for their tickets for the school year and these will be processed in the usual way, but without a fee being charged. </p><p>Families who have already paid/entered medical card details for their ticket do not need to take any further action. Families who have not yet paid for their ticket will need to confirm they still require a ticket by the 29<sup>th</sup>July 2022 and further information will issue to families shortly in this regard. </p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann have informed my Department they will process a full refund to families who have already made payments for the new school year.  Less than 20% of families who have applied for school transport have made a payment for the 2022/2023 school year.  </p><p>While Bus &Eacute;ireann will endeavour to provide refunds to customers as soon as possible, the system will prioritise the issuing of school transport tickets so that students can travel on school transport in the coming year. It is expected that the likely time period for refunds to issue will be late August/early September.</p></reply>

Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements.</p>  <p>  An online registration portal was available for schools to register their participation in this year&rsquo;s programme with a closing date  of 9 June 2022, and it remains open for schools to contact the Department in respect of the Summer Programme.

Through this intensive intervention, we have seen over 300 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year.</p><p>I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p><p>NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>NCSE is continuing to engage with schools regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022/23 and beyond. There are specific plans in place to open additional special classes and every support will be made available to progress their opening in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on September next.</p><p>It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class.</p><p>My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p><p>I want to reassure you also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education</p><p>While a full list of special classes and special schools is available on the NCSE website at the following links.</p><p><i>ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NCSE-Special-School-Allocations-21-22-website-03-12-2021.pdf</i>.</p><p><i>ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Final-2021_2022-Sp-Class-list-25_03_22.pdf</i>.</p></reply>

As part of this review, the <i>Draft Primary Curriculum Framework</i>was published for public consultation in February 2020. Work is ongoing in finalising the framework in respect of the findings from the consultation. The draft framework proposes the introduction of five broad curriculum areas, one being Social, Personal and Values Education and another being Social and Environmental Education (incorporating history and geography). The introduction of these curriculum areas into the redeveloped primary curriculum provides opportunities for learning experiences on the nature, role and value of Trade Unions in Ireland. Work on the development of curriculum specifications for the five curriculum areas will begin later this year.</p><p>The model of curriculum design at post-primary level is based on learning outcomes, setting out what students should know or be able to do. This model allows for much flexibility and autonomy for teachers in designing learning experiences. The role and importance of trade unions can be explored most obviously in business courses, but there are opportunities elsewhere too to consider their historical and contemporary significance, especially in History, CSPE and Politics and Society.</p><p>The Junior Cycle History specification provides numerous opportunities to explore the significance of trade unions in Irish history and how they have contributed to political and social developments in Ireland. </p><p>Among the many opportunities that exist at Junior Cycle to teach about the history of trade unions, of particular significance is learning outcome 2.10. This requires students to &lsquo;Examine how one sporting, cultural or social movement<b></b>impacted on Irish life.&rsquo;  When this learning outcome was devised by the JC history development group in 2017, the word &lsquo;social&rsquo; was deliberately added to allow for groups such as trade unions to be the focus of particular study, and to allow for students to understand the significance and contribution of the role of trade unions in Irish history.</p><p>Both the Irish History and Europe and the Wider World History strands allow for students to &lsquo;Debate the idea that the 1960s was an important decade in Ireland/Europe and the wider world, referring to relevant personalities, issues and events.&rsquo; This allows scope to consider how trade unions contributed to significant developments in politics and society, nationally and internationally, during this decade.</p><p>It should also be noted that the two Classroom Based Assessments for History, <i>The Past in My Place</i>and <i>A Life in Time</i>, each allow for students to look at an aspect of the trade union movement, or an important related personality.</p><p>In CSPE, there is great scope for considering the role of trade unions when interpreting learning outcomes. The CSPE course is taken by all students in junior cycle and infused throughout the course are numerous opportunities to explore the role that trade unions play in decision making processes in Irish social and political structures, and in tackling social justice issues. There is also an active citizenship dimension that allows for students to conduct a project, allowing for deeper learning about civic society and democratic processes.</p><p>Throughout the LC Politics and Society course, there are opportunities to consider the role of trade unions and other bodies in decision making processes. For instance, in learning outcome 2.1, students are obliged to describe the process of decision-making at national level in relation to a policy that impacts upon young people, making reference to the roles of: <b>civil society bodies or groups; </b>statutory bodies; the civil service; the social partnership process; the relevant minister and the government political parties; the Houses of the Oireachtas and the European Union supranational agreements such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p><p>Recent revisions to the specification explicitly include reference to the role of trade unions in promoting sustainable development. Learning outcomes 8.1 states that students should be able to consider the role of each of the following in achieving sustainable development:  individual and local community efforts; corporate/business sector; civic society groups, including trade unions, governments and international agreements.</p><p>Further to the above curricular provisions, the <i>Framework for Junior Cycle (2015)</i>gives schools greater flexibility to design programmes that are suited to the needs of their junior cycle students and to the particular context of the school. In addition to offering subjects, schools can offer students the opportunity to study short courses. </p><p>These short courses can be developed by teachers, or other agencies such as Mandate, to suit the specific needs and interests of their students in junior cycle. Information on how to develop a short course can be found on here: <i>ncca.ie/en/junior-cycle/subjects-and-short-courses/develop-your-own-short-course/</i>.  This may be an avenue of interest to Mandate Trade Union to explore.</p><p>The remit of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), outlined in the Education Act, is to advise the Minister for Education on matters relating to the curriculum for early childhood education, primary and post-primary schools, and the assessment procedures employed in schools and examinations on subjects which are part of the curriculum. As part of this, the Council has a responsibility to review the curriculum and to advise the Minister accordingly. In accordance with the Education Act, the Council is a representative structure and is appointed by the Minister for Education for a four-year term. It has 26 members who represent teachers, students, school managers, parents, business interests, trade unions, the Irish language sector and other educational interests. The current Council, appointed in March of this year, has 8 trade union members.</p><p>Curriculum development work is carried out on behalf of Council by Boards and development groups. Members of development groups are nominated as representatives of their nominating bodies which comprise the key stakeholders and partners in education. </p><p>NCCA boards and development groups serve both the function of bringing expertise and valuable experience to the deliberations while at the same time providing effective representation around the table. Trade unions form an important and significant part of this representation on development groups and boards at both primary and post-primary level.</p></reply>

This is a Road Safety Authority requirement for any licence category applied for at age 70.  It exists because of the known effects of aging on eyesight, on cognitive and physical performance, the increased risk of co-morbidities and the increased likelihood of drivers taking a number of medications.  For public transport, and especially large capacity public transport carrying children, these risks are increased as the potential harm that could result is that much greater.</p>  <p>  The age limit on school bus drivers was increased to 70 years a number of years ago.

The terms and conditions of teachers employed in State funded teaching posts are formulated at TCC and are of general application to all teachers appointed to such posts. The Career Break Scheme exists by virtue of a collective agreement, concluded under the auspices of the TCC.</p><p>My Department will keep the position under review in the 2022/23 school year, having regard to the recruitment of substitute teachers.</p><p>With regard to panel rights, the core function of the redeployment arrangements is to facilitate the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers to other schools that have vacancies. Thereafter, schools are required under the panel arrangements to fill permanent vacancies from supplementary panels comprised of eligible fixed-term (temporary/substitute) and part-time teachers. The criteria, reviewed annually with the Education Partners, are published on the Department&rsquo;s website. My Department&rsquo;s Circular Letter 0057/2021 sets out the arrangements for the Supplementary Panel for the 2022/23 school year.</p></reply>

The NCSE calendar of teacher professional training seminars will be published in the coming weeks. These seminars are scheduled to be delivered in online or in-person formats. This includes seminars specifically developed for teachers working in autism classes, some of which will be delivered in collaboration with the Middletown Centre for Autism. </p><p>In addition to the NCSE programme of seminars and online resources, schools may apply directly to the NCSE to build their capacity to support autistic students in our schools through professional learning for whole staff, groups, and individual teachers where required. Schools can access this support by making a request through NCSE School Support Portal. Support is tailored to the specific professional learning needs within a school.</p><p>Once a school makes a request, all applications for in-school support are automatically assigned to the local team manager. Applications for support regarding autism are assigned to an appropriate Advisor. The NCSE endeavour to respond to all applications for support as expediently as possible. The timeframes for providing support may vary depending on the school context, the nature of the information supplied, or the availability of specialist Advisors.</p><p><b>SNAs</b></p><p>At the request of the Department of Education, the NCSE tendered for a national training programme for SNAs, which has been delivered by UCD since 2021. In total, the programme will provide training for 3,500 SNAs over a four year period. There are five modules available in the programme, including a module on Autism. The programme is fully funded by the Department of Education and delivered at no cost to the participant.</p><p><b>Picture Exchange Communication Systems (PECS)</b></p><p>Schools can apply to the NCSE for funding to attend approved teacher professional development courses. This includes access to courses to train teachers in the use of Picture Exchange Communication Systems, also known as PECS, to respond to the communication needs of students, including autistic students, where recommended. Applications for funding are made through the NCSE School Support Portal. Applications are open to schools throughout the year and are processed on the basis that teachers receiving funding have students who would benefit.</p></reply>

This includes additional teaching and care supports.</p>  <p>  As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p>  <p>  Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen over 300 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year.</p>  <p>  I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in the Dublin 12 area as referenced by the Deputy. Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years in this area to meet the demand for places. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p>  <p>  NCSE Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) are liaising with schools and patrons in Dublin 12 to establish new special classes for the 2022/23 school year and beyond. </p>  <p>  If the NCSE has not been able to secure the necessary placements in an area, it can activate a statutory provision contained in Section 37A of the Education Act 1998. Under this provision, and after a period of engagement, the Minister can direct a school to open a special class. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware I recently initiated the Section 37a process for a third time. The NCSE have written to me to advise that they have formed an opinion that there is insufficient special class capacity in primary schools and special school capacity in Dublin The NCSE report to the Minister on the matter, which will consider existing provision, any relevant proposed building works and which schools may be able to provide additional provision is currently being finalised. I am not in a position to elaborate further until this report is finalised.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department is currently progressing emergency legislation through the Houses. The Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022 provides for a truncated Section 37A process. It is envisaged that this new process can lead to a Ministerial direction to be served on school within 6 to 8 weeks of receiving a report from the NCSE setting out their opinion that there is insufficient schools places in a certain area. </p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing this urgent legislation progressing over the coming weeks, being enacted and being available as another measure to ensure that we can continue to work to forward plan and provide an adequate number of special class and special school places for children. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

This will add an additional &euro;32million to the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to a total of in the region of &euro;180million. Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools.</p>  <p>  My Department is committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which they have been identified for inclusion in the DEIS programme. Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. Schools were also provided with the opportunity to update their details on my Department&rsquo;s enrolment databases - POD/PPOD.</p>  <p>  All appeals submitted have now been processed by my Department and schools were notified of the outcome on Wednesday 29th June. </p>  <p>  The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website.</p>  <p>  The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. My Department will continue to support schools to deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my Department&rsquo;s vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, my Department recognises that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools who need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders and will consider information provided by schools in correspondence following the application of the refined DEIS identification model.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index when available can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

REALTs also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support my Department in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area.</p>  <p>  These teams ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures in relation to people arriving from Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I am advised that the REALT team in Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board (LCETB) are liaising with the school authorities in question on a regular basis regarding enrolments in the Ennis area since contact was made with the team on Thursday, 30 June 2022.</p>  <p>  Where the demand for places in the primary schools adjacent to the accommodation centres of Ukrainian children residing in Ennis exceeds the capacity of these schools, families will be advised of the availability of school places outside of Ennis by the REALT team.</p>  <p>  If Ukrainian families are accommodated in close proximity to this school, they can of course, request to enrol their children in the school. </p>  <p>  The REALT team in LCETB will continue to support any Ukrainian family who require school places and liaise with this school in question as the need arises. </p>  <p>  Recent surveys have been carried out at Primary and Post-Primary level on potential capacity and my Department has incorporated this information with other information in the Geographical Information System (GIS) to enable prompt identification of potential capacity near accommodation centres of Ukrainian arrivals through the use of a Community Analyst reporting system. This information has been made available to all REALT&rsquo;s to support and assist their work.</p>  <p>  Utilisation of each school&rsquo;s existing capacity in the most flexible way possible will be key to supporting Ukrainian children who are being enrolled in our schools. The capacity offered by the school being referred to will be considered by the relevant REALT in conjunction with the capacity of all other schools in the relevant school planning area in relation to the placement of Ukrainian children seeking school places for the next academic year.</p></reply>

However, under Project Ireland 2040, there will be an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock. This will include a PE Hall build and modernisation programme to ensure that students in all post-primary schools have access to appropriate facilities to support PE provision. The ancillary accommodation needs of primary schools, such as General Purpose rooms will also be considered. </p><p>The Deputy may also be aware of the very significant school building programme that is currently underway.

This represents an increase of over 60%, in total expenditure, since 2011.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p><p>Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year.</p><p>We are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.</p><p>Continuing to add capacity in schools to support SEN provision is a key priority with a particular emphasis at post-primary level.</p><p>NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p><p>The Department&rsquo;s Geographic Information Management System (GIS) will continue to support a strategic and coordinated approach to planning and delivery of SEN provision. This includes &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; data on capacity across the school system.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that my Department is working actively with the NCSE and other key stakeholders including School Patrons and Management Bodies to provide additional special classes and special school places for the 2022/23 school year and beyond.</p><p>The Minister has powers under Section 37A of the Education Act to direct a school to provide additional places but this power is only used as a last resort and where all reasonable efforts have failed.</p><p>This legal power to compel schools to open new special classes is only used where the following criteria apply: </p><p>-  there is established need for additional places in an area</p><p>-  it is considered that the schools involved in the Section 37 process have capacity to open the additional classes and</p><p>-  all reasonable efforts have been made to support these schools in making the required provision.</p><p>The legislation has been used twice to date; initially in the Dublin 15 area in 2019 and more recently in the South Dublin area in 2020 in respect of primary school provision only. </p><p>The Section 37A process has recently been initiated for a third time in relation to the provision of special class places at primary and special school places in the Dublin region. The NCSE have written to me to advise that they have formed an opinion that there is insufficient special class capacity in primary schools and special school capacity in Dublin. In accordance with the legislation, the NCSE are in the process of providing a detailed report on the provision of special class places, which will consider existing provision, any relevant proposed building works and which schools may be able to provide additional provision. </p><p>The Section 37 process is one of the tools available to the Department to ensure that adequate suitable education provision is made for children with special needs and it is not a substitute for advance planning. All parties would prefer to see schools volunteer to provide more places rather than places being secured on the back of an order or a direction from the Minister. The evidence available this school-year is that schools are willing to work collaboratively with the Department and NCSE on the provision of new school places for children with special educational needs and I am grateful to all concerned for their ongoing work in this.</p></reply>

These students require highly individualised and differentiated learning programmes that are significantly different to their peers.

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.  </p>  <p>  I know what a hugely important service school transport is for families and children.  As you are aware my Department commenced a review of the School Transport Scheme in February 2021. The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme, its broader effectiveness and sustainability, and to ensure that it serves students and their families adequately. </p>  <p>  The review encompasses the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and the Primary and Post-Primary School Transport Schemes in terms of how each element of the schemes currently operate, to include eligibility criteria, trends, costs and cost drivers, and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  </p>  <p>  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Government Departments that also use transport services. The review will consider issues such as climate action, supporting rural development and promoting where possible initiatives that encourage walking and cycling to school. </p>  <p>  In June 2021, the Steering Group presented me with an initial interim report.  Following consideration of this report, I approved temporary alleviation measures for the 2021/2022 school year which allowed for the provision of transport for post-primary students who were otherwise eligible for school transport but were attending their second nearest school and had applied and paid on time. </p>  <p>  Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are now taking place in the second phase of the review.  The Technical Working Group has undertaken extensive consultation over the last number of months; including running a public survey for parents/guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  The Group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education  interest groups, industry representatives and other Government Departments,</p>  <p>  A number of meetings have been convened in recent weeks with both the Technical Working Group and the Steering Group with a view to finalising phase 2 of the review.  </p>  <p>  Decisions in regard to measures for the 2022/23 school year will be made shortly. </p>  <p>  The Steering Group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p></reply>

In the current school year over 121,400 children, including over 15,500 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;289m in 2021.</p>  <p>  Children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only. Concessionary transport is subject to a number of terms and conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service. The availability of concessionary transport may vary from year to year and cannot be guaranteed for the duration of a child&rsquo;s education cycle.  </p>  <p>  Routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis. </p>  <p>  Commercial contractors who provide transport for schools on a private hire or commercial basis but who are not contracted by Bus &Eacute;ireann to operate on the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme do not fall under the remit of the Department of Education. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-12a.1368.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071200092#WRCC01900"><p>The decision to use technology including e-books is a matter for the Board of Management of a schools.  Where the introduction of new technology is planned, consultation with members of the school community including parents is advised.  The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Management before a decision is made. Schools, in conjunction with parents and the wider school community, retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technologies in the context of their digital learning planning, and how to embed their use to enhance teaching and learning. In making this decision each school should consider all the available information.</p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice to schools and have developed an advice sheet, on the adoption of tablets in schools, on it's website which covers areas such as what tablets can offer a school, educational and purchasing considerations, and software.</p>  <p>   I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by educators and parents, in relation to costs of digital devices including eBooks, and my Department continues to work to help support schools and families meet these costs. In 2017 a circular letter issued to schools with measures to be adopted to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. This circular also instructed schools to consult with parents and their school community on the issue of ensuring costs are reasonable for parents, and how to avoid costs acting as a barrier. This circular specified that wherever possible, generic rather than branded items should be specified (e.g. uniform, clothing, IT tablets, sports equipment etc.). The issue of costs to parents will also be included in the Guidelines that will issue with the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2018.</p>  <p>  My Department currently provides a book grant of over &euro;17.2 million to all recognised primary and post primary schools within the Free Education Scheme in order to provide assistance for books, including book rental schemes  (which can include ebooks), and all schools are encouraged to operate book rental schemes to help alleviate costs to parents.  It is a matter for the board of management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of this funding in the school, but they are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes.</p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1million was provided under Budget 2020 to provide free books in DEIS primary schools on a pilot basis. This funding was allocated to 102 DEIS primary schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year. The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents.</p>  <p>  Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per pupil.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per pupil enrolled in the school. This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the Real Cost of School which states that &euro;85 is the average cost of school books at primary school. </p>  <p>  Funding continued for the 2021/22 and 2022/23 school year and the effectiveness and impact of the pilot will be evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. </p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents.  In order to support the establishment of book rental schemes, my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to primary schools.  Some 96% of primary schools and 68% of post-primary schools currently operate a book rental scheme.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027 was published in April 2022 and builds on the achievements of the previous Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020.  It aims to further support the school system so that all students across our schools have the opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills they need to navigate an ever-evolving digital world successfully. The strategy was developed following an extensive consultation process with all relevant stakeholders including students, parents/guardians, teachers and industry and sets out the various supports and resources available to schools in this important area.</p>  <p>  The strategy is underpinned by an overall investment of &euro;200m, &euro;50m of which has already issued directly to schools. In addition, &euro;50m in grant funding was issued to schools in November 2021 as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) to address the needs of their learners at risk of educational disadvantage through the digital divide.  Again this builds on the overall investment of &euro;210m under the previous strategy. </p>  <p>  Most publishers issue eBooks free of charge with the purchase of their text books, but this is at the publisher&rsquo;s discretion.  Curriculum specifications and prescribed syllabus material are determined by the NCCA and it is the responsibility of each individual school to select the resources, if any, that it will use to support its implementation of the curriculum. The NCCA and the Department does not endorse or recommend particular materials. This includes text books, and it is a matter for each school to consider all relevant issues, including discussing license requirements for eBooks with the publishers.</p>  <p>  Scoilnet, the Department funded website, provides open access to the Irish education system to rich appropriate content including Encyclopaedia Britannica, Irish newspaper archives, and other curated sites.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-12a.1390.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071200092#WRCC04100"><p>There are a number of options open to students across Senior Cycle that provide students with the opportunity to develop their skills and reach their full potential.</p>  <p>  Transition Year (TY) is a one-year programme between Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle. It is designed to act as a bridge between the two by facilitating the smooth transition from the more dependent learning of the Junior Cycle to the more independent self-directed learning required for the Senior Cycle. All Second-Level schools have the option of offering the Transition Year programme to their students and most do offer it. </p>  <p>  The established Leaving Certificate programme is a two-year programme that covers a wide range of subjects. Subjects are normally studied at either Ordinary or Higher Level. Two subjects, Irish and Mathematics, can be studied at Foundation Level. Foundation Level is geared to the needs of students who might have difficulty with those subjects at Ordinary or Higher Level.</p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate Applied is a distinct, self-contained two-year Leaving Certificate programme aimed at preparing students for adult and working life. The programme sets out to recognise the talents of all students and to provide opportunities for developing personal responsibility, self-esteem and self-knowledge. The programme focuses on the talents of each student and helps students apply what they learn to the real world. The two-year programme consists of four half-year blocks called sessions. Achievements are credited in each session.</p>  <p>  The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) is a Leaving Certificate with a strong vocational aspect.  The programme consists of Leaving Certificate subjects, together with three compulsory link modules on enterprise education, preparation for work and work experience. Students must take at least 5 Leaving Certificate subjects, one of which must be Irish and a continental language or vocational language module.</p>  <p>  On 29 March I announced an ambitious programme of work for a reimagined Senior Cycle of education where the student is at the centre of their Senior Cycle experience. The three tenets of Senior Cycle redevelopment are to:</p>  <p>  -  Empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century</p>  <p>  -  Enrich the student experience and build on what&rsquo;s strong in our current system</p>  <p>  -  Embed well-being and reduce student stress levels</p>  <p>  The approach to Senior Cycle redevelopment is informed by and builds upon the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s (NCCA&rsquo;s) Advisory Report on the review of Senior Cycle. The redeveloped Senior Cycle will involve the creation and development of more flexible learning pathways within school.</p>  <p>  In a redeveloped Senior Cycle, real opportunities to progress, consolidate and transfer learning should be available for students of Level 1 and Level 2 Learning Programmes, for those who can currently access these programmes at Junior Cycle. In my announcement I stated that a new qualification will be introduced at level one and two on the National Qualification framework to provide an appropriate level of assessment to some students with special educational needs, building on the equivalent programme at Junior Cycle level.</p>  <p>  I intend to make these opportunities available as soon as possible. I have requested the NCCA to begin work immediately with schools to work towards developing a Level 1/Level 2 Learning Programme for those currently in first year. To commence this process, the NCCA has initiated a review of the L1/L2 Learning Programmes at Junior Cycle and is seeking to learn more from schools about their curriculum provision for students in Senior Cycle who followed L1/L2 Learning Programmes at Junior Cycle. To support this work, the NCCA recently invited schools to express their interest in participating in the school-based component of the review. Following a selection process, nine schools will participate in the review with school visits taking place when schools reopen in September.</p>  <p>  Work has also commenced on the development of a background paper and brief for developing the follow-on programmes. The outcomes from the review will feed into the background paper and help to inform the brief both of which will be discussed by the NCCA Council in Q4 this year. Following Council approval, the paper will be published for public consultation. In preparation for work on the follow-on programmes, NCCA is currently establishing a development group.</p>  <p>  The redeveloped Senior Cycle will involve the creation and development of more flexible learning pathways within school. For students commencing fifth year in the coming school year (September 2022), students in schools providing the LCVP will be able to access the Link Modules without the requirement to meet vocational subject grouping criteria set out in Circular Letter 0040/2013. These groupings will no longer apply for students opting in to the LCVP programme commencing fifth year in the coming school year.</p>  <p>  In addition, students will no longer have to meet the modern European language requirements to access the LCVP programme. However, all other requirements for participation in the LCVP as set out in circular 0040/2013 continue to apply, including the Irish language requirement.</p>  <p>  Further guidance for schools and students on the plans for Senior Cycle redevelopment is available at www.gov.ie/SeniorCycle.</p></reply>

This includes additional teaching and care supports.</p>  <p>  As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.</p>  <p>  Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen over 300 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021/22 school-year.</p>  <p>  I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in the Dublin 12 area as referenced by the Deputy. Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years in this area to meet the demand for places. </p>  <p>  The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. </p>  <p>  NCSE Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) are liaising with schools and patrons in Dublin 12 to establish new special classes for the 2022/23 school year and beyond. </p>  <p>  If the NCSE has not been able to secure the necessary placements in an area, it can activate a statutory provision contained in Section 37A of the Education Act 1998. Under this provision, and after a period of engagement, the Minister can direct a school to open a special class. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware I recently initiated the Section 37a process for a third time. The NCSE have written to me to advise that they have formed an opinion that there is insufficient special class capacity in primary schools and special school capacity in Dublin The NCSE report to the Minister on the matter, which will consider existing provision, any relevant proposed building works and which schools may be able to provide additional provision is currently being finalised. I am not in a position to elaborate further until this report is finalised.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department is currently progressing emergency legislation through the Houses. The Education (Provision in Respect of Children with Special Educational Needs) Bill 2022 provides for a truncated Section 37A process. It is envisaged that this new process can lead to a Ministerial direction to be served on school within 6 to 8 weeks of receiving a report from the NCSE setting out their opinion that there is insufficient schools places in a certain area. </p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing this urgent legislation progressing over the coming weeks, being enacted and being available as another measure to ensure that we can continue to work to forward plan and provide an adequate number of special class and special school places for children. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed, in conjunction with the NCSE, to continue to work with parents, schools, patrons and all stakeholders to ensure that there are sufficient appropriate places for students with additional needs and to support all students to achieve their potential.</p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy also that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.</p></reply>

Entitlement to such benefits is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria. Invalidity Pension is one such, non means tested, income support.</p>  <p>  A person who has an insufficient PRSI contribution record may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme.  The application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need.  Disability Allowance and Blind Pension are two means tested social assistance schemes, which are also subject to a medical assessment and habitual residency requirement.</p>  <p>  It is important to note however that within the schemes a number of disregards apply, for the purpose of the means test; these include:  </p>  <p>  - Both the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension schemes are structured to support recipients to pursue employment opportunities, be that self-employment or insurable employment. In the means test, both schemes have an income disregard of &euro;140 per week. In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;375 are also disregarded for the purpose of the means test.</p>  <p>  - Capital disregards apply for both schemes.</p>  <p>  - There are also a range of other services and grants available to support people with disabilities to pursue employment opportunities, these include for example, the workplace equipment adaptation grant (WEAG).  </p>  <p>  My Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives, while any proposed changes have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-12a.1414.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071200093#WRDD01300"><p>My Department provides a number of income supports for those unable to work due to illness or disability. There is a range of benefits available to people who make Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions. Entitlement to such benefits is dependent on the individual's social insurance contribution record, the class of social insurance paid as well as satisfying other qualification criteria relevant to the scheme. The Invalidity Pension is an example, of one such income support.</p>  <p>  A person who has an insufficient PRSI contribution record to qualify for a social insurance benefit/pension may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme. This system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring. The application of the means test not only ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need but that resources are targeted to those with greatest need. </p>  <p>  Disability Allowance and Blind Pension are means tested social assistance schemes, which are also subject to a medical assessment and habitual residency requirement.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that within the schemes a number of disregards apply, for the purpose of the means test; these include:  </p>  <p>  - Both schemes are structured to support recipients to pursue employment opportunities, be that self-employment or insurable employment. In the means test, both schemes have an income disregard of &euro;140 per week. In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;375 are also disregarded for the purpose of the means test.</p>  <p>  - Capital disregards apply for both schemes.</p>  <p>  - Disregards are in place for both schemes were a person is granted a bursary, stipend or scholarship towards completing a PhD. This is subject to an annual limit of &euro;20,000 (i.e., if a recipient gets more than one bursary, the combination cannot exceed &euro;20,000) and is available for a maximum of four years. </p>  <p>  - In addition, income received from the SUSI grant is disregarded in the means test for most social welfare schemes. </p>  <p>  - The Department also supports all social welfare recipients to avail of education and training opportunities through its Back to Education scheme, as well as by referrals to further education and training opportunities through its Intreo service. </p>  <p>  - In addition, there are a number of other scholarships, such as those awarded by certain charitable organisations, which are not assessed as part of the means test for any social welfare payment. These include payments under the 1916 Bursary Fund and under Higher Educational Scholarships for Adult Learners from Uversity.</p>  <p>  Finally it is worth noting that, under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a strawman proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments. The main objectives are to simplify the system, remove anomalies, recognise the continuum of disabilities and to support employment. Work is underway by officials on the &lsquo;strawman&rsquo; with a public consultation to commence in due course.</p>  <p>  My Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives, while any proposed changes have to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.</p></reply>

This ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is a benefit under the Occupational Injuries Scheme.  It can be paid to a recipient who suffers a loss of physical or mental faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or from work, or a prescribed disease contracted at work.  The contribution requirements for the scheme are minimal when compared to other Departmental benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  People in receipt of Disablement Benefit (without another social welfare payment) can work full or part time and continue to receive the Benefit Payment &ndash; in other words, they are not prevented from generating additional income. </p>  <p>  Disablement Benefit is paid at the same time as most social welfare payments including Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit, Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, State Pension and One-Parent Family Payment.  It is not considered as means for most social welfare means-assessed schemes except for Fuel Allowance, Supplementary Welfare Allowance or Working Family Payment.</p>  <p>  Incapacity Supplement is an increase payable in addition to Disablement Benefit where a person is considered to be permanently incapable of work as a result of an occupational accident or disease and does not qualify for another Social Welfare benefit such as Illness Benefit.  This Incapacity Supplement is a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, while Disablement Benefit on its own is a disqualifying payment for Fuel Allowance because a person may continue to or take up work, or may receive another social welfare payment in parallel, qualification for Incapacity Supplement in addition to Disablement Benefit qualifies that recipient for Fuel Allowance (subject to satisfying all other qualifying criteria).</p>  <p>  I have asked officials in my Department to prepare a report reviewing the treatment of Disablement Benefit under the Fuel Allowance scheme. This report has now been finalised and the report's contents and recommendations will be considered in the context of the upcoming budget.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In particular, specialised employment services for those farthest from the labour market - previously available in just twelve counties - will soon be available State-wide for the first time.   </p>  <p>  In the first phase of this procurement, contracts for Intreo Partners Local Area Employment Services were agreed in late 2021 across four lots in seven counties in the Midlands and North-East.  These new services have been operational and accepting referrals since early this year.   </p>  <p>  Phase two of this process is expected to be concluded shortly.  The procurement of phase 2 of the Intreo Partners Local Area Employment Services commenced with the publication of the request for tender on 21 December last.  Phase 2 took on board learnings from the phase 1 procurement including, for example, a substantial increase in guaranteed minimum annual referral numbers, enhanced requirements for social and community links and an increase in the number of lots. </p>  <p>  This procurement process was preceded by extensive consultation with all stakeholders, including the community sector providers and their representative body, the ILDN.  Each existing provider was visited on site by my officials and asked for their views on the way forward for the best provision of employment services and there has also been engagement with the staff representative bodies.  In addition, the external consultants engaged by the Department to assist in the restructuring of these services also consulted with existing providers. </p>  <p>  My Department extended the deadline for the Requests for Tenders to 25 April to ensure all interested parties, including the community sector, had sufficient time to prepare quality tender responses that reflect their experience and capacity to deliver a quality service.</p>  <p>  When this procurement process is completed, the preferred bidders will be promptly contacted and engaged with a view to signing contracts and establishing new services at the earliest opportunity. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand that I am not and cannot be directly involved in the procurement process.</p></reply>

This is due to the fact that Class S contributions to the Social Insurance Fund are made at a lower rate of 4%. In order to qualify for Illness Benefit people must have made the required number of contributions under Class A, E, H or P.</p>  <p>  There has been an extensive expansion of access to the range of social insurance benefits for self-employed contributors in recent years without any increase in the 4% rate of contribution made by them. In effect, self-employed contributors, in return for a contribution of 11 percentage points lower than the combined employer and employee contribution of 15.05% made in respect of employed contributors, have access to benefits which comprise over 90% of the value of all benefits available to employed contributors.</p>  <p>  Where all qualification criteria are satisfied, Class S PRSI gives access to Adoptive Benefit, Guardian's Payment (Contributory),  Invalidity Pension, Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed), Maternity Benefit, Parent's Benefit, Partial Capacity Benefit (where in receipt of Invalidity Pension), Paternity Benefit, State Pension (Contributory), Treatment Benefit, and Widows, Widower's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Contributory) Pension.</p>  <p>  The benefits to which class S PRSI does not provide access are Carer's Benefit, Health and Safety Benefit, Illness Benefit, and Occupational Injuries Benefits.  </p>  <p>  Self-employed people may qualify for long-term payments Disability Allowance or Invalidity Pension if they satisfy all eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  Disability Allowance is a social assistance payment for people with a disability who are aged 16-66 and are resident in the state. Applicants are subject to medical and means assessments.</p>  <p>  Invalidity Pension is a social insurance payment for people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability. Eligibility is based on PRSI contribution record, this payment is not means-tested. Applicants are, however, subject to a medical assessment. </p>  <p>  Although self-employed people are not usually eligible for Illness Benefit, an exception was made in relation to Covid-19 enhanced Illness Benefit, primarily as a public health measure. The purpose of this payment is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation.</p>  <p>  Apart from these income supports, my Department provides means tested supports under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who are ill but who do not qualify for illness and disability payments. An Additional Needs Payment is also available to people who have expenses that they cannot pay from their weekly income.</p>  <p>  My Department keeps its income supports under review in order to make sure they meet their objectives.

The two main national strategies in this area are the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is the lead Department with regards to both of these strategies.</p>  <p>  In addition, on 10 June, Minister of State Rabbitte, launched an open call for Expressions of Interest to join the Autism Innovation Strategy Oversight and Advisory Group. This announcement followed the launch of an initial public consultation on the Autism Innovation Strategy, which took place from 29 April 2022 to 30 May 2022. The Oversight and Advisory Group&rsquo;s main role will be to oversee implementation of the Autism Innovation Strategy which aims to accelerate Ireland's journey towards becoming an autism-inclusive and neurodiverse-friendly society. Full details are available on Gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection provides a suite of income supports for those who are unable to work due to an illness or disability.  It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Department also provides a wide range of employment services and supports to assist jobseekers and existing employees with disabilities, and to incentivise employers in the private sector to both recruit (and support existing) employees with disabilities.</p></reply>

Participation by jobseekers is wholly voluntary. </p>  <p>  There are currently 25 Employment Services Officers, 272 Employment Personal Advisors (Higher Executive Officers) and 96 Job Coaches (Executive Officers). </p>  <p>  Jobseekers with a disability who wish to avail of the service work with an Employment Personal Advisor with a view to agreeing a suitable personal progression plan in order to access the full range of employment supports available with the aim of supporting the person into sustainable employment. If the person would like to explore education and training options, there are a wide range of opportunities available with mainstream and specialist training providers.  Funding is also available through the Training Support Grant to help the person to access private sector training providers. </p>  <p>  Once the personal progression plan is agreed, Employment Personal Advisors/Job Coaches continue to work with the person to support them along a pathway to employment.</p>  <p>  My Department also contracts for the provision of Local Area Employment Services. Providers deliver a case-managed employment service for all jobseekers, including those with disabilities, who avail of the services.</p>  <p>  Employment programmes such as Community Employment and the Work Placement Experience Programme provide valuable stepping stones into sustainable employment. My Department also contracts AHEAD (Association for Higher Education Access and Disability) to deliver the Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) and &lsquo;Get Ahead&rsquo; Programmes on its behalf. These programmes provide paid work experience and other supports for graduates with disabilities seeking to enter or re-enter employment.</p>  <p>  As part of our commitments under the Pathways to Work Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, my Department is shortly to commence an early engagement approach that will see the Intreo service proactively engaging with persons with a disability, to offer support and assistance to help them enter or return to employment.  The process will initially focus on persons aged 18 to 22 and in receipt of Disability Allowance, before being expanded to other age groups and schemes.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the additional challenges that some jobseekers with disabilities may experience in securing and maintaining employment, and my Department also contracts for the provision of specialist employment services (EmployAbility) to help address this.  A jobseeker with a disability who is working with their Intreo case officer (or LEAS provider) may be referred to these service providers if it is agreed that they would benefit from the type of services and support provided.  Jobseekers work with a Job Coach who provides both pre-employment and in-employment support and assistance. </p>  <p>  There are no directly associated costs in hiring Job Coaches in my Department as these posts are filled from existing, internal staffing resources. Job Coaches are filled at Executive Officer level. The most recently updated Executive Officer salary scale is outlined in Circular 04/2022, available on Gov.ie.</p>  <p>  A budget amount has not been allocated specifically to the Department for Job Coaches. These positions are paid for through the Department&rsquo;s overall staffing budget.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-12a.1457.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071200093#WRDD03475"><p>When the State Pension (Transition) existed, it was a scheme which allowed those who were retired to receive a transitionary payment between the ages of 65 and 66 years.  The maximum personal rate was equivalent to the then maximum rate for the State Pension (Contributory).  Eligibility was based on PRSI contributions and credits and payments were calculated based on the Yearly Averaging approach.  PRSI Class S contributions (self-employed) were not reckonable for the State Pension (Transition).</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the conditions and eligibility requirements for State Pension (Transition) were different to and more arduous than those for the State Pension (Contributory).  For example, a person had to have a minimum average of 24 contributions per annum to be eligible for State Pension (Transition) whereas an average of 10 contributions per annum is required for State Pension (Contributory) eligibility.  In addition, recipients of State Pension (Transition) were not eligible for Free Travel, the Household Benefits Package (electricity, gas, TV licence) or Living Alone Allowance.  Furthermore, the State Pension (Transition) scheme had a retirement condition whereas the State Pension (Contributory) did not.</p>  <p>  Since the State Pension (Transition) scheme ceased with effect from 1 January 2014, very significant amendments have been made to the State Pension (Contributory) scheme, including the introduction of the interim Total Contributions Approach and the availability of Homecaring Periods.  As a consequence of these changes, applicants for the State Pension (Contributory) are assessed under the Yearly Averaging system and the interim Total Contributions Approach and awarded on the basis of the most beneficial calculation. </p>  <p>  While it would be possible to estimate the potential cost of reintroducing the State Pension (Transition) on the exact same legislative basis as it previously existed (which included specific rate-band structures and a yearly average method of payment calculation), it would not be possible to reintroduce it on that basis because of the changes set out above.  Therefore, introducing such a scheme would require significant design changes to the previous State Pension (Transition) to modernise it in line with the Total Contributions Approach method of payment calculation and the availability of Homecaring Periods.  As no such design work has been done, it is not possible to estimate the cost as requested. </p>  <p>  In February 2021, I introduced the "Benefit Payment for 65 year olds" in line with the Programme for Government commitment, to provide a benefit payment for people who are aged 65 and who are required to retire, or who choose to retire, without a requirement to sign on, engage in activation measures or to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  This new payment was designed specifically to bridge the gap for people who retire from employment or self-employment at 65 years of age but who do not qualify for the State Pension until age 66.</p>  <p>  The Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report was published on 7th October 2021 and it contained almost 250 pages of analysis, consideration and recommendations. The report, Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, agendas, minutes, external presentations and submissions in response to an extensive public consultation process are available on the website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.  The Commission&rsquo;s work established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed.  It has set out a wide range of recommendations, including in respect of the State Pension Age and early access, and aligning retirement ages in employment contracts with the State Pension age. </p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and future generations of older people, the Government is considering the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Pensions Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are being considered as part of these deliberations.  I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government for its consideration when that work is completed.</p>  <p>  It is clear from the Commission&rsquo;s work that State Pension reform is necessary and it is complex.  It would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for projected demographic changes, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

On the 23rd December 2021, both unions involved confirmed acceptance of this settlement which will benefit approximately 2,500 people employed by CE schemes going back to 2008. It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million.</p>  <p>  Generally, under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age are now able to apply for this payment. CE supervisors and assistant supervisors who retire on ill health grounds can also apply for the payment subject to the provision of supporting documents and medical evidence.</p>  <p>  As agreed with the unions, the start date for the qualifying period of employment for the scheme is aligned with the year of the Labour Court recommendation in 2008.  Accordingly, the settlement does not apply to periods of employment prior to 1st July 2008.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that each recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.</p>  <p>  If a claimant is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, the means of the couple will be assessed. This is the case even if only one of the couple is actually claiming a payment. The means assessed include income from employment or self-employment, non-social welfare pensions, and the capital value of savings, investments and property other than the family home.  It should be noted that the value of the family home, regardless of who is the legal owner, is never taken into account in this assessment.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the full value of capital is not assessed. The standard formula for assessing the value of capital for most social welfare payments is as follows: the first &euro;20,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.</p>  <p>  The formula for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance and Disability Allowance is as follows: the first &euro;50,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.</p>  <p>  Any proposals to change the means assessment formulas for social assistance schemes would have to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy</p></reply>

The work originally planned was based on no significant changes being made to the services being provided by Navan Road Intreo Centre, the way those services are delivered and the layout of the building. Given the significant increase in construction and maintenance costs in recent months, including in building supplies, it was decided, before finalising the works contract, to review the future use of the building at Navan Road to ensure efficient and effective use of resources.</p><p>A comprehensive review was undertaken in 2021 of all services and activities delivered by the Department&rsquo;s network of local offices, with the purpose of determining the best future operating models for delivering these services and activities. </p><p>The review identified that significant portions of work that had previously taken place in Intreo Centres had been moved to alternative work streams, with the most significant being the processing of payments by the National Processing Team (NPT) and the handling of phone and electronic contacts by the National Intreo Contact Centre (NICC). The review also identified substantial benefits for standardising and streamlining work previously replicated across different local divisions.  </p><p>In terms of the layout of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo Centres, this means that instead of large waiting areas with rows of seats and multiple hatches, the Department will be providing self-service zones with interactive touch screens, child friendly spaces and autism supportive sensory rooms.  The layout will reflect the fact that many customers will be there by appointment and won&rsquo;t need to queue. </p><p>The work in Navan Road Intreo Centre had been planned some time ago and it was considered appropriate to pause the works while further consideration was given to the optimal use of the building.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist those households most in need with their energy costs.  </p><p>In Budget 2022, the Government increased the weekly means threshold for the Fuel Allowance scheme by &euro;20 to &euro;120, which enables more people to qualify for this support. </p><p>The allowable means limit ensures that the Fuel Allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p><p>Any decision to further increase the allowable means for the Fuel Allowance payment would have budgetary consequences and can only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources. </p><p>Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.

To qualify for the fuel allowance payment, a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including a means test and the household composition criteria.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own. </p>  <p>  While the Department's schemes are reviewed on an ongoing basis, any further expansions to the Fuel Allowance scheme in the manner outlined by the Deputy would have cost implications and could only be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources. </p>  <p>  However, significant additional cost is not the only feature of the Deputy's proposal. Removing the mean test criteria for the Fuel Allowance payment to the cohort of people referred to by the Deputy would fundamentally change the nature of the scheme. The scheme would no longer be a targeted measure, as it would be awarded irrespective of a person's or a household's means.  These are implications that would clearly require further consideration in any proposed expansion of the scheme.</p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of recent price increases and their impact on households.  For this reason, this Government did not await a further budget cycle to address these challenges but acted early.  Overall, the tax and spending measures we have introduced to ease the burden and provide support to those most in need have amounted to &euro;2.4 billion.  </p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.

This is extended to encompass older school or college going children up to age 22 under certain circumstances.  This increase provides targeted assistance that is directly linked with household income and family-size to support low-income families.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 I provided for the weekly rates of the Increase for a Qualified Child to increase by &euro;2 to &euro;40 per week in the case of children under age 12 and by &euro;3 to &euro;48 per week in the case of children age 12 or over.</p>  <p>  The measure is in recognition of the need for greater income support for welfare-dependent households with children.  It includes a higher level increase for children aged 12 and over, in recognition of the higher costs faced by families with older children.  It is estimated that this measure will cost &euro;39.3 million in 2022.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to increase the age in respect of which an Increase for a Qualified Child is payable.</p></reply>

It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependents and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment.  Eligibility for the payment is not linked to receipt of a social welfare payment but rather a person must be in employment of at least 38 hours per fortnight, and have at least one relevant child, in order to qualify for the payment.  </p>  <p>  To qualify for the Working Family Payment the average total weekly family income must be below the relevant income threshold for the family's size.  The payment is calculated at 60% of the difference between the total family income and the income threshold that applies to the family.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 I provided for a &euro;10 weekly increase in the Working Family Payment income limits for families of all sizes.  The income threshold increases with the number of children.  For example, the weekly income threshold for families with one child is &euro;551 and for families with two children it is &euro;652. </p>  <p>  Based on current and projected claim volumes, my Department estimates expenditure of &euro;348.6 million on the scheme in 2022.</p>  <p>  Any expansion of the scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Overall, the tax and spending measures we have introduced to ease the burden and provide support to those most in need have amounted to &euro;2.4 billion.  </p><p>The Government continues to monitor the situation carefully in preparation for the Budget later this year.  I will be meeting a range of NGOs at the Department's pre-budget forum next month and will listen carefully to the views expressed.</p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department can make additional needs payments to help meet expenses that a person cannot pay from their weekly income.  This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.</p><p>The payment is available to anyone who needs it and qualifies, whether the person is currently receiving a social welfare payment or working on a low income.  </p><p>The household income amounts published in relation to additional needs payments are not an eligibility threshold, but are intended as an information guide to assist persons who may find themselves in financial difficulty and require assistance with essential expenses. </p><p>Guidelines issued to staff administering the scheme assist them in the decision making process and ensure consistency of service.  However, they do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing an additional needs payment to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.</p><p>An exceptional needs Payment (ENP) is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time. </p><p>Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>The scheme is demand led.  The Government has provided funding of &euro;45.75 million for the provision of exceptional and urgent needs that are provided for as Additional Needs Payment in 2022.  A further provision of &euro;5.3 million has been provided for SWA Supplements in 2022 (excluding rent supplement).</p><p>The Department is developing more extensive statistics in relation to the number of applications made to the ENP/UNP schemes.  The focus of the development has been on current data from January 2022 with details on the number of applications available from this date onward.  Details of applications pre-January 2022 are not available at this time, however it is possible to provide details on the number of payments that were made.</p><p>Table 1 shows the number of ENPs/UNPs awarded for 2021 and to date in 2022 (end of June).</p><p>Table 2 shows the number of recipients of Other Supplements on 31 December 2021 and on 30 June 2022.</p><p>Table 3 shows the number of ENP/UNP and Other Supplement applications received/disallowed to date in 2022 (to end of June).</p><p>This represents a snapshot of claim activity taken at 7th July 2022 and is subject to change. It does not include claims that were cancelled or withdrawn.</p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  There is a National Community Welfare Contact Centre in place - 0818-607080 - which will direct callers to the appropriate office.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p><p><b>Tabular Statement</b></p><p><b>Table 1 - The number of ENPs/UNPs awarded for 2021 and to date in 2022 (to end of June)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th><div>Number of Payments </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td><div>55,500 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 (to end of June) </td>       <td><div>36,987 </div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2 - The number of recipients of Other Supplements on 31 December 2021 and on 30 June 2022</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th><div>Number of Recipients </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 </td>       <td><div>3,698 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2022 (to end of June) </td>       <td><div> 3,384 </div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 3 - The number of ENP/UNP and Other Supplement applications received/disallowed to date in 2022 (to end of June)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme </th>       <th><div>Received </div></th>       <th><div>Disallowed  </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ENPs/UNPs </td>       <td><div>40,718 </div></td>       <td><div>2,676 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other Supplements </td>       <td><div>670 </div></td>       <td><div>78 </div></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Two further certificates, covering the periods to 7th and 10th February 2022, were subsequently submitted, however, neither of these were marked as a final certificate.  Because of this, the end date of the original certificate i.e. 17th July 2022 remained active which meant that her claim remained open and in payment.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate the Department has been dealing with an unprecedented level of claims and correspondence across the course of the pandemic and this has unfortunately given rise to delays in responding to some customers, which falls short of expected standards.     </p>  <p>  The error that occurred in this case was not one made by the Department and taking account of all  the circumstances involved, the Department does not propose to write off the overpayment, that has arisen.

This specifies the nature of the illness and the duration of the incapacity for work. </p>  <p>  In respect of Enhanced Illness Benefit (EIB), given the high rate of Covid 19 infections in the community and the strain on the health service, my Department on a temporary basis during this period of exceptional demand, expanded the range of documentation customers could use to apply for EIB.  This included confirmation from the HSE of a positive diagnosis for Covid 19 either through a PCR test or having registered a positive antigen test.  In addition, in respect of people who were identified as a close contact, by a positive COVID-19 contact, could submit a copy of the acknowledgement text for a PCR booking or the HSE acknowledgement of antigen test kit request. </p>  <p>  The use of this additional documentation as an acceptable form of medical evidence to support claims for Enhanced Illness Benefit was introduced as an exceptional measure.  The objective was to assist people who had tested positive with Covid-19, or who had been identified as a potential source of infection with Covid-19, to promptly comply with medical advice in line with pubic health objectives. </p>  <p>  With effect from 28th February 2022, following the further changes to the public health advice, the Department reviewed their impact on the processing of EIB and, in consultation with the HSE, introduced changes to the documentation required to support an application namely: </p>  <p>  -  for individuals who had a positive COVID diagnosis  they could continue to upload evidence of the positive PCR test or the SMS acknowledgment received by persons who logged a positive antigen test on the HSE portal, with their Enhanced Illness Benefit on-line application and </p>  <p>  -  for those who were symptomatic and had to self isolate were required to provide an eCert from their GP for the period of their self isolation. </p>  <p>  With effect from 30 May 2022, in light of the current public health guidance, the Department discontinued all the temporary exceptional arrangements and re-introduced the requirement for medical certification (a Certificate of Incapacity for Work) to be submitted in respect of all illness benefit applications, standard or EIB.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Interactions have taken place at local contract management level along with more broader engagement at a central level through the Contracted Public Employment Services Unit of the Department.  The specific administrative requirements of contract closure are covered in the agreed contract for services and associated guidelines.  My Department will as a matter of course honour all agreements made.</p>  <p>  Costs relevant to the provision of LES and Job Clubs service up to the 31 August 2022 will be paid.  Relevant costs will be processed provided they relate directly to the period of the contract and have been included in the calculation of the final claim.

My Department informed Local Employment Service contractors in January of this year, that all training supported by the Mediator Fund must be availed of and completed within the 6-month contracted term 1 Jan to 30 June 2022.  With the extension of contracts to 31st August a further notification issued to contractors that all payments for Mediator Fund supported training must be processed and completed within the contracted term from 1 Jan to 31 August 2022.</p>  <p>The Back to Education Allowance scheme (BTEA) is an educational opportunities scheme for customers in receipt of certain social welfare payments wishing to pursue second or third level courses of education, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions.  My Department&rsquo;s Employment Personal Advisers process all allocations for this scheme and this will remain the case.  Any decision in relation to BTEA is not based on attendance nor does it require attendance at a Local Employment Service or Job Club.  Any customer wishing to avail of the scheme should contact their local Intreo Centre.</p>  <p>  As the Public Employment Service, Intreo offers support to all individuals who require advice and access to employment services.  This remains the case whether the person is availing of other services of my Department or not.  There are sufficient resources in Intreo and other Intreo Partner services to deliver services to any person who requires them. </p></reply>

A private water supply provides water to one house and is often a well.</p>  <p>  If the person concerned has exhausted all other options for resolving the matter and can confirm that there is no financial assistance available from another Government Department or Agency, it is open to her to make an ENP application.  </p>  <p>  An application for assistance can be made by completing a SWA1 form, which is widely available.  This form can be downloaded at www.gov.ie and is available at all Intreo Centres and Branch Offices.  It can also now be requested by emailing cwsforms@welfare.ie  or by calling the CWS national phoneline at 0818 60 70 80.  The completed application form and supporting documentation can be posted or dropped into the Intreo Centre where it will be processed promptly.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.  </p>  <p>  A budget of &euro;68.1 million has been provided for the scheme in 2022.  </p>  <p>  In recent years entry to the school meals programme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the programme.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provided for the hot school meals to be extended from January 2022 to the remaining 81 DEIS schools that had expressed an interest in the programme but which were not yet participating.  As a result, the number of children in receipt of the hot school meal in June 2022 was 54,266.  The full year cost for hot school meals for 54,266 children is &euro;28m.</p>  <p>  In March 2022, the Minister for Education announced an extension of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in School to an additional 273 primary and 37 post-primary schools from September 2022.</p>  <p>  I have recently announced that the provision of the hot school meal option will be extended to all new DEIS primary schools and the cold lunch option to all new DEIS secondary schools at a full year cost of &euro;26m and benefitting some 60,000 children.  However, as 31 of these schools are already in receipt of some funding, the additional cost of providing these options is &euro;23.5m in a full year, with the first-year cost from September to December of &euro;9.5m.</p>  <p>  There are 444 DEIS schools not receiving the hot school meal.  The full year cost to provide a hot school meal to these 63,260 remaining DEIS children is &euro;33m.  However, as 402 of these schools are already receiving the cold lunch, the additional cost of providing a hot school meal is &euro;20m, with the first-year cost from September to December of &euro;8m.</p>  <p>  I am committed to continuing to grow the hot school meals element of the school meals programme for DEIS schools and building further on the significant extension announced.  In this regard, I have commissioned an evaluation of the school meals programme to be undertaken in 2022 to inform future policy decisions on the scheme. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The income thresholds were also increased to ensure that the increases in weekly social protection payments rates introduced in Budget 2022 will not negatively impact on an individual&rsquo;s entitlement to the allowance.</p><p>Any further changes to the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary and operational context and within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements. </p><p>Applications which fall outside the normal rules of the scheme may be considered for an additional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme by the Community Welfare Service (CWS).  </p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local Community Welfare Service.

In that way, it complements data produced from other analyses such as the Survey on Income and Living Conditions produced by the Central Statistics Office. </p><p>The work of the Vincentians also highlights issues that may be addressed with improvements in services.  In this regard, improved services, such as the extension of GP visit cards for children and the affordable childcare scheme can result in significant reductions in the minimum income standards needed by households.</p><p>Bringing weekly social welfare rates in line with the MESL would entail:</p><p>-  increasing the maximum personal working age rate to &euro;260.  There would be no proportionate increase in the current rate for Qualified Adults in order to meet the MESL.  This increase would cost &euro;1,745.8m in a full year;</p><p>-  raising the Qualified Child Increase to &euro;86 for children under 12, and &euro;133 for children aged 12 and over.  These increases would cost &euro;480.1m and &euro;493.2m respectively in a full year.</p><p>Older couple household type generally show income adequacy, as do single pensioners in urban areas.  While it is not possible at this time to provide an estimate of providing an increase for single pensioners living in rural areas only, the estimated cost of an increase to bring the rates in line with the MESL for all pensioners in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance is &euro;154m for recipients of non-contributory pensions and &euro;668m for contributory pensions.</p><p>The total cost of these measures is &euro;3.5 billion in a full year.</p><p>The estimated cost for 14 weeks is &euro;953.4m.</p><p>The estimated cost of increasing working age payments to &euro;260 is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme</th>       <th>Full year cost</th>       <th>14 week cost (27 September to 31 December 2022)</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Social Insurance Schemes</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Widow/er's or Surviving Civil Partner's (Con) Pension</td>       <td>69.2</td>       <td>18.6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deserted Wife's Benefit</td>       <td>5.4</td>       <td>1.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Invalidity Pension</td>       <td>141.3</td>       <td>38.0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Partial Capacity Benefit</td>       <td>5.0</td>       <td>1.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Guardian's Payment (Contributory)</td>       <td>4.3</td>       <td>1.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Death Benefit Pension</td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Disablement Pension</td>       <td>5.2</td>       <td>1.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Illness Benefit</td>       <td>131.2</td>       <td>35.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Injury Benefit</td>       <td>1.9</td>       <td>0.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Incapacity Supplement</td>       <td>2.1</td>       <td>0.6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td>       <td>112.7</td>       <td>30.3</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Benefit (Self-Employed)</td>       <td>4.1</td>       <td>1.1</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carer's Benefit</td>       <td>6.6</td>       <td>1.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Health and Safety Benefit</td>       <td>0.1</td>       <td>0.0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Maternity &amp;amp; Adoptive Benefit </td>       <td>10.6</td>       <td>2.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Paternity &amp;amp; Parent's Benefit </td>       <td>3.0</td>       <td>0.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Social Assistance Schemes</td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Blind Person's Pension</td>       <td>2.8</td>       <td>0.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Widow/ers or Surviving Civil Partner's (Non-Con) Pension</td>       <td>3.2</td>       <td>0.9</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Deserted Wife's Allowance </td>       <td>0.2</td>       <td>0.0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>One-Parent Family Payment</td>       <td>107.1</td>       <td>28.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carer's Allowance</td>       <td>96.4</td>       <td>26.0</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Half Rate Carer's Allowance </td>       <td>24.3</td>       <td>6.6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory)</td>       <td>2.0</td>       <td>0.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jobseeker's Allowance Max Rate</td>       <td>346.2</td>       <td>93.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>JA age 18 to 24</td>       <td>99.5</td>       <td>26.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Disability Allowance</td>       <td>424.9</td>       <td>114.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Farm Assist</td>       <td>12.7</td>       <td>3.4</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Employment Support Schemes  (BTWA &amp;amp; BTEA)</td>       <td>35.7</td>       <td>9.6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Employment/Internship Schemes (CE, T&uacute;s, RSS etc.)</td>       <td>50.1</td>       <td>13.5</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</td>       <td>37.9</td>       <td>10.2</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTAL</td>       <td>1,745.8</td>       <td>470.0</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><i>*Rounding may affect totals</i></p><p>These costings are based on the estimated number of recipients in 2022 and are subject to change in light of emerging trends and subsequent revision of the estimated number of recipients. </p></reply>

This includes the launch of a dedicated webpage, which went live in February 2022. This webpage allow all members of the public to find updates on the progress being made in implementing the White Paper.</p></reply>

I will also be requesting that my officials meet with the corresponding organisation to discuss the matters further.</p>  <p>  The review which the correspondent references noted the considerable success of the NCS in reaching those most in need. As the correspondent notes the review also reflects certain concerns particularly that it may present challenges for some families and for some providers serving disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  It is however quite incorrect to say that "in November 2019 the targeted funding for disadvantage was closed to children". The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children.</p>  <p>  The subsidies on the older schemes were grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements.  It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty traps, some of which were associated with the older ELC/SAC schemes. Both the older schemes and the NCS contained universal and targeted elements. As a point of fact the proportion of families on the targeted schemes vs universal on NCS is more favourable than on the older schemes.</p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof. It also designed to assist people in exiting the poverty trap, elements of which were inherent in the legacy schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to consult extensively with stakeholders on the development of NCS, through the Partnership for the Public Good report and the 12 month review of the NCS. The reviews noted the considerable success of the NCS in reaching those most in need. However, the report also highlights the same issues raised in the correspondence, particularly that it may present challenges for some families and for some providers serving disadvantaged communities. Findings which I have already begun to act on in Budget 2022, specifically:</p>  <p>  -  An extension to the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefitting up to 40,000 children.</p>  <p>  -  An end to the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours from spring 2022, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.</p>  <p>  Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. A number of safeguards have been put in place to ensure no unintended outcomes of Core Funding including a funding guarantee and a Sustainability Fund which is open to services.</p>  <p>  Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance. </p>  <p>  Once Core Funding is embedded and changes to existing programmes take effect (ECCE and NCS), my Department will progress the development of the Tackling Disadvantage funding and support. Informed by recommendations in Partnership for the Public Good, services will be provided with a proportionate mix of universal and targeted supports to support children and families accessing their services who are experiencing disadvantage. </p>  <p>  This Government agreed on 31 May to the publication of the National Action Plan and for its submission to the EU Commission. The publication of the Plan is an important first step in the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee which clearly intersects with the Tackling Disadvantage response. Identifying the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children and young people will be a particular focus of our work in the coming months, in order to progress matters.</p></reply>

To enable this, a child must now have turned 2 years and 8 months on or before the 31st August of a given programme year in order to be eligible (and cannot turn 5 years and 6 months during the programme year). . This change was based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory requirements for early learning and care.</p>  <p>  There is no situation in which a child is only entitled to one year of the ECCE programme and the current arrangements ensure that all children have the same entitlement, unlike an earlier multiple age entry point system. It should also be noted that whilst there is one point at which the child becomes eligible, eligible children can enter the ECCE programme at any time during the 2 year cycle.</p>  <p>  I would also highlight the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) provides financial support to help with early learning and childcare costs. There are two types of subsidy for children over 6 months of age:</p>  <p>  - A universal subsidy for children under 3. Children over 3 who have not yet qualified for the ECCE programme are also eligible. It is not means tested. From September 2022, this subsidy will be extended to children of all ages up to 15.</p>  <p>  - An income-assessed subsidy for children up to 15. It is means tested.</p>  <p>  I would note that my Department will shortly commence a 12 month review of the ECCE programme which will consider whether the programme is meeting its objectives and subject to the findings consider whether any changes need to be made. As part of this review, there will be wide stakeholder engagement, which will include an opportunity for parents to offer their views on matters such as this. The concerns raised in this PQ will be considered in that review.</p></reply>

This is the approach set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Ireland ratified in 2018.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to make further advances towards meeting the needs of people with autism in Ireland. It is for this reason that I have prioritised the development of a national Autism Innovation Strategy. </p>  <p>  This strategy will identify key areas where individuals with autism face particular challenges and barriers, in order to accelerate our journey towards being a more autism-inclusive and neurodiverse-friendly society.</p>  <p>  The Autism Innovation Strategy will complement our existing national disability strategies, which are designed to support people with disabilities in all aspects of their lives. These are the National Disability Inclusion Strategy and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the Government's commitment for action on autism, it is important to note that neurodiverse persons already are encompassed by the supports provided in broader disability national strategies and plans. The Autism Innovation Strategy will be developed so as to sit harmoniously with wider disability strategies, and in a manner that ensures the fair distribution of supports. </p>  <p>  The existing disability strategies are already cognisant of intersectional issues. Given the interlinkages between disability equality policy and other equality areas such as gender, LGBTQIA+, ethnic minority and Traveller rights, my officials coordinate with a wide range of colleagues across the Department, other Government Departments/Agencies and external stakeholders to ensure that policy and strategy development takes account of the specific needs of different groups in society, on an explicitly intersectional basis.</p>  <p>  A review of Ireland's national equality strategies - the Migrant Integration Strategy, the National Strategy for Women and Girls and the National Traveller &amp;amp; Roma Inclusion Strategy - is currently underway and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The evaluation process will consider how to address the issue of intersectionality in a more coherent way.  Successor strategies will look to design and implement programmes and measures to address intersectional discrimination in partnership with NGOs and communities.</p></reply>

The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. </p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. </p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to relative foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments.  In considering any additional payment or enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.</p>  <p>  Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the fostering allowance. Enhanced allowances for relative foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child.</p>  <p>  Tusla does not differentiate between relative foster carers and general foster carers in relation to financial supports for children in foster care.</p></reply>

This can be seen in 2020/21 for example where adding together Cork City and Cork County would give you a total of 12,605, however the total number of unique children across Cork is actually 12,572. This would indicate that there is a small number of children who had a registration in both city and county in 2020/21.</p><p>My Department, in conjunction with Pobal, reviews ECCE capacity on an ongoing basis and works closely with the local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) in this regard.</p><p>In April of this year, City/County Childcare Committees (CCC) undertook a nationwide survey of capacity in early learning and childcare services. This survey was undertaken as part of the Action Plan put in place by my Department to respond to the early learning and childcare needs of Ukrainian children and their families. This survey was followed in May by the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Survey that is undertaken by Pobal. This will allow for more detailed information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be gathered for the Annual Early Years Sector Profile Report.</p><p>Preliminary analysis of the latest data captured by CCCs and Pobal reveal a drop in vacancy rates across the country &ndash; with the national vacancy rate now averaging at 13%.</p><p>Furthermore, vacancy rate for ECCE only places for Cork city is 13% and ECCE only places Cork county 14%.</p></reply>

Its goal is to empower pre-school providers to deliver an inclusive pre-school experience, ensuring that every eligible child can meaningfully participate in the ECCE Programme and reap the benefits of high quality early learning and care. Eligibility for AIM supports is linked to participation in the universal ECCE pre-school programme.</p>  <p>  AIM supports are grouped into universal or targeted. Universal supports are designed to create a more inclusive culture in early learning and care settings, through training courses and qualifications for staff. Where universal supports are not enough to meet the needs of an individual child, targeted supports are available to ensure the child can meaningfully participate in pre-school.</p>  <p>  AIM Early Years Specialists are available to work with parents and pre-school providers to develop an inclusive learning environment for children. Applying for AIM educational advice and mentoring is very simple.  Parents are advised to speak with their pre-school provider who will make an application for targeted supports in collaboration with the parent. The pre-school will submit this application to Better Start through the Early Years Hive portal on the parent&rsquo;s behalf.</p>  <p>  AIM level 6 provides a range of services in collaboration with the HSE under therapeutic supports. Targeted services are individualised and could include; behaviour support plans, classes, equipment, professional advice or pre-school visits. Supports may be provided through a Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Team (CDNT), HSE Disability Service, HSE funded Voluntary Organisation or HSE Primary Care Services.</p>  <p>  The HSE offer speech and language therapy services, in the public health service, free of charge for children with a disability. Speech and language therapists (SLTs) will show parents ways to support their child&rsquo;s communication or feeding skills. They assess the child&rsquo;s needs, set short and long-term goals and link with other relevant services. For information on services in your area you can contact your Local Health Office. See list of Local Health Offices at the link below.</p>  <p>  www.hse.ie/eng/services/list/1/lho/.</p>  <p>  If a parent in partnership with the provider, submit an application for AIM support and in that application have stated that the child is already receiving supports from speech and language, the Early Years Specialist would link in with the relevant health professional. They would do this to identify what strategies/supports can be implemented in the pre-school setting by the educators.</p>  <p>  AIM Level 7 support provides additional funding to pre-schools who have a child requiring extra support. Providers can use this funding either to reduce the adult-to-child ration in the pre-school room or to fund an extra staff member as a shared resource with other children in the ECCE setting. This is all centred on supporting the pre-school leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.</p>  <p>  One of the commitments in First 5 was to undertake an end of Three-Year Evaluation of AIM. The evaluation is now complete and the final report is due to be published in Quarter 3 of this year. Subject to evaluation findings and other relevant developments, we will be considering enhancements to, and/or extension of, AIM to, for example, all ELC services, all school-age childcare services and to children with additional needs other than a disability. This will include consideration of issues raised with regard to children with ASD and potential measures to enhance provision.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education also provides specialist pre-school services including autism-specific pre-school services for children who are ECCE eligible, which include:</p>  <p>  -  Early Intervention Classes attached to primary schools for autistic children aged three and over.</p>  <p>  -  A Home Tuition Scheme which provides funding towards 10 hours per week tuition for children under 3 years of age and 20 hours per week for children over 3 years of age who cannot secure a placement in an early intervention class. Subject to conditions, parents are free to use the grant to engage tutors to deliver tuition in their home or pre-school providers to deliver tuition in a group/pre-school setting. Such arrangements are essentially between the parents and the relevant provider.</p>  <p>  More information is available at: www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-education/.</p></reply>

I will also be requesting that my officials meet with the corresponding organisation to discuss the matters further.</p>  <p>  The review which the correspondent references noted the considerable success of the NCS in reaching those most in need. As the correspondent notes the review also reflects certain concerns particularly that it may present challenges for some families and for some providers serving disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  It is however quite incorrect to say that "in November 2019 the targeted funding for disadvantage was closed to children". The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children.</p>  <p>  The subsidies on the older schemes were grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements.  It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty traps, some of which were associated with the older ELC/SAC schemes. Both the older schemes and the NCS contained universal and targeted elements. As a point of fact the proportion of families on the targeted schemes vs universal on NCS is more favourable than on the older schemes.</p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof. It also designed to assist people in exiting the poverty trap, elements of which were inherent in the legacy schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to consult extensively with stakeholders on the development of NCS, through the Partnership for the Public Good report and the 12 month review of the NCS. The reviews noted the considerable success of the NCS in reaching those most in need. However, the report also highlights the same issues raised in the correspondence, particularly that it may present challenges for some families and for some providers serving disadvantaged communities. Findings which I have already begun to act on in Budget 2022, specifically:</p>  <p>  -  An extension to the NCS universal subsidy to all children under 15 from September 2022, benefitting up to 40,000 children.</p>  <p>  -  An end to the practice of deducting hours spent in pre-school or school from the entitlement to NCS subsidised hours from spring 2022, benefitting an estimated 5,000 children from low income families.</p>  <p>  Core Funding will contribute to services&rsquo; sustainability and will significantly increase income for the overwhelming majority of services and provide greater funding stability. A number of safeguards have been put in place to ensure no unintended outcomes of Core Funding including a funding guarantee and a Sustainability Fund which is open to services.</p>  <p>  Core Funding will give providers a stable income source based on the nature of the service they deliver. A provider&rsquo;s income will now consist of Core Funding, NCS and ECCE subsidies, and parental fees. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity means that services will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children&rsquo;s attendance. </p>  <p>  Once Core Funding is embedded and changes to existing programmes take effect (ECCE and NCS), my Department will progress the development of the Tackling Disadvantage funding and support. Informed by recommendations in Partnership for the Public Good, services will be provided with a proportionate mix of universal and targeted supports to support children and families accessing their services who are experiencing disadvantage. </p>  <p>  This Government agreed on 31 May to the publication of the National Action Plan and for its submission to the EU Commission. The publication of the Plan is an important first step in the implementation of the EU Child Guarantee which clearly intersects with the Tackling Disadvantage response. Identifying the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children and young people will be a particular focus of our work in the coming months, in order to progress matters.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to eligible students attending an approved full-time course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.</p>  <p>  As per Article 15(10)(c ) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021, grant aid for postgraduate study shall be limited to a maximum of four years in total and account is taken of all previous attendance and attainment at postgraduate level when considering grant aid entitlement for postgraduate study, regardless of whether a person previously received a grant or not.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific application, I have been advised by my officials that the student outlined by the Deputy submitted an application to SUSI in September 2021 for the 2021/2022 academic year for year 2 of a Level 10 postgraduate course. According to information provided by the student on the application form and through information sharing with the Higher Education Authority (HEA) it was determined that the student had previous postgraduate academic attendance and attainment which exceeded the maximum period of study allowed to be eligible for grant assistance under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme 2021 and a letter of ineligibility was issued. In a call to the SUSI Support Desk on 6th October 2021, the student was advised of the appeals process. During subsequent calls to the SUSI Support Desk on 16th December 2021 and 31st January 2022, the student was advised to request an internal review if there was any additional or new information regarding the application. The student did not avail of the right to appeal to SUSI within the required timeframe and to date no request for an internal review has been received.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may also be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Construction related programmes include electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery, plastering, painting and decorating and the recently launched scaffolding apprenticeship. Apprenticeships are also in development in roofing and cladding (L5) and advanced quantity surveyor (L9).</p>  <p>  Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) is used to describe a range of offsite manufacturing and onsite techniques that provide alternatives to traditional house building. Typical MMC systems include timber frame, steel frame, and precast concrete. The Construction Industry Federation&rsquo;s report on Modern Methods of Construction can be found here: www.cif.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1271-CIF-Modern-Methods-of-Construction-Report-v4.pdf.</p>  <p>  Currently there is no MMC statutory apprenticeship but rather several apprenticeships related to the construction sector would have similar content embedded in the programmes. The costs of apprenticeships are dependent on several variables including content, duration and delivery methodology.  As there is currently no MMC apprenticeship programme and recognising these variables, it is not possible to provide any indicative costings.</p></reply>

The researchers will work in partnership with TRICALS, an independent consortium of leading ALS experts, patients and patient advocacy groups across Europe.  National and international industry partners and charities including patient organisations are also actively participating.</p>  <p>  The research is supported by Science Foundation Ireland through an investment of &euro;5 million, which will be leveraged with an additional &euro;5 million from industry partners.</p>  <p>  Precision ALS will provide an innovative and interactive platform for all clinical research in ALS across Europe that will then harness AI to analyse large amounts of data. As the largest international multimodal dataset aimed at precision medicine for this condition, Precision ALS will address the issues with gathering new data at scale in a timely and cost-effective manner across multiple international sites to present that data in real time to clinical scientists.</p>  <p>  Irish researchers, along with their European collaborators in ALS/MND, have shown that the disease is caused by variable combinations of faulty genes that likely interact with lifestyle and environment.  Using big data analysis, Precision ALS will provide the technology to improve our understanding of how these factors impact the development of the disease. This in turn will inform which treatments will work for each individual, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>  <p>  Precision ALS is a unique programme that brings together Clinicians, Computer Scientists, Information Engineers, Technologists, and Data Scientists. The researchers will work together with a number of companies including Biogen, Novartis, Takeda, IQVIA, Roche and Accenture to generate a sustainable precision medicine-based approach towards new drug development that will have many benefits including better clinical outcomes for patients and reducing the economic cost of these diseases.</p>  <p>  On completion, Precision ALS will be a first-in-kind modular transferable pan-European ICT framework for ALS that can be easily adapted to other diseases that face similar precision medicine-related challenges.</p>  <p>  This research project began in December 2021 and will run for 48 months.</p></reply>

In recent decades our universities, institutes of technology, and colleges have been transformed, from predominantly national institutions catering primarily for school-leavers, to internationally oriented institutions engaged with an increasingly diverse student body, of all ages, backgrounds and gender identities. It is therefore key, for the further development and internationalisation of the sector, that we stamp out all forms of racism within our HEIs and take a proactive approach to encouraging further diversity and inclusion in the higher education sector.</p>  <p>  In this regard, the HEA conducted a National Race Equality Survey of all HEIs last year which was published in October 2021. The aim of the survey was to capture the lived experience of HEI staff in relation to race equality. For the purpose of the survey, race equality was defined as &lsquo;equal representation, equal experiences and equal outcomes of staff from minority ethnic groups.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  The survey was conducted in late 2020/early 2021 and all staff working in HEIs in the Republic of Ireland &ndash; regardless of ethnic background or nationality &ndash; were invited to participate. A total of 3,323 staff, approximately 10% of the total number of HEI staff nationally, in Irish HEIs responded to the survey.</p>  <p>  The recommendations made in the report were across eight thematic areas: supporting diversity in staff; supporting diversity in student recruitment; making race/equality policies transparent; reporting mechanisms; awareness and training; fostering diversity in HEIs; leadership; and data collection. The survey findings provide an evidence base which will facilitate a more proactive policy response to issues of racism in our HEIs. </p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have comprehensive policies to tackle harassment on campuses and reporting mechanisms for the same. These policies and procedures also cover incidents of racist discrimination and harassment. </p>  <p>  Last year, the Irish Universities Association introduced an online training programme called &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s Talk About Race in the Higher Education Sector&rsquo;. This course, which is available to both staff and students, is a key initiative in building the intercultural understanding and competence required to achieve systemic change within our HEIs. This training programme complements the existing race awareness and education activities of the universities, as well as other specific initiatives, such as curriculum reviews, Universities of Sanctuary initiatives, and intercultural events alongside new mechanisms for building cultures of dignity and respect which build a sense of inclusion for all members of university communities.</p>  <p>  Funding has also been provided to develop the anonymous Speak Out reporting tool through which students can anonymously report incidents of harassment, including racist harassment. The online platform directs users towards support services and formal reporting processes.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Anti-Racism Committee; to develop tertiary education actions for the new National Action Plan Against Racism which my colleague Minister O&rsquo;Gorman will be publishing shortly.</p></reply>

For the majority of apprenticeships, the rate of pay is agreed between the apprentice and the employer. For the 25 craft apprenticeship programmes, the rates of pay applying under the employment contract are either agreed within the relevant sector, or are set out in legally binding Sectoral Employment Orders recommended by the Labour Court. </p>  <p>  On that basis any review of those rates currently payable is a matter for negotiation and agreement under the appropriate industrial relations structures in place and it is not appropriate for there to be political involvement in these independent structures. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that, while rates do vary between occupations and sectors, in all cases craft apprenticeship rates are expressed as a proportion of a qualified rate, increasing yearly from 33% of the qualified rate in year one to 90% in year four. Periods of off-the-job training are funded from the National Training Fund with payments of the agreed rate made directly to craft apprentices by the education and training boards during this time.</p>  <p>  However, it is also important to note that as employees, eligible apprentices are also entitled to access general employment supports through the social welfare system. This option is open to any employee, apprentice or not, who finds themselves in difficulty. There are allowances paid to apprentices and we are examining these in the context of the upcoming Estimates process.</p></reply>

The majority of PhD students are in receipt of grants from either the Irish Research Council, Science Foundation Ireland, other research funders, as well as institutional funding.</p><p>My Department is monitoring the issue of stipends, in the context of the resources available to the competitive research funding agencies under the aegis of my Department  and the competing needs to which they can be allocated. In that regard, I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding to the IRC in 2021 to enable it to increase postgraduate scholarship by &euro;2,500 per annum, or 16%, from &euro;16,000 to &euro;18,500. This was made effective from 1 January 2021 and, together with an increase to funding for postdoctoral salaries, benefited close to 1,300 early-career researchers in the system. The move also aligned the stipend level for both agencies within my Department, i.e. the IRC and SFI.</p><p>Under the Student Grant Scheme 2021, a student in receipt of a postgraduate research award where the stipend portion of the award does not exceed &euro;18,500 may apply to the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) for financial assistance under the Student Grant Scheme 2021</p><p>The recently announced Innovate for Ireland initiative, is a partnership between government and industry to recruit and retain research talent. It will offer an attractive package, including a stipend of &euro;28,000, to be awarded through the programme to PhD students. This has been benchmarked against similar scholarship programmes internationally. The programme will be managed through Science Foundation Ireland, in partnership with the Irish Research Council and the Health Research Board.</p><p>Other research funders in the system include the Health Research Board, Teagasc etc. There are also typically a number of PhDs funded through European Programmes and individual HEI schemes.</p><p>My Department allocates recurrent funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to HEA designated higher education institutions. The HEA allocates this funding as a block grant to the institutions and as autonomous bodies, the internal disbursement of this funding, including stipend funding, is a matter for the individual institution.</p></reply>

This modular accommodation is to address immediate accommodation needs. This development will enable the delivery of a range of PLC programmes, including but not limited to: music production, science, beauty, sports, animal care, sports therapy and general skills programmes. It will also provide canteen and sports facilities and office space. Works are well advanced on the delivery of this project for the new academic year.</p></reply>

The further development and mainstreaming of apprenticeship in Ireland through the creation of a single unified apprenticeship system has a key role to play in meeting Ireland's skill needs in a manner that presents a valued proposition for apprentices and employers alike. Despite the challenges of Covid, significant progress has been made to date;</p><p>-  The new employer grant of &euro;2,000 will encourage more employers to engage with a wider range of apprenticeships and help to encourage the development of new programmes. It also means that, for the first time, all employers will receive a level of support towards the cost of apprentice training.</p><p>-  The existing bursary for employers of female craft apprentices has been extended to all apprenticeships with over 80% representation of a single gender,</p><p>-  Two new governance structures have been put in place: the National Apprenticeship Office (NAO) will deliver practical supports and information for employers and apprentices seeking to engage with apprenticeship. The National Apprenticeship Alliance (NAA) brings together a wealth of knowledge and first-hand, practical experience from the worlds of education providers, learners, industry partners and trade unions, to help steer the evolution of the system.</p><p>-  Over 100 civil and public service organisations have recently been surveyed for their views on apprenticeship and their skills needs. These insights will form the basis of the Public Service Apprenticeship Recruitment Plan, which is currently under development.</p><p>-  With visits to apprenticeship.ie directly from CAO/options page up to over 32,000 since November 2021, the inclusion of information on apprenticeship as part of the CAO website is expected to make a significant contribution to highlighting the range of learning and qualification options for school leavers, providing learning options both for students who learn by doing as well as vocational and academic routes to a qualification.</p><p>-  Information sessions and briefings were completed with guidance counsellors and others as part of the CAO initiative October-November 2021. A next phase of promotion is planned with guidance counsellors in 2022 and has been added to the Generation Apprenticeship campaigns.</p><p>-  Eight new apprenticeship programmes were launched over 2020 and 2021, despite the pandemic; Arboriculture, Equipment Systems Engineer, Healthcare Assistant, Principal Engineer &ndash; Professional Doctorate, Recruitment Executive, Sales, Scaffolding , Supply Chain Associate. In 2022 more were added - Bar Manager, Wind Turbine Maintenance, and Transport Operations &amp;amp; Commercial Driving. Programme development has been approved for progression in areas such as farming, horticulture, finance, manufacturing, construction, cybersecurity and ICT, and a number of others at the initial proposal stage.</p><p>The increased diversity of new apprenticeships, many of which have off-the-job training delivered through online or blended learning provides a significant opportunity for widening of access to apprenticeship for rural businesses and learners. In addition, Education and Training Boards, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities are spread throughout the country and play a very important role in ensuring apprenticeship provision has a strong regional dimension.</p><p>Teagasc received approval from the Apprenticeship Council (now the National Apprenticeship Alliance) to develop 5 apprenticeships; Farm Technician (Level 6), Farm Manager (Level 7), Sportsturf Management (Level 6), Horticulture (Level 6) and Stud Farm Assistant Management (Level 7). </p><p>Current legislation in relation to apprenticeship (The Industrial Training Act, 1967 as amended) prohibits statutory apprenticeships in an area of agriculture, horticulture or fishing, which is an activity of primary production, which impacts the Farm Technician, Farm Manager and Horticulture programmes. An amendment to the Act is due to be progressed alongside the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022. </p><p>Development work on the 5 apprenticeship programmes is ongoing and programme documentation will be submitted to QQI shortly to commence the validation process. Pending approval by QQI and the removal of the legislative restriction on areas of primary production it is aimed to have these apprenticeships launched by year end. Further details of the programmes, including locations where the training will be provided, will be available once the validation and legislative processes are finalised.</p></reply>

Prior to this, they are classified as a dependent on their parent's permission. A re-entry visa was therefore required for children under 16 if travelling on a passport issued by a visa required country.</p>  <p>  The re-entry visa requirements for children under 16 have been suspended with immediate effect and until further notice. Processing of these applications requires customers to submit their passports. There is an extremely high demand from customers wishing to travel during the summer months.

The Strategy aims to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s capabilities to promote equality, embrace diversity and foster inclusion, not only in our daily interactions and activities as colleagues, but also in the design and delivery of the services that we provide to the public.</p>  <p>  To this end, the EDI Strategy prioritises three areas of focus for strategic impact: </p>  <p>  -  achieve better policy outcomes and improve the accessibility and quality of our services;</p>  <p>  -  support the development of a skilled and diverse workforce which is reflective of the diversity within our population / country;</p>  <p>  -  build and embed a workplace culture which facilitates, supports and encourages contributions from all</p>  <p>  Each of these strategic outcomes are underpinned by a number of actions which the Department will implement over the life of the EDI Strategy. These actions will be integrated into our business plans including adding appropriate indicators and monitored along with other organisation goals and strategic priorities. </p>  <p>  For example, as part of our objective to support the development of a skilled and diverse workforce, training on a range of EDI related areas such as disability awareness, intercultural relations, managing inclusivity will be rolled out and embedded in training programmes and induction. Staff in customer facing roles will also receive training on communication barriers and hidden disabilities through the JAM card initiative.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s EDI and Public Sector Duty Committee meet three times a year to monitor the implementation of this EDI Strategy. The monitoring process also involves establishing a mechanism to engage with colleagues with lived experience to ensure we are our living up to the aspirations communicated in the Strategy. Over the lifetime of the strategy, there will also be ongoing engagement with relevant external groups and stakeholders. The EDI and PSD Committee will set a timeline for consultation with colleagues with lived experience and external parties at the next meeting, which is due to be held in September 2022.</p></reply>

It is an ambitious five-year programme of reform to achieve a society which does not accept DSGBV or the attitudes which underpin it.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the Government&rsquo;s commitment to make this the most ambitious Strategy to date, and in particular to make a real impact on the provision of refuge units and other associated support services, will require additional expenditure. </p>  <p>  The overall cost of implementing the entire Strategy is estimated to be in the region of &euro;363m.</p>  <p>  I plan to deliver 141 new units of refuge accommodation on a phased basis at a capital cost estimated at &euro;70.5m and running costs of &euro;33m over the lifetime of the strategy.</p>  <p>  Other additional running and development costs (e.g. project management and capacity building supports, current costs for provision of step down facilities and safe homes) are estimated to cost some &euro;10m over the five-year life time of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  These figures are in addition to Tusla&rsquo;s 2022 current funding allocation of &euro;30m per annum for refuges, rape crisis centres and associated helpline services.  This equates to &euro;150m over the lifetime of the Strategy.  </p>  <p>  The Strategy will provide enhanced support for victims within trial and other criminal justice processes, victim awareness and trauma-informed training for front-line and other staff and legal professionals, legal aid for victims, national awareness campaigns and other communications campaigns, and an expansion of existing perpetrator programmes to create a national programme of interventions for men who have been violent. These costs will come to some &euro;74m over the lifetime of the Strategy, of which some &euro;51m is already, on the basis of the 2022 allocations, provided for in my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</p>  <p>  The establishment and running costs of the DSGBV Agency are estimated at &euro;3.5m in a full year or some &euro;11.5m in total over the lifetime of the Strategy.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Garda Commissioner has advised that the deployment of Body Worn Cameras (BWC) can play a significant role in the management of domestic violence situations and in gathering evidence for subsequent use in prosecutions.  Accordingly, an estimate of &euro;14m has been included to cover the cost of procuring and deploying this equipment.</p></reply>

No. 230 of 2018), the labour market access permission issued by my Department has had a very positive impact for international protection applicants and employers alike. Over 8,000 permissions have been granted to date. </p>  <p>  This permission gives eligible applicants the opportunity to work and helps them to integrate into Irish society while providing for themselves and their families outside of the State&rsquo;s directly provided services and supports. It also helps people to plan and prepare for their future in Ireland if they receive a positive decision on their application for international protection.</p>  <p>  The Regulations provide access to both employment and self-employment for any applicant who has not received a first instance decision within six months of making their international protection application, provided that this situation cannot be attributed, or attributed in part, to the applicant. </p>  <p>  Labour market access permission is valid for 12 months from the date of issue and may be renewed until a final decision is made on the person's international protection application. The LMA8 Information booklet provides a summary of the Labour Market Access process for employers. The Labour Market Access Unit of my Department recommends that employers familiarise themselves with the terms and conditions of the permission before employing permission holders. The booklet can be accessed on my Department's immigration website at the following link: www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/form-LMA8.pdf.</p>  <p>  An applicant&rsquo;s legal permission to temporarily reside in the State is provided for under the International Protection Act 2015. People  who make an application under the Act are given a temporary residence card (TRC or blue card) which is proof of their permission to reside in the State. The TRC can be renewed and only becomes invalid when a person's permission to enter and reside in the State (Ireland) as a protection applicant, ceases to be valid. </p>  <p>  There are no plans by my Department to make any changes regarding the legal basis for an applicant&rsquo;s permission to reside in the State under the International Protection Act 2015. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that where the Ministerial Decisions Unit of my Department grants an international protection status or a grant of permission to remain to an applicant they are then entitled to immediately register an immigration permission on a Stamp 4 basis which allows a person to seek employment without the requirement to hold an employment permit and is renewable. </p>  <p>  Finally, I can confirm for the Deputy that my Department is currently conducting a qualitative study of the experiences of international protection applicants in accessing the labour market, which is due to be completed by Q3 2022.</p></reply>

An appeal of this decision was launched on 13 April 2021.</p>  <p>  Appeals for applications of this type are processed in the order in which they are received, to be fair to all applicants. While every effort is made to process these applications as soon as possible, processing times will vary having regard to the volume of appeals received, their complexity, the possible need for the visa office to seek further information in relation to certain appeals and the resources available to process them.</p>  <p>  All visa applicants are advised that the onus is on them to provide as much information in support of their application as they feel is necessary. Guidelines in this regard are posted on my Department's immigration website (www.irishimmigration.ie). When making their appeal, the applicant should take into account the reasons for refusal listed in the refusal letter. The appeal should include any further information or additional documentation they wish to have considered, and should be sent for the attention of the Visa Appeals Officer, in the relevant Visa Office, where the matter will be considered afresh. </p>  <p>  Full consideration will be given to the appeals received on behalf of the applicants, however the onus is on applicants to satisfy the Visa Officer that visas should be granted. Processing times and decisions at the Overseas Visa Offices can be checked at the webpage for the relevant office. </p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility (inisoireachtasmail@justice.ie), which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Abhaile is jointly coordinated and funded by my Department and the Department of Social Protection, under a Joint Steering Board and a Joint Working Group, which include the implementing bodies. The Service&rsquo;s implementing bodies are the Citizens Information Board (which includes the Money Advice and Budgeting Service), the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service.</p><p>The goal of Abhaile is to meet the Government&rsquo;s commitment to keeping people in their own homes. In providing legal aid for personal insolvency court reviews as part of Abhaile, the Government seeks to keep as many people in their homes as possible. Legal aid includes the services of a solicitor from the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s Abhaile Solicitors Panel and payment to the personal insolvency practitioner in respect of expenses that occur in making the section 115A application. Prior to 1 March 2019, the services of Junior Counsel were funded in all s115A applications. Since that date, the services of Counsel may be sought on a case by case basis, as is the case in other civil legal aid matters. </p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in 2021, the Oireachtas enacted the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2021, which I brought forward with the aim of ensuring access to the PIA review process by those whose debts occurred after 1 January 2015 and, in particular, those whose debts may have arisen as a result of the restrictions necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Schedule A in the attached document sets out in tabular format the amounts spent by the Legal Aid Board on solicitors, barristers and personal insolvency practitioners for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 in 2021 and in the year 2022 up until 30 June 2022.</p><p>Schedule B in the attached document sets out in tabular format the amount paid by the Legal Aid Board to each individual solicitor, barrister and personal insolvency practitioner for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 in 2021 and in the year 2022 up until 30 June 2022.</p><p>Schedule C in the attached document sets out in tabular format the total amounts incurred but not yet paid by the Legal Aid Board in connection with solicitors, barristers and personal insolvency practitioners for applications under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, as at 30 June 2022. </p><p>The Legal Aid Board informs me that it has recently changed its procedures to obtain the name of the solicitor/Counsel from the PIP at the outset of the case. However, this information has been recorded only for relatively recently started cases and not for historical cases and, therefore, the Board is unable to provide this information on an individualised basis.</p></reply>

Reforms will be developed with a supportive approach to businesses, and the interests of public health, consumers and communities will be central to implementation.</p>  <p>  Last November, I launched a wide-ranging consultation to seek the views of the public on the modernisation of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing laws. The consultation, which ran until 21 January this year, looked at how best to update the existing laws governing the sale and regulation of alcohol in Ireland. Members of the public, academics, sectoral groups, and representative organisations were invited to complete an online survey and/or make a written submission to my Department.</p>  <p>  There was a high level of response to the consultation, with in excess of 5,000 responses received. My Department is now reviewing these responses to ensure the reform of the legislation takes account of and is informed by this engagement.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that, on 10 March, I hosted a consultation webinar and panel discussion event on the reform of the alcohol licensing laws to give an opportunity for further discussion of the issues of concern to stakeholders.</p>  <p>  That webinar can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s YouTube channel via the following link: youtube/0tMtKzd_9jA.</p>  <p>  It is intended to progress this legislation in the months ahead. Submissions from stakeholders will of course be carefully considered in the context of publication of the forthcoming Bill. Details of the proposed reform will be included in the General Scheme when published.</p></reply>

Prisoners may also avail of up to four video visits or a combination of both per month.</p>  <p>  Each prison has a dedicated telephone line for the public to make contact and book a visit appointment, these phone lines are manned during visiting hours. There is also an option for families to request a visit through the online request system, this is accessible through the Irish Prison Service website &ndash; visit a prison &ndash; request video call.</p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service have informed me that they recently received a small number of complaints from the public in relation to technical issues regarding the online service and steps have been taken to address these. </p>  <p>  Access to physical visits will continue to be monitored by the National Infection Control Team and Prison Management.  Information regarding visits is available on the Irish Prison Service website, www.irishprisons.ie. and social media platforms for families and friends. </p>  <p>  The Public Services Card is an accepted form of identification in use at Limerick, Midlands and Wheatfield Prisons.  Arrangements are being made to facilitate its use across all prisons by year end.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service are committed to the provision of safe, secure and humane custody for people who are sent to prison in this State. Covid-19 in a prison setting presents significant challenges for prison management in terms of controlling the spread of the virus amongst staff and prisoners.</p>  <p>  While the Irish Prison Service is continuing to re-open and unwind Covid-19 measures, there are still some restrictions in place given the environment of a prison and the vulnerability of some of the people within our prisons.  Currently the Irish Prison Service are not accepting prisoner property during visits.  </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that any remaining restrictions are kept under review by the Irish prison Service in light of the level of risk posed to prisons.</p></reply>

The division currently receives almost 1200 applications per month.</p>  <p>  For a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has unfortunately resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. The processing time for applications in 2021 was 24 months. It currently stands at 19 months for decisions issued in 2022, an almost 21% decrease.</p>  <p>  Last year, my Department made 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest level since 2015. For the first six months of 2022, 8149 citizenship decisions have been made with 7,193 certificates of naturalisation issued. This includes 1,005 minor applications who have also been issued with a decision on their application, in comparison to 868 in total for minors during 2021. </p>  <p>  The citizenship application process is reviewed on an ongoing basis to continually improve customer service quality. Feedback from applicants is taken on board and, as a result, a much more simplified, customer-focused and streamlined mechanism for applicants to provide their proofs of residence has recently been introduced. A scorecard was introduced to help applicants to complete their applications with greater certainty than before. A review of this is currently being undertaken and an updated version is due to be published in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  To further speed up the processing of applications, a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  Since the beginning of this year, new applicants for citizenship no longer have to submit their original passport with their application. Instead, they can provide a full colour copy of their entire passport, including the front and back covers. This change in practice is welcomed by our customers and is also freeing up valuable staff time that up to now has been engaged in returning passports to applicants.</p>  <p>  My Department hosted the first in-person citizenship ceremony since the pandemic on 20 June 2022 with 950 people receiving their certificate of naturalisation. Further ceremonies are planned for December, in Killarney.</p></reply>

The granting of an employment permit by DETE is not the sole determining factor as to whether a visa will subsequently be granted by my Department. These are two very distinct application processes with different checks and procedures in place in each respective Department. </p>  <p>  The processing times for visa decisions are published on the visa pages of each Visa Office and the relevant Embassy website. Applicants are advised to allow at least eight weeks for the processing of an employment visa and, in the vast majority of cases, the processing times are well within that timeframe.  </p>  <p>  As these applications are usually processed within a very short timeframe, statistics are not maintained by my Department in the manner requested by the Deputy. Currently, the average time taken to process an employment visa received in my Department's Visa Offices in Dublin and overseas is three weeks.</p>  <p>  The central concern in deciding on visa applications, as with all visa services worldwide, is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime while at the same time facilitating travel for those who meet the criteria.  Each visa application is therefore decided on its own merits taking all factors into account. </p></reply>

The Bureau has staff drawn from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (including Customs), the Department of Social Protection and my Department.</p>  <p>  The Bureau&rsquo;s remit is to target assets, wherever situated, which derive or are suspected to derive, directly or indirectly, from criminal conduct. The Bureau has been at the forefront of fighting organised crime in this jurisdiction &ndash; disrupting the activities of criminal gangs through the removal of their ill-gotten gains - and has been recognised as a world leader in asset investigations, tracing and forfeiture. </p>  <p>  Since its inception the Bureau has conducted investigations into individuals and Organised Criminal Groups including illegal Paramilitary Groups involved in various types of crime including illegal money-lending activities. These investigations are conducted in conjunction with and with the assistance of several other law enforcement agencies. The Bureau does not record statistics in relation to a specific crime type in any given area.  </p>  <p>  Work is also underway to consider how best to support CAB in its important work. Last year my Department completed a review which presented a number of recommendations. One which I am intending to pursue as a priority is reducing the timeframe for the making of a &lsquo;Disposal Order&rsquo;. The intention is to substantially reduce the statutory timeframe before a &lsquo;Disposal Order' can be made from seven years. Reducing this period would mean that those who generate criminal assets cannot benefit from them for extended periods.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I also launched the Community Safety Innovation Fund Scheme. The new fund will use money seized from the proceeds of crime to support investment in innovative community safety projects and is a fitting reflection of the successful work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau in identifying and seizing proceeds from criminal activity.</p>  <p>  The fund has an initial allocation of &euro;2 million under Budget 2022, and I expect this funding to increase in future.</p></reply>

As Operation Denton is an analytical review being carried out in another jurisdiction rather than a formal criminal investigation, in order to achieve the strong desire of myself, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Government to co-operate with Operation Denton to the maximum extent possible, it was necessary to obtain the advices of the Office of the Attorney General to confirm the available legal measures to facilitate Garda cooperation and the sharing of information.</p>  <p>  Following receipt of advices from the Attorney General, I sought and received Government approval on 21 June to create a dedicated cooperation mechanism, following which on 23 June I signed a directive under section 25(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act directing the identification and preparation for release of relevant records to Operation Denton. The directive under section 25 was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the law. </p>  <p>  In order to to facilitate the transfer of information to Operation Denton, I have today signed the Data Protection Act 1988 (Section 2B) Regulations 2022. </p>  <p>  The legal mechanism is therefore now in place for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to cooperate with Operation Denton.  The provision of any material relevant to the review in the possession of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy of my continuing commitment to supporting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in pursuing this work and in providing the greatest assistance possible.</p></reply>

This ensures that those who are found to be in need of protection in Ireland can receive it quickly and begin rebuilding their lives here with a sense of safety and security. </p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to innovate to improve our processes and to reduce processing times, in line with the recommendations made by the Catherine Day Expert Advisory Group, and the commitments in the Government's White Paper published by my colleague, Minister Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman. However, the substantially higher number of applications currently being received will present a significant challenge in achieving this. </p>  <p>  Since the introduction of new efficiency measures, in the first six months of this year we have been able to increase the number of first instance recommendations and permission to remain decisions being made by the IPO by 56% when compared with the same period pre-Covid in 2019.</p>  <p>  The total number of first instance recommendations made by the IPO under the single application procedure for the first six months of 2022 was 2,656, compared with 3,408 for all of 2019.</p>  <p>  My Department is taking all possible steps to ensure we can process applications as quickly as possible. An end-to-end review of relevant international protection processes by a multi-disciplinary team from my Department has been completed and published. New measures and procedures will continue to be put in place to improve efficiencies across all aspects of the protection process. My Department will, by October 2022 at the latest, commence a review of progress made in reducing and improving processing times.</p></reply>

The Programme was introduced at a time when Ireland was going through a very significant economic downturn and Departments were tasked with initiating innovative programmes to attract investment and create employment as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. Key to the programme is that the investments are beneficial for Ireland, generate or sustain employment and are generally in the public interest.</p><p>The criteria applied when assessing applications under the IIP is set out in the guidance published on my Department's immigration website at: .</p><p>IIP applications for investment in social housing and healthcare is facilitated through the Enterprise and Investment Fund options to the IIP scheme.</p><p>I can confirm that approximately 400 applications have been approved for both social housing and healthcare investment respectively. It should also be noted that there may also be a social housing or healthcare dimension to some of the Investment Funds that IIP applicants invest in and such applicants are not included in the aforementioned figures.</p><p>Therefore, my Department is unable to provide a precise number of applications specifically for social housing and healthcare. This number may change where applicants, for a variety of reasons and subsequent to the approval of their initial IIP application, may apply to transfer their investment to a different IIP project or scheme or where alternative projects, in line with the IIP published criteria, are commenced as determined by the Investment Fund Manager. </p></reply>

Waiting lists are not kept for individual disciplines as this does not reflect the nature of the support provided for children with complex needs. There will be one multi-disciplinary team which will provide a more integrated model of service delivery. </p><p>  The Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams in Laois /Offaly are currently reviewing all children within the service and in the process of planning and delivering on Individual Family Service Plans (IFSPs) for children within the service. An IFSP is an Individual Family Support Plan and is developed by the family, child and the members of the CDNT. It guides how the team supports the child. This is a process which requires getting to know the child and their needs (if not already known), preparing the family to create the IFSP and the development of the document along with the development of the supports to address the identified goals which include universal, targeted, and individual supports. Each IFSP is estimated to take up to 12 clinical hours across 2-3 staff to develop over a period of 6 weeks. This does not include the supports delivered after the IFSP to meet the goals and priorities identified. </p><p>  There are currently 810 children who are registered with Network 12. It is estimated 450 children with complex needs will require an IFSP within the model of service. There are 643 children who are registered with Network 11, of which an estimated 360 children with complex needs will require an IFSP. In Network 10 there are 1100 children currently registered with the team, of which an estimated 700 children with complex needs will require an IFSP. Children with non-complex needs will likely not receive an IFSP, but will require Multi-Disciplinary Team supports. </p><p>  There are some children where the complexity of needs has not been confirmed and the CDNTs are planning to make contact with these families to further understand their needs.</p></reply>

Ensuring the adequate recruitment and retention of appropriately skilled healthcare support assistants and healthcare assistants is a key objective of this initiative.</p>  <p>  The structure and membership of the Strategic Workforce Advisory Group was informed by submissions received by my Department from key stakeholders in January 2022 as well as by a short-life scoping exercise to gather initial data and evidence on the extent of the challenges in the sector.</p>  <p>  The Group provides a forum for agreement on strategic approaches to address sectoral workforce challenges and will submit a report for my consideration by September 2022. This report will outline the Group's key findings and recommendations.</p></reply>

The government&rsquo;s Shared Island initiative involves:</p><p>-  Working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government to address strategic challenges faced on the island of Ireland.</p><p>-  Further developing the all-island economy, deepening North/South cooperation, and investing in the North West and border regions.</p><p>-  Fostering constructive and inclusive dialogue and a comprehensive programme of research to support the building of consensus around a shared future on the island.</p><p>I am committed to working with partners in Northern Ireland to improve cooperation in health and social care where there are clear benefits for both jurisdictions and for patients across the island. We can build on the successes of recent years, including all-island provision of paediatric cardiac surgery in Dublin and cross-border provision of radiotherapy and coronary intervention services in Derry.</p><p>Project prioritisation in the health sector is driven by healthcare needs. The development of new /refurbished healthcare facilities anywhere in the country cannot be seen in isolation or separate from the delivery of related health care services. Therefore, the determination of the specific model of care and how where it interfaces with the wider health service is a critical element in the specification /project brief that determines the type of facility to be provided. </p><p>These criteria apply equally for health infrastructure projects which may be funded under the Shared Island programme. </p><p>At time of writing, no allocation has been provided from the Shared Island Fund for any children&rsquo;s health capital projects. </p><p>My Department will continue to work with the Department of the Taoiseach on the Shared Island Initiative and is considering how best to deepen North-South collaboration in healthcare with Shared Island support.</p></reply>

The HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  Under the 2013 Act, reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation either by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or by the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  The majority of new, innovative medicines are evaluated by the EMA and authorised via the European Commission&rsquo;s centralised procedure in order to be marketed in the EU.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, once a new medicine has received marketing authorisation, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have the product added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  The timing of company applications for reimbursement in different countries can vary for a number of reasons, not least the available market share in each country. Once a company responsible for the commercialisation of a new medicine receives market authorisation, it can apply for reimbursement in the country (or countries) of its choice. Ireland, by virtue of its size and market share, may not always be prioritised by a company in the first stages of marketing a new product.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement with industry on the pricing and supply of medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving a company&rsquo;s pricing/reimbursement application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), whether to approve a new medicine for reimbursement.</p>  <p>  The HSE must ensure that the best possible price is achieved for new medicines as these commitments often represent multimillion-euro investments over several years. This can lead to protracted commercial negotiations.</p>  <p>  The fundamental challenge that applies to consideration of almost all new medicines in Ireland is their price and affordability in a budget-limited health service. However, the allocation of dedicated funding for new medicines has had a positive impact on the reimbursement of orphan drugs.</p>  <p>  The allocation of &euro;50m for new medicines in 2021 enabled the HSE to approve 52 new medicines/expanded uses of existing medicines in 2021, 27 of which were for the treatment of oncological diseases. Budget 2022 has allocated a further &euro;30m for new medicines this year which will provide access to new innovative medicines for patients, including those with cancer.</p></reply>

The HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p><p>Under the 2013 Act, reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation either by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or by the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p><p>The majority of new, innovative medicines are evaluated by the EMA and authorised via the European Commission&rsquo;s centralised procedure in order to be marketed in the EU.</p><p>In line with the 2013 Health Act and the national framework agreed with industry, once a new medicine has received marketing authorisation, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have the product added to the reimbursement list.</p><p>The timing of company applications for reimbursement in different countries can vary for a number of reasons, not least the available market share in each country. Once a company responsible for the commercialisation of a new medicine receives market authorisation, it can apply for reimbursement in the country (or countries) of its choice. Ireland, by virtue of its size and market share, may not always be prioritised by a company in the first stages of marketing a new product.</p><p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement with industry on the pricing and supply of medicines, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving a company&rsquo;s pricing/reimbursement application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), whether to approve a new medicine for reimbursement.</p><p>  The HSE must ensure that the best possible price is achieved for new medicines as these commitments often represent multimillion-euro investments over several years. This can lead to protracted commercial negotiations.</p><p>  The fundamental challenge that applies to consideration of almost all new medicines in Ireland is their price and affordability in a budget-limited health service. However, the allocation of dedicated funding for new medicines has had a positive impact on the reimbursement of orphan drugs.</p><p>  The allocation of &euro;50m for new medicines in 2021 enabled the HSE to approve 52 new medicines/expanded uses of existing medicines in 2021, 19 of which were for the treatment of rare diseases. Budget 2022 has allocated a further &euro;30m for new medicines this year which will provide access to new innovative medicines for patients.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: <i>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html</i>. Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<br /><br />2.  Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<br /><br />3.  Agency roles working in the HSE;<br /><br />4.  Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;<br /><br />5.  Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;<br /><br />6.  Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage. </blockquote>  <p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention. </p></reply>

There are a multitude of reasons why a medicine may not be available including: shortages of raw materials; manufacturing difficulties; or product recalls due to potential quality issues.</p>  <p>  Medicine shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicine shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicine shortage framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.</p>  <p>  Department officials engaged the HPRA who contacted the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAG) of Concerta, along with the wholesalers, after receiving queries from a patient's carer regarding supply challenges as well as some direct representation from TDs. The MAH stated that although there are global constraints on Concerta products, there was no stock-out for the products in Ireland. However, some logistical and operational issues resulted in a delay in some wholesalers receiving their allocation for July. This has since been rectified and HPRA understands that the situation has been resolved. Additionally, the MAH has put in place measures to ensure that a situation like this does not reoccur, including an emergency mechanism where a pharmacist or wholesaler can request additional stock to meet patient needs.</p>  <p>  In many instances a shortage of a particular medicine is effectively addressed to ensure continuity of care for a patient including through the substitution for a generic version (in the case of a branded medicine short supply) or a generic version from a different manufacturer (in the case of a generic medicine in short supply). Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 medicines which are deemed to be interchangeable can be directly substituted for one another by a pharmacist.</p>  <p>  Where an interchangeable product is not available in Ireland, a pharmacist, in consultation with the prescriber, can source a medicine containing the same active ingredient in order to ensure that continuity of patient care is maintained, wherever possible. Such medicines may be sourced in another European Member State, or by a specialist wholesaler in a third country, and are known as exempt medicinal products (EMPs). EMPs have not been granted a marketing authorisation in Ireland by the HPRA but are sourced in response to a bona fide unsolicited order in order to fulfil the special needs of a patient.

The NSAC has commissioned HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) looking at the addition of other SCID types to the NBS programme. This HTA is underway and I am looking forward to receiving a recommendation from the Committee on this condition after the HTA process is finalised later this year.</p>  <p>  The NSAC is now well established and recently published its second annual report which detailed significant progress in 2021. The Committee's first Annual Call for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received a significant response with a total of 53 submissions received, including on newborn screening. Submissions were received from various sources and are now undergoing consideration by the committee. The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme later this year once it has considered all proposals submitted.</p>  <p>  Given that this is a complex area, careful consideration must be given to the expansion of the NBS programme and these things can take time, however, it is important that decisions are made based on internationally accepted criteria and scientific rigour.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of how difficult it is for parents whose children have received a diagnosis of a rare disease, and how challenging daily life can be for them, their families and their children. It can be an overwhelming situation and can be very isolating for many families because of the significant work that is involved when a rare disease is diagnosed. I am committed to the further expansion of newborn screening in Ireland and in identifying opportunities for future additions to it.</p></reply>

My Department's Contraception Implementation Group, convened in July, 2021, has been working with partners, including the HSE, towards ensuring that the scheme will commence in late August or early September 2022. Funding of approximately &euro;9m has been allocated for this in Budget 2022.</p><p>The scheme will be open to all 17-25 year-old women ordinarily resident in Ireland and will provide for:</p><p>- The cost of prescription contraception;</p><p>- The cost of necessary consultations with medical professionals to discuss suitable contraception options with individual patients and to enable prescription of same;</p><p>- The cost of fitting and/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit/remove same;</p><p>- The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs;</p><p>- The cost of providing the wide range of contraceptive options currently available to GMS (medical) card holders, which will also be available through this scheme, including contraceptive injections, implants, IUS and IUDs (coils), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.</p><p>Formal consultations with medical representative bodies with regard to service provision under the scheme have commenced and are ongoing. The legal framework for the scheme will be provided by the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2022, which was passed by the D&aacute;il on 6<sup>th</sup>July, 2022 and will be debated by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 12<sup>th</sup>July, 2022. </p><p>The design of citizen engagement information and publicity campaigns to support and promote the roll out of the scheme will be finalised in the coming weeks, by officials in the Department&rsquo;s Press and Communications Team, the HSE&rsquo;s Communications team and relevant subject matter experts. . This will build upon the information already available through HSE- led and HSE-funded websites which provide information about sexual heath and wellbeing, including <i>www.sexualwellbeing.ie</i>.</p><p>It should be noted that some access to free contraception is already enabled, through the National Condom Distribution Service (NCDS), which was established by the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) in October 2015.The NCDS functions as a central point for distributing free condoms and lubricant sachets to HSE services and other organisations working with individuals and groups at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes.  The service was extended to 3rd level institutions in late 2019. Third-level institutions can now order condom dispensers from the HSE, which enable the provision of free condoms and sexual health information to students on campuses nationwide.</p><p>While oral contraception and various forms of long-acting reversible contraception can be more effective at preventing pregnancy, condoms provide protection against STIs that is not provided by non-barrier forms of contraception.</p><p>It is envisaged that continued expansion of the NCDS will be facilitated in line with demand, in order to support the STI prevention and sexual health promotion needs of people living in Ireland.</p></reply>

However, I am aware that statistics reported by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in the UK showed that women with Irish addresses continued to access termination of pregnancy services in that jurisdiction in 2021. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 permits terminations to be carried out in cases where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of a pregnant woman; where there is a condition present likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth; and without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that it is a priority for my Department that the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 is performing as it should be, to enable all women in Ireland to access services quickly and easily, without bias or judgment. There has been a substantial reduction in the number of people with Irish addresses availing of termination of pregnancy services in the UK since the enactment of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 and the commencement of services.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to facilitate the operation of the service and to resolve any issues that may arise.</p></reply>

My Department's Contraception Implementation Group, convened in July, 2021, has been working with partners, including the HSE, towards ensuring that the scheme will commence in late August or early September 2022. Funding of approximately &euro;9m has been allocated for this in Budget 2022.</p><p>The scheme will be open to all 17-25 year-old women ordinarily resident in Ireland and will provide for:</p><p>- The cost of prescription contraception;</p><p>- The cost of necessary consultations with medical professionals to discuss suitable contraception options with individual patients and to enable prescription of same;</p><p>- The cost of fitting and/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit/remove same;</p><p>- The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs;</p><p>- The cost of providing the wide range of contraceptive options currently available to GMS (medical) card holders, which will also be available through this scheme, including contraceptive injections, implants, IUS and IUDs (coils), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.</p><p>Formal consultations with medical representative bodies with regard to service provision under the scheme have commenced and are ongoing. The legal framework for the scheme will be provided by the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2022, which was passed by the D&aacute;il on 6<sup>th</sup>July, 2022 and will be debated by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 12<sup>th</sup>July, 2022. </p><p>The design of citizen engagement information and publicity campaigns to support and promote the roll out of the scheme will be finalised in the coming weeks by officials in the Department&rsquo;s Press and Communications Team, the HSE&rsquo;s Communications team and relevant subject matter experts. This will build upon the information already available through HSE- led and HSE-funded websites which provide information about sexual heath and wellbeing, including <i>www.sexualwellbeing.ie</i>.</p><p>It should be noted that some access to free contraception is already enabled, through the National Condom Distribution Service (NCDS), which was established by the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) in October 2015.The NCDS functions as a central point for distributing free condoms and lubricant sachets to HSE services and other organisations working with individuals and groups at increased risk of negative sexual health outcomes.  The service was extended to 3rd level institutions in late 2019. Third-level institutions can now order condom dispensers from the HSE, which enable the provision of free condoms and sexual health information to students on campuses nationwide.</p><p>While oral contraception and various forms of long-acting reversible contraception can be more effective at preventing pregnancy, condoms provide protection against STIs that is not provided by non-barrier forms of contraception. It is envisaged that continued expansion of the NCDS will be facilitated in line with demand, in order to support the STI prevention and sexual health promotion needs of people living in Ireland.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: <i>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html</i>. Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);<br /><br />2.  Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;<br /><br />3.  Agency roles working in the HSE;<br /><br />4.  Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help / home care / home support) contracted to the HSE;<br /><br />5.  Redeployed members of Department of Defence to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;<br /><br />6.  Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage. </blockquote>  <p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention. </p></reply>

Worldwide, they save at least 2-3 million lives each year &ndash; and many more from crippling and lifelong illnesses.</p>  <p>  COVID-19 vaccines were made possible by the unprecedented levels of scientific research and collaboration, investment, and early and proactive engagement between vaccine developers and regulators helped speed up development and ensured that quality, safety and effectiveness were not compromised.</p>  <p>  The ongoing COVID-19 Vaccination communications and engagement strategy undertaken by my Department and the HSE had two main objectives. The first was preparing for the vaccine, emphasising the safety and regulatory processes that continue to take place in Ireland, Europe and across the world, engaging with people who have genuine hesitancies around the vaccine and communicating the Government Plan from acquisition to prioritisation to distribution. The second objective focussed on the implementation of the vaccine programme &ndash; encouraging the public to get the vaccine, informing them who will administer it and where, identifying people of trust to act as ambassadors for the vaccine and addressing emerging mis and disinformation themes relating to the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>  <p>  This work was supplemented by the work of Kinzen, a company engaged by my Department to monitor the online dissemination of mis and disinformation relating to COVID-19 and COVID-Vaccines.</p>  <p>  Kinzen produced a daily report of mis and disinformation topics and trends provided to my Department and the HSE, supported by a weekly meeting involving my officials and officials from the HSE to discuss current themes.</p>  <p>  This enabled my Department to work with public health doctors to address the mis and disinformation and direct the public to official sources of information, such as the Department&rsquo;s own website, the COVID-19 Data Hub and the HSE&rsquo;s website. The HSE also undertakes considerable social media advertising campaigns in order to promote public health guidelines, advice and vaccine uptake across platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. The partnership with Kinzen allowed my Department and the HSE to target communications messages in a given week to support vaccine uptake and address emerging genuine concerns and questions the public may have had.</p>  <p>  My Department spent &euro;87,750.00 Ex Vat on this service.</p></reply>

These treatments have been readily available and in use across the Irish healthcare system since February 2022. However, it is accepted that the uptake and use of these therapeutic treatments has to date been low in Ireland, and particularly in view of the risk posed by BA.4 / BA.5 and any potential winter surge, it is my firm view that efforts should now be focussed on promoting their use more widely, in order to protect those most at risk of progressing to severe disease. As such, my Department has requested that the HSE review the treatment pathways and patient selection criteria, to ensure consistent accessibility for those vulnerable individuals for whom treatment is appropriate. </p>  <p>  I have also requested that action is taken to enhance communication and education programmes to promote the benefits of utilising COVID-19 therapeutics, ensuring clinicians have the required knowledge, access and comfort to safely prescribe treatment where appropriate. Every effort should be taken to proactively identify vulnerable patient candidates and to ensure all individuals who may be eligible for treatment are fully informed of their potential candidacy should they contract COVID-19.</p>  <p>  These therapeutics are another important tool available to combat this virus, and it important we utilise them appropriately to protect hospital capacity and preserve health service delivery, both now, in mitigating against the current deterioration in epidemiological situation associated with the BA.4/ BA.5 subvariants, and in the future, recognising the potential for the emergence of new variants.</p></reply>

GPs contracted under the GMS scheme are required by their contract to make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them, or a locum or deputy, for emergencies outside of normal practice hours; most meet this obligation through participation with GP out of hours co-operatives.</p>  <p>  Medical card and GP visit card holders are not charged for services provided under the GMS contract, including out-of-hour GP consultations. Patients who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis, and the fees charged by GPs for services to private patients are a matter of private contract between the GP and their patients. Similarly, cooperatives that provide out of hour GP services are private companies and the fees charged to their private patients are a matter of private contract between the company and their patients. I have no role in relation to the fees charged by individual GPs or GP out of hours service providers for private consultations.</p>  <p>  The Government has introduced many policy measures to help mitigate the cost of living and the cost of living will be the focus of the upcoming Budget, however the introduction of a system to remove GP out-of-hour consultation fees for private patients is not currently under consideration.</p></reply>

This number is expected to rise to 150,131 within twenty years. The health and social care system will need to respond with more flexible and person-centred services and supports that address the needs of this growing number. The National Dementia Strategy, published in 2014, sets out a framework for the development of dementia supports and services in Ireland. The aim of the Strategy is to improve dementia care so that people with dementia can live well for as long as possible, can ultimately die with comfort and dignity, and can have services and supports delivered in the best possible way. </p>  <p>  As part of the National Service Plan 2021 dementia received funding to expand the Dementia Adviser Service bringing the total number of Dementia Advisers from 8 to 29; with access to this service across every county. This is a vital dementia post-diagnostic support providing sign-posting, advice and emotional support to people living with dementia and to their families/carers. In addition, funding was secured in 2021 for the provision of Day Care at Home Services to provide a day care at home experience for people when they cannot attend their local day centre. This service was developed in response to COVID-19 and will continue in 2022 as day centres begin to reopen on a phased basis in-line with public health measures. </p>  <p>  The focus of new service developments in relation to dementia is to enhance assessment ensuring access to a timely diagnosis and in the development of post-diagnostic support and appropriate care. This has included an additional &euro;7.3 million in Budget 2022; in addition to &euro;5 million recurring funding allocated for dementia in 2021. This funding will allow for further developments, including: </p>  <p>  - Memory Assessment and Support Services with access to comprehensive assessment, postdiagnostic support and brain health interventions; </p>  <p>  - Increase in the number of Regional Specialist Memory Clinics; </p>  <p>  - Enhancement of Memory Technology Resource Rooms to provide assistive technology advice and assistance as well as cognitive therapies and other psycho-social supports to people living in the community; </p>  <p>  - Implementation of the dementia registry to improve dementia data and to inform the development of dementia services and clinical practice; </p>  <p>  - Development of a Brain Health programme; </p>  <p>  - Continued dementia audit within acute hospitals; </p>  <p>  - Funding for the National Intellectual Disability Memory Service providing access to specialist teams for this high risk group. </p>  <p>  In addition, the proportion of new home support hours that will be ring-fenced for people with dementia, increased from 5% in 2021 to 11% in 2022.</p></reply>

Those, in these groups, who did not hold a medical card or a GP visit card were provided the vaccine without charge and typically paid an administration fee to have the vaccine administered.</p>  <p>  In 2020/2021, given the potential for the winter influenza season to coincide with a resurgence of COVID-19 and the importance of minimising hospital attendance for the treatment of influenza, the Government expanded the provision of vaccination without charge to all of those in the at-risk groups, regardless of eligibility status.</p>  <p>  This expanded programme ensured that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza had access to vaccination without charge. This was intended to encourage uptake and thereby result in a reduction in the number of influenza-related hospital admissions and in the overall spread of influenza in the community. This expanded programme will be continued during the 2022-2023 flu season.</p>  <p>  As the management of any flu outbreak is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly on this aspect, as soon as possible. </p></reply>

I have requested that the HSE set out short-term immediate actions to alleviate the pressure on EDs and ensure that our hospitals are ready for winter. I also requested the development of a longer-term plan for reform and improvement of unscheduled care, in line with expected increases in demand driven by population growth and an aging population. This plan will build on the substantial investment over the past two years in initiatives such as additional capacity, more staff, increased home care packages and greater GP access to diagnostics.</p>  <p>  I met senior officials from the HSE recently and was updated on progress in developing plans and I instructed the HSE to urgently commence the implementation of all feasible short-term actions, in advance of finalising the plans,  to mitigate pressure at each ED. We are due to meet tomorrow to further progress this priority area.</p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE will continue to work together to develop a programme with a suite of longer-term actions to deliver systemic change to how unscheduled care is delivered.</p></reply>

The cost of GP visit and medical cards varies significantly with the age of the cardholder. Cost calculations require complex and detailed modelling exercises to account for a range of demographic changes, future projections of service demands and variation in the number of GPs and the allowances that could be paid.</p><p>Consultations with the IMO, representing GPs, would be held prior to expansions of GP visit card eligibility and would include discussions on the scope of services to be provided and the rate of fees payable to GPs for the provision of the services.</p><p>For these reasons, it is not possible to give the actual cost of extending GP care without fees to further cohorts or to large set numbers of persons. However, the 2019 IGEES paper <i>Costing Framework for the Expansion of GP Car</i>e provides a cost estimate for expanding GP care without charges to all children aged 12 years and under and for universal free GP care. The 2018 ESRI study <i>Universal GP care in Ireland: Potential Cost Implications</i>also provides a cost estimate for universal free GP care.</p><p>Department of Health IGEES staff are currently working on possible options for expanding eligibility to GP care on a phased basis. This analysis includes consideration of costs, demographics, demand and GP capacity.</p></reply>

This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar type emergency arrives. Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the pandemic there has been significant and ongoing consideration of the impact of COVID-19 and the evolution of the response to it, as evidence and knowledge emerged and as national and international understanding of the virus evolved. Throughout, this has included a specific and sustained focus on older persons, and in particular, those resident in nursing homes. Various examinations and development of reports with a focus on COVID-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons have been undertaken.</p>  <p>  In particular, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established in May 2020, on foot of a NPHET recommendation, to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 among this particularly vulnerable cohort in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing approach to the management and mitigation of risk to older persons resident in nursing homes as the pandemic evolved. This report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders.

There has been a clear national commitment to continue to learn from the pandemic as the national and international understanding of the virus evolves, and where necessary to ensure that the public health-led approach evolves, as evidence and learning materialises.</p>  <p>  The establishment of an inquiry or review into the State's response to the COVID-19 pandemic would be a matter for Government.</p></reply>

The report notes that to meet the demand for GPs that may be required by 2025, the State would require significant increases to the annual intake for GP postgraduate specialist training.</p><p>Building on this work, the HSE publication <i>The Demand for Medical Consultants and Specialists to 2028 and the Training Pipeline</i><i>to Meet Demand</i>provides estimates on the demand for GPs by 2028 based on rolling out GP care without charges to the under 18&rsquo;s and over 70&rsquo;s as well as universal free GP care.</p><p>Measures taken by the Government to increase GP capacity and the number of GPs in the State are already having an impact. There has been a significant increase in the number of GPs entering training in recent years, up from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021, with large increases made in recent years. The transfer of responsibility for training to the ICGP, completed last year, will result in further increases in the coming years. 258 GP training places are planned for 2022.</p><p>Due to the wide range of payments and variables that must be accounted for, and the requirement to determine the scope of services to be provided to newly eligible cohorts in consultation with the IMO, it is not possible to definitively calculate the cost of universal GP care without charges. However, the 2019 IGEES paper <i>Costing Framework for the Expansion of GP Care</i>provides a cost estimate for universal GP care, as does the 2018 ESRI study <i>Universal GP care in Ireland: Potential Cost Implications</i>.</p><p>Other relevant analyses include the Department of Health&rsquo;s <i>Health Service Capacity Review 2018</i>which estimates future capacity requirements, including those in primary care, for the period to 2031, and the <i>Projections of Expenditure for Primary, Community and Long-Term Care in Ireland, 2019&ndash;2035, based on the Hippocrates Model</i>(July 2021) research paper from the ESRI, which was funded by the Department of Health and which projects expenditure for most primary, community, and long-term health and social care services in Ireland for the years 2019&ndash;2035.</p><p>Department of Health IGEES staff are currently working on possible options for expanding eligibility to GP care on a phased basis. This analysis includes consideration of costs, demographics, demand and GP capacity.</p></reply>

As such a breakdown of validation figures by hospital each month does not reflect the appropriate activity and removal rates of the validation cycle. In addition, to generate such a report would require significant manual intervention as it does not correlate with how the validation process operates in practice.</p>  <p>The NTPF has advised my Department that the number of patients removed from Acute Hospital Waiting Lists through their validation programme year to date up to 3rd June 2022 was 3,082 from Inpatient/Day Case and 36,046 from Outpatient waiting lists.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: <i>www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. </i></p><p>Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE. As of Friday, 8 July, 68,943 eligible HSE staff have received payment around the country. This number excludes Section 38 agencies which are estimated to have paid 20,000 staff to date thereby bringing the total number of employees paid to 88,943. The rest of eligible employees will be paid as soon as possible. </p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5. Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p><p>6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p></reply>

I was updated on the progress of the UHL Expert Team review and the response to the HIQA report. The HSE informed me that the Performance Management Improvement Unit (PMIU) has been mandated under its Performance Accountability Framework to lead the immediate engagement with the Hospital Group and the Mid-West CHO to ensure that the issues identified are addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  I have since requested the HSE to urgently commence the implementation of short-term measures to deal with the current challenges in UHL ED. Senior PMIU management were on-site again last week, supporting local hospital management.</p>  <p>  The Hospital has said that short- and medium-term actions include the redeployment of nursing staff with experience to the ED; reviewing nurse staff levels within the ED; making more effective use of the capacity available in St. John's, Ennis, Nenagh and Croom to support UHL; developing an over-75s assessment area in the ED; and re-establishing the Acute Medical Unit and Surgical Assessment Unit pathways.</p>  <p>  I am due to meet with HSE senior management this week to provide a further update on the development of the comprehensive plans for each ED which will set out short term and long-term measures to be taken locally and nationally, including at each Community Healthcare Organisation, to ensure sustainable improvements in emergency care performance. </p>  <p>  My Department and I continue to work closely with the HSE to progress the plans which will be published in due course.</p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p>  <p>  Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1050 for a couple.

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p><p>The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p><p>The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system. </p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p><p>The plan builds on the successes of the short-term 2021 plan that ran from September to December last year. The 2021 plan was developed by the Department of Health, the HSE and the NTPF and was driven and overseen by a senior governance group co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the CEO of the HSE and met fortnightly.</p><p>This rigorous level of governance and scrutiny of waiting lists has continued into this year with the oversight group evolving into the Waiting List Task Force. The Task Force will meet regularly to drive progress of the 2022 plan.</p><p>This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p><p>The NTPF only collects data on patients currently on the waiting list. The time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. As a result, the health system does not have the data necessary to calculate true average wait times.</p><p>In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, the attached document, provided to my Department by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), outlines the number of patients on a waiting list for an inpatient or day case procedure in the South/South West Hospital group for Orthopaedic, Gynaecology and Cataract treatment by routine/urgent and by time band in each of the years 2019 to 2021 and to date in 2022.</p><p>  </p></reply>

This includes the &euro;150 million I secured in Budget 2021 to progress the development of a reformed model of service delivery to underpin the statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services and to provide 5 million additional hours of home support.</p><p>In 2021 some 20.4 million hours was provided to over 55,000 people. This is about 2.9 million more hours compared to 2020, an increase of 17%.In 2022, our aim is to provide 23.67 million hours of home support.  </p><p>At the end of May preliminary data shows that 55,392 people were receiving home support and over 8.7 million hours has been delivered year to date.The preliminary data also shows significant inroads have been achieved in reducing waiting lists for funding approval for new or additional service from over 7,800 in January 2020 to 348 in May 2022.This reduction has been achieved through a combination of validation of the waiting list and availability of additional funding to address those waiting.  However, there can be a lag between funding approval and the actual delivery of home support hours.  Certain geographical areas that are experiencing increased pressures due to staff availability are particularly affected.</p><p>At the end of May provisional information shows that there were 4,720 people assessed and approved for Home Support but were awaiting a carer to be assigned. In January 2020, there was about 1,300 people in this category. Despite the increase, it is important to note that the total number of people waiting for home support across both categories has reduced from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to 5,068 at the end of May 2022. </p><p>The number of home support hours in communities is increasing, in line with enhanced investment. Delivering this enhanced capacity requires substantial recruitment. This has been affected due to the strategic workforce challenges in the sector.  </p><p>I have established an Advisory Group to identify the specific obstacles to recruiting carers.  The Group is committed to providing me with a set of recommendations by September.  </p><p>The HSE continues to advertise for Health Care Assistants.  In my ongoing engagements with the Chief Officers I have recommended that they consider a renewed focus in advertising these positions locally.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: www.hse.ie/eng/staff/resources/hr-circulars/hr-circular-012-2022-pandemic-special-recognition-payment.html. Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/S38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5. Redeployed members of the Defence Forces to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments for the HSE;</p><p>6. Paramedics employed by the Department of Local Government, Housing and Heritage.</p><p>The above 6 areas only are covered by this Government Decision and all eligible workers will be paid in accordance with the overarching eligibility criteria in place. </p></reply>

This important research report explores the experiences and preferences of older adults on ageing in place in rural Ireland and makes a number of recommendations to Government.</p>  <p>  Across Government, we will continue to prioritise the needs and preferences of older people, including those living in rural Ireland. The Programme for Government 2020 commits to the vision of creating an Age Friendly Ireland and highlights the imperative to plan judiciously to meet the needs of our ageing population. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health&rsquo;s strategic goal is to support older people to remain living independently in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare vision for receiving the right care in the right place and at the right time.  To this end, &euro;195 million was allocated in Budget 2022 to enable the continued delivery of the Enhanced Community Care Programme. </p>  <p>  The objective of the Enhanced Community Care Programme is to reorient healthcare provision towards general practice, primary care, and community-based services, creating end-to-end care pathways that will prevent referrals and admissions to acute hospitals and will enable a &ldquo;home first&rdquo; approach.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the HSE also support a number of complimentary Support-Coordination models which help our older population to age in place and reduce the rate of older people transferring to long-term residential care. The Healthy Age Friendly Homes Programme is an innovative partnership between Age Friendly Ireland and Sl&aacute;intecare. The programme commenced at the beginning of 2021 and saw the introduction of a new person-centric, robust, support co-ordination service that will enable older people to continue living in their homes with a sense of independence and autonomy.</p>  <p>  The HSE, in conjunction with ALONE, is also continuing the roll out of a Support Co-ordination Service that will support older people to live independently at home for as long as possible, by facilitating access to services including befriending, social prescribing, assistive technologies, and by coordinating linkages to local community groups. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is committed to delivering the vision of the 2019 policy statement on 'Housing Options for Our Ageing Population', jointly published with the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage. The central aim of the policy statement is to increase the housing options available to older people and to facilitate the integration of supports in a more coherent way, particularly between the housing and health sectors, with a view to facilitating people to live at home with dignity and independence for longer.  </p>  <p>  The final report of the group, published in June, details the significant progress that has been made to date and the plans for taking the strategic goals of the policy statement onwards. The remaining actions will be taken forward within the framework of Housing for All which aims to increase housing options for older people to facilitate ageing in place, in their own homes and communities, with dignity and independence, and deliver an appropriate range of housing and related support services, in an integrated and sustainable manner. The Department of Health will continue to work with the Department of Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage, as well as all relevant stakeholders, to increase the housing options available to our older population. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to establishing a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support services. It is intended that this new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality, regulated home care services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. The Government allocated &euro;150 million of additional funding in 2021 to provide for 5 million more hours of home support. This funding has been maintained into 2022.</p>  <p>  To conclude, it is important that there is a cross-governmental and multi-stakeholder approach to address the barriers older people in rural areas face to remain in their homes and communities as they age. The Department of Health is committed to addressing these challenges and supporting older people to age in place in rural Ireland.</p></reply>

Family carers are the backbone of care provision in our country and have cared for the most vulnerable in our society during the COVID 19 pandemic. Whether caring for a child or a parent with a disability or illness or an elderly family member, carers, through their selfless hard work, knowledge and compassion enhance the quality of life of the most vulnerable in our society on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government aims to prioritise policy actions that protect the most vulnerable, including those both in caring roles and those they care for as our economy returns to growth in the aftermath of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is committed to working with other Government Departments to ensure that we are providing the most appropriate supports to sustain carers in their caring role. Officials from the Department of Health recently partook in the Annual Carers Forum hosted by the Department of Social Protection. This annual forum is a forum for family carers and representative organisations to voice their views on caring in Ireland and their priorities to support them in their caring role.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Carers Strategy is a cross-departmental strategy, designed around a core vision which recognises and respects carers as key care partners who are supported to maintain their own health and well-being, care with confidence and who are empowered to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.</p>  <p>  The National Carers Strategy recommends that family carers should have access to a range of respite services to allow family carers to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life. A break from caring can lessen the psychological and emotional burden that can be experienced by family carers. It can support family carers to continue in their caring role. </p></reply>

The applicable legislation requires that the HSE carry forward any deficit in its Income and Expenditure account as a first charge against the following year&rsquo;s allocation. In cases where the HSE reports a surplus for the year, the HSE may carry this surplus forward only with the consent of the Minister for Health and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; </p><p>In relation to reporting obligations, the legislation requires the HSE to adopt annual financial statements on or before the 1st day of April in the year following the financial year to which they relate. These accounts are then required to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and once the finalised audited accounts are available, they are required to be provided to the Minister for Health who lays these before the Oireachtas. This took place on 20th June 2022. </p><p>The HSE has therefore has fully complied with its financial reporting obligations as defined under the legislation for 2021 and given the HSE reported a deficit in 2021, consideration of the HSE returning expenditure from its 2021 allocation does not arise. </p><p>In responding to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it has been assumed that the question refers to the HSE&rsquo;s year-end position. If the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to another matter or if additional details are required, my officials will be happy to provide further clarification on request.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-12a.2531.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071200111#WRXX03400"><p>The National Drug Treatment Report System (NDTRS), published by the Health Research Board in June of this year, presents trends on treatment for problem drug use (excluding alcohol) for the seven-year period from 2015 to 2021. The data are drawn from the National Drug Treatment Reporting System, the national surveillance system that records and reports on cases of drug and alcohol treatment in Ireland.</p><p>The report demonstrates the continuing demand for health services to address the harmful effects of drug use, the types of drugs that are most impactful on people who require treatment, and the social factors associated with problematic drug use.</p><p>The increase in treatment services reflects the government&rsquo;s commitment to a public health response to drug use and the additional resources committed to services in 2021. The total numbers receiving treatment in the community has increased, with 70% of cases now treated in outpatient facilities. The provision of healthcare services in the community is a key tenet of the Sl&aacute;intecare approach. </p><p>The commitment remains to expanding the provision of community-based services in conjunction with drug and alcohol task forces and the HSE. Funding of over &euro;2m has also been made available through the Community Services Enhancement Fund which will have a particular focus on women, ethnic minorities and the LGBTI+ community.</p><p>The National Drugs Strategy sets out a health-led approach to drug use. It promotes a more compassionate and humane approach to people who use drugs, with drug use treated first and foremost as a public health issue. The Programme for Government endorses this health-led approach. By treating the use of substances as a public health issue, rather than solely as a criminal issue, we can better help individuals, their families and the communities in which we live. </p><p>The Government established a working group to consider alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use in December 2017. The work programme of the group consisted of meetings with experts from other countries, commissioning research on other jurisdictions and undertaking a public consultation. The consultation process received a response of over 20,000 people and included the views of many people who use drugs. </p><p>The working group examined the option of decriminalising drugs. The report did not deem this an appropriate option in the Irish context due to legal difficulties (which could lead to the de facto legalisation of drugs), and operational problems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The report of the working group was published in 2019 and is available here.</p><p>The Government accepted the views of the working group on the decriminalisation of drugs. Accordingly, there are no plans to decriminalise drugs. </p><p>As part of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, I announced six strategic priorities for the remaining years of the strategy until 2025. These will strengthen the health-led approach to drug use, as agreed in the Programme for Government, and align with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan. The<b></b>fifth priority is to reinforce the health-led, rather than criminal justice-led, approach to people who use of drugs and who commit drug-related crimes. The main focus will be on the rollout of the government health diversion programme for people in possession of drugs for personal use, which will offer compassion not punishment. Other initiatives, such as the drug treatment courts, will also be supported. A particular emphasis will be on the exchange of best practice on alternatives to coercive sanctions with EU member states.</p></reply>

I have been concerned for some time that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services.</p>  <p>  To help address this issue, an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 was secured to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish. In addition, an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) is being used to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings.</p>  <p>  The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the Scheme this year over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021, &euro;40 million.</p>  <p>  Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1st May. I would hope that this significant additional investment in the Scheme will encourage more dentists to treat medical card patients, including in Waterford. </p>  <p>  These measures are designed to address immediate concerns with the DTSS, pending a more substantive reform of the Scheme. It is my intention that this is addressed in the context of the implementation of the National Oral Health Policy, which sets out a body of substantial services reform. Work is underway on a governance framework for this root and branch service reform. The Chief Dental Officer is engaging with stakeholders and I understand that she will meet shortly with the Irish Dental Association.</p>  <p>  I have been assured by the HSE that their local services on the ground will assist any persons who are still experiencing problems in accessing a service.</p></reply>

There are approximately 8,000 known rare diseases; 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin and are often chronic and life-threatening.  Up to 1 person in 12 in Ireland may have a rare disease at some stage in their life.  Approximately 300,000 persons in Ireland are living with a rare disease.</p><p>Many of the recommendations of the <i>National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018)</i>have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) and HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which has now been  operationalised and incorporated into the NRDO which is the main contact point and driver for National HSE rare disease projects and initiatives.</p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks (ERN).  ERNs are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.  These links are emphasized in the Plan to address the care of patients with rare diseases at both National and European levels.  Significant progress has been made with regard to participation in ERNs with Ireland&rsquo;s 15 applications for entry to ERNs recently being approved from 5 academic hospitals. Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.</p><p>In order to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, in 2021 I met with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Task force which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). At this meeting priority areas for the future were discussed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of priority areas for the coming period were agreed including; patient awareness, European Reference Networks, research and registries, access to services, access to medicines, diagnosis, education, legislation and policy.</p><p>The Clinical Genetics service at Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) at Crumlin was founded in 1995 and provides a diagnostic, counselling and clinical genetic testing service for children and adults affected by or at risk of a genetic condition. </p><p>The service is the main provider of general genetic counselling to the population of the Republic of Ireland. It cares for and manages families with genetic conditions, rather than simply focusing on individual patients. </p><p>Currently there are four Consultant Geneticists in CHI at Crumlin. I am pleased to advise that two vacant posts have been approved by the Consultant Applications Advisory Committee and have been advertised with a closing date of 22nd of July 2022. A locum post is also currently in place.  </p><p>To support the progression of Genomics and the development of a national genomics network work a single vision for the future of genomics is required. The Department of Genomic Medicine at CHI is in a central position to build on the foundations of the clinical genomics service in CHI at Crumlin to support clinical teams in understanding and managing disease through precision medicine. CHI are progressing the recruitment of a Genomics Medicine Lead (consultant) across CHI who will link and advise on a national strategy. </p><p>I fully support the development of a national strategy for Ireland, and I am pleased to advise that Dr Colm Henry, HSE Chief Clinical Officer, has recently set up an international group to review and advise on the national strategy for genomic medicine. This group will be reporting on its outcomes later this year and I look forward to hearing its progress.&rsquo;</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-12a.2574.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071200112#WRYY01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 981, 984, 986, 989 and 1099 together.</p>  <p>The 2013 Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act is a clear, robust, statutory framework under which all new medicinal products must be assessed by the HSE. The HSE is the statutory decision-maker for the reimbursement of such products, and the Act ensures that these decisions are made on an objective and scientific basis.</p>  <p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to remove any threshold incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) informed by the Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) metric from the assessment of orphan medicinal products while retaining the responsibility for the HSE to consider cost-effectiveness under modified criteria.</p>  <p>  The QALY is the economic evaluation system which is used to set a threshold of cost-effectiveness when assessing medicines. Using the QALY, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) can systematically assess new medicines for cost effectiveness. Disregarding a validated systematic evidence-based scientific methodology to inform decision-making would greatly limit the HSE&rsquo;s capacity to determine whether the submitted price for orphan drugs represents value for money. In the absence of cost-effectiveness information on orphan drugs, the HSE would enter commercial negotiations in an uninformed, and therefore disadvantageous position.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Health Act does not provide for a different ruleset when assessing orphan medicines. However, the criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow the HSE to have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs. The statutory framework in the 2013 Act requires the HSE to take account of a range of objective factors and not just cost-effectiveness under the QALY system.  In making reimbursement decisions, there is a list of criteria contained in the Act which the HSE is required to consider, including the magnitude of the clinical effect, cost effectiveness, budget impact, available resources, and unmet medical need.</p>  <p>  Consequently, the QALY economic evaluation system does not restrict the HSE from applying discretion particularly in seeking to address unmet medical need. In making reimbursement decisions, the HSE often reimburses orphan medicines in excess of a cost per QALY of &euro;45,000 in cases where the potential to address unmet need is supported by robust clinical evidence.</p>  <p>  Budget 2021 allocated &euro;50 million for the approval of new drugs and nineteen of the fifty-two new medicines approved by the HSE in 2021 were orphan medicines, representing over one third of approvals. Budget 2022 allocated a further &euro;30 million for the approval of new drugs. The HSE has approved 36 new medicines/new uses of existing medicines to date in 2022 including three medicines  for the treatment of rare diseases.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the concerns outlined above, the Bill is honourable in its intent and must serve as an opportunity to explore the policy options available to us. We all want an assessment process for orphan medicines which provides our most vulnerable patients with access to the innovative treatments which they deserve. The Bill represents an opportunity to comprehensively look at the current system and consider how issues such as transparency and communication can be improved, and I have asked my officials to do that.</p></reply>

Companies insist that parts of the application are confidential.</p>  <p>  The NCPE publish a Technical Summary Document for each completed Health Technology Assessment (HTA), which provides an overview of the clinical and economic dossier reviewed by the NCPE, and the outcomes of the economic assessment.</p>  <p>  The NCPE&rsquo;s website is updated in real time in respect of all steps in the HTA process. Additionally, their dedicated online section for patients includes information on the submission process, the drug reimbursement process and how to interpret NCPE recommendations. </p>  <p>  The HSE has also confirmed that it faces significant challenges in publishing all of the information it uses in decision-making, as such information is also subjected to commercial confidentiality by the pharmaceutical companies. </p>  <p>  The NCPE&rsquo;s Patient Organisation Submission Process encourages consideration of the lived experience of patients, carers and their families, as well as their views on the difference a new medicine may make. This information is then used as part of the Health Technology Assessment of medicines undergoing evaluation.</p>  <p>  The HSE Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The role of the Drugs Group is to make a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) in relation to each individual application having considered the criteria under the 2013 Act. The group also includes representation from the National Patient Forum.</p>  <p>  When considering applications, the HSE can request the input of the Rare Disease Technology Review Committee (RDTRC). The RDTRC gives a voice to rare disease patients and also to clinicians with expertise in the specific illnesses in question. Using the guidance from the Committee, the HSE is able to take account of the challenges faced by patients in terms of unmet need and the potential impact of the drug, alongside considerations of cost effectiveness.</p>  <p>  The Drugs Group considers the NCPE assessment, the outputs from commercial engagements, patient interest group submissions, and any other pertinent information in advance of providing its recommendation to the HSE EMT.</p>  <p>  As the decision-making authority within the HSE, the HSE EMT decides on the basis of all the demands with which it is faced (across all services) whether it can fund a new medicine, or new uses of an existing medicine, from the resources that have been provided to it in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

However, I am aware that statistics reported by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) in the UK showed that women with Irish addresses continued to access termination of pregnancy services in that jurisdiction in 2021.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 permits terminations to be carried out in cases where there is a risk to the life, or of serious harm to the health, of a pregnant woman; where there is a condition present likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within 28 days of birth; and without restriction up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.</p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that it is a priority for my Department that the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 is performing as it should be, to enable all women in Ireland to access services quickly and easily, without bias or judgment. There has been a substantial reduction in the number of people with Irish addresses availing of termination of pregnancy services in the UK since the enactment of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 and the commencement of services.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing engagement between the Department of Health and the HSE to facilitate the operation of the service and to resolve any issues that may arise.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-07-12a.2610.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071200112#WRYY04900"><p>The Programme for Government, 2020 commits to providing free contraception for women, starting with the 17-25 age cohort.  My Department's Contraception Implementation Group, convened in July, 2021, has been working with partners, including the HSE, towards ensuring that the scheme will commence in late August or early September 2022. Funding of approximately &euro;9m has been allocated for this in Budget 2022.</p>  <p>  - The cost of prescription contraception;</p>  <p>  - The cost of necessary consultations with medical professionals to discuss suitable contraception for individual patients and to enable prescription of same;</p>  <p>  - The cost of fitting and/or removal of various types of long-acting reversible contraception (LARCs) plus any necessary checks, by medical professionals certified to fit/remove same;</p>  <p>  - The cost of training and certifying additional medical professionals to fit and remove LARCs;</p>  <p>  - The cost of providing the wide range of contraceptive options currently available to GMS (medical) card holders, which will also be available through this scheme, including contraceptive injections, implants, IUS and IUDs (coils), the contraceptive patch and ring, and various forms of oral contraceptive pill, including emergency contraception.</p>  <p>The legal framework for the scheme will be provided by the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2022, which was passed by the D&aacute;il on 6th July, 2022 and will be debated by Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 12th July, 2022. Should the Bill pass all stages and be signed into law, it is envisaged that the scheme will be launched in late August or early September, 2022.</p>  <p>  Formal consultations with medical representative bodies with regard to service provision under the scheme have commenced and are ongoing. The design of citizen engagement information and publicity campaigns to support and promote the roll out of the scheme will be finalised in the coming weeks by officials in the Department&rsquo;s Press and Communications Team, the HSE&rsquo;s Communications team and relevant subject matter experts.</p>  <p>  In terms of considering the expansion of the scheme to wider age cohorts, it is recommended by the Public Expenditure Code that policy changes with significant Exchequer cost implications should be phased in and/or be subject to piloting and formal evaluation, before full roll out. This is particularly pertinent in the case of schemes, such as this one, which are demand-led. It is envisaged that, for quality control and other logistical reasons, including the monitoring of health service capacity in terms of LARC fitting and removal, a minimum of 12 to 18 months would be needed for monitoring of service delivery to 17-25 year-olds, prior to any further major expansion of the scheme.</p>  <p>  In relation to extending the age cohort specifically to girls under the age of 17, It is important to note that the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2022 in the form passed by the D&aacute;il, does not preclude the scheme being extended to girls under the age of 17. It provides that such an extension cannot be done under regulations to be made by the Minister for Health, meaning such an extension of the scheme would require a legislative amendment to be brought before the Oireachtas. I gave a commitment in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann (Committee Stage debate, 06/07/2022), that consideration of the needs of this girls under 17 would be considered by my Department as soon as this Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2022 has been commenced.</p>  <p>  If the Bill passes all stages in the form it was passed by D&aacute;il Eireann, my Department will commence the relevant consultations across Government, including engagement with the Oireachtas Health Committee. Subject to the outcome of these consultations, in particular resolving any potential obstacles, legal or otherwise, it is my intention, subject also to the required Government approval, to bring any necessary legislative amendments before the Houses of the Oireachtas, for full debate and scrutiny, at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is important also to clarify that the sole purpose of the contraception provisions contained in Part 3 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill 2022 (in the form as passed by the D&aacute;il), is to transfer the costs of contraception from the patient to the State, starting with women aged 17-25.</p>  <p>  Every day, GPs see women and girls of all ages, up and down the country, in their practices, to prescribe contraception, both for the purposes of birth control, and to ameliorate pain, heavy bleeding, mood disorders and other symptoms of the menstrual cycle for which medical help is often needed.</p>  <p>  This Bill, if enacted, will have no impact on normal practice in this regard, for women over 25 and girls under 17. The normal operation of services provided by GPs, their clinical judgement and the medications and devices they may decide to prescribe are not a matter for this Bill, which is concerned only with removing the financial barriers to accessing contraception, starting with women aged 17-25.</p></reply>

Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The Minister for Health has no role in these decisions.</p>  <p>  Ozempic&reg; (semaglutide) is licensed with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in Ireland, and is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Semaglutide has not been approved for reimbursement for any other indication to date.</p>  <p>  Controls are in place within the HSE management systems on claiming processes to ensure that only HSE approved indications are reimbursed across a range of medicines. Controls are currently in place in relation to Ozempic&reg; (semaglutide) to restrict reimbursement support to the HSE approved indication of Diabetes. </p>  <p>  Persons with Diabetes are entitled to be registered under the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme to enable them to obtain this product free of charge.

The range of supports provided by the Irish State to each Irish survivor also include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, which includes access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment and housing adaptations.  There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive who liaises with Irish thalidomide survivors and assists them to access supports towards their ongoing health and personal social service needs.</p>  <p>  Work is underway in the Department to provide these health and personal social supports on a statutory footing as committed to by the Government.</p></reply>

As private contractors, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the workforce issues currently facing general practice and is working to ensure patients across the country continue to have access to GP services and that general practice is sustainable in all areas into the future.</p>  <p>  Under the 2019 GP Agreement additional annual expenditure provided for general practice has to date been increased by &euro;206.6m and is set to increase to &euro;211.6m per annum next year when the Agreement is fully rolled out. This provides for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees and subsidies for additional services. Improvements to GP&rsquo;s maternity and paternity leave arrangements, increased rural practice supports and a support for GPs in disadvantaged urban areas, have also been provided for.</p>  <p>  The number of GPs entering training has increased steadily over the past number of years, rising from 120 in 2009 to 233 in 2021.  258 places will be available this year. The transfer of GP training from the HSE to the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) which was concluded in 2021 will allow for the introduction of a new service model for GP training in Ireland and the further expansion GP training capacity in the years ahead.

As the Deputy will be aware, the COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme, also known as TAPS, was established as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic. According to the most recent available HSE data, from 5 July, 9,061 claims had been processed, with some &euro;140.7 million euro of direct financial support provided to the sector. The outbreak assistance element of the scheme is still in payment. This element has been extended a number of times, most recently for 3 months, which will see the scheme operate until the end of September 2022. In addition to TAPS, direct support has been provided by the HSE to private nursing homes in many areas, including the provision of PPE, serial testing and support with staffing.</p></reply>

Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p><p>In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The Minister for Health has no role in these decisions.</p><p>Ozempic&reg; (semaglutide) is licensed with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) in Ireland, and is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ozempic&reg; (semaglutide) was approved by the HSE for addition to the Reimbursement List for the treatment of Diabetes in 2018. Semaglutide has not been approved for reimbursement for any other indication to date.</p><p>Controls are in place within the HSE management systems on claiming processes to ensure that only HSE approved indications are reimbursed across a range of medicines. Controls are currently in place in relation to Ozempic&reg; (semaglutide) to restrict reimbursement support to the HSE approved indication of Diabetes.</p><p>Persons with Diabetes are entitled to be registered under the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme to enable them to obtain this product free of charge.

During this visit, I also met with HSE staff and with the chairperson and coordinator of the Tallaght Drug and Alcohol Task Force. I heard first-hand about the wide range of services provided for people who use drugs in the Tallaght area. I was informed about the challenges in providing community-based services for cocaine and crack cocaine users.</p>  <p>  In January 2022, I  announced &euro;850,000 in recurring funding for a HSE-led initiative to reduce the health-related harms associated with the use of cocaine and &lsquo;crack&rsquo; cocaine. This funding will support services in delivering evidence-based interventions and will increase training opportunities for staff in addiction services nationally. It will also improve the support provided to those affected by adverse health consequences of cocaine or &lsquo;crack&rsquo; cocaine use.</p>  <p>  Following a review of submissions from community healthcare organisations, the HSE has allocated funding of &euro;200,000 to CHOs 3, 4, 7 &amp;amp; 9. In CHO 7, &euro;140,000 is being allocated to establish a crack cocaine specific harm reduction service in JADD and a gender specific crack cocaine programme in CARP.  These new services to be added to the already existing services of JADD and CARP.</p>  <p>  I welcome the engagement of community-based services and CHOs in developing these initiatives. This partnership approach is at the heart of the national drugs strategy.</p></reply>

Following extensive engagement with healthcare unions on the matter, on 19th April the HSE published eligibility guidelines and FAQs, as apply to the HSE and Section 38 agencies, which are available on its website: . Payment is currently receiving priority across all Hospital Groups and Community Services in the HSE.</p><p>The HSE and the Department are currently examining progressing the rollout to the list of 6 non-HSE/non-Section 38 organisation types covered by the Government Decision. It is hoped that information will be published shortly for those certain non-HSE/Section 38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. This shall cover eligible staff in:</p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5. Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; </p><p>6. Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE. </p><p>The above 6 areas only are covered by this Government Decision and all eligible workers will be paid in accordance with the overarching eligibility criteria in place. </p></reply>

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p>  <p>  The NTPF have advised my department that they have approved 13 IPDC orthopaedic initiatives and 1 outpatient orthopaedics initiative for funding so far in 2022 for the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh, which will facilitate treatment for 1,459 patients on orthopaedics waiting lists. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy, The NTPF only collects data on patients currently on the waiting list. The time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. As a result, the health system does not have the data necessary to calculate true average wait times.</p></reply>

This independent expert group considers and assesses evidence in a robust and transparent manner, and against internationally accepted criteria. It is important we have rigorous processes in place to ensure our screening programmes are effective, quality assured and operating to safe standards, and that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms.</p>  <p>  The Committee's first Annual Call for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received a significant response with a total of 53 submissions received, including submissions relating to antenatal screening. Submissions were received from various sources and are now undergoing consideration by the committee. The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme later this year once it has considered all proposals submitted.</p></reply>

The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs in each of the six Hospital Groups across the country.</p>  <p>  Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system. Substantial planning, development and policy work is required to establish the scope, design and requirements for this component of the model of care. At this juncture, the design and scope of this aspect of the model of care have not been finalised as detailed consideration of a range of issues including service and treatment design, eligibility and access criteria, and associated resource implications is required. This work will also need to be informed by the final Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act, the progress of this Bill &ndash; which has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in March &ndash; and associated regulations that will be developed following the enactment of this legislation. </p>  <p>  My officials are continuing engagement with the HSE in relation to the necessary programmes of work required to further advance consideration of the issues arising for commencing Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care. This work will also include an examination of the costs associated with providing AHR services, including IVF, which will then allow us to model options and associated costings in more detail. </p></reply>

The HSE assesses each medical card application on a qualifying financial threshold. This is the amount of money that an individual can earn a week and still qualify for a card. It is specific to the individual&rsquo;s own financial circumstances.</p><p>Persons aged 69 and under are assessed under the general means tested medical card thresholds which are based on an applicant&rsquo;s household income after tax and the deduction of PRSI and the Universal Social Charge. Certain expenses are also taken into account, i.e. mortgage payments, which help to increase the amount a person can earn and still qualify for a medical card.</p><p>Persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over 70s medical card income thresholds which are based on gross income. It should be noted that in November 2020, the weekly gross medical card income thresholds for those aged 70 and over were increased to &euro;550 per week for a single person and &euro;1,050 for a couple. This increase ensures that a greater proportion of those aged 70 and over now qualify for a medical card.</p><p>With regard to the estimated cost of the deputy's proposals, the data required to model these are not readily available and it is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the associated cost, number of cards, or other requested figures.</p><p>However, I wish to assure the Deputy that, to ensure the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs, my Department keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds under review and any changes are considered in the context of Government policy, the annual budgetary estimates process and other issues which may be relevant.</p></reply>

Earlier this year I approved an ambitious plan for Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) to reduce the number of children waiting for spinal orthopaedic procedures (scoliosis and spina bifida) by year end. Both current and capital funding totalling &euro;17.43 million has been approved for this initiative. The plan will result in an additional 67 spinal fusions and 28 spinal other procedures for children with Scoliosis, as well as an additional 141 procedures for children with Spina Bifida. The plan also allocates substantial paediatric orthopaedic procedures at Cappagh orthopaedic hospital, with 720 additional procedures planned for the year. The impact of the plan has already been recorded with increased activity year to date, with 239 procedures carried out year to date on 1st July, compared with 178 procedures in the same period last year.</p>  <p>  This latest initiative is further evidence of this Government&rsquo;s commitment to address acute hospital waiting lists. The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve waiting times. This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health.</p></reply>

To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.</p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.</p>  <p>  In relation to endoscopy and cardiovascular waiting lists, acute hospital Outpatient and Inpatient/Day case waiting lists are published monthly, broken down by specialty, and are available on the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) website at: ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm</p>  <p>  With regard to oncology, key performance indicators for access to oncology services are outlined in the HSE National Service Plan and performance profiles and are published on the HSE website at: hse.ie/eng/services/publications/performancereports/</p></reply>

This framework will comprise primary legislation for the licensing of providers, secondary legislation in the form of regulations (minimum requirements), and HIQA national standards. </p><p>On 27 April 2021, Government gave approval to the Minister for Health to draft a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. The Heads of a Bill are currently at draft stage and it is intended to bring this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. </p><p>In tandem to this, draft regulations setting out the minimum requirements a home support provider must meet to obtain a licence are also at an advanced stage. The Department has completed a targeted stakeholder consultation which has amended the draft regulations further. This has been enhanced by regular discussions with HIQA, HSE, Private Providers' representative groups and legal expertise assisting with legal text and interpretation of core issues, such as, capacity legislation, employment laws and health and safety issues. A 6-week public consultation is ongoing, due to close on 28th July.</p><p>In addition to this, HIQA are in the process of developing standards for home care and home support services which will be the focus of a public consultation in September. </p><p>(ii)  Funding of home-support services </p><p>The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) undertook a programme of work on behalf of the Department on the potential demand for, and cost of, home support which culminated in two reports.</p><p>This research will form an important part of the evidence base for the development of a sustainable funding model for home support services in the context of our ageing population. </p><p>An internal consultation process on a range of potential funding options is underway. Targeted external consultation will follow in due course. </p><p>(iii) Reformed model of service delivery </p><p>The Pilot for testing of a reformed model of service for the delivery for home-support is now fully operational. It commenced in November 2021 in CHO 8 and the three other sites CHO2, CHO 4 and CHO 7 became operational in January 2022. The interRAI outputs and pilot site evaluation will be critical to the development of the new home-support scheme. </p><p>Recruitment of 128 Care Needs Facilitator posts has commenced to progress the national rollout of interRAI as the standard assessment tool for care-needs in the community. It is planned to have these posts in place by the end of Q3 2022.. </p><p>Approval and funding were provided in 2021 for the new National Older Persons Services Offices which will encompass the National Home Support Office to be located in Tullamore. Funding is provided for 15 full time jobs including 9 Community Healthcare Organisation home support manager/coordinator posts. Recruitment of the Head of Service of the new National Home support Office has been advertised.  </p></reply>

We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.</p><p>Budget 2022 ring-fenced &euro;31m in funding for new Developments for Women&rsquo;s Health. This includes:</p><p>- &euro;8.66 million additional funding for the National Maternity Strategy.</p><p>- &euro;9 million to fund access to contraception for women aged 17-25.</p><p>- &euro;5.3 million to grow access to &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; gynaecology clinics; specialist menopause clinics; and specialist endometriosis services. </p><p>- &euro;1.34 million to support initial establishment of a perinatal genetics service</p><p>- &euro;0.71m investment in tackling period poverty for the first time.</p><p>- &euro;0.54million to establish an expert Obstetric Event Support Team to support services and sites that report severe maternity incidents</p><p>- &euro;0.25m additional investment in Sexual Assault Treatment Units.</p><p>In addition, Budget 2022 increased the allocation to the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund (&euro;10 million) enabling the Department to retain a responsiveness to meet women&rsquo;s needs as they arise and accelerate progress on key initiatives where possible. On 28th April 2022 I allocated up to &euro;2.5 million of the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund to priority areas within the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, Menopause, Endometriosis, Post-natal hubs, targeted support for marginalised women. The NWIHP Annual Report published last Tuesday 5th July showcases the depth and breadth of progress underway in the HSE on these issues. Further allocations from this fund are in process.</p><p>My intention is to develop the infrastructure for women&rsquo;s health nationally so that we can reduce waiting times, support earlier diagnosis and improve care and treatment across the board. </p><p>We can see significant improvements already in a number of important areas of women&rsquo;s health:</p><p>1. <b>Menopause:</b></p><p>The majority of women who seek support for their menopause can be effectively supported within primary care by their GP, however, approximately 25% of symptomatic women will require specialist medical expertise in menopause.</p><p>These more complex cases will be dealt with in several specialist menopause clinics being developed around the country, in the following locations:</p><p>- National Maternity Hospital </p><p>- Nenagh General Hospital </p><p>- Cork </p><p>- Coombe </p><p>- University Hospital Galway </p><p>- Rotunda </p><p>- The first of the dedicated specialist menopause clinics opened in the National Maternity Hospital December 2021. </p><p>- The specialist menopause clinic within the University of Limerick Hospital Group is located in Nenagh General Hospital and the HSE has advised that this clinic opened in May of this year.</p><p>Clinics in Limerick, Cork and Galway will be developed as part of the maternity networks in the South-South West, University of Limerick, and Saolta Hospital Groups.</p><p>- We have accelerated the delivery of menopause clinics with a further ring-fenced investment of &euro;2.5 million in April 2022 that will support two additional specialist menopause clinics, at the Coombe and the Rotunda</p><p>- This will result in a total of 6 such clinics nationwide, one in each maternity network, for women who require complex, specialist care.</p><p>Clinical teams within the specialist menopause clinic setting will also provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care.</p><p>2. <b>Endometriosis</b>:</p><p>- As part of the work of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, in April 2021, I announced the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH).</p><p>- This will deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there had previously been no ready access in Ireland.</p><p>- In addition, as part of this initial investment, services for the management of endometriosis at the Coombe hospital were also expanded.</p><p>Budget 2022 funding will enable the expansion of the endometriosis service at TUH as well as the establishment of a new service for more complex endometriosis cases at Cork University Maternity Hospital.</p><p>- This investment will result in 2 supra-regional specialist centres for complex care for endometriosis for the first-time.</p><p>- In April 2022, as part of a ring-fenced investment from the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund, I announced funding for six additional interdisciplinary teams to support holistic treatment of endometriosis within each of the hospital networks. These multi-disciplinary teams will support secondary level care for women and complement supra-regional services for very complex care being established at Tallaght University Hospital and Cork University Maternity Hospital.</p><p>3. <b>Gynaecology:</b></p><p>- My Department is working with the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme to improve access to gynaecology services, through the implementation of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care. </p><p>- This centres on the establishment of one-stop &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; ambulatory gynaecology clinics. </p><p>- Roll out of the Ambulatory Gynaecology Model of Care began in 2020, and at present, 10 of these clinics are operational. This includes the new clinics at the Rotunda, Cork, Galway, Letterkenny, Waterford, - Wexford and Nenagh which are all operational, as well as the expansion of pre-existing ambulatory gynaecology clinics at the Coombe, National Maternity Hospital (NMH), and Mayo.</p><p>- Work is continuing in relation to recruitment, refurbishment and equipping of the remaining ambulatory gynaecology clinics that were funded in 2021.  </p><p>- Funding has been provided under Budget 2022 which will facilitate the establishment of additional ambulatory gynaecology clinics at the last six hospital sites.</p><p>- This will bring the total number of these clinics to 20 nationally.</p><p>4. <b>Fertility:</b></p><p>- Phase One of the roll-out of the Model of Care for Infertility has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of Regional Fertility Hubs, in order to facilitate the management of, according to NWIHP, an estimated 50%-70% of patients presenting with infertility issues at this level of intervention.</p><p>- The completion of Phase One of the roll-out, envisaged before the end of this year, will result in<b>six</b>fully operational Regional Fertility Hubs, one in each of the maternity networks / Hospital Groups across the country.</p><p>- Phase Two of the roll-out of the model of care will see the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF, in the public health system.</p><p>5. <b>Maternity strategy:</b></p><p>- Government is allocating &euro;8.66 million to the Maternity Strategy this year, on top of &euro;7.3m allocated in 2021. This is the single biggest investment in the Strategy since its publication in 2016 (in 2020, for example, &euro;1.5 million was allocated).</p><p>- The funding provided in 2021 allows for further development of community midwifery as well as specialist services. It is enabling us to expand breastfeeding supports, strengthen training and education supports for staff.</p><p>- The funding allocated for 2022 will enable the continued implementation of the National Maternity Strategy and will permit the recruitment of additional WTEs into maternity services across the country, including Consultants, Midwifery/Nursing posts, Allied Health workers, Healthcare Assistants and Administrative staff.</p><p>- These posts will cover a variety of disciplines, including, obstetrics, neonatology, endocrinology, anaesthetics, dietetics, midwifery, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy.</p><p>- The investment in 2022 will also improve the infrastructure of our maternity services by providing additional home-from-home birthing suites, upgrades to theatres and wards, as well as additional training and supports for our maternity staff.</p><p>- As part of the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022-23, this Government has committed to improving the health outcomes and experiences of women, with a targeted focus on marginalised women. In delivering on this commitment, I have allocated significant investment in 2022 for additional medical social work resources across the six maternity networks, significantly enhancing this support at what can be a very vulnerable time for these women.</p><p>6. <b>2022 Waiting List Action Plan:</b></p><p>I launched the 2022 Waiting List Action Plan on 25 February this year following extensive engagement between the Department, HSE and NTPF. </p><p>The Plan contains 45 actions to reduce and reform waiting lists across four main areas of work: delivering capacity, reforming scheduled care, enabling scheduled care reform, and addressing community care access and waiting lists. The Plan will also progress work towards achieving maximum waiting time targets, moving towards intermediate targets this year of 12 months for a hospital procedure and 18 months for an outpatient appointment. </p><p>As part of the Plan, &euro;15m has been dedicated to reducing waiting lists in three priority areas, including gynaecology (in addition to paediatric orthopaedics and bariatrics / obesity). </p><p>The 2022 Waiting List Fund will enable the expansion of ambulatory gynaecology care in Tallaght, will provide access to additional theatre capacity for gynaecology activity in the Coombe, and will provide additional inpatient / day case capacity at CUMH through increased theatre sessions.</p><p>Implementation of the Plan is being governed by a Waiting List Task Force, co-chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and CEO of the HSE.</p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/323b5-the-2022-waiting-list-action-plan/</i>.</p></reply>

Services available annually include an examination, two fillings and emergency extractions. More complex care and a broader range of treatments for patients with special needs and high-risk patients is also provided, some of which requires prior approval.</p>  <p>  I have been concerned for some time that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services.</p>  <p>  To help address this issue, an additional &euro;10 million in Budget 2022 was secured to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders including the reintroduction of Scale and Polish. In addition, an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s estimate allocation (&euro;56 million) is being used to award fee increases across a number of items including fillings.</p>  <p>  The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the Scheme this year over and above what was spent on the Scheme in 2021, &euro;40 million.</p>  <p>  Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1st May. I would hope that this significant additional investment in the Scheme will encourage more and more dentists to treat medical card patients.</p>  <p>  These measures are designed to address immediate concerns with the DTSS, pending a more substantive reform of the Scheme. It is my intention that this is addressed in the context of the implementation of the National Oral Health Policy, which sets out a body of substantial services reform. Work is underway on a governance framework for this root and branch service reform. The Chief Dental Officer is engaging with stakeholders and I understand that she will meet shortly with the Irish Dental Association.</p>  <p>  I have been assured by the HSE that their local services on the ground will assist any persons who are still experiencing problems in accessing a service.</p></reply>

In its recent report &lsquo;Forests and wood products, and its importance in climate change mitigation&rsquo; COFORD advised that 16,000 ha of annual afforestation is required if Ireland is to achieve the government target of 18% forest cover by 2050.</p>  <p>  The current Forestry Programme which commenced in 2015 and has been extended to the end of 2022 provides significant supports for afforestation. This includes grants and premiums for 12 different planting categories to promote a good species mix and covers 100% of the cost of establishing a forest.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, afforestation levels have been declining in recent years and Project Woodland was established in February 2021 to ensure that a new impetus is brought to woodland creation in Ireland.  A national shared vision for the future of Ireland's trees and forests and a new Forestry Strategy are currently being developed. This new Forest Strategy will underpin a new Forestry Programme for the period 2023 - 2027.  Supports will be included in the next Forestry Programme to incentivise afforestation. I am committed to working with all our stakeholders to substantially increase our afforestation rates over the next decade.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 provides a detailed plan for taking decisive action to achieve a 51% reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and setting Ireland on a path to reach net-zero emissions by no later than 2050.</p>  <p>  An annual afforestation target of 8,000 hectares is outlined in the Plan. However, afforestation is a voluntary land use choice for landowners. Any target that is set must be realistic and we have set an ambitious target which is a significant step up from existing levels achieved in recent years.</p></reply>

This group is drawing on expertise from across semi-state and governmental Departments to explore opportunities for the development of practices which encourage the removal of carbon in line with developments at EU level. </p>  <p>  This work will look at ways to encourage reductions in emissions and at the same time develop a potential alternative source of income for landowners and foresters. These initiatives may be similar to the existing Woodland Environment Fund (WEF), which includes a mix of private finance and state funding to pay farmers to establish native woodlands. </p>  <p>  The WEF demonstrates a willingness to tackle wider societal issues in Ireland relating to biodiversity, water quality, climate mitigation, and health and well-being.</p>  <p>  At EU level, the European Commission adopted a Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles last December, setting out how to increase removals of carbon from the atmosphere. The Communication details actions to support carbon farming and upscale this green business model to better reward land managers for carbon sequestration and biodiversity protection. </p>  <p>  The Commission is working on a regulatory framework for the certification of carbon removals, with the intention of publishing a proposal by the end of 2022 and expected entry into force by the end of 2023. </p>  <p>  In the interim, it is their intention to set up an expert group from forestry, agriculture &amp;amp; environmental specialists to advise on plans for the new framework, where Member State authorities and stakeholders can exchange best practices on carbon farming and share experiences. The work of the expert group will lead to the development of carbon certification methodologies setting-out how land-owners will be rewarded for removing carbon through their management activities.</p>  <p>  These are still early days in the development of a carbon farming initiative and the Department will continue to explore options in line with developments at EU level. </p></reply>

In 2021, our exports to over 180 countries were &euro;15.4 billion, up over &euro;1 billion, or 7%, on 2020. Dairy exports were valued at over &euro;5 billion for the third year in a row. Beef, our second largest agri-food export, is up in value at &euro;2.4 billion. The strongest growth areas were for beverages, which grew by 20%, and pigmeat, where exports were up more than 10%. </p>  <p>  My focus remains very firmly on supporting the agri-food sector to maximise exports in order to support everyone in the sector especially our farm families. This means supporting our existing and potential future UK trade, as well as further diversification in EU and third country markets. Bord Bia, with my Department's funding, continues to support companies establishing and expanding their presence in these high-value international markets.</p>  <p>  Minister of State Martin Heydon and I have also re-commenced critical engagements overseas, with in-person Trade Missions to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the US and Mexico to date in 2022. These visits included Government-to-Government discussions and engagements with key Irish customers in these markets. Our intensified programme of trade missions for 2022 also includes plans for visits to Germany, Japan, Singapore and Vietnam before the year end. </p>  <p>  I remain fully committed to supporting the agri-food sector's growth ambitions. Despite the geopolitical challenges we have faced in recent years - and continue to face - the sector is continuing to grow its exports around the world which is a credit to its resilience and adaptability. </p></reply>

Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsibility for the sector, it is our ambition this year to increase the number of licences issued to 5,250.</p><p>We currently have 648 afforestation licences, 2,098 felling licences and 402 roads licences, awaiting approval, a total of 3,148. Since 1<sup>st</sup>January, this figure has reduced from 4,803 and from 6,100 in August 2021, therefore the accumulation of licences is being cleared.  Of those on hand, those classified as being in the backlog are 530 afforestation, 1,800 felling and 243 roads. </p><p>Up to 30th June, we have issued 2,449 licences, which I acknowledge is below the projected average of 2,635. It is, however, inevitable, in the context of the annual target figures, there will be fluctuations in licence output and across categories from week to week. I remain confident that by year end we will achieve our projected targets.  In June, we achieved our overall target for the month.</p><p>As regards RUS while we committed in our Licensing Plan to increasing output this year, the Plan does not include an annual target as many RUS applications are screened in for Appropriate Assessment and are referred to ecology.  Of these, any that propose replacing the ash crop with conifer species currently require planning permission.</p><p>We have had successful engagement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in relation to this requirement for planning permission. From those discussions we expect that legislation to remove the requirement for planning permission in all cases under 10 hectares will be introduced after the Summer recess.</p><p>Output Year To Date is on RUS is 81 and we have 488 RUS applications on hand.</p><p>  The following link shows the output vs target in each of the licensing categories.</p><p>  In the interest of full transparency, details of all licences issued by category are available on the weekly dashboard. This is published on the Departmental website and is made available to all interested parties as well as being submitted to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine each week. </p></reply>

The contribution must be co-funded by the organisation concerned from other sources, for example, from income received from the public use of their facilities and services.</p>  <p>  There are currently over 1,700 FTE positions supported under the CSP.  It should be noted that there are a number of CSP supported organisations currently in a position to pay their staff the living wage rate of &euro;12.90 per hour.</p>  <p>  An independent review of the CSP was undertaken by Indecon International Economic Consultants, on behalf of my Department, with the final report published in September 2020.  Since the publication of the review report, my Department and Pobal, who administer the programme on behalf of my Department, have been working on a restructuring of the programme, in conjunction with a Consultative Group that is representative of stakeholders. As part of this ongoing work, the rates of funding under the scheme are being reviewed.</p>  <p>  My Department have recently met on two occasions with the Consultative Group and have provided them with a detailed proposal on a revised funding rate allocation model and proposed new funding rates, followed by a detailed response to the queries raised by the group. The submission received from the organisation, along with all of the feedback received from the Consultative Group will be considered in preparing my Department's budget requirements for the CSP Programme in 2023.</p></reply>

The policy recognises the opportunity for rural rejuvenation that remote working presents and commits to establishing a comprehensive and integrated national network of 400 remote working hubs by 2025.</p><p>In furtherance of this commitment, my Department&rsquo;s focus to date has been on strategically developing a national hubs network, adding capacity to Ireland's existing remote working infrastructure and supporting the establishment of new hubs. </p><p>Over &euro;100m has been invested by my department in the development of remote working facilities through programmes such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, and the Connected Hubs Call. Successful projects are developed in collaboration with local authorities and communities with many projects seeing vacant and derelict buildings in rural towns and villages converted into remote working hubs.</p><p>Last year I launched ConnectedHubs.ie, a shared online booking and payments platform for member hubs and their users. The network includes a diverse range of hubs, services and facilities, thus facilitating companies of different sizes. There are currently 249 remote and co-working facilities across the State on-boarded to the platform. This number is growing all the time meaning we are well on track to meet our target of 400 remote working hubs nationwide by 2025. This includes 8 hubs in county Kildare, which are as follow:</p><p>- National Equine Innovation Centre (NEIC) (Kildare),</p><p>- ACDAL Remote Working Hub (Allenwood),</p><p>- Newbridge Business Centre (Newbridge),</p><p>- The Hub at Ballymore Eustace (Ballymore Eustace),</p><p>- Premier Business Centres @ The Osprey (Naas),</p><p>- MERITS (Naas),</p><p>- Venture House (Ballitore),</p><p>- County Kildare Chamber iHub (Naas). </p><p>A further 5 hubs in Kildare have also been invited to join the National network, as follows: </p><p>- Monasterevin Community Centre (Monasterevin),</p><p>- Athy Community Enterprise Centre (Athy),</p><p>- AgTechUCD Innovation Centre (Celbridge),</p><p>- Clane Project Centre (Clane),</p><p>- Business Barn (Leixlip).</p><p>In February of this year, I launched the 2022 Connected Hubs Call, allocating &euro;5 million in funding to add additional capacity to the existing remote working infrastructure in remote working hubs and Broadband Connection Points throughout the country. </p><p>On Wednesday 8 June, I announced that 81 projects across the country were successful in securing funding via the Connected Hubs 2022 scheme. This included approximately &euro;250,000 being awarded to the following 5 hubs/BCPs in county Kildare - Kildare Chamber I Hub, Merits, Athy Community Enterprise Centre, the National Equine Innovation Centre and Venture House.</p><p>Details of the successful projects can be found on my Department website at: </p><p><i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/49822-2021-connected-hubs-fund-successful-applicants/</i>.</p><p>I have been clear throughout my tenure as Minister for Rural and Community Development that balanced regional development, sustainable and thriving communities, and indeed the wider national economy will all benefit from workers and employers embracing the remote working revolution.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the National Hub Network will continue to make a central contribution to the achievement of the Government's vision for rural Ireland, as set out in <i>Our Rural Future</i>.</p></reply>

As part of <i>Our Rural Future</i>, the Government is committed to ensuring that the LIS is funded into the future. The scheme makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland.</p><p>The scheme was reintroduced in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding.  From 2017 to 2021, my Department allocated &euro;80 million towards improvement works on over 3,000 non-public roads and lanes benefiting over 13,300 landowners and residents in these rural areas.</p><p>I launched the 2021 scheme with an initial budget of &euro;10.5 million. Additional funding was sourced last year from savings within my Department's vote, effectively doubling investment in LIS to bring the total investment last year to &euro;21 million.  </p><p>I was pleased, as part of Budget 2022, to announce an increase in the base funding for LIS from &euro;10.5 million to &euro;11 million this year. I am continuing to closely monitor expenditure patterns this year.  Should savings emerge, I will give consideration to again allocating additional funding to the scheme.</p><p>The prioritisation and selection of eligible LIS roads is a matter for each relevant local authority within broad parameters set down by my Department. Each year following the launch of the Scheme and the announcement of individual county allocations, each local authority submits a priority list of roads, as well as a reserve list to my Department before works commence locally.</p><p>660 LIS roads were delivered under the 2021 scheme from the total allocation of &euro;21 million.

This process operates independently of Government and does not come under my remit.</p><p>My Department funds 'As I Am' through the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO). The SSNO provides core costs for national organisations and is not provided for programme or regional costs such as referenced in the question.</p><p>Local authorities are currently developing their new Local Economic and Community Plans and there may be potential for including local autism initiatives, at their own discretion. </p><p>While my Department does not have a funding stream process by which a town can be classified autism friendly, there are funding streams available to enhance facilities and amenities in towns and villages. Such programmes and schemes include the following:</p><p><b><i>Town and Village Renewal</i></b></p><p>- The Town and Village Renewal Scheme (TVRS) was introduced in 2016 and supports small to medium capital projects which enhance the environment of town or village centres. Since its introduction, almost &euro;113 million has been allocated to more than 1,400 projects across Ireland.</p><p>- This year&rsquo;s scheme includes, under Priority category A2 , funding for projects to develop parks, plazas, public outdoor dining spaces, green spaces (including allotments) and recreational spaces/amenities in town centres to make them vibrant hubs for community enjoyment, and to increase footfall for local businesses. </p><p><b><i>LEADER </i></b></p><p>- Funding may be available through the LEADER Programme for the type of project referred to by the Deputy.  LEADER is a multi-annual programme which is delivered through 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs) around the country. </p><p>- Support under the LEADER programme is provided under a broad range of themes, one of which is Social Inclusion. </p><p>- In order for a project to be eligible for LEADER funding, it must be compatible with the actions outlined in the approved Local Development Strategy for the relevant LEADER area, and it must comply with the Operating Rules and EU Regulations in place for the programme. </p><p>- Prospective applicants should, in the first instance, contact their relevant Local Action Group, through its Implementing Partner, to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. The list of all Local Action Groups, their Implementing Partners and their contact details, is available on the Gov.ie website at: <i>www.gov.ie/en/publication/c45498-local-action-groups</i>.</p><p><b><i>Libraries</i></b></p><p>- My Department has policy responsibility for Public Libraries, and provides funding to supplement investment by local authorities in their public library services.  The current public libraries strategy, &lsquo;Our Public Libraries 2022 - Inspiring, Connecting and Empowering Communities&rsquo; includes a specific focus on communities and individuals at risk of being socially excluded, marginalised or disadvantaged.</p><p>- In 2019 my Department approved funding of almost &euro;700,000 to support the provision of sensory facilities and equipment in Public Libraries which included equipment such as a Sensory Pod in Carrigaline and sensory play equipment in all the Cork City library branches.</p><p>- Since 2019 my Department has provided funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund which supports marginalised, socially excluded and disadvantaged communities. This has included funding for library staff training to support certain library branches in becoming Autism Friendly spaces e.g. Scarriff, Co Clare and a number of library branches in Fingal County Council. In 2021 and 2022, Dormant Accounts funding has also been provided to support the provision of modern equipment in public libraries which improves accessibility for people with a disability and those with autism and sensory needs.  Funding under this programme includes sensory walls, sensory toys, sensory gardens and sensory pods.</p><p>The Autism Innovation Strategy, which is in development, will take a whole-of-government approach to advance the rights of people with autism in Irish society and will play an important role in shaping future policies and strategies across government to address challenges and barriers faced by the community of neurodiverse people in Ireland. </p></reply>

This years Scheme will place particular emphasis on projects that bring vacant and derelict buildings and sites back into use as multipurpose spaces in line with the objectives of &ldquo;<i>Our Rural Future &ndash;Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Policy 2021-2025&rdquo;</i>. </p><p>The following table outlines the funding provided through the TVRS for Cork County Council since 2016. In relation to funding that was subsequently returned from Cork County Council to my Department, I can confirm that an amount of &euro;9,062.28 which was claimed for an ineligible project element (the installation of glazing) for the Kinsale 2017 project was returned. <table>    <tr>       <th>Scheme </th>       <th>Town or Village </th>       <th>Amount approved </th>       <th>Description of Project </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TVRS 2016 </td>       <td>Bandon </td>       <td>&euro;47,500 </td>       <td>Commemorative space to celebrate 1916 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TVRS 2016 </td>       <td>Blarney </td>       <td>&euro;47,500 </td>       <td>Tourism - Interactive sculpture of Chieftain McCarthy </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>TVRS 2016 </td>       <td>Boherbue </td>       <td>&euro;47,500 </td>       <td>Footpath, Landscaping &amp;amp;

I announced details of the 2022 LIS in early April, which included &euro;879,099 for County Cork.  </p><p>Since the scheme was reintroduced in 2017, County Cork has been allocated a total of &euro;6.94 million. This represents the third largest allocation at a national level.</p><p>Last year, I was in a position to double the initial LIS allocation to &euro;21 million following the identification of savings in other capital areas. This year, I am continuing to closely monitor expenditure patterns. Should savings emerge, I will give consideration to again allocating additional funding to the scheme.</p></reply>

These hubs are all members of the National Hub Network and voucher bookings may be made via the Network's online booking platform connectedhubs.ie</p><p>Connectedhubs.ie is a shared online booking engine that provides a 'one stop shop' for users to find their nearest hub and for hubs to advertise their services and take bookings. This service is currently provided free of charge to both the user and the member hubs.</p><p>Under the Connected Hubs Voucher Scheme, at least 10,000 hot desk working days will be provided for free. The scheme is aimed at both existing hub users and those accessing hub facilities for the first time. Each registered user has been allocated 3 vouchers to use at participating hubs.</p><p>Vouchers first became available on 27th June and are redeemable until 31st August 2022. A second phase of the Scheme will launch in September. This second phase will allow more hubs to sign up to the Network and to take part in the voucher scheme. Any hubs who are interested in taking part should contact info@connectedhubs.ie to register their hub on the connectedhubs.ie platform.</p><p>As more hubs are added to the Network, more hot desks will become available to book online, including via the voucher scheme. </p><p>With regards to the area highlighted by the Deputy, the Connected Hubs team have spoken to and engaged with representatives from a number of hubs in the area since early this year. These hubs have been invited to join the National Hub Network and to be onboarded to <i>connectedhubs.ie</i>. </p><p>It should be noted that there are a number of other hubs in Cork City and county that are members of the Network and are participating in the Voucher Scheme. Locations of these hubs may be found at www.connectedhubs.ie.</p></reply>
