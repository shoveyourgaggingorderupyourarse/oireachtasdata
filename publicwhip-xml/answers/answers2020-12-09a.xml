    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-12-09a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020120900069#WRB01600"><p>Weather conditions are a major factor in &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; in levels of emissions at this time of year. Calm and foggy conditions, together with domestic burning of solid fuel can lead to a build-up of air pollutants far greater than those normally experienced. These events also serve to demonstrate how the choices we make in heating our homes can have a significant bearing on the quality of the air in the communities in which we live.     It is important that where low smoke zones have been established, such as Ennis, that there are adequate measures in place to ensure regulatory compliance.  Responsibility for ensuring such compliance rest with local authorities under Section10 of the Air Pollution Act (Marketing, Sale, Distribution and Burning of Specified Fuels) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 326 of 2012). My Department has commenced discussions with the Local Authority sector to develop a regional approach to air quality enforcement. The intention is to establish dedicated resources within regional lead authorities to provide co-ordination, expertise and advice to support effective and consistent implementation of air quality legislation across the country. </p>  <p>  Ireland has a network of 84 monitoring stations which measure levels of air pollutants across the state.  The provision of improved data from this network has highlighted the extent to which solid fuels, such as turf, peat and wet wood, as well as bituminous coal, contribute to the emissions in our air and this must be taken into consideration in the development of new measures to regulate to a broader extent the use of solid fuels in the residential sector. </p>  <p>  The first step in this process will be the launch of a solid fuel public consultation which will be published alongside the Clean Air Strategy early next year. The consultation will seek views on new measures to regulate the use of all solid fuels in the residential sector, while the Clean Air Strategy will set out a comprehensive cross Government programme of policies and measures that will tackle all sources of air pollution, including those from the transport, agriculture and residential sectors.  </p></reply>

This is being done with a view to a national transition to lower polluting fuels for residential heating and will:</p><p>- Assess the merits of a national approach to regulating sold fuel;</p><p>- Determine which solid fuels should be regulated;</p><p>- Consider how these fuels should be regulated;</p><p>- Set out an appropriate timeline for the implementation of any new regulations.</p><p>The consultation will be launched alongside Ireland's first Clean Air Strategy early next year and the responses received will inform the decisions to be made regarding the implementation and enforcement of a nationwide extension.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).  I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.</p><p>The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within County Kildare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence.</p><p>I am advised by NBI that, as of  3 December 2020, over 139,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. Surveys have been completed in the following areas across Co Kildare, Killashee, Oughterard, Naas Rural, Rathmore, Kill, Kilteel, Carnalway, Gilltown, Ballymore Eustace, Bodenstown, Naas Urban, Newtown and Donaghcumper. The next step is for NBI to develop network designs to deliver the new fibre to the home network to these premises, followed by pre build and build works. I am advised that NBI intend to have completed surveys at this location in early 2021 and the indicative target for the commencement of network build at this location is late 2021.Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 December, 217 sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Affairs for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. 59 publicly accessible BCPs across the country are now live. BCPs locations due for installation in Kildare include Backgate Lodge, Kilkee Demesne, Castledermot and Crookstown Further Education and Training Centre.  Bigstone Community Hall is now fully connected with public WiFi and Lullymore Heritage Park is installed and waiting connectivity.  Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.  </p><p>Rathmore National School and St Davids National School in Co Kildare will be connected for educational access as part of this initiative by the end of the year. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education and Skills to prioritise other schools with no high speed broadband, within the intervention area for connection over the term of the NBP.</p></reply>

The NBP deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.I am advised by NBI that, as of 3 December 2020, over 139,000 premises across all counties have been surveyed which is ahead of the full year survey target of 120,000 that had been projected by the company. Of this figure, over 16,000 premises have been surveyed to date in Cork including in the areas of Carrigaline and Midelton, and network designs completed to deliver the new Fibre to the Home (FTTH) network there. </p><p>Surveying is the first step towards delivering the new fibre network and involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This informs design solutions for provision of the fibre network to each and every premises in the surveyed area and leads to detailed designs. The detailed designs are then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with Open eir for the area, where Open eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose and the make ready of other required infrastructure. This step also informs decisions on equipment ordering. Survey data is also needed to initiate pre-works which pave the way for the deploying of fibre. Pre-works involve construction of new duct routes, erection of poles, building chambers, and tree trimming. On completion of these pre-works, the main construction works can commence. This involves deploying fibre overhead on poles and in underground ducts, splicing of fibre, and unblocking of ducts. Once the main construction works are completed and the appropriate level of testing has been undertaken, the fibre network can be commissioned and end users can order their connection.</p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are expected shortly in Carrigaline and  will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from early 2021 retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network. </p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie.  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence.I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the level of information available on the deployment of the NBI network and I am advised that NBI is working to provide more detail on its website, with a rolling update on network build plans.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 3 December 2020, 217 publicly accessible BCP sites have been installed by NBI, with 59 already connected to high speed broadband service. The remaining locations will be connected through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development in the coming months. In Cork, BCPs at Ballindangan Community Centre, Aghabullogue Community Centre, Castletownkenneigh Community Centre, Lissavard Community Centre, Whitechurch Community Centre and T.O. Park Labbamollaga Community Facility have been connected.  Further BCPs at Bere Island Heritage Centre, Laharn Heritage Centre and Ballydaly Community Hall have had infrastructure installed by NBI and will be connected in the coming weeks. </p><p>Some 58 schools throughout Ireland have now had infrastructure installed by NBI, with 22 schools already connected to high speed broadband. In Cork, a number of schools including Clogagh and Ballycroneen National School Schools will be connected as part of this initiative. My Department continues to work with Department of Education and Skills to prioritise the remaining schools to be connected over the term of the NBP. Further details can be found at .</p></reply>

I have met with representatives of the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) on a number of occasions to discuss the matters raised in the  Grant Thornton report which was commissioned by the IPU.</p>  <p>  A lot of work has been done over the past few years to develop the network and this has had a positive effect for both postmasters and customers. This momentum needs to be maintained and if An Post, the postmasters and Government work together we can ensure that the network can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community-focused services. </p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland.  What we are doing now is working with An Post  to investigate the scope to channel additional services through the network.  As with any business the post office needs to develop commercial strategies to enable it to grow and maintain its relevance for its users. All options will be considered fully and efforts will be redoubled to give effect to our commitment to ensuring a sustainable and viable post office network. </p>  <p>  In the circumstances, there are no proposals to introduce a Government funded subsidy for the post office network. </p></reply>

In order to improve traceability of waste received and to counter the trade in stolen metal, an amendment to the Waste Management (Facility Permit and Registration) Regulations was introduced in 2014 to require the following at all permitted facilities receiving/purchasing waste: the production of proof of identity and current address for the person supplying the material, records to be kept of the registration number and waste collection permit number of the delivery vehicle, records to be kept describing the materials, time and date of sale, weight and amount paid, and the provision of a signed statement by the person supplying the material indicating that they are the lawful owner.</p><p>Local authorities continue to undertake inspections to ensure compliance with these regulations and these inspections were included in the National Waste Enforcement Priorities for 2020. In addition, officials from my Department continue to participate in the National Metal Theft Forum, which was established in 2012 by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to bring together State stakeholders, including local authorities and the Department of Justice, and industry representatives in order to improve information sharing and to develop a metal theft prevention and crime reduction plan.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. Budget 2021 provides &euro;109 million in capital funding to support lower income households to retrofit their homes with &euro;100 million of this funding allocated to the Warmer Homes Scheme.   There are currently over 7,000 homes on the Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are: currently undergoing works; have been allocated to contractors for works; have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor, or are awaiting the initial survey of their home. Eligible homes are allocated on a first come, first served basis, and the average time between application and allocation to a contractor is now 22 months.  The wait time is a result of strong demand for what is an extremely popular scheme. The work programme was also negatively impacted by Covid-19, particularly between March and June when the scheme was fully paused in line with Government guidelines. The SEAI does not compile the information requested on waiting times on a county by county basis. </p>  <p>  In addition to the increased budget, capacity by the industry to deliver more activity has also increased due to a new, broader contractor panel to provide works which commenced last month. Recommendations on the implementation of changes to the scheme to better target those most in need will also be finalised shortly.</p></reply>

There will be two price reviews over the decade to 2030, one of which will be decided on by CRU in the coming weeks. The costs for grid investment covered by regulatory price reviews are borne by electricity consumers and not funded through the Exchequer.    The strategic objectives for the price review out to 2025 are: facilitating a secure low carbon future, transforming the role of the distribution system operator (ESB Networks), increasing efficiency and protecting customers and ensuring security of supply.</p>  <p>  The CRU as part of its oversight has issued a draft determination for funding over the next five years to the end of 2025 (PR5 - Price Review 5) and this determination can be found on the CRU website. It indicates a spend of &euro;6.78 billion. This is a draft decision and the final determination is expected in the coming weeks.  </p>  <p>  This price review covers up to 2025 only and thus does not fully factor in all the requirements of the Government's Climate Action Plan or Programme for Government, including substantive electrification of heat and transport commitments and the delivery of at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030. The System Operators are assessing what the potential costs are for the grid to deliver on such commitments. </p>  <p>  EirGrid publishes a variety of reports, some on an annual basis, such as the Transmission Development Plan, the Transmission Forecast Statement and the Generation Capacity Statement, all of which provide detailed analysis of grid development needs and projects.</p></reply>

Officials in the Department are alert to issues raised directly by the public and these inform the Department&rsquo;s ongoing engagement process and policy formation.  </p>  <p>  The Wage Subsidy Schemes are some of the main tools with which we are protecting the income of employees who otherwise would not be working and it is hoped that it will be a major boost in saving the businesses for which they work. However, whilst I acknowledges the seriousness of the issue you have raised and its impact on those affected, I cannot mandate how temporary payments received under the Wage Subsidy Schemes are treated in lending sustainability evaluations by regulators and lenders. </p>  <p>  The banking crisis we faced over ten years ago was fueled by unsustainable lending. There are now thankfully far firmer regulatory controls and restrictions on lenders. Speaking on this particular issue, on 7 May the Governor of the Central Bank publicly noted that if an individual borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have changed such that doubt is cast over the sustainability of potential borrowing, it is in the best interests of the borrower and the bank if the situation is reviewed.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, as Minister for Finance, I cannot mandate or overrule the internal risk assessment processes in any bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the State has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. The Relationship Framework for PTSB, the bank referred to in correspondence supplied by the Deputy, can be found here: </p>  <p>  https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/5c6ad6-ptsb-relationship-framework-april-2015/  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, officials in the Department contacted the bank for a general comment, on a no-name basis, on how they are managing the matter you have raised and were advised of the following: </p>  <p>  "We have a duty of care to our customers to ensure that any lending is affordable for them. In accordance with consumer protection requirements, we are facilitating mortgage-approved customers on the EWSS in drawing down their loans subject to their employers providing assurance on the sustainability of their income when the EWSS comes to an end. We are also processing approval in principle applications from customers in receipt of the PUP and we are not excluding any sectors from applying for a loan. We are doing everything we can to support our customers at this difficult time and are working with them on a case by case basis to assess their individual situations."</p></reply>

It applies to businesses who, under the specific terms of the regulations, are required to prohibit or significantly restrict members of the public from accessing their business premises, with the result that the business is required to temporarily close or to operate at significantly reduced levels. Support provided under CRSS is intended to enable businesses to meet normal fixed costs associated with their business premises such as rent, insurance, utilities and so on, during the period which they are subject to such restrictions.</p><p>Domestic travel restrictions or social distancing measures are not the level of restrictions to which the CRSS refers.  To be eligible to make a claim under CRSS, the applicable restrictions should require the business to either prohibit, or significantly restrict, customers from accessing the business premises in which the relevant business activity is carried on.  </p><p>These has been an easing of restrictions on businesses, with a phased move to Level 3 restrictions nationally from 1 December, with some restrictions easing from 4 December and 18 December respectively. From 4 December, bars, cafes and restaurants which serve substantial meals prepared onsite are allowed to open for indoor dining.  A substantial meal is defined in the current public health regulations as a meal which might be expected to be served as main meal/ main course at lunch or dinner and for which it would be reasonable to charge a sum that is not less than &euro;9.  The meal must also be substantially prepared on the premises in a &ldquo;food preparation area&rdquo;.  A food preparation area is defined as an indoor part of a premises which is structurally adapted and used for the purpose of preparing food for consumption by customers on or off the premises. It does not include a tent, caravan, vehicle, storage container or other temporary structure. </p><p>A pub serving substantial meals, which are prepared in a food preparation area located in the pub premises rather than ordered in from another business, was allowed to reopen on 4 December and, from that date, ceased to qualify for CRSS. However, the pub would be eligible to claim an additional week&rsquo;s support under CRSS (referred to as a &lsquo;restart week&rsquo;) to assist it in meeting the costs of reopening. </p><p>Any business that can reopen without having to prohibit or significantly restrict access to their business premises, but chooses not to reopen, will not be eligible to claim under CRSS.</p><p>Pubs that do not serve substantial meals that are prepared in a food preparation area located in the premises are not allowed to reopen and, therefore, remain eligible to claim under CRSS.  </p><p>If a pub is prohibited from opening under the current public health regulations because it does not meet the criteria in relation to serving substantial meals then, I understand that it is Revenue&rsquo;s view that the pub continues to qualify for CRSS.  This is regardless of whether the particular pub had put in place arrangements with a food supplier to provide meals to customers at the pub in order to open in the past.  Under the current regulations, to be allowed to open, a pub must serve substantial meals that are &lsquo;substantially prepared&rsquo; onsite in a food preparation area &ndash; serving meals that have been prepared elsewhere does not qualify.  If a particular pub does not meet the criteria to open then it should qualify for CRSS (where the other criteria are met). </p><p>On 4 December, I announced an additional seasonal support for businesses who cannot reopen through December. Payable for a period of three weeks beginning 21 December, the additional support will provide up to double the amount of the weekly CRSS support payment due subject to the statutory maximum payment of &euro;5,000 per week. </p><p>The CRSS is an additional measure for businesses in a region subject to significant Covid-19 restrictions.<b></b>Businesses who do not qualify under this scheme may be entitled to support under various measures put in place by Government, including existing supports available under the COVID Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) and the range of measures announced as part of Budget 2021 to support  particular sectors including Tourism and live entertainment. They may also be eligible to warehouse VAT and PAYE (Employer) debts and also excess payments received by employers under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme, and the balance of Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 for self-assessed taxpayers if applicable. </p></reply>

Accordingly, the Government has dealt with this through the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020, which is currently being considered by the Oireachtas.  Part 10 of this legislation will allow any UK/Gibraltar-authorised insurance entity to continue the administration of both life and non-life insurance policies written before the end of the transition period.  This &lsquo;run-off&rsquo; regime will apply for a period of fifteen years from the date of the end of the transition period, and be subject to a review by the Central Bank in year twelve.  It should be noted that, under this regime, no new policies or renewals are allowed to be written by UK/Gibraltar-authorised insurers unless they receive authorisation from an EU/EEA member state.</p>  <p>  Finally, with less than four weeks left until the end of the transition period, I would urge all insurance providers who provide services to Irish consumers to finalise their readiness and contingency plans and take necessary actions in accordance with the relevant European Commission guidance.   I would also urge any consumer who have concerns about their insurance policy to contact their insurance provider, who should be able to provide them with details of arrangements to ensure continuity of service.  This includes whether the consumer can amend policies, or how the company will pay claims associated with policies, written prior to the end of the transition period.</p></reply>

A beneficiary will have access to the Group A threshold of &euro;335,000 for all gifts and inheritances received from disponers within that group.

The value of gifts and inheritances received from all disponers in Group A are aggregated together and the amount over the Group A tax-free threshold (currently &euro;335,000) will be subject to CAT, currently at a rate of 33%.</p></reply>

This project is aimed at bringing a comprehensive regeneration of this historic area through extensive public realm improvements that includes some flood defence elements. </p>  <p>  The wider Lower Lee Flood Relief Scheme already had a strong focus on public realm and conservation, and the design team has built up relevant skillsets in these areas for the Cork City area.  Given this, and the proposal to implement some flood defence elements into the Morrison&rsquo;s Island Project, the Steering Group considered that it would be an appropriate, cost-effective and expeditious approach for the same design team to lead on the design of Cork City Council&rsquo;s Morrison&rsquo;s Island Public Realm Project, including the preparation of method statements and technical drawings. OPW supported this arrangement and a Collateral Warranty was put in place between the three parties.

OPW believes that the nett benefit for the town of now having effective flood defences in places outweighs the mitigated short term impacts.  </p>  <p>  Over many years, Bandon has been badly affected by periodic severe flood events that greatly adversely affected the economic and general well-being of the town.  Although it will take time for the river and its environs to recover fully from the impacts, the town&rsquo;s economic and social prosperity is considered to be enhanced due to having the threat of periodic flooding greatly diminished - to the 1 in 100-year flood event standard of flood protection.  In addition, scheme elements such as improvements to Bandon Bridge, the construction of a new pedestrian footbridge and other public realm enhancements have improved the fabric of the town and allow for greater enjoyment of the town for its citizens and for visitors to Bandon.</p></reply>

The OPW appointed Arup Consulting Engineers (Design consultants), and Ryan Hanley in association with MKOS (Environmental consultants), following open tender competitions in 2013, to develop the scheme and bring it through all stages to full implementation. </p>  <p>  Both procurements were undertaken using the Public Works Contract (PWC) Forms of Tender and Standard Conditions of Engagement. The scope of the tendered work was defined on the known requirements at tender stage, but also included the undertaking of detailed specific investigations. As is usual in these types of projects, these investigations highlighted the need for further analysis and input in respect of hydrology, hydraulic modelling, public consultations and environmental assessments. While it is acknowledged that overall expenditure will exceed the initial tender sums, such additions to the tender sum are necessary and do not render the contract materially different. It would be neither feasible nor cost effective to re-tender services once a given increase in additional work is reached, as this would cause inordinate delay, inconsistency in design evolution and unsustainable cost inefficiencies, including possible cost duplications arising. Given the nature of flood relief schemes generally, and this one in particular, the continuity and the evolving understanding of the environmental and technical detail is critical to the success and viability of this complex project.  </p>  <p>  There is no direct contractual relationship between OPW and the Paul Hogarth Company or Alastair Coey with respect to the LLFRS as both are sub consultants to the main design consultants.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

The involvement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  The participation of Israel in the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation programme is governed by a 2014 agreement between the EU and Israel that makes Israel subject to the relevant EU legislation establishing Horizon 2020 and its implementing rules. Article 6 of the agreement states that the agreement does not apply to the territory occupied by Israel in 1967. Ongoing implementation and oversight of the Horizon 2020 agreement with Israel is a matter principally for the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  Horizon 2020 regulations stipulate that research and innovation activities must comply with ethical principles and relevant EU and international legislation, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and the European Convention on Human Rights. Several mechanisms are in place at the level of programme implementation to ensure compliance.</p>  <p>  The human rights situation in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory is a priority for Ireland and we takes every opportunity to raise human rights concerns with all appropriate interlocutors. We will continue to work with EU partners to promote coherent and effective EU action to push for an end to settlement expansion and a lasting and peaceful two-state solution.</p></reply>

Inspectors engage in a comprehensive programme of training prior to  conducting these inspections.  They also engage in a programme of continuous professional development in the area of special educational needs.  The focus of the SEN inspections is on the outcomes for pupils with special educational needs in schools and on the extent to which schools use the resources it receives to improve outcomes for pupils with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  In relation to the provision of assistive technology support, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including assistive technology. SENOs make recommendations to my Department where assistive technology is required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making such recommendations, as set out in Circular 0010/2013.   </p>  <p>  In order to qualify for equipment under the assistive technology scheme, a child must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the child to access the curriculum. It must also be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs.</p>  <p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. It is open to parents to contact SENOs directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available at: www.ncse.ie/seno-contact-list&rdquo;</p></reply>

Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with public health advice. This guidance is focused on the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre and HSE has published guidance in relation to the return to school for at risk groups.  The advice confirms that for the vast majority of children, can return to school and it is important for the overall health and wellbeing for children to attend school. This is consistent with public health advice internationally.  The guidance is available at the following link.</p><p>My Department has published guidance to support schools in making adapted education provision for pupils/students with an underlying medical condition who cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at very high risk to COVID-19.  </p><p>The guidance for primary schools on supporting such pupils is available via the following link:  </p><p>The guidance for post-primary schools on supporting such students is available via the following link  </p><p>The guidance provides that supports will be provided for these pupils/students through designated teachers from within the staffing resources of the school. Schools have discretion to manage and redistribute their teaching support resources in order to best meet the learning needs of their pupils/students, including pupils/students at &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; to COVID-19. Facilitating engagement with and among pupils is essential to their learning experience and maintaining their social and emotional development. </p><p>Teachers can facilitate this through online interaction, providing feedback on work completed, organising project work that pupils can complete as part of a group and providing learning experiences based on pair work and group work. Early and ongoing two-way communication between the pupil&rsquo;s school, class teacher, designated teacher where relevant, and the home will be essential to supporting the pupils&rsquo; engagement with their learning and their continuous connection with their classmates and school community. </p><p>Overall responsibility for ensuring that pupils/students who are at very high risk to COVID-19 receive appropriate support to engage adequately with learning remains with the school in which they are enrolled. </p><p>My Department has also published guidance in respect of the COVID -19 operational supports for Primary and Post Primary schools to fully and safely reopen in a sustainable way while minimising risk associated with COVID-19. This is available at www.gov.ie/backtoschool </p><p>The operational supports include funding of approx. &euro;84.7 million so that schools can employ replacement teachers, SNAs and administrative staff. There is additional funding of &euro;41.2 million, for substitution in primary schools. This will provide more certainty on the availability of substitutes for primary schools and cover substitutions that are not covered by existing schemes. The Supply Panel Scheme has been expanded nationwide and over 300 posts have been allocated to provide substitute cover through these panels. The purpose of supply panels is to support schools to manage the sick leave and other absences by having a supply of teachers to meet substitution needs when required. Schools will continue to be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel.</p><p>On 21 August, I announced a series of changes that would be made to assessment arrangements for both Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate examinations for 2021. This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p><p>These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC), the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p><p>As schools have significant autonomy in determining how to sequence and pace learning for students in their schools, no centrally prescribed adjustment of the curriculum and courses of study would have been effective for students taking the certificate examinations in 2021. Consequently, the most appropriate way to reflect and take account of the challenges for students that have occurred in 2019/20 and may occur in 2020/21 was to incorporate adjustments to the certificate examinations in 2021.</p><p>These changes to the national assessment arrangements were made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. The changes provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>Further clarification on the assessment arrangements for 2021 for certain subjects will issue shortly. </p><p>It is my firm intention to operate the conventional 2021 state examinations, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. This is shared by the SEC, which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.</p><p>The SEC has valuable learning from the experience of running the 2020 November examinations, notwithstanding that the numbers taking these examinations is significantly lower than the number due to sit examinations in 2021.  The measures relating to COVID-19 that have been put in place for the November examinations will be considered as part of the planning for examinations in 2021.</p><p>The SEC has commenced its contingency planning for the 2021 examinations, recognising that a flexible and agile approach is necessary in light of the continuing fast-moving environment linked to COVID-19.  It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. Project briefs for relevant subjects have issued earlier than usual and practical coursework will be submitted two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. Teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study.  These changes to the Leaving Certificate assessment arrangements for 2021 are deigned to provide reassurance to students, their parents/guardians, teachers and schools.</p><p>In addition, an advisory group of key stakeholders, which advised on altered arrangements for the 2020 state examinations, was reconvened on 25 November in an online meeting to perform a similar role in respect of the 2021 examinations. The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teachers, school leadership and management bodies, the SEC, the NCCA and the Department, including the National Educational Psychological Service.

The objective of the programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement. </p><p>In recent years entry to the school meals programme has been confined to DEIS schools in addition to schools identified by Department of Education and Skills as having levels of concentrated disadvantage that would benefit from access to the programme.  </p><p>Prior to the introduction of DEIS in 2005, all schools and organisations that were part of one of a number of Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; initiatives for disadvantaged schools were eligible to participate in the programme, which included Breaking the Cycle, Giving Children an Even Break, the Disadvantaged Area Scheme, Home School Community Liaison and the School Completion Programme.  These schools and organisations have continued to remain in the programme. </p><p>Participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary with the onus being on the individual eligible schools to make an application.  Schools and organisations must reapply for funding in advance of each school year and are required to submit detailed records at the end of the school year.  Funding is based on a rate of payment per meal, per child, per day.</p><p>The number of schools, primary schools, post-primary schools, special schools and alternative education settings that provide school meals by county in tabular form is in table 1 of the attached Tabular Statement. </p><p>The percentage of primary schools, post-primary schools, special schools and alternative education settings that provide school meals in tabular form is in table 2 of the attached Tabular Statement.</p><p><b>Table 1 &ndash; Number providing School Meals by County</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Primary Schools</th>       <th>Post-Primary Schools</th>       <th>Special Schools</th>       <th>Alternative Education   Settings</th>       <th>Number of Schools</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow</td>       <td>19</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>28</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>34</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork</td>       <td>54</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>27</td>       <td>117</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal</td>       <td>122</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>153</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin</td>       <td>189</td>       <td>77</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>80</td>       <td>363</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway</td>       <td>48</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>70</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry</td>       <td>37</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>59</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>24</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>22</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>18</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>16</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick</td>       <td>26</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>12</td>       <td>51</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>21</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth</td>       <td>15</td>       <td>10</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo</td>       <td>75</td>       <td>17</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>97</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan</td>       <td>16</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly</td>       <td>20</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>27</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon</td>       <td>21</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>1</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>32</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo</td>       <td>22</td>       <td>5</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary</td>       <td>31</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>54</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford</td>       <td>14</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>9</td>       <td>31</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath</td>       <td>13</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>3</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford</td>       <td>34</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>8</td>       <td>55</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow</td>       <td>11</td>       <td>4</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>2</td>       <td>19</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2 &ndash; Percentage providing School Meals</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Total Number </th>       <th>Number providing School Meals</th>       <th>% Providing School Meals</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Primary Schools</td>       <td>3105</td>       <td>868</td>       <td>27.95%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Post-Primary Schools</td>       <td>722</td>       <td>283</td>       <td>39.20%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Special Schools</td>       <td>134</td>       <td>76</td>       <td>56.72%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Alternative Educations Settings</td>       <td>Not available*</td>       <td>234</td>       <td>Not Available</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>*</b>The total number of these types of organisations is not held.  </p></reply>

He will be supported on cessation of CE by the Activation Service in my Department to complete the  one remaining module to attain this qualification. </p>  <p>  His CE  employment was extended due my Departments response to the pandemic. It was further extended during the recent Level 5 restrictions.  Funding for this participant will cease on 15/1/2021.  .</p>  <p>  The priority for my Department is to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcomes for participants.  Places on these work programmes will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, while maintaining the role of CE as an active labour market programme.  </p>  <p>  I am fully committed to the future of CE and will continue to support and improve CE for the benefit of the CE participants and the valuable contribution being made to local communities. </p></reply>

The voluntary contributions scheme is not intended to cover short-term benefits such as illness or jobseeker's benefits nor are voluntary contributions reckonable for eligibility for invalidity pension.</p>  <p>  To reflect the limited coverage afforded by the voluntary contributions scheme, the associated contribution charges are significantly lower than those applicable to compulsory social insurance which provides cover for short-term benefits such as jobseeker's benefit. For example, a combined employee/employer contribution of up to 15.05% of an employee's reckonable earnings is paid in respect of an employee which covers the employee for the full range of social insurance benefits. In contrast, the voluntary contribution charge is 6.6% of the preceding year's income of a former compulsory insured employee, subject to a minimum annual charge of &euro;500.  </p>  <p>  The significant charge variance reflects the difference in the social insurance benefits covered by compulsory social insurance and voluntary social insurance.  Any extension in the benefits covered by the voluntary contributions scheme would be a substantial change to the nature and scope of the scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  Any such development would also necessitate consideration of a commensurate increase in the contribution charge.    </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Nearly 55,000 individuals will benefit from this decision at an estimated cost of almost &euro;12 million.</p>  <p>  I was very pleased to obtain the approval of Government for these payments. There are many individuals and families who have lost their job or business as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and have been out of work for several months now. The Bonus will help to ease the financial burden on them at this very difficult time. </p>  <p>  For administrative and legal reasons, the Bonus payment has always been paid by reference to a specific week, and this is the standard practice across all social welfare schemes.  Any change to that practice would have to be considered in the overall policy, administrative and budgetary context. </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Policy is coordinated by the Department of Justice. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has statutory responsibility under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased that my Department has been able to allocate additional funding of &euro;4.7 million to Tusla to support DSGBV services across the country in 2021. A total of &euro;30 million will be made available by DCEDIY to Tusla to fund DSGBV services. This includes a &euro;2.7 million increase in core funding, bringing core service provision to &euro;28 million, with an additional &euro;2 million of one-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of COVID-19. This increase in funding reflects my personal commitment on this issue. I am hopeful that these additional resources will enable services to continue their valuable supports for victims and their families at a very vulnerable time in their lives.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that not all funding to this sector issues via my Department.  The Department of Justice allocates funding to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and support victims of crime, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Many voluntary organisations in the DSGBV sector have also received capital funding via the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), which is administered by local authorities on behalf of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  While funding will be crucial to our success, it is imperative that we have the right structures in place to respond as effectively as possible to DSGBV. Under the Programme for Government, we have committed to undertaking an audit of responsibility for DSGBV across Departments and State agencies. The procurement process to secure the expertise to conduct this audit is under way, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Justice. We expect that the audit will be completed early next year, and the Government will act on the basis of that audit. </p></reply>

I have previously spoken with survivor representatives about their concerns and expectations for the future of this site. I have further engaged with them since news of the planning applications was highlighted to me I and will continue to do so. I share the concerns of survivor groups about the proposed development.</p>  <p>  The investigation of burial arrangements where deaths occurred in Mother and Baby Homes was a key focus of the terms of reference for the statutory Commission of Investigation.  We know from the Commission's Fifth Interim Report, which was published in April 2019, that it has dedicated significant time and effort to advancing its investigations into the burial arrangements of the children who died in while resident in Bessborough. </p>  <p>  Notably, the Commission reported at that time that it had seen no physical or documentary evidence of systematic burials within the grounds of Bessborough, but considered it highly likely that burials took place there. The Commission did not consider it feasible to excavate the 60 acres involved. There was also uncertainty as to whether children who died may be buried at a recognised graveyard but in respect of which records could not be located. The Commission asked for public assistance in furthering its investigation into these matters and indicated that it would include any further information in its Final Report. </p>  <p>  I received the Commission&rsquo;s Final Report on 30 October. It is my intention to publish the Report in the week of 11 January 2021. </p>  <p>  It is important to be clear that the consideration of any development application in respect of these lands is a matter for Cork City Council as the relevant Local Authority, or for An Bord Pleanala where the application is a Strategic Housing Development. I do not have any statutory powers or responsibilities in relation to relevant considerations under the Planning and Development Acts. </p>  <p>  However, there is scope for the Council, or An Bord Pleanala, to consider archaeological and heritage concerns in the context of any proposal or application for redevelopment of a site, following on from submissions made which may raise such concerns. In addition, the planning process includes a specific focus on public consultation and it appears that campaigners are continuing to raise their concerns directly with the relevant authorities.</p></reply>

Therefore responsibility for examinations and assessments rests ultimately with each individual institution.</p>  <p>  The national co-ordination group for tertiary education, which includes representatives from my Department and third level institutions, is meeting regularly to discuss key issues in the tertiary sector including issues around examinations and assessments. </p>  <p>  In providing guidance for higher education providers to return to learning safely for the 2020/21 academic year, my Department published a three-pillar guidance framework, consistent with public health requirements. This included an adaptation framework to assist institutions to continuously adapt to meet the challenges posed by this pandemic. </p>  <p>  Though HEIs are planning for a phased and incremental increase in face to face learning on campus for some priority groups in Semester 2, for the remainder of this semester on campus activity is prioritised for essential learning and activities including mandatory skills, practical, mandatory training and assessment.  Further and higher education institutions should continue to deliver the majority of their classes online. Given the scale and diversity within third-level provision, higher and further education institutions will be equipped to determine in which circumstances onsite presence is required.</p>  <p>  My Department has been informed by LYIT that nursing students are assessed in accordance with the NMBI approved course schedule and curriculum. This includes facilitation of pre-Christmas examinations for Year 2 and Year 4 student nurses in advance of clinical placement commencing 28 December (for Year 4) and 4 January (for Year 2) respectively. Both these student year cohorts are going on clinical practice placements and starting internships (Year 4). Each cohort of students will have one examination online and this can be completed remotely, off campus with the remaining two written examinations over two days, to ensure that those travelling will only require one overnight stay. Any students who have any mitigating or extenuating circumstances will be afforded the opportunity to defer without disadvantage or prejudice to Autumn 2021 and to progress on clinical practice placements as planned. Special accommodation has been arranged for any student who has requested or indicated any such mitigating or extenuating circumstances. </p>  <p>  My Department has been further informed by LYIT that written examinations were scheduled in line with curriculum module assessments as they could not be scheduled after clinical placements commenced in January 2021. Students will then be in different HSE Clinical settings through Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. Therefore, it would not be in accordance with best practice or NPHET guidelines to request students to return for assessments once placement commenced.  Furthermore, this cohort of Year 4 student nurses will be paid employees of the HSE as intern nurses from January to August 2021 and unable to attend for examination during their internship. </p>  <p>  LYIT is confident that written assessment can proceed adhering to HSE and NPHET guidelines respecting social distancing and examination regulations and guidelines. The examinations will be conducted in a controlled setting adhering to strict guidelines.</p></reply>

Prisoners are a recognised vulnerable group for a number of reasons and an outbreak of Covid-19 in a prison could have potentially devastating consequences. </p><p>I understand that every effort has been made by the IPS to continue physical visits during this pandemic however, following Government and NPHET advice it was necessary to suspend physical visits to prisons, firstly in March and more recently in October.  The Service is acutely aware of the need for prisoners to maintain contact with their families and in that regard a new video visit system was introduced which has allowed families to continue to support those in custody during this time. </p><p>All prisoners are entitled to one 20 minute video visit per week to nominated family and friends. The feedback from prisoners has been very positive as the visit allows people to connect with their families in their homes. The feedback from families has also been positive as it allows families to continue to support prisoners without having to make long journeys to prison to avail of a visit. The IPS introduced a support line to provide information to families on how to connect to the video visit and assist with any connection difficulties. </p><p>A number of other initiatives include:</p><p>- Useful guides and videos, in a number of languages, and these are available on the Prison Service website. </p><p>- New methods for the electronic transfer of money making it much easier for families to provide monies to family members for Tuck shops. </p><p>- Additional phone calls to allow prisoners to keep in contact with loved ones, with an additional daily phone call to all those in custody during the Christmas period. </p><p>I recognise that physical visits are hugely important to prisoners and their families and I am pleased to advise that the IPS has announced that arrangements have been made to allow all those in custody to book a physical family visit between the 16<sup>th</sup>December and the 6<sup>th</sup>of January. </p><p>Each prisoner will be entitled to one physical visit during the period, which will be 15 minutes in duration. In order to ensure that visits are conducted as safely as possible, visits will be limited to two people of which one may be a child.  The risk posed by Covid-19 still remains therefore in order to prevent the potential spread of infection all visits will be behind clear screens and visitors and prisoners will be required to wear a face mask at all times. No physical contact between prisoners and family members will be permitted.</p><p>The normal security screening procedures will be in place however, all visitors will also be subject to the Covid-19 screening procedure including having their temperature taken. Visitors are asked not to attend the prison if they have any Covid-19 symptoms, have been in contact with a person who has gone for testing for the virus or is a confirmed case and have to yet to cleared by a doctor, or have been abroad in the proceeding 14 days. </p></reply>

The whole area of how criminal justice and public health, especially mental health, intersect and how to best provide the most appropriate service is a priority for the Government. </p>  <p>  It's priority status is acknowledged in the Programme for Government in that it commits to establishing a high-level cross-departmental / cross-agency taskforce to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care support on release. I met with my colleague the Minister for Health in September to lay the foundations for advancing work on this commitment. Collaboration with the Department of Health on the development of Terms of Reference and structure for the establishment of the Task Force is now at an advanced stage and work is now underway to identify a Chair and put in place other administrative details.</p>  <p>  A range of other matters have also been raised by the Committee in the report and I am pleased to say that a significant amount of work is underway to address the concerns raised.  </p>  <p>  The IPS will be implementing a new prisoner complaints system before the end of 2020 which, when bedded down, will include an oversight role for the Ombudsman. </p>  <p>  In relation to the use of Close Supervision Cells and Safety Observation Cells, the IPS has already commenced, in conjunction with officials working on the development of penal policy in my Department, a review of the Prison Rules taking account of the most recently published Council of Europe European Prison Rules which includes the operation, management and governance of these cells. </p>  <p>  On the issue of overcrowding, the Deputy may wish to note that my Department is undertaking a number of actions regarding the consideration of the greater use of alternatives to imprisonment. The DG of the IPS is committed to ensuring that any person committed to custody is, in so far as possible, provided with a permanent bed in a prison cell. A Prison Population Management Plan was developed in 2019 to maximise capacity, increase the use of open centres and the use of back door strategies including structured temporary release.</p>  <p>  The Prison Service&rsquo;s Capital Strategy 2016-2021 outlines plans for the complete replacement of the outdated accommodation in Limerick and Portlaoise prisons as well as improvements across a number of other prisons. On completion of these projects, &ldquo;slopping out&rdquo; will be completely eliminated across the prisons estate. </p>  <p>  The Prison Service is committed to ensuring that the use of force by staff is restricted to situations or circumstances where is it deemed reasonable and necessary and that a number of safeguards are in place to ensure staff operate within the necessary procedures and rules.  I understand that staff regularly receive updated training on de-escalation and the use of physical force as part of their annual training. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to say that we have committed in the programme for Government to ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT) before the end of 2021. In that regard, a single National Preventative Mechanism for the Justice Sector will be introduced and a General Scheme of the Places of Detention Bill is being drafted with a view to securing Government approval in early 2021.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to reassure the Deputy that while there is unlikely to be quick fix solutions to some of the issues highlighted by the CPT, we will continue to work intensively together to ensure all people get the care and support they need from our system.</p></reply>

Policy is coordinated by the Department of Justice. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency has statutory responsibility under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased that my Department has been able to allocate additional funding of &euro;4.7 million to Tusla to support DSGBV services across the country in 2021. A total of &euro;30 million will be made available by DCEDIY to Tusla to fund DSGBV services. This includes a &euro;2.7 million increase in core funding, bringing core service provision to &euro;28 million, with an additional &euro;2 million of one-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of COVID-19. This increase in funding reflects my personal commitment on this issue. I am hopeful that these additional resources will enable services to continue their valuable supports for victims and their families at a very vulnerable time in their lives.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that not all funding to this sector issues via my Department.  The Department of Justice allocates funding to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and support victims of crime, including victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Many voluntary organisations in the DSGBV sector have also received capital funding via the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), which is administered by local authorities on behalf of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  While funding will be crucial to our success, it is imperative that we have the right structures in place to respond as effectively as possible to DSGBV. Under the Programme for Government, we have committed to undertaking an audit of responsibility for DSGBV across Departments and State agencies. The procurement process to secure the expertise to conduct this audit is under way, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Justice. We expect that the audit will be completed early next year, and the Government will act on the basis of that audit. </p></reply>

This will be a key element in ensuring that we develop an informed understanding of domestic and sexual violence that takes into account the range and indices of the types of violence and abuse that occur; including where females are perpetrators. </p>  <p>  The overwhelming majority of sexual offences are committed by males and that is why the perpetrator programmes currently funded by the Department concentrate on male offenders, but if applications are made to my Department to fund female perpetrator programmes, they will certainly be considered.</p>  <p>  To ensure we have the right framework in place that will enable the Government to respond effectively and comprehensively to these matters, the Programme for Government commitment to conduct an audit of how responsibility for Domestic, Sexual and Gender based Violence (DSGBV) is segmented across different government agencies will be undertaken by an external consultant with meaningful involvement from relevant NGOs and service providers, as well as input from Departments and agencies. </p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the audit have been finalised, and very shortly the Department will commence a procurement process to engage an independent person to undertake the audit.

In certain settings, such as weddings, higher noise levels due to music, can force people into close proximity, requiring them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others.

Following receipt of a rapid review dossier, the NCPE advised the HSE on the 17 January 2020 that a HTA was not recommended and that Dupilumab not be considered for reimbursement for this indication at the submitted price.</p>  <p>  The HSE engaged in commercial negotiations with the company in February 2020 regarding both the adult and adolescent populations.</p>  <p>  The final HTA report concerning Dupilumab was reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group, along with the outputs of commercial negotiations, and the patient group submission received during the HTA process. The HSE Drugs Group considered all the evidence and gave a recommendation to the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT) not to support reimbursement of Dupilumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in both adults and adolescents 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy.</p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed that the applicant company was issued with notice of the proposed decision of the HSE EMT not to support reimbursement on 21 August 2020.  On 18 September 2020, the applicant company submitted representations with respect to this application.</p>  <p>  The HSE reviewed these representations, as is required in such circumstances under the 2013 Act, and has engaged in a meeting in November 2020 with the applicant company to discuss the submission. The HSE advises that Dupilumab will be included on the agenda for the December HSE Drugs Group meeting at which the two applications and the submitted representations will be considered.</p>  <p>  Dupilumab remains under consideration with the HSE and a final decision will be made in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The amount of vaccine made available for this winter is almost double the amount of vaccine administered last winter.</p>  <p>  Over 1.33 million of the 1.35 million doses of flu vaccine available this winter have been distributed to GPs, pharmacists and other vaccination sites. Deliveries are continuing and stock is expected to be depleted by the end of the year. In addition, over 460,000 doses of the LAIV for administration to children aged from 2 to 12 have been distributed. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the large increase in available vaccine this year, the full supply of QIV may be used, representing an increase of 35% in uptake over last year. At that stage, sufficient stock will have been delivered for an uptake in excess of 80% in the targeted groups.</p>  <p>  Given the demand on the international market for influenza vaccine, it is not likely to be possible to procure additional supply. As a consequence, from the fourth round of deliveries which started on 23 October, GPs and pharmacists have been asked that of remaining patients in at-risk groups, priority should be given to the over-65s and healthcare workers with direct patient contact, in line with WHO advice. </p>  <p>  As of 3rd December, over 1.1 million claims for reimbursement from GPs and pharmacists for the administration of influenza vaccines have been received by PCERS.</p>  <p>  The significant increase in uptake among those in the at-risk groups, combined with the addition of vaccination for children aged from 2 to 12, will help reduce the impact of influenza on the community and the health system.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and  to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the importance of the sector and the number of jobs it supports in nurseries, harvesting, transportation and processing. I know that it has significant potential for income generation on farms, for the creation of rural jobs, and for the provision of woodlands for public enjoyment. It also has a key role to play in meeting our national climate change and biodiversity objectives.  </p>  <p>  My Department receives forestry applications and issues new licences every week. There are currently around 4,700 licences on hand for processing.  Some 2,000 licence applications require ecology input and, on which, a backlog has developed. The remaining 2,700 licence applications do not generally experience the same delays as the first group. By way of context on our output, we have issued 2,393 licences this year to date. Some 633 of these licences have issued since the introduction of the new Forestry legislation at the beginning of October and I am confident that this positive trend will continue. </p>  <p>  Our overall approach to tackling this is subject to continuous improvement and review  with the aim of increasing the output of these licences on a weekly basis.  Adequate and appropriate resources are key. At the beginning of the year, there were just two ecologists working on ecology files but this figure is now sixteen. Additional forestry inspectors have also been hired to support this work.  This delivered increased output in October and November compared to other months this year. In relation to felling, the licences issued so far this year represents over 4 million cubic meters of timber. </p>  <p>  We also implemented significant changes to the functioning of the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and acted quickly to propose and implement the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I have significantly resourced the FAC and four appeals committees are now set up and hearing appeals. This is an increase from one Committee that was previously in existence.  Since putting these additional resources in place, the FAC has held 61 hearings and has 42 hearings scheduled for December.  This is significantly reforming how the FAC does its business and will result in a more fit-for-purpose, environmentally sensitive and sustainable forestry licensing process which serves all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  While there is still has some considerable way to go, I am encouraged by this progress and intend to sustain and build on this output of licences issued each week. To this end, my Department will recruit additional ecologists and support staff in the New Year.  </p>  <p>  It is a key priority of mine and my Department to ease the pressure on the sector as soon as possible.</p></reply>
