There are 49 IDA client companies in the Midlands Region, employing 6,868 people. The Foreign Direct Investment performance in the region has been consistent over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing significantly over that time. The region has an impressive range of companies across all industry sectors, with particular strengths in Life Sciences, Technology, Global Business Services, International Financial Services, and Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies.</p>  <p>  As regards County Laois, there are currently 157 people employed across 5 IDA-supported companies. In July 2021 N&rsquo;Ware Technologies, a Canadian software firm, announced the opening of its new sales and services centre in Mountrath, with the creation of 25 jobs.  In July 2020, Greenfield Global officially opened its new &euro;30m EU manufacturing headquarters in Portlaoise, supported by 75 employees.</p>  <p>  With regards to County Offaly, there are 1,302 people currently employed in Offaly across 11 IDA-supported companies.  In October 2021 Zoetis announced plans to significantly expand its manufacturing capabilities in Tullamore, with the development of a large new plant and the creation of up to 100 jobs. In February 2020 Steris AST announced the official opening of their multimillion expansion of its sterilisation facility located in the IDA&rsquo;s Business and Technology Park, Tullamore.</p>  <p>  The existing FDI base of client companies in the region continues to perform well in terms of their operational sustainability, job retention and ongoing transformation.  It is not appropriate for me to comment on specific leads, in view of  commercial sensitivities and the fact that not all clients wish to announce investments.</p>  <p>  Both Laois and Offaly are also well served by an ever-expanding network of co-working hubs. Their appeal to new name IDA companies is exemplified by the decision of N&rsquo;Ware to locate in the Bloom HQ hub in Mountrath, Co. Laois.</p></reply>

In the Global Business Complexity Index 2021 Ireland scored extremely well and was deemed to be the 4th least complex country in which to do business. This index examines the rules and requirements in 77 jurisdictions throughout the world. The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council (NCPC) 2020 scorecard assessed Ireland&rsquo;s performance as being within the top 20% of countries in major international competitiveness rankings. Two of the key international indicators for the NCPC when assessing Ireland&rsquo;s performance are the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report and the IMD Competitiveness Yearbook, which consider a variety of factors including ease of establishment and doing business.</p><p>With regard to company law specifically, the Companies Act 2014 is a landmark legislative project which was the result of many years of detailed and comprehensive work. It consolidated, simplified and reformed company law to provide a modern framework for all companies. The Act strikes a balance between simplifying the day to day running of a business, maintaining the necessary protections for those dealing with companies, and putting in place an effective corporate governance regime. </p><p>The Act has reduced reporting requirements for micro and small companies. Such companies can for example avail of an exemption from disclosing full financial statements at the CRO. They can also avail of an audit exemption. I am aware that regulation may have a disproportionate effect in terms of compliance cost and administrative burden on SMEs and my Department is leading on the implementation of the SME test across Government.  </p><p>Covid-19 has added to that burden and this Government&rsquo;s response to the needs of SMEs has been evident from the onset of the pandemic.  In respect of the Companies Act, I have amended it twice and led on two measures to protect viable businesses and preserve employment.  The Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Act 2021 provided for SCARP - the <i>Small Company Administrative Rescue Process. </i>This is<i></i>a new cost efficient and speedy corporate rescue framework for small and micro companies.  The other is the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid 19) Act 2020 which addresses temporary operational issues and alleviates pressure on company liquidity.</p><p>Company law is dynamic and having established a world-class company law code in the Companies Act we keep it under regular review. In this regard the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) plays a central role in advising me on the Act. The CLRG is a statutory advisory body with membership made up of a wide range of stakeholders including ISME and SFA.  In the CLRG my Department has access to a deep reservoir of knowledge and on the ground experience. </p><p>Future legislative proposals to be developed will be mindful of any potential impact on SMEs. Preparations are being made for a third updating of the Act through a Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. My officials are considering provisions in the areas of corporate supervision and enforcement; the recent CLRG report concerning the consequences of certain corporate liquidations and restructuring practices; and other matters including rebalancing the provisions regarding audit exemptions for small companies.</p></reply>

Furthermore, the Local Enterprise Offices provide trading online vouchers to assist many businesses in developing their e-commerce capability.  </p><p>The LEO network also offers an extensive range of high-quality training supports which are open to all business sectors and can assist entrepreneurs in developing the skills and knowledge to maximise their potential.  </p><p>The LEO mentoring programme is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance.</p><p>LEAN for Micro provides insights to make businesses more efficient, and Green for Micro, which addresses the issues of decarbonisation and greening of businesses, provide the business owners with expert consultation and advice on the measures to undertake to achieve their goals. </p><p>As many businesses face challenges because of the war in Ukraine, as well as the aftermath of Covid and Brexit and the disruption both have brought, the Local Enterprise Offices across these counties and the rest of the country, will continue to assist business owners and new entrepreneurs to develop and scale their business ideas into successful enterprises and develop their export potential.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-07a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022040700062#WRA01800"><p>Company law is primarily concerned with providing the legislative framework for the structure and operation of companies incorporated in Ireland, whether domestic or foreign, and does not regulate or supervise the actual activities of companies.</p><p>Such activities are governed by other legislation including for example in the areas of consumer protection, competition, taxation, anti-money laundering and fraud. Compliance matters in these areas come within the remit of the relevant statutory bodies.</p><p>While it is not the role of the Companies Registration Office to question the motivation for incorporating a company, the office takes seriously allegations of suspicious or bogus activity. In this regard, the CRO has set up an integrity checking function and put in place various measures to identify and, as appropriate, follow-up on potentially suspicious activity relating to the incorporation of companies and the filing of other submissions. </p><p>The provision of false information is a criminal offence under section 876 of the Companies Act 2014 and when the CRO has concerns in this regard, such matters are referred to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Since mid 2021, the CRO has made 89 referrals to the ODCE involving some 191 companies.</p><p>Under anti-money laundering legislation, companies are also required to register certain information in respect of their beneficial owners with the Central Register of Beneficial Ownership of Companies and Industrial and Provident Societies (RBO). The RBO follows up with companies who do not make the required filings and I understand that the Registrar is considering taking prosecutions in a number of cases. </p><p>The Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021 provides for the establishment of the Corporate Enforcement Authority. An amendment was required to address a cross referencing error before bringing the Act into effect. This has been done and work can now proceed on the required Orders to commence provisions of the Act and provide for an establishment day for the Authority. My intention is that establishment will take place once all the legal, operational, and resourcing matters integral to the CEA&rsquo;s successful establishment, are finalised to my satisfaction.</p><p>Among the provisions of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021 is a requirement that company directors provide PPS numbers to the CRO. This will be a significant enhancement to the current regime and will assist the CRO in verifying the authenticity of directors. The CRO is currently making the necessary changes to IT systems and related procedures and expects to be in a position to implement the requirement in January 2023, after the end year filing peak.  </p></reply>

Longford is already home to 6 IDA Ireland client companies directly employing more than 1,310 people and has an impressive range of companies across all industry sectors, with strengths in Life Sciences, Technology, Global Business Services, International Financial Services, and Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies. </p><p>The timely provision of appropriate, innovative, and cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions that meet the needs of Multi-National Companies remains essential to winning Foreign Direct Investment. In a competitive and uncertain global environment IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme, supported by my Department,  ensures the supply of land, buildings and infrastructure in regional locations as required by current and prospective clients of both IDA and EI.</p><p>Over the course of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s current strategy, the Agency will deliver 19 Advanced Building Solutions across the country, including in Athlone, Longford and Mullingar.  The planned building solutions have a geographical spread in line with the National Planning Framework, and also a particular emphasis on the Border and Midlands regions, reflecting IDA's strategic focus on supporting the necessary conditions to attract Foreign Direct Investment into regions of significant economic need. </p><p>With regard to the building in Longford, IDA Ireland have advised me that the site selection process is ongoing, and they continue to liaise with Longford County Council and wider stakeholders to seek a suitable site for the proposed Advance Building Solution.</p></reply>

The proposal, which had previously been referred to as the Sustainable Corporate Governance Directive aims to reduce the adverse environmental and human rights impacts of companies by introducing new obligations on companies.</p>  <p>  The proposal will apply to large companies, both EU and non-EU - SMEs are not directly within scope but may be indirectly impacted under the proposal &ndash; for example, if they are part of a large company&rsquo;s supply chain. Such companies will be required to conduct human rights and environmental due diligence to identify actual or potential adverse impacts and prevent, mitigate, or minimise the extent of such impacts within their own operations, their subsidiaries and their value chains. The effectiveness of the due diligence measures must be assessed at least annually.</p>  <p>  Larger companies will be required to adopt a plan to ensure that their business model and strategy is compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and the limiting of global warming to 1.5 &deg;C, in line with the Paris Agreement.</p>  <p>  Directors, when fulfilling their duty to act in the best interest of the company, will be required to take into account the consequences of their decisions on sustainability matters, including, where applicable, human rights, climate change and environmental consequences - in the short, medium and long term.</p>  <p>  The proposed Directive requires companies to establish procedures to handle complaints from those adversely affected by company operations and from other key stakeholders. The Directive would also provide for the designation of supervisory authorities at national level and a civil liability regime in relation to companies who fail to meet their obligations.</p>  <p>  Ireland is supportive of the objective of the proposed Directive which should promote responsible business conduct and we will seek to ensure that the proposals strike the right balance by providing effective protections whilst ensuring that the measures to be implemented by companies are clear, proportionate, and enforceable. It is important that measures such as those proposed are on a cross EU basis in recognition of the complex, international nature of many supply chains and to ensure harmonisation, promote policy coherence, and avoid the risk of fragmentation within the EU single market.</p>  <p>  Consideration of the proposals is at an early stage and is ongoing across EU Member States. My Department is engaging at EU working party level to clarify the practical implications for stakeholders. Giving the complexity of the issues being addressed, negotiations at EU level may well continue through the remainder of this year and into 2023. My Department has begun a process of engagement with key stakeholders and intends conducting a public consultation on the proposals in due course.</p></reply>

Exports by Irish companies to the UAE and Saudi Arabia in 2020, even against the backdrop of a global pandemic, increased by 12% and 6% respectively, signifying the interest by Irish companies and the continued strong opportunities that exist in this rapidly growing market.</p>  <p>  The primary focus of all trade missions and associated meetings is to encourage business-to-business links, to maximise opportunities to help Irish companies to access new markets and to increase the levels of foreign direct investment into Ireland which in turn creates employment opportunities. </p>  <p>  While in Saudi Arabia, I held meetings with the President of the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation, the Governor and Board of the Saudi Central Bank, the Saudi Minister for Commerce, the Saudi Minister for Investment, and the Saudi Minister for Transport. These meetings were arranged as part of the trade mission to further our trade and investment promotion objectives in Saudi Arabia. I also had discussions on the social and economic transformation which is underway, as part of the Saudi government&rsquo;s Vision 2030.  This aims to diversify the Saudi economy, encourage greater personal freedoms, and deepen Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s engagement with regional and international partners which include the European Union.  </p>  <p>  To be effective in raising human rights issues with other countries we must do it in an appropriate way and at the right opportunity, so that our concerns are taken seriously and acted upon.  Ireland has always been at the forefront internationally in raising human rights issues through bilateral contacts and especially through the European Union and the United Nations.</p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned by the high number of civilian casualties as a result of the Yemen conflict. The EU has been consistently clear that all parties to the conflict have an obligation to uphold International Humanitarian Law. Protecting and promoting human rights is a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, as it is for the European Union. Ireland is committed to all aspects of human rights, and encourages adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in both bilateral dialogues, and in appropriate international fora.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also been very clear in his engagement with Saudi Arabia, UAE and others in the region that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Yemen and all parties must engage with the UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg to bring about a peaceful and sustainable solution to this conflict.</p></reply>

The Enterprise Ireland Offshore Wind Showcase Event will be held this summer, convening delegates from across the Irish and UK offshore wind industry. For its part, the IDA is involved in facilitating and promoting links between large energy users, including data centres, and the renewable energy sector to help them align with and contribute towards emissions targets and future network needs.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Secretariat for which is based in my Department, is an independent body tasked with advising the Government on the current and future skills needs of the Irish economy. The EGFSN undertook a study on the nature and quantity of skills required between now and 2030 to deliver on some of the key enabling measures in the Climate Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The study, &ldquo;Skills for Zero Carbon: The Demand for Renewable Energy, Residential Retrofit and Electric Vehicle Deployment Skills to 2030&rdquo;, was published on the 24th November. The analysis found that in order to deliver on the Climate Action Plan's 2030 targets, employment in wind and solar energy developments will have to quickly increase to 8,000, from a 3,000 baseline in 2020, within a number of years, and ultimately stand at 9,000 by 2030. This will mainly consist of workers in roles including Construction and Installation, Technicians and Technical Professionals, Engineering, Transport and Logistics, and Legal and Professional Services.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering on the Climate Action Plan 2021 targets and is providing a range of upskilling, reskilling and apprenticeship supports to ensure any skills needs are met. </p>  <p>  For example, through the Green Tech Skillnet network, more than 3,700 participants have already received renewable energy training across a range of professions and areas including turbine technicians, high-voltage operators, PV and microgrid installers, policy and energy markets. Three bespoke programmes address skills gaps in the workforce to meet the Climate Action Plan&rsquo;s targets including Near Zero Energy Building design and BER Assessors certification, Wind Turbine Technicians and the Wind industry jobs (graduate level) programme.  </p>  <p>  My Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to establish the Cross-Departmental Offshore Renewable Energy Team and will also continue to work with the Department of Further and Higher Education and its agencies to follow through on the initiatives required to build our workforce for the renewable energy sector.</p></reply>

Provided that they do not resign from their current employment, there should be no obstacle to retaining their statutory redundancy entitlements.</p>  <p>  Officials of the Department of Social Protection have already met with both the Receiver and employee representatives to provide information and assurances regarding measures taken to accept online applications for income support as quickly as possible.  My Government colleague, Heather Humphreys TD, Minister for Social Protection, has encouraged individuals now seeking jobseekers payments to apply on line so that her Department can process their claims as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection will provide all relevant supports through the local Intreo Offices and will proactively help employees to access opportunities available for employment or appropriate training and development.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has been in regular contact with the company and officials have had discussions with the Acting CEO to investigate whether any Roadbridge contracts can be fulfilled by other operators in the market.  This, however, will be challenging given the current economic climate and inflationary pressures.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has met with some employees in relation to advice about starting their own businesses. Following initial assessment, these calls have recommended contact with the Local Employment Office, as they continue to formulate their plans and projections.</p>  <p>  Some competitors of Roadbridge have been in contact with Enterprise Ireland in relation to hiring former employees as these staff are considered to be highly qualified and have excellent training in the industry.  In all cases, positive directions were given. Enterprise Ireland understands that employment offers have been made, and will continue to be made, across all regions of Roadbridge&rsquo;s operations.</p>  <p>  The Receiver has given an undertaking to continue discussions with Enterprise Ireland to discuss how Enterprise Ireland can further support employees, sub-contractors and sub-suppliers impacted by the receivership.</p>  <p>  It should be noted however that Receivership arises from a private contractual relationship between a lender and a creditor and as such I cannot intervene in this matter.  The Companies Act 2014 confers statutory powers on receivers appointed to preserve, manage or sell the property of a company. The Act also provides that an application may be made to court for directions concerning the performance by the receiver of their functions. Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred. In addition, misconduct by receivers must be reported to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to rebuilding a strong economy that provides stability for workers and helping those who have lost their jobs to secure alternative employment.  My Department will continue to liaise with all stakeholders in order to fully determine the scale of the potential adverse impacts on all those concerned.</p></reply>

This compares with an increase in consumer prices of 7% in the 6 years to December 2021. The Minimum Wage has increased substantially in real terms over recent years. </p>  <p>  The share of workers on the minimum wage in Ireland has also fallen consistently since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission. The share of workers on the minimum wage or less as a percentage of the total labour force has reduced from 9.3% in Q4, 2016 to 6.8% in Q4, 2020.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission is made up of an equal number of employer representatives, employee representatives, and independent members which helps to provide a balanced view when determining an appropriate rate for the National Minimum Wage. In addition, the establishing legislation requires the Low Pay Commission to give consideration to a range of issues when arriving at a recommendation for the appropriate National Minimum Wage rate. These issues include the cost of living, competitiveness and the likely effect that any proposed recommendation will have on future levels of employment.</p>  <p>  I have been clear in my commitment to improving pay and terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay. </p>  <p>  I am committed to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government. While the living wage initiative is being considered, the Government will continue to be guided by the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission with regard to any future changes in the minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission is required to submit its annual recommendation on the National Minimum Wage to me on or before the third Tuesday in July.</p></reply>

This has enabled the delivery of enterprise relevant programmes to companies and the provision of physical spaces to support remote working.</p>  <p>  Since 2017, Enterprise Ireland has administered Departmental funding to 91 projects totalling &euro;16.4 million under both the Regional Enterprise Development Fund and the Community Enterprise Centres Schemes.</p>  <p>  On 20 November 2020, &euro;8.24 million in grants, administered through Enterprise Ireland, for 95 Enterprise Centres around the country was announced. This funding will ensure that these Enterprise Centres, many of which have been negatively impacted by COVID-19, can sustain their businesses, pivot and further develop their services, to continue to assist the development of our start-up companies. </p>  <p>  Currently, an Enterprise Ireland open &lsquo;Regional Development Feasibility Fund&rsquo; is available to promoters seeking to scope out and investigate the viability of larger full-scale projects such as remote working hubs. A feasibility grant of &euro;15,000 or 50% of eligible costs, whichever is lesser, is available to qualifying applicants meeting the required criteria.</p>  <p>  In addition, over the next 20 years, advances in digital technologies will transform the enterprise potential across the country, particularly in our smaller towns and rural areas. To maximise those opportunities, co-working spaces (or &ldquo;eHubs&rdquo;), are envisaged under Project Ireland 2040 as part of an ongoing suite of measures to encourage greater levels of collaboration between entrepreneurs in accessing available supports and assistance in helping to make their businesses grow.</p>  <p>  There are a broad range of other hub-type facilities, both publicly and privately funded, around the country including Community Enterprise Centres and incubator/accelerators that are being considered by the National Hub Network Working Group in their mapping of a national network of remote working facilities. The Department of Rural and Community Development leads on this mapping initiative. The DCRD has invested significantly in remote working infrastructure &amp;amp; connectivity through the Broadband Connection Point Network initiative and a number of programmes and schemes including the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund and the Leader Programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, the first allocation of &euro;3 million in Budget 2022 was announced for the European Digital Innovation Hubs as part of the EU Digital Europe Programme which will provide, over time, a total of &euro;13.4 million in funding to Ireland focused on bringing digital technology to businesses, SMEs, citizens and the public sector.</p></reply>

Exports to Great Britain in 2021 were valued at &euro;14.4 billion, an increase of 17% compared with 2020. Exports to Great Britain accounted for 9% of total exports in 2021. Exports to Northern Ireland were valued at &euro;3.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 54% on 2020. </p>  <p>  The EU accounted for &euro;61.4 billion (37%) of total exports in 2021, a decrease of 4% on 2020. Exports to non-EU countries were valued at &euro;103.7 billion in 2021, which is an increase of 6% on the 2020 level of exports. The USA was the largest export destination in 2021, accounting for &euro;52.5 billion or 32% of total exports.</p>  <p>  It is too early, based on statistics for 2021, to get a real sense of the impact that Brexit will have on Ireland's longer term trade flows as there are other contributory factors, not least the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which have an impact on trade.  While the UK will remain a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export market in markets beyond the UK will continue to be a priority. The long-term response to Brexit is for companies across all sectors to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more international markets. Given the pressures of COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine on trade and supply chains, it is also not possible to accurately forecast how Irish trade will develop with EU countries and non-EU countries over the next five years. However, our trade strategy is to deepen our existing trading relationships and to promote new trading relationships around the globe.  We will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p>  <p>  Each year, Enterprise Ireland offers a programme of trade missions, trade fairs and knowledge events which give their client companies based in Ireland the opportunity to connect with existing and new customers, access key decision makers, increase sales in international markets and exchange ideas.  In recent years, the majority of Ministerial-led trade missions have taken place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represented the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies. These trade missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working closely with its agencies on a trade mission schedule for Q2 of 2022 which will maximise opportunities to help Irish companies to access new markets and to increase the levels of foreign direct investment into Ireland.  Trade missions are being planned for the second quarter to the USA, Mexico, Europe and New Zealand. The trade mission schedule for 2022 is being planned and reviewed on a quarterly basis due to the changing global environment and adjustments will be made where deemed necessary.</p></reply>

It consolidated, simplified and reformed company law to provide a modern framework for all companies. The Act strikes a balance between simplifying the day to day running of a business, maintaining the necessary protections for those dealing with companies and putting in place an effective corporate governance regime. </p><p>Company law is dynamic and having established a world-class company law code in the Companies Act we keep it under regular review. In this regard the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) plays a central role in advising me on the Act. The CLRG is a statutory advisory body with membership made up of a wide range of stakeholders including employee and employer representative groups, the Revenue Commissioners, the Courts Service, insolvency and legal practitioners and regulators. Members have an expertise in company law and provide well-rounded analysis on the issues that come before them for consideration. </p><p>Since 2020, the T&aacute;naiste and I have amended the Companies Act twice to protect viable businesses and preserve employment.  The Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Act 2021 provided for SCARP - the <i>Small Company Administrative Rescue Process. </i>This is<i></i>a new cost efficient and speedy corporate rescue framework for small and micro companies.  This Act also made a number of amendments to the Companies Act enhancing the rights of creditors in a liquidation.  The other is the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid 19) Act 2020 which addresses temporary operational issues and alleviates pressure on company liquidity.</p><p>Preparations are being made for a third updating of the Act through a Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. My officials are considering provisions in the areas of corporate supervision and enforcement; the recent CLRG report concerning the consequences of certain corporate liquidations and restructuring practices; and other matters including rebalancing the provisions regarding audit exemptions for small companies.</p></reply>

The breadth and variety of COVID-19 related schemes to support all kinds of businesses, but particularly small and medium enterprise, through the pandemic has been unprecedented, and their design and delivery has very much been a priority for the Government. </p><p>The degree to which the assistance has addressed the challenges which businesses were facing is a matter of independent evaluation to be undertaken at different stages depending on the provenance of and timeframes for individual schemes and may follow audits in some cases. In light of the further challenges which are posed by the war in Ukraine and its economic fallout in all EU Member States, I expect this to be a complex undertaking.

Instead, the focus of the <i>Programme for Government &ndash; Our shared Future</i>- is to strengthen the operation of the 95 municipal districts established in 2014 and which cover the entirety of the State&rsquo;s population as opposed to the 14% of the population previously represented by town councils.</p><p>The Municipal District system provides effective and community-focused decision-making and implementation.  There is full integration of local authority resources across each county, and elimination of duplication both in administrative and electoral terms.</p><p>The Municipal District system is also closer to the European norm, covering the entire territory of each county, in contrast with the previous arrangement of isolated town councils, while rural areas, many town environs, and some larger centres lacked municipal status and local governance.</p><p>An important benefit of the Municipal District system is a more appropriate assignment of local authority functions.  Local matters are dealt with at Municipal District level, while those of wider strategic application are decided at county level, without duplication between county and district jurisdictions. In effect, there is now a dual system of governance but an integrated administrative structure in each county which maximises operational efficiency while ensuring devolved decision-making throughout the county.</p><p>Regional enterprise development and sustainable local job creation is a key policy priority of mine and this Government.</p><p>Throughout the first quarter of this year, I along with the T&aacute;naiste Leo Varadkar TD and Minister of State Robert Troy TD have launched 8 of 9 Regional Enterprise Plans.  A key feature and strength of the Regional Enterprise Plans is that they are developed using a &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; approach, developed by regional stakeholders, including local government structures, who are keenly aware of the growth opportunities and vulnerabilities in their region.</p><p>Together, we have been determined to ensure that funding is available to support these Plans.  I can advise the Deputy that up to &euro;180m is being made available for the nine regional plans to develop and implement collaborative and innovative enterprise projects &ndash; projects that will not just sustain but enhance employment opportunities at county, regional and national level.</p></reply>

Directive 2019/770 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services;</p><p>2.  Directive 2019/771 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods; and</p><p>3.  the main provisions of Directive 2019/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules.  </p><p>The Bill will also consolidate, modernise and enhance domestic consumer contract law by bringing existing provisions together in a single enactment. The main provisions of the Bill include:</p><p>- rights and remedies in consumer contracts for the sale of goods;</p><p>- rights and remedies in consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services;</p><p>- rights and remedies in consumer contracts for non-digital services;</p><p>- consumer information and cancellation rights;</p><p>- unfair terms in consumer contracts;</p><p>- unfair commercial practices;</p><p>- enhanced enforcement measures available to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC). </p><p>Services account for an increasingly large part of consumer activity and expenditure.  The rights of consumers in respect of service contracts will be expanded and a scheme of statutory remedies will be established to apply where a service does not conform to these rights.</p><p>Consumer contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services have not previously been the subject of specific statutory regulation.  While digital content supplied in tangible form such as a cd or dvd is subject to the rights and remedies in current legislation, digital content supplied, as is now mainly the case, in intangible form, through downloads, streaming or other means is not currently subject to similar statutory regulation.</p><p>Substantial amendments will be made to the existing provisions on consumer information and cancellation rights due to the transposition of Directive 2019/2161.</p><p>Changes will be made to the current unfair terms in consumer contracts legislation, to include &ndash; </p><p>- extending the scope of the unfair terms provisions;</p><p>- strengthening the transparency requirements that apply to contract terms;</p><p>- narrowing the exemption from assessment for unfairness of core contract terms, and </p><p>- expanding the &lsquo;grey list&rsquo; of consumer contract terms presumed unfair and introducing a &lsquo;blacklist&rsquo; of terms that are automatically unfair.</p><p>Various amendments will be made to the Consumer Protection Act 2007 required to update the law on unfair commercial practices as included in Directive 2019/2161.  These amendments will extend and enhance the enforcement measures available to the CCPC and ComReg.</p><p>Also, on 22 March last, the Government approved the priority drafting of the <i>Representative Actions for the Protection of the Collective Interests of Consumers Bill 2022</i>. The Bill will transpose the EU Directive on Representative Actions (2020/2018) into domestic law. The Directive is due to be transposed by 25 December 2022.  My Department has published the General Scheme of the Bill on its website. The primary purpose of the Bill is to permit a qualified entity to represent consumers in a representative action where a trader has infringed their consumer rights under one or more of the legislative provisions listed in the Schedule to the General Scheme.</p><p>For the first time in Irish law, a group of consumers will be able to take a civil action against a rogue trader through a Qualified Entity. A qualified entity will act as the designated representative for the consumers affected by an infringement of their consumer protection rights. Consumers will be charged a modest fee by the qualified entity to take part in their representative action. Actions can be brought on a domestic or cross-border basis. All EU consumers are protected against any rogue trader in the EU. Building on from the Consumer Rights Bill 2022, this Bill adds to consumer protection. The Bill also serves to protect the interests of traders who already abide by consumer protection legislation in that it provides additional mechanisms to tackle <i>non-compliant</i>traders who are, thereby, competing unfairly.</p></reply>

A cross referencing error in section 11 relating to a Schedule in the Act which prevented the proper establishment of the CEA, was identified by the Office of Parliamentary Council in January. To address this an amendment to the Act was included in section 4 the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Act 2022 which was signed by the President on the 31 March. This means that work can now proceed on the required Orders to commence provisions of the 2021 Act and provide for an establishment day for the Authority.</p>  <p>  Establishing the Corporate Enforcement Authority at the earliest opportunity is a priority for me.

We are committed, therefore, to honouring the Programme for Government commitment to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government. In doing so, we need to recognise that many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic and are struggling to pay existing wages.

The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to Directive 2019/1 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 to empower the competition authorities of the Member States to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market (ECN+).  The ECN+ system is intended to ensure effective and consistent application of the EU laws with close cooperation by its members.

The additional funding provided will allow each of the 31 Local Enterprise Offices to enhance the role they play in supporting local and regional development. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office, South Dublin, has been allocated &euro;907,798 for 2022 to ensure that businesses are well served in terms of grant aid and financial assistance in addition to serving the training, mentoring, management and capability development requirements of entrepreneurs and managers in the enterprises.  </p>  <p>  &euro;449k has been set aside to service direct financial assistance to businesses including Feasibility Grants, Priming Grants and Business Expansion Grants. &euro;25k of this is ringfenced for the Technical Assistance for Micro Exporters Grant, which will support the ambition set out in the EI Strategy to increase the number of  new exporters from our micro-enterprise sector over the course of the coming 4 years. </p>  <p>  &euro;459k has been allocated to the broad suite of management development and training programmes that assist business owners in acquiring additional skills to help them succeed in their business. &euro;50,000 of funding has been set aside to deliver the Green4Micro programme in line with the Government commitment to prepare businesses for a greener, more carbon efficient economy. A further &euro;30,000 has been allocated to the Lean4Micro programme which aims to help businesses increase efficiencies and reduce costs.</p>  <p>The Local Enterprise Office budget has grown year on year to meet the needs presented by the businesses and clients who have availed of the services offered. This is borne out by the growth in jobs supported by the Local Enterprise Offices, who have just completed an 8th year of consecutive growth. LEO South Dublin client enterprises supported 1,345 gross jobs in 2021 across 260 client companies with a net increase of 37 jobs for the year.  I am satisfied that LEO South Dublin will continue its progress in meeting the requirements of the many businesses who avail of LEO services and that the 2022 budget will be instrumental in the creation of further employment and the advancement of enterprise development in the South Dublin area.</p></reply>

The trade mission was organised by Enterprise Ireland and had the participation of 60 Irish companies and organisations. Irish business-to-business interests are growing in the Gulf region. Exports by Irish companies to the UAE and Saudi Arabia in 2020, even against the backdrop of a global pandemic, increased by 12% and 6% respectively, signifying the interest by Irish companies and the continued strong opportunities that exist in this rapidly growing market.</p>  <p>  The primary focus of all trade missions and associated meetings is to encourage business-to-business links, to maximise opportunities to help Irish companies to access new markets and to increase the levels of foreign direct investment into Ireland which in turn creates employment opportunities. </p>  <p>  While in Saudi Arabia, I held meetings with the President of the Saudi General Authority of Civil Aviation, the Governor and Board of the Saudi Central Bank, the Saudi Minister for Commerce, the Saudi Minister for Investment, and the Saudi Minister for Transport. These meetings were arranged as part of the trade mission to further our trade and investment promotion objectives in Saudi Arabia. I also had discussions on the social and economic transformation which is underway, as part of the Saudi government&rsquo;s Vision 2030.  This aims to diversify the Saudi economy, encourage greater personal freedoms, and deepen Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s engagement with regional and international partners which include the European Union. </p>  <p>  To be effective in raising human rights issues with other countries we must do it in an appropriate way and at the right opportunity, so that our concerns are taken seriously and acted upon.  Ireland has always been at the forefront internationally in raising human rights issues through bilateral contacts and especially through the European Union and the United Nations.</p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned by the high number of civilian casualties as a result of the Yemen conflict. The EU has been consistently clear that all parties to the conflict have an obligation to uphold International Humanitarian Law. Protecting and promoting human rights is a cornerstone of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy, as it is for the European Union. Ireland is committed to all aspects of human rights, and encourages adherence to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in both bilateral dialogues, and in appropriate international fora.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also been very clear in his engagement with Saudi Arabia, UAE and others in the region that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Yemen and all parties must engage with the UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg to bring about a peaceful and sustainable solution to this conflict.</p></reply>

There has been a significant long-term shift in attitudes to remote work amongst both employers and workers throughout the country.</p><p>The Government is committed to increasing remote work adoption through removing barriers, developing infrastructure, providing guidance, raising awareness and leading by example in this area.</p><p>In the context of Pillar 1 of the National Remote Work Strategy, published in January 2021, a commitment was made to legislate to provide employees with the right to request remote work. This is one of the key actions of the Strategy. </p><p>In line with that Strategy, on 25th January the Government approved the priority drafting of the Right to Request Remote Working Bill 2022. This will provide employees with a right to request remote work and provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing such a request can be based. It will also provide legal clarity to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests.</p><p>Pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment commenced on 9th February and Departmental officials are scheduled to attend a further meeting on 4<sup>th</sup>May.</p><p>I will be happy to consider any proposals made by the Committee.

It applies to workers &ndash; national and non-national - on board Irish registered ships. As I understand it, the general rule in relation to ships that are not Irish registered is the flag state, the state where the ship is registered, has exclusive right to exercise legislative and enforcement jurisdiction over ships on the high seas.</p>  <p>  When an employer is proposing collective redundancies in Ireland, the Protection of Employment Act 1977 imposes a number of obligations on employers. These include an obligation to engage in a 30-day information and consultation process with employees&rsquo; representatives before any redundancies can take effect. The employer must also notify the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the proposed redundancies. </p>  <p>  Employees have the right to refer complaints to the Workplace Relations Commission on a wide range of employment law breaches and to seek compensation, including where an employee believes a genuine redundancy situation has not arisen and they have been unfairly dismissed. A situation in which people are dismissed and replaced is not a genuine redundancy. Complaints can also be brought for breaches of the consultation requirements.</p>  <p>  The Exceptional Collective Redundancies Act 2007 provided for the setting up of a Redundancy Panel, drawn from the social partners, for referring certain proposed collective redundancies to it to establish if the dismissals constitute an exceptional collective redundancy i.e. where there is a possibility of the collective compulsory replacement of workers by lower paid workers.</p>  <p>  The Redundancy Panel would remain in force for three years only but could be extended by Statutory Instrument for a further period of three years subject to:</p>  <p>  a.Both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation having requested the extension, and </p>  <p>  b.The Minister being satisfied that the continued operation would be conducive to the continued orderly conduct of industrial relations.  </p>  <p>  The operation of the Redundancy Panel was last extended up until 7 May 2019. No formal request was received prior to the end date of 7 May 2019 to extend the Redundancy Panel and accordingly it is no longer in force. Consultation with the social partners and new primary legislation would be required to establish another Redundancy Panel.</p>  <p>  Ireland's workplace relations structures, a two-tier system involving the WRC and the Labour Court, has greatly improved the complaint adjudication and appeal process for employees. This in addition to the excellent service provided by the WRC conciliation, mediation and inspectorate functions.</p></reply>

I am engaging with the regional Chairpersons and Steering Committees as implementation commences. </p><p>The Midlands Plan&rsquo;s strategic objectives are:</p><p>- Climate Action &ndash; transition to a climate neutral economy.</p><p>- Capitalising on strengths of the Midlands through Smart Specialisation and Digitalisation</p><p>- Positioning the Midlands as the destination of choice to live, work, visit, invest and learn</p><p>The Midlands region has been successful in securing over &euro;6.8 million over five projects under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) and the Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme (RETS), since 2017.</p><p>I have been determined to ensure that funding is available to support these Plans.  I can advise the Deputy that up to &euro;180m is being made available for the nine regional plans to develop and implement collaborative and innovative enterprise projects &ndash; projects that will not just sustain but add to employment at county, regional and national level. </p><p>&euro;6 million has been set aside in 2022 and a further &euro;6 million over the following years to assist those projects which have been delayed and incurred increased costs in the delivery of their originally approved projects.  Enterprise Ireland are in the process of contacting eligible projects regarding this fund.</p><p>To create a strong pipeline of projects for future funding calls Enterprise Ireland has also announced a new competitive &lsquo;priming&rsquo; and &lsquo;feasibility&rsquo; scheme fund of up to &euro;5 million. This Scheme is now open for applications and details can be accessed on Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s website.</p><p>Substantial funding will also be made available up to 2027 for regional enterprise projects under funding from the European Regional Development Fund and Shared Island fund. This funding will help ensure that the coming years will be an exciting time for the Regional Enterprise Plans.</p><p>The Midlands region is full of potential and is very well positioned to compete for the new funding schemes.  I strongly encourage all stakeholders to take advantage of the new funding to develop quality projects in the region.</p></reply>

This will be challenging given the current economic climate and inflationary pressures.   These discussions are ongoing and everything possible will be done to achieve as positive an outcome as possible.</p>  <p>  A number of creditors have also made contact with Enterprise Ireland, which in turn has advised them to contact the Receivers. Reports to hand from industry sources indicate that, where facilities are in place, credit insurance options are being exercised and will be considered favourably.   </p>  <p>  The Receiver has given an undertaking to continue discussions with Enterprise Ireland to further discuss how Enterprise Ireland can support employees and subcontractors impacted by the receivership.</p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that Receivership arises from a private contractual relationship between a lender and a creditor and as such I cannot intervene in this matter.  The Companies Act 2014 confers statutory powers on receivers appointed to preserve, manage or sell the property of a company. The Act also provides that an application may be made to court for directions concerning the performance by the receiver of their functions. Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred. In addition, misconduct by receivers must be reported to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>  <p>  We will continue to gather information as to the scale of the potential adverse impacts on sub-suppliers and sub-contractors.  Department officials will continue to liaise with all stakeholders to fully determine the scale of the potential impacts on sub-suppliers and sub-contractors and the progress of the infrastructural projects concerned with a view to considering what options are available in terms of how these projects might be sustained.</p>  <p>  We are working across Government, including with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport, to examine what options are available with regard to major construction projects to see how these projects might be progressed.</p>  <p>  My officials will continue to monitor the situation carefully and continue to be as responsive as we can to the issues as they unfold.</p></reply>

The CLRG ultimately concluded that the incidence of abusive practices in corporate restructuring, while attracting significant attention, is in fact low. This conclusion is supported by the Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement which notes that its reviews of liquidations indicate that in over 90% of all liquidations, company directors had acted honestly and responsibly.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the CLRG made eight recommendations for potential amendment to the Companies Act and are intended to further enhance the regulatory framework. The Report has been considered by officials from my Department in the context of the Plan for Action on Collective Redundancies following Insolvency.

From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications. </p>  <p>  My Department has issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists has increased the demand for employment permits. </p>  <p>  My Department and I recognise the impact delays on the processing times for employment permits has for businesses and their workers and the Employment Permits team are committed to reducing these times.    </p>  <p>  An plan of action is being implemented by officials in the Employment Permits team. It has increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications, including removing hundreds of doctors from the permits system. The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits section has made positive progress to reduce the current backlog reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from 11,181 in January 2022 to 8,773 at the end of March 2022. Officials expect to see a further significant improvements in this backlog by the end of Q2 of 2022.</p>  <p>  Waiting time for Critical Skills Employment Permits (CSEPs) have been more than halved in the past seven weeks.  The Department plans to maintain processing times for all CSEP applications at approximately its current level for all of Q2, on the assumption that demand remains at current levels.

However, Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has sparked further energy price increases and brought unprecedented volatility to international energy markets. This is feeding through to retail price increases for all households and businesses.  I understand that these rising costs, including fuel costs, have placed an additional burden on enterprises trying to get back on their feet in the aftermath of the COVID-19 shock. </p><p>Recently, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) published its &lsquo;HEAT Study Report&rsquo;, which noted that the Industry Sector in particular was already facing cost and competitiveness challenges because of the need to decarbonise and move away from fossil fuel usage. The report pointed out most industry sectors use gas to meet their heat demand needs. In Ireland, sectors which are relatively energy intensive include the Cement sector, the Commercial Activities Sector (which includes hospitality and retail), the Food and Drink Sector, and the Electrical and Optical equipment sector. However, businesses across a range of sectors are likely to be impacted by increased fuel prices through their reliance on the logistics and distribution sector to deliver their raw materials and inputs, and to bring their final products to market. </p><p>Ireland imports over 70 per cent of our energy use and the Government cannot fully insulate individuals and businesses from developments in international energy markets that are outside of our control.  However, Government has put in place a suite of targeted measures aimed at reducing the burden of these cost pressures, both for businesses and households. Given the volatility of fuel prices, it is important that measures are sustainable and targeted. </p><p>To support businesses as well as households, in March the Government approved a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel, and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil. The Government also launched an emergency support measure for licensed hauliers to address cost pressures arising from current high fuel prices. The targeted and temporary grant scheme will provide a payment of &euro;100 per week for every heavy goods vehicle (over 3.5 tonnes) in the country. It will operate for a period of eight weeks and will be reviewed. The Government also agreed a temporary, targeted intervention package for the tillage sector to the value of &euro;12.2 million. The agriculture sector has been significantly impacted by higher input prices for fuel, animal feed and fertilisers. </p><p>The Government will keep the energy situation under close review and we will continue to examine what measures are possible to manage the impact of rising energy prices for households and businesses. My Department is leading consultations with business and industry to learn about the specific impacts of higher energy costs on Irish businesses, and to hear their concerns and perspectives on the appropriate and most effective tools for policy action.</p><p>The European Commission recently launched its Temporary State Aid Crisis Framework for businesses affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This opens the way for Member States to consider what specific instruments might be needed in the near-term in order to help vulnerable but viable businesses to overcome the acute impacts of the current crisis in particular with liquidity, and to gear up for meeting their longer-term investment and transition requirements. As part of the Framework, low-cost loans and grants may be made available in order to meet liquidity needs and facilitate the necessary investment.</p><p>In terms of short-term temporary supports, there are already a number of effective schemes in place resulting from Government&rsquo;s response to the Brexit and Covid-19 crises, and the Government will consider whether, and to what degree, such schemes might be pivoted to firms impacted by the Ukraine crisis in particular. </p></reply>

I know these costs are increasing rapidly and that those on lower incomes are being disproportionately affected. </p>  <p>  When considering increases in the National Minimum Wage during a period of inflation Government must be is conscious of the need to avoid second round effects. Pumping more money into the economy could lead to further inflation. </p>  <p>  That being said, I have been clear in my commitment to improving pay and terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay. </p>  <p>  Last year I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine and make recommendations on the best approach to achieving the Programme for Government commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.</p>  <p>  One of the issues examined by the Low Pay Commission, and the research team commissioned by them to produce a technical research report on the progression to a living wage, was how a living wage should be calculated. The Commission considered whether the Minimum Essential Standard of Living or fixed threshold approach should be recommended. As part of its deliberations, the Low Pay Commission met with a number of stakeholders in this area, including the Living Wage Technical Group. </p>  <p>  Last week I received the Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations on the progression to a living wage. Along with my officials, I will review the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations and consider next steps.</p>  <p>  While the living wage initiative is being considered, the Government will continue to be guided by the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission with regard to any future changes in the minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission is required to submit its annual recommendation on the National Minimum Wage to me on or before the third Tuesday in July. </p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission in 2015, the national minimum wage has increased from &euro;8.65 per hour to &euro;10.50 per hour between 2016 and 2022, a 21.4% increase. This compares with an increase in consumer prices of 7% in the 6 years to December 2021. The Minimum Wage has increased substantially in real terms over recent years. </p>  <p>  The share of workers on the minimum wage in Ireland has also fallen consistently since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission. The share of workers on the minimum wage or less as a percentage of the total labour force has reduced from 9.3% in Q4, 2016 to 6.8% in Q4, 2020.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission is made up of an equal number of employer representatives, employee representatives, and independent members which helps to provide a balanced view when determining an appropriate rate for the National Minimum Wage. In addition, the establishing legislation requires the Low Pay Commission to give consideration to a range of issues when arriving at a recommendation for the appropriate National Minimum Wage rate. These issues include the cost of living, competitiveness and the likely effect that any proposed recommendation will have on future levels of employment.</p></reply>

The system is managed through the use of lists designating highly skilled and ineligible occupations.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, applications for employment permits are processed in date order of receipt of fully completed applications.  My Department advise that an application for any employment permit should be received at least 12 weeks before the proposed employment start date.</p>  <p>  Since the outset of the Covid-19 crisis, in order to assist the HSE and other medical providers in the State, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect.</p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications. </p>  <p>  My Department has issued 16,275 employment permits in 2021, and processed a total of 17,968 applications which represents a significant volume of activity.  In addition, the extension of categories of employment permits following the latest Review of the Occupational Lists has increased the availability of employment permits for these roles resulting in additional applications. </p>  <p>  My Department and I are very conscious of the current timeframes for processing employment permit applications and the staff of the Employment Permits team are committed to reducing these. </p>  <p>  An plan of action has been developed by the Employment Permits team that is focusing on increasing resources and driving efficiencies in applications processing. This plan is currently being implemented to tackle the current backlog, with both human resource interventions and systemic changes identified.

The Agreement will cement the close political and economic relations between the EU and Mercosur countries and represents a clear commitment from both regions to rules-based international trade.</p>  <p>  In 2021, Ireland exported nearly &euro;0.5 billion worth of goods to the Mercosur region. In 2020 &ndash; the most recent year for which figures are available &ndash; Ireland exported approximately &euro;1 billion worth of services to Mercosur. Further expansion into the Mercosur markets is expected as a result of the Agreement reached. The independent impact assessment commissioned by my Department, and published last July, concluded that Irish exports to the Mercosur market are expected to be 17% higher in 2035 under the terms of the Agreement.</p>  <p>  However, we also have some well-known concerns regarding climate change and the environmental impact of the extensive forest fires we have seen in the Amazon. I have raised these concerns at all political levels, including through my engagement with the Commission and with Trade Minister colleagues in Council.</p>  <p>  Specifically, at a meeting of the EU&rsquo;s Trade Council in Berlin in September 2020, I took the opportunity to remind both the Commission, and my counterparts, that enforceable guarantees which strengthen environmental protections, particularly with regard to the Amazon rainforest and climate action, are a priority for this Government in terms of our assessment of the benefits of the Agreement when it is formally presented for decision. Furthermore, there was a discussion on the EU-Mercosur Agreement at the meeting of EU Trade Ministers in Brussels in May 2021 at which I restated my and our Government's position on these important issues. Following these discussions, I took the opportunity to write to EU Executive Vice-President and Trade Commissioner Dombrovskis in June 2021 to restate Ireland&rsquo;s position, as well as to address other Trade Policy matters.</p>  <p>  On the basis of these concerns, raised by Ireland and other EU Member States, the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) are engaged with the Mercosur countries on negotiating further enforceable commitments on climate and deforestation.</p>  <p>  Finally, both I and officials from my Department and across Government have continued to articulate our clear position regarding this Agreement at the highest level in the EU, including in bilateral conversations with colleague Trade Ministers in the margins of EU Council meetings, such as last February in Marseille at an Informal Trade Ministers meeting under the current French Presidency of the Council.</p></reply>

The report suggests that some essential workplaces - particularly in residential care and meat processing - saw deterioration in their working conditions during the pandemic. The report suggests that this was largely due to the fact that such workplaces lacked union recognition and calls for compulsory trade union recognition and the creation of new Joint Labour Committees for such sectors.   </p>  <p>  My clear view is that collective bargaining is an important element of ensuring industrial relations stability in Ireland.  This stability comes from a voluntarist system where the State does not seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but will, where appropriate, assist them in arriving at a solution. Should a group of employees and employers wish to establish JLCs for any sector for the purposes of engaging in collective bargaining, I trust the Labour Court will consider the matter and, where appropriate, issue establishment orders.</p></reply>

It is simply not right that people who are sick are often afraid to take time off for fear of a major reduction in their income and it's not good when it comes to public health. There's a risk of them infecting co-workers and customers as well.</p>  <p>  The Bill is intended to provide a level of protection to low paid employees, who may have no company sick pay schemes and cannot afford to miss work. However, in developing the Bill, I was very mindful of the unique economic challenges faced by employers due to Covid-19 and Brexit related impacts. Imposing excessive new costs on businesses at this time could jeopardise jobs. As a starting point, this law will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for State Illness Benefit. This Bill will ensure that all employees are better off and will have financial protection from day one of a medically certified absence. </p>  <p>  I have given a lot of consideration to the pressures on business at the current time, and the design parameters and the incremental approach to be taken are in recognition of this.  Employers will have time to adjust to the associated costs. All employees will eventually be entitled to ten days, or two weeks, of sick pay per year. </p>  <p>  Pre-legislative scrutiny has been completed and I have reviewed the Joint Oireachtas Committee's recommendations and made necessary amendments arising. </p>  <p>  I am presenting the Bill for the second stage debate in the D&aacute;il on Thursday April 7th and I hope to progress the Bill through all stages as soon as possible thereafter. </p></reply>

The Minimum Wage has increased substantially in real terms over recent years. </p>  <p>  The share of workers on the minimum wage in Ireland has also fallen consistently since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission. The share of workers on the minimum wage or less as a percentage of the total labour force has reduced from 9.3% in Q4, 2016 to 6.8% in Q4, 2020.</p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission is made up of an equal number of employer representatives, employee representatives, and independent members which helps to provide a balanced view when determining an appropriate rate for the National Minimum Wage. In addition, the establishing legislation requires the Low Pay Commission to give consideration to a range of issues when arriving at a recommendation for the appropriate National Minimum Wage rate. These issues include the cost of living, competitiveness and the likely effect that any proposed recommendation will have on future levels of employment.</p>  <p>  When considering increases in the National Minimum Wage during a period of inflation Government must be is conscious of the need to avoid second round effects. Pumping more money into the economy could lead to further inflation. </p>  <p>  That being said, I have been clear in my commitment to improving pay and terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay. </p>  <p>  I am committed to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government. In doing so, we need to recognise that many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic and are also facing rising costs. We need to make sure that we proceed in a way that does not adversely affect inflation or cause jobs to be lost, either in terms of the numbers of people employed, or the numbers of hours worked.  To do so would be counterproductive.</p>  <p>  While the living wage initiative is being considered, the Government will continue to be guided by the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission with regard to any future changes in the minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission is required to submit its annual recommendation on the National Minimum Wage to me on or before the third Tuesday in July. </p></reply>

The Taskforce will develop a cohesive national strategy to build out the industry to decarbonise our energy system and move us towards a green hydrogen economy. It will accelerate and drive key actions in the plan and develop a system wide project plan to meet the overall objective for Offshore Renewable Energy.</p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will actively participate in this group and ensure that the innovation, investment, and employment opportunities of the Offshore renewable energy sector are capitalised on.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is already actively engaging with the renewable energy sector, both directly and through our agencies, to develop the sector in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland continues to identify and work with those Irish companies with the capability to support the offshore wind industry&rsquo;s growth through the Offshore Wind Industry Cluster. They will hold the Enterprise Ireland Offshore Wind Showcase Event this summer, convening delegates from across the Irish and UK offshore wind industry. For its part, the IDA is involved in facilitating and promoting links between large energy users, including data centres, and the renewable energy sector to help them align with and contribute towards emissions targets and future network needs.</p>  <p>  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and agencies recognise the significant job opportunities associated with the offshore renewable energy sector. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Secretariat for which is based in my department, undertook a study on the nature and quantity of skills required between now and 2030 to deliver on some of the key enabling measures in the Climate Action Plan. </p>  <p>  The analysis found that demand for labour associated with offshore wind development is forecast to increase from a 2020 baseline of c.2,500 FTE to c.4,000 mid-decade, and to stand at c.3,500 in 2030. . My own department will work with the Department of Further and Higher Education and its agencies to follow through on these initiatives and secure the required workforce for the renewable energy sector.</p></reply>

The company said that it made this decision because it found it difficult to continue to scale its specific manufacturing operations in Ireland to remain competitive. IDA Ireland, worked closely with B.Braun to try to find a solution. Unfortunately, a solution could not be found, and the company made the decision to move a significant portion of its operations to third parties.</p>  <p>  I understand the planned closure of B.Braun will take place in a phased manner and the first redundancies will not take effect until the end of 2022.  In anticipation of this timeline, a series of initiatives are already underway. My Department through IDA Ireland activated the Job Loss Protocol which is a co-ordinated response plan implemented by an interagency group based in the region. The group consists of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Department of Social Protection, Local Enterprise Office, North West Regional Skills, Mayo Sligo Leitrim Education Training Board and IT Sligo.</p>  <p>  An introductory meeting has taken place with B.Braun and representatives from the Department of Social Protection. Department officials outlined the variety of supports available to the company and affected employees in the short, medium and long term. </p>  <p>  It is my understanding that B.Braun has also engaged with the North West Regional Skills Manager and Mayo Sligo Leitrim Education Training Board to discuss potential upskilling and reskilling opportunities. The company has been introduced to the Local Enterprise Office to help it get a better understanding of the supports available to employees. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland continues to market the available lands on the IDA business &amp;amp; technology park and Oakfield site in Sligo to potential investors. The creation of a talent profile of the site is currently underway which will be included to help market the site to new investors. It is important to note that Ireland is competing globally for investment and all local stakeholders have an important role to play in making Co. Sligo and the Border region as attractive as possible to investors.</p></reply>

My Department is considering the Commission's recommendations in relation to mandatory retirement ages in certain contracts of employment.</p>  <p>  There is no statutory retirement age for employees in Irish legislation, apart from for certain public sector employees where statutory retirement ages may apply. A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age but this is a matter of contract between the parties.</p>  <p>  Employment equality must be a core consideration in reforms to address mandatory retirement clauses, and the needs of both employees and employers will require consideration and further consultation. In this regard, it will be necessary to liaise closely with employer groups as any changes in this area have potential to have a significant impact on workforce planning, particularly for SMEs.</p>  <p>  Other pension related reforms, such as the delivery of a national auto-enrolment pension scheme, will make it easier for people to access retirement savings options to help them meet their own income expectations for when they retire and is a current Programme for Government commitment.</p></reply>

The Versailles Declaration is clear that Europe needs to phase out or dependency on Russian energy imports by amongst other things accelerating the reduction of our overall reliance on fossil fuels, developing a hydrogen market, speeding up renewables and diversifying supplies and routes including through the use of LNG and development of biogas.  In playing its role to deliver upon these commitments, Ireland must ensure we meet our climate ambitions, deliver affordable energy and ensure secure supplies of energy. Ireland has been very clear in its support for the accelerated reduction of our reliance on fossil fuels, particularly through the roll-out of energy efficiency and renewable energies.  </p>  <p>  In respect of LNG in Ireland, the Government Policy Statement on importing fracked gas was approved by Government and published in May 2021. The policy statement provides that, pending the outcome of a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems that is currently being carried out by my Department, it would not be appropriate for the development of any LNG terminals in Ireland to be permitted or proceeded with. This review being conducted is being carried out for the period to 2030, in the context of net zero emissions by no later than 2050. This includes examining potential risks and potential mitigating options for such risks. My Department is working to ensure that the implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict are reflected in the analysis as well as the broader energy security framework. </p></reply>

At the end of 2021 ComReg reported that total broadband subscriptions stood at 1.93m subscriptions, 87% of which had speeds equal to or greater than 30Mbps. The data clearly demonstrates the demand for high speed broadband services where these are available.    A number of commercial operators have also announced further investment plans in fibre broadband networks. Eir has said it will roll out fibre to 1.9 million premises by the end of 2026, while SIRO has announced a &euro;620 million upgrade and expansion of its fibre to the home network to reach 770,000 homes and business. Virgin Media has announced a &euro;200 million investment to upgrade its network for 1 million premises over the next three years. Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p>  <p>  As outlined in my reply to today's Priority Question from Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, National Broadband Ireland (NBI) continues to make steady progress on the rollout of the NBP State led intervention, with almost 316,000 premises surveyed, almost 166,000 premises under construction or complete across 26 counties and over 62,000 premises now available to order or pre-order across 22 counties. NBI has also confirmed that over 41,000 premises are now passed across 19 counties and are available for immediate connection.</p>  <p>  The Department has worked with NBI to agree an Updated Interim Remedial Plan (UIRP) which recalibrates the targets for 2022 to take account of the knock-on effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other delays to the Programme, with a revised target of 102,000 premises to be passed by the end of January 2023 (Contract Year 3).</p></reply>

A full table of import dependency figures by Member State is published by Eurostat.  Ireland imports all its oil. It accounts for 45% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy requirement, which is one of the highest rates of oil dependency in the EU. Of this, the majority is used in transport. There is also significant oil use in residential and business heating and in industry.</p><p>Ireland sources roughly one-quarter of its natural gas from the Corrib gas field. Three-quarters is sourced via the interconnector from the UK, which has diverse sources of supply. Natural gas accounts for 34% of Ireland&rsquo;s primary energy requirement and is used in electricity generation, the industrial sector and heating homes.</p><p>The third largest primary energy source for Ireland is from renewables, which makes up 13% of our total requirement. The share of renewable energy in Ireland's primary supply has increased from 2.3% to 13% since 2005, just under a factor of 6 increase. Wind is the second largest source of generated electricity, after natural gas. In 2020, wind generation accounted for 36.1% of all electricity generated in Ireland, which is one of the highest rates in the EU.</p><p>The best way to secure our energy needs is to continue to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. Ireland&rsquo;s 2021 Climate Action Plan sets us on a pathway to reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels dramatically by 2030, in the context of reaching net-zero emission by 2050. However, as set out in the November 2021 Government Policy Statement on Security of Electricity of Supply, there will be a continued need beyond 2030 for gas-fired conventional generation to support and back-up high levels of renewable electricity.</p></reply>

Ireland has been very clear in its support for the accelerated reduction of our reliance on fossil fuels, particularly through the roll-out of energy efficiency and renewable energies.     In terms of Oil, markets rose steeply in response to the war in Ukraine and this fed quickly into higher pump prices.  Acknowledging the impact on transport fuels, the Government introduced an Excise reduction on March 8 which led to a 20 cent per litre reduction in petrol and a 15 cent per litre reduction in diesel. </p>  <p>  Since the onset of the conflict, I have been in regular contact with EU and International counterparts through the IEA and EU structures to monitor the fast moving situation and to agree co-ordinated responses. My Department is also in daily contact with the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) and the oil industry, represented by Fuels for Ireland (FFI), in order to monitor supplies into the State.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s policy of holding a Strategic Oil Reserve equivalent to 90 days supply is required by both its membership of the EU and the International Energy Agency (IEA) and this role is performed by NORA. These reserves are ready to be deployed as necessary.</p>  <p>  In order to help alleviate global supply concerns that emerged immediately on foot of the war in Ukraine, member countries of the IEA, including Ireland, participated in a co-ordinated release of strategic reserves that amounted to 60 million barrels. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this release amounted to 222,000 barrels.</p></reply>

This includes increasing the supply of renewable energy sources, including at local level, in line with the target of up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030. There is an overriding public need to accelerate the delivery of renewable energy projects in the context of energy price increases and energy market volatility resulting from Russia's war on Ukraine.  The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is one of the major Government policies to help deliver up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030. The RESS supports communities in a variety of ways including through a separate category for community projects and a community enabling framework to assist development of community projects. The Climate Action Plan includes a target for at least 500MW of renewable electricity to be supplied by local community-based projects; to reach this target, at least 100 community projects will be needed. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure such a pipeline of community projects, the SEAI are deploying a range of capacity-building supports including toolkit guides, trusted intermediary and advisory services, for expert financial, grid and planning advice, as well as financial enabling grant supports to aid the development of these projects. </p>  <p>  As well as this, Government has recently approved a Microgeneration Support Scheme (MSS) which supports deployment of an expected 380 MW of new micro renewable generation by 2030. In addition, my Department is also working with the SEAI on a policy design for a small-scale generation support scheme for farmers, business, and communities to generate their own electricity and feed into the grid. This is being progressed in 2022 and will become available in 2023.</p></reply>

Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland (NBI) has made steady progress on delivery of the new high speed fibre broadband network under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). I am advised by NBI that as of 31 March 2022, over 312,000 premises have been surveyed and over 169,000 premises are under construction or complete across 26 counties. I am further advised that almost 60,000 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 22 counties, with over 41,000 premises passed across 19 counties and available for immediate connection. In addition to the premises completed, build is underway on over 128,000 premises, demonstrating that the project is reaching scale.</p><p>In line with a remedial plan to address Covid-19 related delays which was agreed with my Department in April 2021, NBI had expected to have almost 60,000 premises passed and available for immediate connection by the end of January 2022 which is the end of Contract Year 2. </p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. </p><p>NBI has implemented a number of measures to help lessen the impact that these challenges have had on the rollout including:-</p><p>-  Increasing the rate of pole replacement and duct remediation per month;</p><p>-  Bringing in additional NBI resources;</p><p>-  Earlier procurement of material used in the build stages; and</p><p>-  Bringing in additional subcontractors</p><p>The Department has worked with NBI to agree an Updated Interim Remedial Plan (UIRP) which recalibrates the targets for 2022 to take account of the knock on effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other delays to the Programme, with a revised target of 102,000 premises passed by the end of January 2023 (Contract Year 3). The focus for 2022 is to continue to build momentum, and catch up on the delays experienced.</p><p>With regards to job creation, the NBP has delivered significant employment opportunities to date, with NBI providing direct and indirect employment to some 1,270 people, including some 293 direct employees and some 977 employees working with build/design contractors on foot of the NBP investment, with this number rising as the construction activity ramps up. The delivery of the NBP is seen as a key enabler of many aspects of the Programme for Government. It will allow policies around remote working and remote service delivery to be realised to their full potential throughout the country no matter how remote the location.</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 31 March 2022, 551 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs.</p><p>At the end of 2021, total broadband subscriptions in Ireland stood at 1.93m subscriptions, 87% of which had speeds equal to or greater than 30Mbps. The NBP will provide a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 554,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with some 679 schools. The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. </p><p>A number of commercial operators have also announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband. Eir has said it will roll out fibre to 1.9 million premises by the end of 2026, while SIRO has announced a &euro;620 million upgrade and expansion of its fibre to the home network to reach 770,000 homes and business. Virgin Media has announced a &euro;200 million investment to upgrade its network for 1 million premises over the next three years. Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p></reply>

The SEM Committee comprises the two energy regulators, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Utility Regulator and an independent member.  In the SEM, all electricity generators, including gas and renewables, are obliged to sell their output into the &ldquo;pool&rdquo;. The wholesale price is based on the last bid by a generator that is accepted by the Market operator to meet the demand for electricity at that time. The market operator accepts all the available renewable power and any other power source that has priority and then accepts the lowest bid followed by the next lowest and so on until the demand is matched by supply.

Ireland will work closely with the European Commission and Member States to deliver upon this ambition.  </p>  <p>In the immediate term, Ireland is  continuing to monitor international gas and oil energy markets and to consult with its EU and international partners on appropriate measures, if necessary, to ensure energy security in light of Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. The European Commission is engaging with other countries to ensure sufficient and timely supply of natural gas to the EU from diverse sources across the globe to avoid supply shocks, including those that could result from disruptions. </p>  <p>The crisis in Ukraine has brought into sharp focus the EU and Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on fossil fuel imports. We must continue to accelerate the clean energy transition, focussing on energy efficiency and renewable energies. The best way to secure our energy needs is to continue to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. Climate Action Plan 2021 sets us on a pathway to reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels dramatically by 2030. </p>  <p>My Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems. This review is being carried out for the period to 2030, in the context of net zero emissions by no later than 2050.

Data centres also create employment and attract foreign direct investment. However, the expansion of data centres, particularly in the Dublin region, is projected to lead to a large increase in electricity demand which raises challenges for the energy system. Under the Climate Action Plan 2021, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has committed to reviewing the 2018 'Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy' to ensure alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets, sectoral emissions and climate priorities.

The National Cyber Security Centre plays an important role in supporting Government Departments and other public bodies to improve the resilience and security of their IT systems to better protect services that our people rely upon, and their data.    </p>  <p>  Information sharing is a key component of the work of the NCSC whereby it acts a source of expert advice and guidance for public bodies and other stakeholders. In November 2021 the NCSC  published the public sector baseline cyber security standard which set out a framework to be used by Public Service Bodies as a baseline to gauge their organisation&rsquo;s cyber security preparedness. The NCSC also shares information on threats and vulnerabilities, in the form of advisories. In many cases these advisories are shared with the public, however the NCSC also provides restricted and confidential advisories in respect of specific threats. The NCSC is in regular and frequent communication with international counterparts and the exchange of information is very much a two-way street. The NCSC has also deployed a monitoring programme, Sensor, across Government Departments to monitor for potential threats and malicious activity. The recent Capacity Review recommended expanding this programme across all Government Networks and Critical Infrastructure. This will be addressed in the legislation being drafted in my Department.</p>  <p>The NCSC has been operating at a heightened state of preparedness in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The NCSC has contingency plans in place in case of escalation of malicious cyber activity impacting on Irish networks and services. The NCSC has arrangements in place to avail of external expert support as required including a number of third-party incident response services. The NCSC has also issued a number of guidance and support documents recently, including a detailed Advisory Note and a &lsquo;Cyber Vitals&rsquo; check list. This Advisory detailed a cyber risk assessment and appropriate advice regarding the ongoing situation in Ukraine. These documents are publicly available on the NCSC website https://ncsc.gov.ie/news/ The NCSC is in ongoing contact with counterparts across the EU, as well as the UK, US and other countries to share information and monitor possible threats. The NCSC continues to work closely with the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is in frequent contact with operators of critical infrastructure and services to monitor for possible malicious cyber activity. </p></reply>

The SEAI's National Heat Study, published in February 2022, examines options to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors in Ireland to 2050, including options for green hydrogen. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently preparing a public consultation on a hydrogen strategy for Ireland. This consultation will include consideration of the work programme required to deliver 1-3 TWh of zero emissions gas. I expect this strategy focussing on the development of green hydrogen to be included in Climate Action Plan 2022.</p></reply>

We should not depart from the competitive principles of our market design, which would undermine the cost-effective decarbonisation of our energy system, jeopardise affordability and risk security of supply.    On 15 and 17 November 2021 respectively, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) issued their preliminary reports on the functioning of the energy and carbon markets. Final reports are expected this month. ACER noted that any changes to the current wholesale market design require careful consideration so as not to inadvertently impact the ability of the framework to drive desired EU-wide changes, such as cost-efficient decarbonisation, over the medium and longer term, while ESMA&rsquo;s preliminary analysis does not indicate that the market is not functioning as it should. We need to take into account the final report by ACER before considering any new measures in the wholesale electricity market design to avoid the risk of unanticipated or unintended consequences.</p>  <p>  The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Improving our energy efficiency, cutting our dependence on fossil fuels and generating power from our own renewable sources will ensure a cleaner, cheaper energy future in the long term. Electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU).   </p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s target to achieve 5GW by 2030 will be primarily met off our eastern and southern coasts. This reflects the suitability of water depths in these regions for deployment of fixed bottom offshore wind turbines and the availability of electricity grid infrastructure capacity. The Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 provides the legal underpinning for an entirely new marine planning system, which will balance harnessing our huge offshore wind potential while protecting our rich and unique marine environment. Ahead of the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA) in 2023, the legislation provides, on an interim basis, the legal authority for the Minister of the Environment, Climate and Communications, to assess Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from offshore renewable energy developers who meet defined assessment criteria. </p><p>I recently announced the launch of this application window, which will open on 25 April for an 8-week period. The first MACs are expected to be issued in the second half of 2022. The process will assess applicants in key areas, including financial and technical competency. This will ensure that only the most viable offshore projects can apply for permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will include full environmental assessment and public participation. </p><p>This approach ensures that immediate progress can be made in progressing offshore wind energy, while MARA is being established. Following assessment of the initial batch of MACs, responsibility will be handed over to MARA from early 2023. </p></reply>

The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is high international gas prices where we are a price taker. In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have risen and remained high since the second half of 2020. Gas prices are now at historically high levels. The increase in international wholesale gas prices, have continued to be driven  by the volatility in the international gas market linked to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the on-going war. These gas increases feed directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.</p><p>  Government&rsquo;s response to the current surge in international gas prices has been to utilise the tax and social welfare system in Budget 22 to counter rising costs of living for households. Additionally, and in recognition of the ongoing inflationary pressures on households, the Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Act 2022 provides for a credit payment to each domestic electricity account amounting to &euro;200 (including VAT). Approximately 2.1 million account holders will benefit from the payment in the coming weeks. This was one of a range of new measures as part of a &euro;505m package of measures to mitigate the wider cost of living increases announced by Government on the 10th February.</p><p>  The conflict in Ukraine has led to sharp increases on international oil markets from late February onwards. This fed directly into higher pump prices and the Government responded on the 8th March  with Excise reductions which amounted to 20 cent per litre for petrol and 15 cent per litre for diesel. </p></reply>

A thirty-day public consultation period is part of both the Prospecting Licence application and renewal process and notices are placed in a local newspaper, the county council office, a local garda station and on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a draft policy statement on mineral exploration and mining, that highlights the critical role minerals will play in our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 and the transition to a circular economy through their use in, for example, renewable energy technologies, such as solar power, wind and batteries. The draft policy statement also underlines the importance of transparency and strong stakeholder engagement in our minerals policy and regulatory processes.

These Regulations mean the Clean Export Guarantee (CEG) tariff is now available for new and existing micro-and small-scale generators so that they can receive payment from their electricity supplier for all excess renewable electricity they export to the grid, reflective of the market value.The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) published a decision on an interim enabling framework for the CEG on 1 December 2021 which outlines the arrangements for the implementation of the CEG, including eligibility criteria and remuneration methodology. The CRU has decided that suppliers will set their individual CEG tariffs on a competitive market basis. A number of suppliers are now advertising their CEG rates, and the CRU advise consumers to check with their supplier in the first instance.</p><p>The CRU is not setting a date or deadline for the timing of the first payment. Those micro-and small-scale generators who have met the eligibility criteria are now accruing the CEG tariff value for all of their exported electricity and can expect an initial payment or credit from their supplier within a reasonable time after June 2022.

The RESS supports communities in a variety of ways including through a separate category for community projects and a mandatory community benefit fund for every project supported in the scheme.   To date, two projects have reached commercial operation as part of the first RESS competition (RESS 1). These projects are both windfarms and amount to almost 19 MW of new renewable electricity generation. I am expecting further RESS 1 projects to reach commercial operation in the coming weeks including the first solar farms in Ireland. </p>  <p>  All RESS 1 projects are required to reach commercial operation by the end of 2023 at the very latest and are incentivised under the scheme to deliver early. EirGrid and ESB Networks project that the volume of new renewable generators connecting to the grid this year will far surpass previous annual connection rates and it is critical that this pace of delivery continues. </p>  <p>  Under RESS 1, seven community projects, comprising five solar and two wind projects, are progressing through a number of milestones for delivery under the RESS scheme. These projects are anticipated to reach commercial operation before the end of 2023. The auction category for community projects has been retained in RESS 2. This category has been developed specifically to allow communities and citizens to participate in and benefit from RESS, empowering communities to generate their own electricity will help us to spread the message of the green transition.</p>  <p>  The projects under development with support from the RESS, both developer and community led, will contribute significantly towards the renewable energy targets and trajectories set out in the National Energy and Climate Plan and to the renewable electricity ambitions set out in the Climate Action Plan. Further rounds of regular RESS auctions are critical to accelerating the pace and delivery of renewable energy sources and the urgent need for diversification away from fossil fuels. </p></reply>

It is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). Since the start of the scheme in 2000, over 145,000 free upgrades have been supported. In 2021, the average cost of the energy efficiency measures provided per household had increased significantly to &euro;17,100.There are currently just over 6,900 homes awaiting works on the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme work programme. This includes homes that are:- Awaiting the initial survey of their home;</p><p>- Have completed an initial home survey and are awaiting allocation to a contractor;</p><p>- Have been allocated to a contractor for works; or,</p><p>- Currently undergoing works.</p><p>Activity under the Scheme, and the associated expenditure, were significantly impacted in both 2020 and 2021 by the COVID pandemic. SEAI data indicates that for homes completed in 2021, the average cycle time from application to completion was approximately 26 months. While this delay was largely driven by Covid related issues, the deeper measures being provided under the Scheme since 2018, also involve more substantive works. </p><p>In order to reduce this timeline to completion, the following key actions are being taken:</p><p>- The budget, at &euro;109 million, is nearly three times the 2021 outturn (&euro;38 million) and funding has also been sought through the European Regional Development Fund;</p><p>- The number of homes retrofitted under the scheme are due to increase from 177 per month in 2021 to 400 per month in 2022, this is a top priority in SEAI's work programme;</p><p>- SEAI has allocated additional staff for the Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme;</p><p>- SEAI is working to increase contractor output through active contract engagement and management.</p><p>Works under the Scheme recommenced in line with activity in the residential construction sector and activity did ramp up again towards the end of last year. Based on the foregoing, SEAI target clearing the homes currently on the waiting list in approximately 18 months.</p></reply>

In November last year, I signed the Separate Collection (Deposit Return Scheme) Regulations 2021, providing the legal framework for the scheme, in particular the terms under which a scheme operator may be approved. The regulations also set out the obligations that will fall to producers, retailers and return point operators under the scheme, which will be launched later this year.The introduction of a Deposit Return Scheme will assist in reducing single use plastics, thus helping Ireland meet EU targets while promoting a wider circular economy. Materials to be included in the scheme will be those for which Ireland faces immediate, challenging EU recycling and separate collection targets. The scheme will therefore focus on plastic bottles and aluminium beverage cans. Recycling rates in Ireland for glass are significantly above current EU targets.</p><p>The Regulations provide that other materials may be considered for inclusion in the Deposit Return Scheme when the scheme is fully established.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the achievement of 5GW of installed offshore wind capacity by 2030 and a further commitment to develop a longer-term plan to harness the estimated potential of at least 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters. The 5GW target will be primarily met through development of fixed bottom offshore wind turbines in Ireland&rsquo;s eastern and southern coastal regions. Subsequent cost-effective deployment of renewables in deeper waters off the west coast, to take advantage of greater wind resources, should be increasingly feasible through future advances in floating turbine technology. </p><p>Work on a revised Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP II) has been initiated by my Department. This will provide an evidence base for the identification of the most suitable areas for the sustainable development of fixed and floating wind, wave, and tidal technologies, while also considering other maritime activities and marine biodiversity. The OREDP II will set out the pathway for the development of offshore renewable energy, including floating offshore wind, beyond 2030.</p><p>The first batch of projects to progress through the new marine consenting process will be fixed bottom wind turbines on the east coast. My Department recently held a consultation on the criteria to use to select the second batch of projects required to meet our 5GW target. This includes a proposal for an Innovation Category which is of particular relevance to developers of floating offshore wind energy projects. Responses are currently being assessed, with a decision on the Phase 2 criteria to be taken later this year.</p></reply>

Under the Act, the Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) submitted their first carbon budget programme in October 2021. The programme establishes a pathway to achieving our legally binding climate objectives &ndash; it will deliver on our commitment to a 51% reduction in our carbon emissions by 2030 and it will set us on the way to net zero no later than 2050. Last December I initiated the process for the adoption of the proposed Carbon Budgets. The motion being considered this week in both Houses of the Oireachtas is the final step in this adoption process, but only the beginning of the implementation challenge.</p>  <p>  I believe that the carbon budgets satisfy the principle of climate justice. They are aligned with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement, and these agreements are themselves rooted in the principles of climate justice on a global scale. The CCAC, in line with the 2021 Climate Act, prepared the budgets having regard to climate justice. Their analysis is laid out in the Carbon Budget Technical Report, published last October. At a national level, appropriately designed climate policies, measures and actions have huge potential to open up new employment and enterprise opportunities, including targeted supports to help particularly impacted groups, regions and communities to adapt to the new economy, as committed to the Climate Action Plan 2021. While the costs of climate action will be more acutely by some people, groups and sectors, this Government has shown itself to be fully committed to protecting those most vulnerable and to ensuring a just transition through interventions such as the progressive redistribution of carbon tax receipts; one hundred per cent funding of energy efficiency interventions for poorer households; and implementing a Just Transition Plan for the Midlands to address the end of peat harvesting for energy generation.</p></reply>

ComReg advises that the current minimum coverage obligations in those licences are being considerably exceeded by all operators.Capital investment by telecommunications operators over the last 5 years was in the order of &euro;3.3 billion for both fixed and mobile services. This has significantly enhanced the availability of services, both voice and data, throughout Ireland, including in rural areas.  </p><p>ComReg is currently in the process of running another Multi-band Spectrum Award to assign rights of use in four spectrum bands. The award comprises 470 MHz of spectrum and represents a 46% increase in the harmonised spectrum assigned for the provision of wireless broadband services in Ireland. This will significantly enable the market to provide improved services to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data and new  services.  </p><p>To assist consumers to choose the network provider that best meets their needs, ComReg has developed a national outdoor coverage map (available at this <i>link</i>). This map provides consumers with very clear information on where operators have good 2G, 3G and 4G coverage. </p><p>Since 2016, the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce has been a driving force for improving access to telecommunications services nationwide. It has completed over 70 targeted actions to alleviate connectivity barriers, and continues to tackle issues impeding the rollout of mobile and fixed connectivity. The reconvened Taskforce is due to meet later this month to agree a new work programme focused on ensuring access to high quality telecommunications connectivity across Ireland to support social and economic development.</p><p>At the end of 2021, total broadband subscriptions stood at 1.93m subscriptions, 87% of which had speeds equal to or greater than 30Mbps. The National Broadband Plan will provide a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools. The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. A number of commercial operators have also announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband. Eir has said it will roll out fibre to 1.9 million premises by the end of 2026, while SIRO has announced a &euro;620 million upgrade and expansion of its fibre to the home network to reach 770,000 homes and business. Virgin Media has announced a &euro;200 million investment to upgrade their network, delivering speeds of 10Gbps for 1 million premises over the next three years. Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p></reply>

In addition to EWIC, there are two further proposed interconnectors, which are the 500MW Greenlink Interconnector between Wexford and South Wales, and the 700MW Celtic Interconnector between East Cork and Brittany, France. Both projects are at an advanced stage of pre-construction development, with the projects' promoters anticipating that Greenlink will be completed by 2024/25, and Celtic by 2026/27. Development of the Celtic and Greenlink interconnectors is anticipated to have a positive impact on Irish electricity customers in terms of enhancing our energy security of supply and increasing wholesale market competition. These projects should also facilitate the integration of higher volumes of renewable energy, including offshore wind, via the export of surplus renewables to neighbouring countries which would otherwise be curtailed. This should have a particularly beneficial impact on renewables development in the South East region, where both new interconnector projects will connect with Ireland&rsquo;s onshore electricity transmission system.     </p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2021 requires my Department to update Ireland's existing interconnector policy by the end of 2022, in order to reflect Ireland&rsquo;s increased climate and energy ambition, and to provide for increased levels of future interconnection with neighbouring countries. </p></reply>

The Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 was a significant milestone to enable development of this sector, providing certainty for offshore wind energy projects, which involve substantial levels of up-front investment. Ahead of the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA) in early 2023, the legislation provides, on an interim basis, the legal authority for the Minister of the Environment, Climate and Communications, to assess Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from a set of pre-qualified offshore renewable energy developers. I recently announced the launch of this application window, which will open on 25 April for an 8-week period. The first MACs are expected to be issued in the second half of 2022. The process will assess applicants in key areas, including financial and technical competency. This will ensure that only the most viable offshore projects can apply for permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la. This approach ensures that immediate progress can be made in progressing offshore wind energy, while MARA is being established and takes over MAC responsibility from early 2023. </p><p>The levelised cost of energy produced by offshore wind has fallen steadily over the past decade, driven in part by technological advances and competitive auction pressures, but also by scale increases in both offshore turbines and the quantity of turbines.</p><p>A cross-Departmental Offshore Wind Delivery Taskforce is being established to drive delivery and capture wider and longer term economic and business opportunities associated with the development of offshore renewables in Ireland. This will include the identification of supporting infrastructure development and supply chain opportunities as Ireland&rsquo;s offshore wind industry is developed.</p></reply>

Additionally, there is a further commitment to develop a longer-term plan to harness the estimated potential of at least 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters. The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is one of the major Government policies to help deliver on the ambition in the Climate Action Plan 2021 of up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030. Over 1GW of new renewable generation was secured in the first RESS competition, including a number of onshore wind farms, which are due to reach commercial operation before the end of 2023.A significant volume of new renewable generation is expected to be secured in the RESS 2 auction which will take place next month.The Maritime Area Planning (MAP) Act 2021 was developed last year, in close cooperation with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to provide the legal underpinning to an entirely new marine planning system, which will balance harnessing our huge offshore wind potential with protecting our rich and unique marine environment. Earlier in 2022, my Department carried out a consultation on the proposed assessment criteria for the first batch of Maritime Area Consent (MAC) applications from a set of seven qualified Offshore Renewable Energy projects.</p><p>Alongside this, my Department have been drafting the terms and conditions for offshore wind-specific RESS auctions.  At least three offshore RESS auctions are currently planned for this decade</p><p>. A schedule of future auctions through to 2025 was published in December 2021 (set out below) so that generators can develop their projects with confidence to line up with these regular auctions ensuring a steady supply of projects to meet regional and national targets.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Auction Type</th>       <th>Indicative Auction Volume (GWh)</th>       <th>Indicative Auction Dates</th>       <th>Indicative Auction Commercial Operation Dates</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Onshore RESS 2</td>       <td>1,000-3,500</td>       <td>Q2 2022</td>       <td>2024</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offshore RESS 1</td>       <td>7,500-10,000</td>       <td>Q4 2022</td>       <td>2027 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Onshore RESS 3</td>       <td>2,000-5,500</td>       <td>Q2 2023</td>       <td>2025</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offshore RESS 2</td>       <td>15,000-25,000</td>       <td>2024-2025</td>       <td>2029 ​</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Onshore RESS 4</td>       <td>1,000-5,000</td>       <td>2024</td>       <td>2026</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>In addition, a supportive spatial planning framework for onshore wind and solar electricity generation development is absolutely critical to deliver on these ambitions. My Department is working closely with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deliver on the measures and actions set out in the Climate Action Plan 2021 in this regard. This will include targets for the total renewable (onshore wind and solar) capacity that should be planned for on a national and regional level. </p></reply>

The Regional Aid Map identifies the areas where Regional Aid can be granted.  Regional Aid is a form of state aid provided to enterprises to encourage investment and job creation in areas of relative economic disadvantage.  Granting authorities in Ireland, in particular Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, are now in a position to grant Regional Aid to eligible enterprises under the new Map, which will apply up to December 2027. </p><p>It is important to note that Regional Aid is not the only form of aid available to Irish enterprises. Only approximately 7.4% of Ireland&rsquo;s State Aid is in the form of Regional Aid.

As the Scheme was delivered through the Local Authorities, it has been subject to the appropriate public sector operational and financial management procedures, and an &lsquo;Overview of the Restart Grant and Restart Grant Plus Schemes&rsquo; report was produced in October 2021 by the VFM Unit of the Local Government Audit Service.</p><p>The Restart Grant independent audit is currently underway and, following completion of this, an evaluation of the Scheme will be carried out.

The Irish State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the European Union and other EEA states.  However, where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possess those skills.  </p><p>All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006 and are dependent on a job offer from an Irish registered Employer for an eligible occupation. The State's employment permit system is ordered by the use of occupation<b></b>lists which determine which employments are in high demand and which are ineligible for employment permits. These lists are reviewed on a twice-yearly basis.</p><p>Non-EEA nationals holding valid immigration permission, who have been offered employment in an eligible occupation will be allowed to apply for an Employment Permit whilst already legally resident in the State. The non EEA national must hold a valid immigration stamp namely,  Stamps 1, 1A, 2, 2A and 3 immigration permissions.  Holders of Stamp 4 immigration permission do not require an employment permit to enter employment in the State.  It is advised that in respect of the person concerned (provided in the details)  who is currently the holder of a Stamp 4 should in the first instance apply to the Department of Justice with  a view to changing their permission.  If however an application for an employment permit is submitted, the application will be considered.</p><p>If the occupation of the person concerned is an eligible occupation for an employment permit but it is not listed on the Critical Skills Occupations List or the annual remuneration is less than &euro;64,000 based on a 39 hour working week, it will not be possible to meet the criteria for a Critical Skills Employment Permit.  In such circumstances, a General Employment Permit application may be submitted on behalf of the person concerned but it will be necessary for a valid Labour Market Needs Test for an employment permit to be carried out prior to submitting the application. </p><p>To assist applicants when applying for a General Employment Permit a checklist document  has been prepared and it is available on my Department's website and can be accessed through this link:- General-Employment-Permits-Checklist.pdf (enterprise.gov.ie).</p><p>Full information on the current eligibility criteria in relation to employment permits can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.dbei.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/.</p><p>My Department also has a Frequently Asked Questions on its website which aims to answer the majority of the frequently asked questions we receive from applicants for employment permits, and it is available at <i>dbei.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Workplace-and-Skills/Employment-Permits/FAQs/.</i></p><p>Online employment permit applications may be submitted at epos.djei.ie.

GNP showed an increase of 11.5% in 2021 over 2020, while the deglobalised measure, Modified Domestic Demand (MDD) increased by 6.5% over the year.</p><p>The industrial sector, which is dominated by manufacturing activities, increased by 24% in 2021 compared to the previous year, and activity in this sector is now significantly higher than pre-pandemic. The &lsquo;&rsquo;modern manufacturing sector&rsquo;&rsquo;, which is dominated by pharmaceutical and other MNEs, performed strongly throughout the Pandemic. Meanwhile, production in the &lsquo;&rsquo;traditional sector&rsquo;&rsquo; is gathering pace and performed solidly in the final quarter of 2021 compared to the previous three months. </p><p>The performance and recovery of the services sector in the aftermath of the COVID-19 shock has been more diverse than the manufacturing sector due to the customer facing and labour-intensive nature of certain service sectors. While the Information and Communications sector has performed exceptionally well, other services sectors such as Arts and Entertainment are only beginning their path to full recovery. </p><p>The labour market has also shown considerable resilience with the total number of persons in employment in Q4 2021 reaching 2,506,000, compared to 2,276,800 persons in employment in Q4 2020, and 2,357,300 in Q4 2019, before the onset of COVID-19. The total numbers employed in the industrial sector are now 27,800 higher than before the pandemic began, once again highlighting the strength of this sector. Since 2019, total employment in the manufacturing sector in enterprise agency client companies has increased by 5.1%, or 11,534 jobs, to reach 238,038 jobs in 2021.</p><p>The outcome for employment in the services sector is more mixed, with the total numbers employed in Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities, and Financial, Insurance and Real Estate Activities higher in the final quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter in 2019. However, the total numbers in employment were lower in the Accommodation and Food Service Activities sector. During the two year period spanning the pandemic from 2019 to 2021 total employment in the services sector in enterprise agency client companies has increased by 10.8%, or 22,262 jobs, to reach 229,301 in 2021.</p><p>Given the heightened global uncertainty surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the ESRIrevised slightly downward their forecasts for the Irish economy in 2022, but the outlook still remains positive. The ESRI now expect Irish GDP to increase by 6.2% in 2022 and modified domestic demand to grow 5.0%. The ESRI also anticipate continued improvements in the labour market, with unemployment set to average 6.3% in 2022. </p><p>GDP by Sector - CSO - Central Statistics Office</p><p>Employment - CSO - Central Statistics Office</p><p>Quarterly Economic Commentary, Spring 2022 | ESRI</p></reply>

The Plan includes the overarching ambition of having 2.5 million people in work by 2024, a target which has already been exceeded according to the latest figures released by the CSO&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey in February this year. The plan outlined renewed supports to help businesses deal with the direct impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as outlining the Government&rsquo;s medium- term approach to creating the right environment for a jobs-led recovery and crucially to ensure that these jobs are more productive, innovative, resilient and in new areas of opportunity.  </p>  <p>  The Plan is about the sustainable rebuilding and renewal of our economy, across four pillars: helping people back into work with supports, intense activation and accelerated reskilling and upskilling opportunities, through Pathways to Work 2021-2025, which includes provisions to invest in and increase the number of training and education opportunities to assist people without jobs and those in employment to retrain and reskill;  re-building sustainable enterprises by future-proofing enterprise to be more resilient, innovative, and productive;  a balanced and inclusive recovery through strategic investment in infrastructure and reforms that enhance our long-term capacity for sustainable growth, balanced regional development and by improving living standards; and ensuring sustainable public finances.</p>  <p>  The Plan is underpinned by a range of investment supports including funding to support the extended labour market and enterprise supports as well as the multi-billion strategic investment through the National Development Plan (NDP), which sets out a total public investment of &euro;165 billion over the period 2021-2030. </p>  <p>  Projects funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) are integrated into the Economic Recovery Plan, and reinforce the Government&rsquo;s approach, which is focussed on supporting recovery and job creation, advancing the green transition, and accelerating and expanding digital reforms and transformation. The initial allocation under the NRRP is &euro;915 million, with a further allocation to be made in 2023. The NRRP projects are focussed on addressing the twin decarbonisation and digitalisation transition and associated behavioural changes which will profoundly alter the economy. Embracing these transitions also is expected to open substantial new opportunities for businesses and support significant job creation.  </p>  <p>  Supporting indigenous SMEs, which account for over two thirds of total employment in Ireland, to innovate and become more productive will be critical to sustaining economic recovery and our ambition for resilient employment into the future. The Government is pursuing a two-pronged recovery approach; a focus on domestic SMEs, whilst leveraging and reinforcing the enormous strength and resilience of the Foreign Direct Investment sector in Ireland and its indispensable contribution to communities across the country. Through the delivery of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy, Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-2024 and complementary trade initiatives, Ireland will enhance its value proposition for FDI and aim to win 800 total investments to support job creation of 50,000 across the country, as well as strengthening linkages between FDI and domestic SMEs.</p>  <p>  Progress on the wide range of deliverables and workstreams across the four pillars of the Economic Recovery Plan, towards the plan&rsquo;s overall ambition is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment and related sub-groups and Senior Official Groups and progress towards the various targets including employment and job creation will continue to be monitored carefully.</p></reply>

It has increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications, including removing hundreds of doctors from the permits system. The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has tripled compared to 2021 levels.</p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits section has made positive progress to reduce the current backlog reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from 11,181 in January 2022 to 8,773 at the end of March 2022.

This Scheme is now open for applications and details can be accessed on Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s efforts to create sustainable enterprise in the regions is working, as can be seen by the latest Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Local Enterprise Office Annual Report figures. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy fully aligns with Government's ambition to bring job opportunities and growth to all parts of Ireland increasing total employment to a record high of 2.5 million by 2024 with an ambitious target of creating 45,000 jobs over the next three years and increasing exports by Enterprise Ireland client companies to &euro;30 billion. </p>  <p>  The IDA has made progress in boosting investment in regional locations. Of the 246 investments won in 2020, more than half went to regional locations.  In 2021, of the 249 investments secured by the IDA, over half were for locations outside Dublin.   </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices have just come out of an 8th consecutive year of growth with 7,400 new jobs created by LEO clients in 2021. The LEOs now support over 7,100 companies financially within their portfolio with almost 36,000 associated jobs.  The Local Enterprise Offices are at the very heart of business development and entrepreneurship in towns and communities right across all regions.  </p>  <p>  While there are challenges, there is resilience in the Irish business community and a renewed optimism for the future growth of our small and micro businesses. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the &lsquo;Town Centre First - A Policy Approach for Irish Towns&rsquo; which was jointly developed by Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Rural and Community Development and informed by the work of a Town Centre First Interdepartmental Group, was published in February 2022, focuses on the regeneration of rural towns and villages.   </p>  <p>  Now that most of the restrictions have been lifted I want workers to be able to work remotely, whether from home or nearby hub if they chose to do so.  I recently published details of new legislation which will give employees the right to request remote working, to allow people to live and work in their local regions.  With more people working in their local towns and villages this will contribute to supporting our climate change targets, reduce traffic congestion and commuting times to an individual&rsquo;s place of work.</p></reply>

This marks an increase of 6.3%, or 148,700 jobs, over employment in Q4 2019 before the pandemic began. Employment decreased between 2019 and 2020 due to the pandemic and rebounded in 2021 following the easing of restrictions.</p><p>The employment rate for those aged 15-64 was 73.0% in 2021, compared with 67.0% in 2020 and 70.1% in 2019.</p><p><b>Table 1: Total Employment, Q4 2019-2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>Q4 2019 </th>       <th>Q4 2020 </th>       <th>Q4 2021</th>       <th>% Change 2019-21</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total Employment</td>       <td>2,357,300 </td>       <td>2,276,800 </td>       <td>2,506,000 </td>       <td>6.3%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Source: Central Statistics Office, Labour Force Survey</p><p>These numbers count those who were on the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme as employed.</p><p>These results show the resilience of the Irish economy despite the immense challenges posed by the pandemic.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Economic Recovery Plan, published last June, sets an ambitious target to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by having 2.5 million people in work by 2024 and in more productive and resilient jobs. The Plan sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to create the right environment for a jobs-led recovery by helping business become more resilient and agile and by supporting people to transition to new jobs in growing sectors of the economy. The Plan commits to further strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s Skills Framework and architecture to ensure people are supported to secure and remain in sustainable and quality employment through opportunities to reskill and upskill.  Accelerating the provision of training, reskilling and upskilling opportunities and increased activation will be pursued through Pathways to Work 2021-2025. </p><p>SMEs account for over two thirds of total employment, and as such a strong focus on indigenous SMEs is critical to a jobs-led recovery. The Economic Recovery Plan sets out a two-pronged recovery approach; a focus on domestic SMEs, whilst leveraging and reinforcing the enormous strength and resilience of the Foreign Direct Investment sector in Ireland and its indispensable contribution to job creation and communities across the country. Under Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund, &euro;115 million is being invested in projects to strengthen regional enterprise in all regions and the IDA Ireland will continue to roll-out its regional property programme under its new Strategy, specifically targeting 400 investments to advance regional development.</p><p>The Deputy is also aware of the ambition contained in our new National Development Plan, launched at the start of October 2021, which provides substantial investment in the resilience and dynamism of our enterprises, addressing immediate challenges like the &lsquo;tail&rsquo; impacts of Brexit and COVID-19, while also preparing enterprises for the longer-term, including climate change and digitalisation.</p><p>The twin decarbonisation and digitalisation transition and associated behavioural changes will profoundly alter the economy. Embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and will support significant job creation.  Substantial capital investment under the revised National Development Plan and Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) under the European Recovery and Resilience Facility, with &euro;915 million in first tranche of funding, will be key enablers of balanced regional development, and supporting the digital and green transition.</p><p>The enterprise programmes of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will continue to strengthen growth and employment potential with a particular focus on balanced regional development and smart specialisation, building competitive and innovative regions and enterprises. This includes funding to back collaborative actions at regional and local level, driven by the Regional Enterprise Plans, aided through the Regional Enterprise Development Fund, the Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme, and leveraging European Regional Development Funding and other strategic investments.</p></reply>

Global supply chains, energy costs, infrastructure and constructions costs, commercial real estate, housing, and talent attraction and skills development have all been impacted by the pandemic and geopolitical events.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenges which these international issues have created, IDA Ireland&rsquo;s end of year results for 2021 show that the level of foreign direct investment into Ireland has remained resilient. </p>  <p>  Overall, 249 investments were gained by IDA Ireland in 2021. Of this number, 104 were new name investment, while 54%, or 134 projects of the 249 investments won, went to regional locations. The number of people directly employed in multinational companies in Ireland grew to 275,384 in 2021, the highest level of foreign direct investment employment ever reached. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, it must be noted that Ireland is now facing these challenges with a resilient economy that is already recovering from the pandemic and has grown very quickly in the last couple of months. Investors&rsquo; confidence in Ireland remains strong as evidenced by the flow of investment projects over recent months and years. In 2020, Ireland increased its market share of FDI into Europe in the face of global declines in FDI. Ireland&rsquo;s focus on the sectors that underpin a modern economy has been key to this. The pipeline of investment in 2021 was extraordinarily strong considering the continued uncertainty in the global operating environment.</p>  <p>  Although international competition for FDI is intense and investors have many attractive locations to choose from, IDA Ireland believes that the FDI opportunities for Ireland will be ongoing. To ensure we seize these opportunities, my Department, with the support of IDA Ireland, will continue to build on Ireland&rsquo;s 70-plus year track record of attracting and maintaining FDI by strengthening our value proposition which includes our pro-enterprise policy environment, our highly educated workforce and our membership of the European Union.</p></reply>

As well as committing to a package of supports and investments to assist enterprise recovery, the Plan outlines a medium-term policy framework to rebuild sustainable enterprises, encourage job creation and sustainable and balanced post pandemic growth.</p>  <p>  The ERP set a target to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by having 2.5 million people in work by 2024 and in more productive and resilient jobs. This target has already been exceeded, according to figures released by the CSO&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey in February of this year, indicating the strength of Ireland&rsquo;s recovery and the improvement in the labour market in Ireland. The employment rate for those aged 15-64 has rebounded from the pandemic to 73.0% in Q4 2021 compared to 67.0% in Q4 2020 and has exceeded the employment rate of 70.1% in Q4 2019. Similarly, the unemployment rate fell over the course of 2021 as the economy recovered. It is now approaching the pre-pandemic rate of 4.5% as the recovery continues. </p>  <p>  Projects funded under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) are integrated into the Economic Recovery Plan, and reinforce the Government&rsquo;s approach, which is focussed on supporting recovery and job creation, advancing the green transition, and accelerating and expanding digital reforms and transformation. The initial allocation under the NRRP is &euro;915 million, with a further allocation to be made in 2023.</p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Government has been committed to helping the sectors and workers most impacted and has invested heavily in order to stabilise the labour market. Schemes such as the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) and the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) compare very well internationally and have been extended well beyond their original end dates. Since its introduction, the EWSS, an economy-wide support for enterprise, has made &euro;6.7bn in payments to support over 50,000 employers and nearly three quarters of a million employees. Under the CRSS &euro;727m was paid to 25,700 to businesses impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. As of the beginning of February 2022, over &euro;9.1 billion has been paid out through the PUP. </p>  <p>  The latest iteration of the national employment strategy &ndash; Pathways to Work 2021-2025 &ndash; will help unemployed people get back into employment through intense activation, upskilling and reskilling opportunities, and engaging with employers. It will have an overall target of over 100,000 additional caseloads per year, by expanding the caseload capacity of the Public Employment Service, reducing the risk of labour market scarring and long-term unemployment. There will be a particular focus on youth unemployment and working intensively with young people at greater risk of long-term unemployment, in recognition of the disproportionate effect of the pandemic on young people.</p>  <p>  In addition to the work already underway, the Government is looking to prepare for the economy of the future. On 1 March 2022, Cabinet agreed to the development of a White Paper on Enterprise Policy in 2022, led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The White Paper will set out set out an ambitious medium- to long-term direction for enterprise policy in response to challenges, opportunities and new drivers of growth catalysed by the Covid-19 pandemic, new economic and geopolitical realities, and an increased urgency to accelerate the decarbonisation of industry. </p>  <p>  In so doing, the White Paper will articulate what needs to be done differently to realise this vision and to set out clearly the risks to be faced (i.e., energy, skills availability, technological change, etc.) and the policy choices and trade-offs that will arise in order to maintain high-quality jobs, to protect the elements which make Ireland&rsquo;s economy globally attractive for investment and to ensure a competitive Irish economy into the future.</p></reply>

Despite the global upheaval of the last few years, IDA Ireland continues to successfully attract inward investment to Ireland. Last year, IDA won 249 investments, 104 of which were from new companies. The number of people employed in multi-national companies grew to 275,384, including 29,000 new jobs created in 2021.</p>  <p>  While the competition may be stiff, what we offer companies looking to expand or establish new operations is world-class. To would-be investors, Ireland offers a stable macroeconomic environment; consistent pro-enterprise policies; high-quality education and skills development; an excellent track-record on ease of doing business and openness to trade; a stable, safe, and attractive living and working environment; availability of property; a competitive corporate tax regime; and an unwavering commitment to the European Union with access to the Single Market. Taken together, these factors all combine to mark Ireland as a stable and reliable location for investment. </p>  <p>  Investors&rsquo; confidence in Ireland remains strong. In 2020 and 2021, Ireland increased its market share of FDI into Europe in the face of global declines in FDI. Though competition is intense and global with countries around the world actively vying for new FDI investments, IDA Ireland have tailored their approach to reflect this increased competition. IDA targets certain sectors and continuously refines its offering to ensure that Ireland offers the most competitive, innovative, and relevant elements that targeted investments seek. This focus on the sectors that underpin a modern economy has been key to our success.</p>  <p>  Supported by my Department, IDA Ireland continues to engage with international clients from a range of sectors and will continue to attract job-rich investment from overseas firms.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2022-04-07a.467.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022040700070#WRJ02300"><p>Since the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) came into effect in January last year, businesses have felt the realities of the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU. In large measure, Brexit was not the calamitous event that we all feared. Businesses have navigated their way steadily through the new trading relationship which includes increased administrative burdens and non-tariff barriers. It is a tribute to the determination and resilience of the business community that so many have made it through these unchartered waters, adapting their business models and supply chains, allowing them to continue to trade and support the economy.</p>  <p>  Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, our export-led trading sector has proven to be very resilient. 2021 was a record-breaking year for Irish goods exports &ndash; rising to &euro;165 billion, the highest level on record, and over &euro;3bn higher than previous year.  While last year imports from Great Britain declined, our exports to Great Britain performed very strongly - up over &euro;2billion.  The introduction of further checks and controls for trade to Great Britain can be expected to have an impact in due course on these exports as the UK only postponed these checks and controls to allow technical discussions on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland to continue on finding durable and realistic solutions.  I have no doubt that Irish businesses can prove their resilience once again and my Department, and colleagues across all Government Departments, will continue to help companies diversify and discover new markets and reap the benefits of free trade agreements and work with them to adapt to new realities, both in relation to Brexit but also COVID.</p>  <p>  We have also seen a significant pick-up in trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It is clear that some readjusting of supply chains is taking place, to be expected in the context of Brexit. As an open, trading economy, the continued growth of our export businesses and diversification in our trading partners is an important driver for jobs and growth - both in Ireland and with our trading partners.</p>  <p>  While recognising the importance of our current markets, our focus is on deepening our reach into these markets while also opening up new trade markets between Ireland and the rest of the world. My department is working intensively with its enterprise agencies to help companies to diversify and discover new markets and to adapt to export challenges posed by both COVID-19 and Brexit.</p>  <p>  With regard to foreign direct investment, IDA has approved over 100 Brexit related investments since the Brexit referendum in 2016 with an associated job creation potential of over 6,500.  IDA&rsquo;s 2021-24 strategy, Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth, positions the Agency to leverage FDI opportunities arising from Brexit. The Agency seeks to capitalise on the expansion potential from new-name Brexit investments secured since 2016 as these companies build out their Irish operations.</p>  <p>  Financial Services continues to account for approximately two-thirds of the investments approved by IDA to date, driven by the end of passporting from the UK across the EU, in addition to Ireland&rsquo;s existing strengths as a location for financial services firms. The December 2021 EY Brexit Tracker continued to show Dublin as the top destination for Brexit related investments from financial services firms, based on projects; Dublin ranks third, based on jobs.</p>  <p>  Given that the UK is no longer part of the EU Single Market or Customs Union, inevitably our trade with our nearest neighbour, and biggest trading partner, is not now as frictionless as it had been before. The TCA outlines the conditions under which UK goods can benefit from the zero-tariff rate when imported into Ireland or elsewhere in the Union. The conditions stipulate those technical issues such as preferential &ldquo;Rules of Origin&rdquo; now need to be considered.  It has brought new challenges for products that incorporate an all-island approach to its production.</p>  <p>  The UK postponed import checks on goods from Ireland due to come into effect from 1 January 2022. For this reason, the full impact of our new trading relationship with the UK has not truly been felt yet as full customs controls are not yet in place. This temporary reprieve for goods from Ireland allows for the ongoing technical discussions between the EU and the UK on the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. These discussions continue and are focused on finding durable and realistic solutions under the Protocol to difficulties that present for businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland. The further introduction of checks and controls for trade with Great Britain can be expected to have an impact in due course on our exports but I have no doubt that Irish businesses can prove their resilience once again and my department, and colleagues across all Government Departments, will continue to help companies diversify and discover new markets and reap the benefits of free trade agreements and work with them to adapt to new realities, both in relation to Brexit but also COVID.</p>  <p>  Businesses were actively assisted in their Brexit preparedness by Government in terms of advance Brexit contingency planning, involving a range of State Agencies and Bodies, providing a broad range of support for businesses and traders throughout. Government continues to stand ready to assist with these and other challenges associated with Brexit with the continued availability of supports as businesses continue to adapt to post-Brexit realities.</p></reply>

There has been a significant long-term shift in attitudes to remote work amongst both employers and workers throughout the country.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing remote work adoption through removing barriers, developing infrastructure, providing guidance, raising awareness and leading by example in this area.</p>  <p>  In the context of Pillar 1 of the National Remote Work Strategy, published in January 2021, a commitment was made to legislate to provide employees with the right to request remote work. This is one of the key actions of the Strategy. </p>  <p>  In line with that Strategy, on 25th January the Government approved the priority drafting of the Right to Request Remote Working Bill 2022. This will provide employees with a right to request remote work and provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing such a request can be based. It will also provide legal clarity to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests.</p>  <p>Pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment commenced on 9th February and Departmental officials are scheduled to attend a further meeting on 4th May.</p>  <p>  I want to strengthen the Bill and I will be happy to consider any proposals made by the Committee.  The Department is currently looking further at the legal issues related to strengthening the redress provisions and the right of appeal and is taking legal advice on the matter. Officials have been requested to consult further with union and employer representatives in this regard over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  We recognise that not all occupations, industries, or particular roles within an enterprise, will be appropriate or suitable for remote working, e.g. construction workers, nurses, doctors, waste collectors. Calls to introduce a blanket right to remote working are not realistic.</p>  <p>  Directive 2019/1158 of the European Parliament and of the Council on work-life balance for parents and carers contains provisions in relation to flexible working arrangements. Responsibility for transposition of the Directive rests with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Roderic O'Gorman T.D. I understand that this work is currently in train.</p></reply>

Members of the House were united in our support for the people of Ukraine as we open our country to them for refuge.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, I would draw attention to the comprehensive FAQ document for Ukraine Nationals and Residents of Ukraine on the Department of Justice website which provides the most up to date arrangements for Ukrainian citizens and their family members wishing to travel to Ireland or already in Ireland. It can be accessed at: www.irishimmigration.ie/faqs-for-ukraine-nationals-and-residents-of-ukraine/</p>  <p>  This document advises inter alia that Ukrainian refugees are entitled to seek employment or self-employment and vocational training education activities in Ireland. </p>  <p>  In general, anyone can set up a business in Ireland (sole trader etc) subject to their visa status.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, I would encourage anyone wishing to start a business to make contact with their Local Enterprise Office.</p>  <p>  Local Enterprise Offices can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. In particular the Local Enterprise Offices offer Feasibility Grants, which help start-up companies or individual entrepreneurs with the cost of researching their proposed business or new business idea to see if it could be viable and sustainable, and Priming Grants, which aim to help with the associated costs of start-up. However, it should be noted that the Local Enterprise Offices do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services or local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses. </p>  <p>  The above supports along with a host of others can also be found on the supportingsmes.gov.ie website. This is a cross-governmental guide to help small businesses know which of the over 170 Government supports could fit their business. By completing the questionnaire, a small business will, in one location find out which of the over 170 Government business supports from 27 different Government Departments, Agencies and initiatives are available; find information on the range of Government supports for accessing credit; and find contact details for their nearest Local Enterprise Office.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices also provide a wide range of high-quality business and management development programmes that are tailored to meet specific business requirements. Whether it is starting a business or growing a business there is something suitable for anyone exploring self-employment as an option.</p>  <p>  In particular, I would encourage any person starting a business to enquire about the Start Your Own Business Programme. The objective is to assist clients in assessing their business idea, its viability and helps them decide if they should proceed or take a step back. The programme covers topics such as starting up / getting started, identifying, understanding, and researching your target market, developing your business plan amongst other vital areas of interest to a new business.</p>  <p>  I would also suggest seeking the advice of a LEO Business Mentor; the Mentor programme is open to both new and existing businesses located within the Local Enterprise Office region and is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance. The mentor contributes independent, informed observation and advice to aid decision making.</p></reply>

Under this new Scheme, SEAI registered One-Stop-Shops will provide an end-to-end service for homeowners. This includes surveying; designing the upgrades; managing the grant process; helping with access to finance; engaging contractors; and quality assurance.</p><p>One Stop Shop (OSS) applicants must apply to SEAI to become a registered OSS. SEAI will assess each application against set prequalification eligibility criteria and application evaluation criteria outlined in the OSS Registration Guidelines which are available on the SEAI website. There is essentially two steps:</p><p>Step 1 - Successfully meet all pre-qualification criteria, as set out in the OSS pre-qualification eligibility list and provide evidence of such.</p><p>Step 2 - Invited to complete the OSS Application - Strategic Plan and provide evidence to demonstrate compliance with the various application criteria.</p><p>The aim is that the applicant must be able to demonstrate that they can meet the criteria under the key areas of:</p><p>- Financial Probity and Business Standing</p><p>- Organisational Capability and Technical Competence</p><p>- Governance and Legal Requirements</p><p>- Business Systems and IT Capability</p><p>- Market Engagement</p><p>- Skilled Workforce (direct or partnerships)</p><p>- Quality Assurance</p><p>- Obligated Party if relevant</p><p>- Commitment as a partner and key stakeholder in national retrofit</p><p>Submitted applications are assessed based on defined evaluation criteria and scoring outlined in the registration guidelines.</p><p>SEAI are focused on engaging organisations capable of professionally managing all aspects of a One Stop Shop service. Organisations interested in becoming a registered OSS should visit the SEAI dedicated One Stop Shop registration webpage www.seai.ie/register-with-seai/one-stop-shop/</p><p>Aside from this new development with One Stop Shops, there are of course arrangements already in place for the registration of installers/contractors to various SEAI schemes or technologies.  For example to register as an installer for Solar PV the installer would be required to be a Registered Electrical Contractor (REC) with Safe Electric and have completed a recognised solar PV course. The installer/contractor would also have to be tax compliant and have appropriate insurance in place to cover the works they are installing.</p></reply>

The Climate Action Plan 2021 identifies green hydrogen as having the potential to support decarbonisation across several sectors and, in particular, as a source for high-temperature heat in industry and flexible generation in electricity. The Plan contains a suite of actions relating to green hydrogen in the electricity, enterprise and transport sectors and includes:   - testing the technical feasibility of safely injecting green hydrogen blends in the gas grid;</p>  <p>  - assessing the potential for system integration between the electricity and gas networks, which will include the production, storage and use of green hydrogen;</p>  <p>  - progressing research and pilot studies regarding the use of hydrogen in the transport sector.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is developing a number of initiatives on the role of green hydrogen in decarbonisation. The 2021 SEAI National Energy Research Development &amp;amp; Demonstration (RD&amp;D) Programme Call included a number of projects relating to green hydrogen, and the development of floating offshore wind foundations coupled with hydrogen storage. The SEAI's National Heat Study, published in February 2022, examines options to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors in Ireland to 2050, including options for green hydrogen. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently preparing a public consultation on a hydrogen strategy for Ireland.

Data centres also create employment and attract foreign direct investment. However, the expansion of data centres, particularly in the Dublin region, is projected to lead to a large increase in electricity demand which raises challenges for the energy system.Under the Climate Action Plan 2021, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has committed to reviewing the 2018 'Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy' to ensure alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s renewable energy targets, sectoral emissions and climate priorities. This statement is due for publication later this year and is part of a suite of actions included in CAP 21 to ensure that Ireland is planning appropriately for new energy demand in the context of our electrification and decarbonisation ambitions, while facilitating growth in digitalisation and our technology sector.</p><p>My Department is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and relevant state agencies to ensure that there is a plan-led, regionally balanced approach to large developments such as data centres, taking into account congestion, existing grid availability and the opportunity to co-locate significant renewable energy opportunities.In addition, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act provides, inter alia, for a maximum amount of emissions to be permitted in different sectors of the economy during a carbon budget period, referred to as &lsquo;sectoral emissions ceilings&rsquo;. All sectors of the economy will have sectoral emissions ceilings and emissions from data centres will be accounted for within the relevant sectoral emissions ceiling.</p></reply>

However, as set out in the November 2021 Government Policy Statement on Security of Electricity of Supply there will be a continued need beyond 2030 for gas-fired conventional generation to support and back-up the roll-out of renewable energy.The Climate Action Plan 2021 </p><p>identifies green hydrogen as having the potential to support decarbonisation across several sectors and, in particular, as a source for high-temperature heat in industry and flexible generation in electricity. The Plan contains a suite of actions relating to green hydrogen in the electricity, enterprise and transport sectors and includes: </p> <blockquote> 	testing the technical feasibility of safely injecting green hydrogen blends in the gas grid;<br /><br />assessing the potential for system integration between the electricity and gas networks, which will include the production, storage and use of green hydrogen;<br /><br />progressing research and pilot studies regarding the use of hydrogen in the transport sector. </blockquote>  <p>In addition, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is developing a number of initiatives on the role of green hydrogen in decarbonisation. The 2021 SEAI National Energy Research Development &amp;amp; Demonstration (RD&amp;amp;D) Programme Call included a number of projects relating to green hydrogen, and the development of floating offshore wind foundations coupled with hydrogen storage. The SEAI's National Heat Study, published in February 2022, examines options to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors in Ireland to 2050, including options for green hydrogen. </p><p>My Department is currently preparing a public consultation on a hydrogen strategy for Ireland. I expect this strategy focussing on the development of green hydrogen to be included in Climate Action Plan 2022. The role of green hydrogen in Ireland's energy mix, alongside alternative technologies such as batteries, is under consideration. Nuclear powered electricity generation plants are prohibited in Ireland and the Government has no plans to revisit the prohibition on, or explore the development of, nuclear powered electricity generation in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Strategy is a whole-of-Government strategy to address the growing threat of cyber security incidents, to ensure Ireland can benefit fully from the digital transformation. The Strategy includes 20 separate measures to safeguard public sector networks and essential services, to support the development of Ireland's cyber security industry, and to ensure we play our part in defending a free, open, secure and stable cyberspace. Over the coming year, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) will continue to work with Government departments, critical national infrastructure, and other relevant stakeholders to implement these measures in line with the timelines set out in the Strategy. Progress on delivery is monitored by an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) which meets quarterly.   As part of the implementation of the Strategy, in 2021 external consultants were commissioned to conduct a Capacity Review and to benchmark the NCSC with similar agencies in Europe and internationally. On foot of the Review, in July the Government agreed a number of measures to support the continued development of the NCSC over the coming five years. The measures agreed include increasing the overall fulltime staffing complement of the NCSC to at least 70 over the next 5 years, with a first tranche of an additional 20 staff recruited by the end of the year bringing the serving complement to 45. A dedicated HQ facility will also be developed at my Department&rsquo;s future HQ in Dublin 4. In addition, the General Scheme of a Bill will be prepared for Government approval to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis and provide for related matters including clarity around its mandate. A set of priority actions have been identified for 2022 and progress will be monitored by the IDC on the National Cyber Security Strategy.</p>  <p>  The Government has also identified the need to implement new measures to enhance the security of digital communications networks such as 5G networks. Following a public consultation on a set of Electronic Security Control Measures (ECSMs) earlier this year, legislation is being drafted to establish a legal framework for these vital controls. In addition, my Department is engaging with partners across Government to draft legislation to address the challenge of High Risk Vendors supplying 5G technology which I expect to be published later this year.</p>  <p>  Recognising the priority which the EU and its institutions affords to cyber security, Ireland will continue to play an active role in European Council discussions on EU cyber security strategy and legislation. The ongoing review of the Network and Information Security Directive is a major pillar of the EU&rsquo;s cyber security strategy and will have far-reaching implications for public bodies, essential infrastructure, and businesses, including digital service providers. My Department will continue to coordinate Irish policy positions on this and other matters including the Joint Cyber Unit initiative and the European Commission&rsquo;s forthcoming proposal for a Cyber Resilience Act. My officials will also continue to engage and share information with counterparts across the EU through the NIS Cooperation Group, the CSIRTs Network, and the CyCLONe Network.</p>  <p>  Finally, building on the success of recent campaigns, the NCSC will roll out a public awareness programme in October to coincide with European Cyber Security Month. The NCSC will work with the EU cybersecurity agency ENISA, partner organisations across the Union, as well as national partners including the Garda Cyber Crime Bureau to deliver an impactful and informative campaign to raise awareness of cyber security in businesses, educational institutions and at home.</p></reply>

The Act commits Ireland to achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by 2030 compared to 2018 levels.</p>  <p>  The significantly strengthened legally binding framework under the Act with clear targets and commitments set in law, including a process for setting carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings, will help ensure that Ireland achieves its climate goals and obligations. Establishing these requirements in legislation places a clear obligation on this and future governments for sustained climate action. In order to deliver on this ambition, the Government published the Climate Action Plan 2021 last November. It identifies actions necessary to achieve our emissions reductions targets. The Plan sets out indicative ranges of emissions reductions for each sector of the economy based on their respective starting points, and the relative difficulty, cost, speed, and benefits, of reducing emissions. All sectors will reduce emissions by an ambitious and achievable percentage, each playing a vital role in meeting our targets.</p>  <p>  The 2021 Plan builds on the significant progress made since the 2019 Plan, in particular in the areas of climate governance, renewable electricity, just transition, the development of a National Residential Retrofit Plan and the increasing levels of bio-fuels in the transport sector. The National Development Plan has allocated significantly increased funding to climate action, including public transport and retrofitting.Failure to rapidly decarbonise our economic model will have far reaching negative impacts on the economy and the public finances; undermine the long-term, sustainable competitiveness of the economy; and lock Ireland into a redundant fossil-fuel based economic model. Embracing the transition will increase our energy security, as well as supporting further job creation through the development of new and emerging sectors.</p></reply>

Facilitating remote working and innovation opportunities is key to addressing climate change, adapting in an evolving economy, and competing internationally. A combination of commercial investment and the State led National Broadband Plan intervention will ensure access to high speed broadband in every part of the country no matter how remote. According to the most recent Quarterly Report on the Electronic Communications market by ComReg, for the period (1 October to 31 December) Q4 2021 which is available at www.comreg.ie/publication/quarterly-key-data-report-q4-2021/, total broadband subscriptions stood at 1.93m subscriptions, 87% of which had speeds equal to or greater than 30Mbps, while 50% of subscriptions were equal to or greater than 100mbps, up from 48.3% in Q3 2021. </p>  <p>  The National Broadband Plan will provide a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools. The NBP network will offer users a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. A number of commercial operators have also announced further investment plans in high-speed broadband. Eir intends to roll out fibre to 1.9 million premises by the end of 2026, while SIRO has announced a &euro;620 million upgrade and expansion of its fibre to the home network to reach 770,000 homes and business. Virgin Media has announced a &euro;200 million investment to upgrade their network, delivering speeds of 10Gbps for 1 million premises over the next three years. Many other network operators and telecom service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.</p></reply>

Additionally, there is a further commitment to develop a longer-term plan to harness the estimated potential of at least 30GW of offshore floating wind power in our Atlantic waters. </p>  <p>  The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) is one of the major Government policies to help deliver on the ambition in the Climate Action Plan 2021 of up to 80% renewable electricity by 2030. The RESS is an auction-based support scheme which invites grid-scale renewable electricity generation projects to compete to receive a guaranteed price for the electricity they generate for a period of up to 16.5 years. Over 1GW of new wind and solar generation was secured in the first RESS auction in 2020, and projects are expected to reach commercial operation before the end of 2023.</p>  <p>  A significant volume of new renewable generation is expected to be secured in the second RESS auction which will take place next month. Alongside this, my Department have been drafting the terms and conditions for offshore wind-specific RESS auctions.  At least three offshore RESS auctions are currently planned for this decade.  </p>  <p>  A schedule of future auctions through to 2025 was published in December 2021 so that generators can develop their renewable energy projects with confidence to line up with these regular auctions and deliver the steady supply of projects needed to meet our climate targets. </p></reply>

The National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) under a contract to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the over 554,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with some 679 schools.</p>  <p>  I am advised by NBI that as of 31 March 2022, over 312,000 premises have now been surveyed and over 169,000 premises are under construction or complete across 26 counties. I am further advised that almost 60,000 premises are now available to order or pre-order a high-speed broadband connection across 22 counties, with over 41,000 premises passed across 19 counties and available for immediate connection. In addition to the premises completed, build is underway on over 128,000 premises, demonstrating the project is reaching scale. </p>  <p>  In County Cork surveying is underway in the Deployment Area of Clonakilty, surveying is complete in the Deployment Areas of Templemartin, Tallow, Kanturk and Fermoy, main works are underway in the Deployment Areas of Midleton and Youghal and network build is complete in the Deployment Area of Carrigaline.  To date over 39,100 premises in County Cork have been surveyed, with over 16,360 premises under construction or constructed and over 6,700 premises now available to order or pre-order. With regard to the areas referred to in the Questions, Beara Peninsula is in the Lauragh Deployment Area and NBI has advised that surveys will be completed in the area in May 2022. Sheep&rsquo;s Head Peninsula is in the Kilcrohane Deployment Area and NBI has advised that survey is due to commence in the area in H1 2023. Kinsale is in the Kinsale Deployment Area, and NBI has advised that survey is due to commence there in H2 2022.</p>  <p>  Further details are available on specific areas within County Cork through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence. NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.</p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 31 March, 550 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. In County Cork 23 BCP&rsquo;s have been installed to date.  The site at Riverstick Community Centre is now installed by NBI which is located 15km from Kinsale. Further details can be found at www.nbi.ie/bcp-locations/. </p>  <p>  In County Cork 40 schools have been installed by NBI to date for educational access. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area. Further details of schools in scope are available on the NBI website at www.nbi.ie/primary-schools-list/.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The policy primarily focuses on measures to promote and facilitate active travel and public transport for all and, in doing so, encourage less private car journeys nationally to support our climate commitment.  </p>  <p>  The targets of the policy are aligned with the transport target metrics in the Climate Action Plan 2021 of 500,000 additional daily active travel and public transport journeys and a 10% reduction in kilometres driven by fossil fuelled cars by 2030.  </p>  <p>  A collaborative approach has been taken by my Department in developing the Sustainable Mobility Policy through public consultation and extensive stakeholder engagement.  The policy includes a comprehensive set of actions to be completed by 2025 to increase walking and cycling infrastructure provision and improve public transport capacity and services across the country.  These will be supported by behavioural change and demand management measures to make sustainable modes the preferred choice for as many people as possible.  A further action plan will then be developed to cover the remaining period of the policy out to 2030.</p>  <p>  The new policy is underpinned by capital funding under the National Development Plan which provides &euro;35 billion for transport over the next decade.  As the Deputy is aware, the Programme for Government has committed to Exchequer spending of approximately &euro;360 million per annum on walking and cycling over the lifetime of the Government.  This investment will help support the planned delivery of almost 1,000 kilometres of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025 as well as additional investment in greenways.</p>  <p>  I look forward to working with the Deputy on the implementation of the new Sustainable Mobility Policy in the coming years.  </p></reply>

A draft National Charging Infrastructure Strategy has been published for public consultation which sets out a pathway for the provision of charging infrastructure to stay ahead of demand.</p>  <p>  The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger up to a maximum of &euro;600. </p>  <p>  Work is currently being progressed to expand the EV home charger grant. This scheme will be launched shortly.</p>  <p>  The Infrastructure Strategy proposes that for those who cannot charge at home, provision of residential charging solutions that give the same benefits and mirror the home charging option should be the first objective. </p>  <p>  There is an onus on national and local government to facilitate the provision of these charging solutions for citizens who do not have access to a home charge point. </p>  <p>  The Strategy proposes a new Residential charging scheme that will replace the existing Public Points scheme, with 75% of funding to be provided to Local Authorities to support the design of local area charging networks, and also 75% of funding for delivery and installation of these networks. which are intended to comprise both on-street charging in areas where residents do not have access to home charging solutions, and destination charge points at Local Authority facilities. </p></reply>

I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence.</p>  <p>  In deciding on this targeted, temporary scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for certain other operators also, fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead cost for hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business.</p>  <p>  Given the rapid increase in fuel prices linked to the crisis in Ukraine, the haulage sector reported to the Government a serious risk of cessation of business among haulage companies that would have had significant implications for supply chains into the State, including for essential goods.</p>  <p>  You will be aware that on 9 March 2022, in recognition of rising fuel costs for all citizens and businesses, the Government reduced Excise duty by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil in order to reduce the cost of fuels.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has written to the European Commission to ask what flexibilities might be available on an emergency basis to reduce the tax on fuel. Currently, however, the EU Energy Tax Directive limits the possibility of further reducing the tax on fuel. Specifically, the Directive requires a minimum tax of &euro;0.33 per litre and the measures already decided have reduced the tax on diesel to the minimum.</p>  <p>  In general, however, it should be noted that the causes of these fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis.</p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure announced on 9 March, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme approved on 15 March 2022, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases.

Under the scheme, businesses can temporarily &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain tax debts on an interest free basis until the end of this year (or until 30 April 2023 for businesses most impacted by the most recent public health restrictions and are eligible for certain Covid-19 support schemes).</p><p>The scheme is automatically available to businesses and individuals that are managed by Revenue&rsquo;s Business and Personal Divisions.  Revenue&rsquo;s Business Division manages enterprises with an annual turnover less than &euro;3 million, which accounts for the majority of business taxpayers.  Revenue&rsquo;s Personal Division deals with all business entities with no trade or professional income such as trusts, charities, sporting bodies.</p><p>The scheme is available by agreement to larger businesses managed by Revenue&rsquo;s Large Corporates and Medium Enterprises Divisions, where such businesses were adversely impacted by COVID-19.  Revenue&rsquo;s Medium Enterprises Division deals with businesses with an annual Irish turnover of more than &euro;3 million (but less than &euro;190 million) as well as the subsidiaries/parents of such companies.  Large Corporates Division deals with the largest companies with an annual Irish turnover of more than &euro;190 million per annum.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the total debt eligible for the Debt Warehousing Scheme since its introduction is &euro;30.9 billion, and 250,000 businesses were eligible to avail of the scheme.  However, 90% of that debt has been paid, with the balance of just over &euro;3 billion warehoused at the end of February 2022 in respect of almost 97,000 businesses.  This warehoused debt breaks down by Revenue Division as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Division</div></th>       <th><div>Total (&euro;m)</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Business</td>       <td>1,625</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Medium Enterprises</td>       <td>1,005</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Large Corporates</td>       <td>392</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Personal</td>       <td>26</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Large Cases &ndash; High Wealth Individuals</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td>3,053</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that towards the end of this year, it will engage with all businesses availing of the scheme to agree suitable phased payment arrangements in respect of the &lsquo;parked&rsquo; debt. The payment arrangements will be flexible and tailored to take account of the financial circumstances of each business concerned.  Provided that in the intervening period tax returns are filed and current taxes paid as they fall due, and therefore a business continues to be able to avail of the Debt Warehousing Scheme, a reduced interest rate of 3% will apply to a payment arrangement.</p><p>I am advised that Revenue has not estimated the potential amount of warehoused debt that will not be paid as the expectation is that flexible payment arrangements will assist businesses in meeting their obligations over time and any payment difficulties will only become apparent in the context of the aforementioned engagement between each business and Revenue.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department makes certain assumptions and projections in preparing the annual Budget and in that regard, Budget 2022 projections made by my Department incorporated the prudent assumption that 25 per cent of the warehoused tax liabilities are not repaid, i.e., that 25 per cent of the businesses that have availed of the scheme will never be in a position to repay. This is a conservative technical assumption but it is considered better to err on the side of caution in this matter.  </p><p>The volume of money warehoused under the tax debt warehousing scheme by sector, at the end of February 2022, is as follows:  <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Sectors </div></th>       <th><div>(&euro;m)</div></th>       <th><div>%</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Agriculture, forestry and fishing</td>       <td>28</td>       <td>1%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Manufacturing</td>       <td>191</td>       <td>6%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Construction</td>       <td>368</td>       <td>12%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wholesale and retail trade; Repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles</td>       <td>688</td>       <td>23%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Transportation and Storage</td>       <td>207</td>       <td>7%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Accommodation and food service activities</td>       <td>431</td>       <td>14%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Information and Communication</td>       <td>200</td>       <td>7%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Financial and Insurance Activities</td>       <td>61</td>       <td>2%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Real estate activities</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>2%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Revenue recently published updated statistics on the Debt Warehousing Scheme and this report as well as further information on the Scheme is available on the Revenue website.</p></reply>

The ETD prescribes minimum tax rates for fuel with which all Member States must comply. The current ETD minimum in respect of MGO for commercial and industrial use is &euro;21 per 1,000 litres.

However, it is my priority to ensure that each bank withdraws from the market in an orderly manner.</p>  <p>  My officials and I are engaging with the banks that have indicated their intentions to leave the market, to emphasise the importance of an orderly withdrawal and the need to engage in a timely manner with their customers in advance of any exit.</p>  <p>  On 22 September 2021, I met with Alison Rose, CEO of NatWest, Sir Howard Davies, Chair of NatWest, Jane Howard, the CEO of Ulster Bank, and Martin Murphy, the Chair of Ulster Bank, where they updated me on their progress and I emphasised the importance of an orderly withdrawal. Minister Fleming met with the CEO, Director of Corporate Affairs and Head of Corporate Affairs of Ulster Bank on the 8 March 2022 for a further update.

We also engage directly with the banks that are remaining on a regular basis, and at recent meetings the issue of preparedness in relation to account  switching has been raised.</p>  <p>  Separately, my officials are arranging to meet key representatives from the Credit Unions, An Post and other retail financial services providers to discuss the how they can support customers that have to open new accounts as a result of the withdrawal of both Ulster Bank and KBC.</p>  <p>  My Department will be monitoring closely the number of accounts that have closed/switched over the coming months and will continue to engage with all stakeholders to ensure that the impact on consumers is minimised.</p>  <p>  On 25 June 2021, the Central Bank engaged with all banks on their expectations of how they manage issues and consumer risks during this period of change, and they are actively monitoring compliance with these expectations.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s supervision of any bank that withdraws from the market will be focused on ensuring that its customers are treated fairly, and that it remains in compliance with the letter and spirit of regulatory requirements. The Central Bank has clearly communicated the requirement for a customer-focused approach to be taken in all aspects of their business throughout the period of change and that the banks ensure that customers understand what these developments means for them.</p></reply>

These projections will have a forecast horizon as far as 2025.</p><p>My Department has not produced detailed annual deficit projections to 2030 of the nature outlined in the Deputy&rsquo;s request. However, my Department published a report entitled <i>Population Ageing and the Public Finances in Ireland</i>last September. Included in this publication are long-term simulations of the impact of age-related expenditure on the deficit and debt ratios under a hypothetical, no-policy change scenario. This exercise assumes non-age related expenditure as a share of GNI* remains unchanged, while total revenue is assumed to move in line with nominal GDP/GNI*. As such, these simulations are not forecasts of the expected trajectory of the general government balance but instead show the potential impact of demographic change on the public finances in the absence of other policy changes over the coming decades. In addition, the starting point for this exercise began with outturn fiscal data from 2019 and the simulations do not, therefore, capture the significant increase in expenditure related to the support measures implemented by the Irish Government during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The results of the simulations, set out below, suggest that under this no-policy change scenario, and holding all other variables constant, age-related expenditure alone could result in a worsening of the general government balance of 3.4 percentage points of GNI* relative to 2019. These projections are published as a share of GNI*/GDP and not on a nominal basis.<div>Table 1: Percentage point difference in general government balance from base year (2019) as a result of projected age-related expenditure</div> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>       <th>2022</th>       <th>2023</th>       <th>2024</th>       <th>2025</th>       <th>2026</th>       <th>2027</th>       <th>2028</th>       <th>2029</th>       <th>2030</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>percentage point of GDP</td>       <td>-1.0%</td>       <td>-0.8%</td>       <td>-0.7%</td>       <td>-0.8%</td>       <td>-0.9%</td>       <td>-1.1%</td>       <td>-1.3%</td>       <td>-1.5%</td>       <td>-1.7%</td>       <td>-1.8%</td>       <td>-2.1%</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>percentage point of GNI*</td>       <td>-1.7%</td>       <td>-1.4%</td>       <td>-1.2%</td>       <td>-1.4%</td>       <td>-1.5%</td>       <td>-1.8%</td>       <td>-2.1%</td>       <td>-2.4%</td>       <td>-2.7%</td>       <td>-3.0%</td>       <td>-3.4%</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It is also important to note that these simulations do not account for second round effects or non-linearities. For example, continuing to run significant deficits over an extended time period would likely result in a notable risk premium, with adverse implications for sovereign borrowing costs and the interest bill over the long-term.</p><p>Finally, these projections do not account for the possibility of losses in tax revenue as a result of the green transition or any changes to the taxation framework. My Department is undertaking a review of the potential losses in tax revenues as the economy transitions to less carbon intensive consumption patterns. This analysis will form an integral part of the Department of Finance&rsquo;s wider economic analysis of the effects of the green transition. As part of this ongoing work, the Department published a <i>Review of Green Budgeting from a Tax Perspective</i>alongside Budget 2022. The review found that approximately &euro;5.7 billion of carbon-related tax revenues were collected in 2019, representing 9.6 per cent of total tax revenues. For comparative purposes, analysis undertaken by the UK government in the 2021 HMT Net Zero Review indicates that carbon-related tax revenues of &pound;37 billion, or 5.8 per cent of all tax revenues over the period 2019-20, are at risk of declining almost to zero by 2040, as the economy transitions away from carbon-related activity.</p><p>The fiscal challenges described above will add significant pressure to the public finances and highlight the importance of rebuilding our fiscal buffers. Last year's Summer Economic Statement set out a medium-term framework for the public finances, with public expenditure ceilings that are fixed for the next few years. Following this strategy will allow for the rebuilding of fiscal buffers while continuing to make significant capital investment, as outlined in the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

The Second Implementation Report, which was published on 1 March 2022, shows that 80 per cent of these actions have now been delivered.</p><p>Among the key developments so far are the implementation of the new Personal Injury Guidelines, which significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue. Recent data from the Personal Injury Assessment Board (PIAB) show that award levels have fallen by an average of 40 per cent, providing stability and certainty to the claims environment.</p><p>As part of the effort to increase competition, the Department of Finance is working closely with the IDA to broaden the supply of insurance in the Irish insurance market, including in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo;, such as the hospitality sector as highlighted by the Deputy. The IDA is currently commencing a multi-phased engagement process with targeted underwriters and will seek to leverage the achievements of the Government insurance reform agenda to date.</p><p>In terms of upcoming issues, rebalancing the duty of care is now a high priority action for Government and is being led by my colleague, Minister McEntee and the Department of Justice. Overhauling this legislation should help to address the issue of &ldquo;slips, trips and falls&rdquo;, which are particularly prevalent in high-risk/heavy-footfall areas such as hospitality. Minister McEntee has noted in the <i>Justice Plan 2022</i>, published last week, her intention to bring forward legislative proposals to reform the law in this area.</p><p>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.</p></reply>

The CWMF represents the tools that a public body must use to procure and manage the external resources necessary to deliver a public works project that is to be delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the National Development Plan. It consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts, generic template documents and procedures that cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their ongoing procurement requirements.</p>  <p>  A review of the policies and practices deployed in the procurement of public works projects commenced in March 2019 and is ongoing. The focus of the review is on improving the delivery of construction projects in terms of quality, timely delivery and cost outcomes. The review will deliver significant changes to the CWMF over the coming years. The review process involves extensive engagement, both with industry stakeholders, and with the public bodies charged with the delivery of public works projects on a broad range of issues such as:</p>  <p>  - inflation;</p>  <p>  - risk management;</p>  <p>  - creating a better quality: price balance in the award of contracts;</p>  <p>  - adoption of BIM on public works projects;</p>  <p>  - liability, indemnity and insurance requirements;</p>  <p>  - performance evaluation; and</p>  <p>  - encouraging collaborative working.</p>  <p>  A high-level strategy has been developed by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) with the Government Construction Contracts Committee (GCCC) that will guide the implementation and will be addressed primarily through the progressive refinement and enhancement of the CWMF.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 impacted the review in 2020 and 2021 as resources were redeployed to address the contractual and procurement issues that arose during construction lockdown. However, progress is being made on a number of fronts.</p>  <p>  - The initial focus is on the engagement of consultancy services, which is aimed at driving better project definition, in order to provide greater certainty for all those engaged in the construction stage.  Overall improvement in project definition is required through establishing minimum standards for information at the different stages of a project&rsquo;s development. Work is ongoing on the detailed implementation aspects of the review of the engagement of consultancy services, which will be delivered by means of changes to the template tender documents, publication of new guidance material and exploring digital solutions.</p>  <p>  - A review of the price variation mechanisms used in both the CWMF consultancy and construction contracts is currently underway. Initial research to review the inflation provisions in both the CWMF consultancy and construction contracts has been completed by consultants. Significant increases in construction material costs is affecting live tenders and contracts. Procurement guidance for &lsquo;live&rsquo; tenders was published in November 2021. Interim amendments to the provisions in the public works contracts to address inflation in construction materials were introduced in January 2022. Consultation on broader changes is due to commence with stakeholders in 2022.</p>  <p>  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) has the potential to transform the processes surrounding project and data management on construction projects and can drive significant efficiencies. The OGP is currently engaged with National Standards Authority of Ireland on preparing a national annex to the international standard (ISO) for BIM implementation. The aim is to ensure a consistent approach to its application across the public sector. An implementation plan for the adoption of BIM will be published later in 2022 setting out dates for a phased adoption of BIM. A series of masterclasses is ongoing to prepare public bodies for the implementation of BIM. In 2022, external advisers will be engaged to draft contract amendments to incorporate BIM into the CWMF and to prepare template procurement documents for publication.</p>  <p>  - The OGP is engaging with key stakeholders on the issue of liability, indemnities and insurance and is reviewing broader aspects of the required terms in the contracts used to engage design teams and contractors. Engagement with the insurance sector and construction industry stakeholders has also taken place on issues relating to cost increases on Professional Indemnity Insurance premiums and the reduction in cover available. Amendments to CWMF documents and additional guidance was published in February 2022.</p>  <p>  - Engagement is ongoing in developing standard metrics for life cycle costing and life cycle analysis that can be applied to the evaluation of projects&rsquo; cost of use in service and full life cycle analysis, including the carbon impact of individual projects. The OGP is liaising with the GCCC and the Irish Green Building Council in developing these metrics.  </p>  <p>  - The Cost Control Templates published under the CWMF are undergoing review to incorporate the International Construction Measurement Standard (ICMS). A working group has been established and revised templates will be published in 2022. ICMS is a global standard for benchmarking and reporting of construction project cost and covers both capital and whole life costing while providing a way of presenting costs in a consistent format.</p>  <p>  - A review into the performance of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provisions that were introduced in 2016 has also taken place in 2021. A final report on the review is being prepared by consultants, which will form the basis of a position paper in 2022 on ADR provisions in the public works contracts.</p>  <p>  Together these reform processes will lead to meaningful policy change and will assist in delivering better value for money for the taxpayer in the implementation of Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

In 2020 we saw a fall in prices as a result of the pandemic.  As we emerge from the pandemic and the economy recovers we are faced with a new set of challenges including rising energy prices and transitory supply issues which are causing prices to increase, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the challenge that households face at the moment with rising energy costs, in particular those on low incomes, Government announced on 10 February a package of measures, bringing to over &euro;500 million the measures introduced post Budget day, targeted at mitigating the impact of cost of living pressures. This package included:</p>  <p>  - An increase in the energy credit to &euro;200 including VAT, estimated to impact just over 2 million households;</p>  <p>  - A lump sum payment of &euro;125 to be paid in March to fuel allowance recipients;</p>  <p>  - To reduce the burden on people returning to the workplace and other people using public transport, there will be a temporary reduction in fares of 20% on PSO public transport services from early May to the end of the year. This will impact approximately 800,000 daily users;</p>  <p>  - The Drug Payment Scheme threshold will be further reduced to &euro;80 per month, having been reduced to &euro;100 per month in Budget 2022. This will benefit just over 70,000 recipients;</p>  <p>  - The increase in the threshold for the working family payment announced on Budget Day will be brought forward from June to April; and</p>  <p>  - Reduced caps for multiple children on school transport fees to &euro;500 per family post primary and &euro;150 for primary school children for the next academic year.</p>  <p>  This package builds on the range of measures introduced in Budget 2022 to help families with affordability issues, including Social Protection measures totalling over half a billion euro, health affordability measures and a funding stream for childcare providers. Budget 2022 also contained an income tax package of just over half a billion.</p>  <p>  In March, in light of the continued high fuel prices, an emergency support measure for licensed hauliers provides a payment of &euro;100 per week per heavy goods vehicle in light of the important role played by the sector in ensuring goods are available to families and businesses. The Department of Finance introduced a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil to 31st August at an estimated revenue foregone cost of &euro;320m.</p>  <p>  The aim of the Cost of Living package was to provide temporary targeted measures to assist households on lower incomes and other families who are facing increased energy bills. This package sought to balance targeting the main underlying problem of higher energy prices with the need to operate with the fiscal framework set out in the Summer Economic Statement. Taken with the Budget 2022 measures and the excise duty cut, Government has committed significant resources to address cost of living issues.</p></reply>

This new regime will be administered in due course by the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA), and by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the coastal local authorities and will be replace the existing consenting regime for maritime development underpinned by the Foreshore act 1933.</p>  <p>  My Department currently has responsibility for assessing applications for a foreshore licence under the Foreshore Act 1933 for site investigations within the foreshore area linked to the proposed development of offshore renewable energy projects. The site investigations are critical activities developers undertake in order to investigate viability and prepare environmental impact assessments of potential future offshore renewable energy (ORE) infrastructure. The majority of these applications have been received in the last 12 months which is strong indication of the appetite and commercial interest in the developing ORE sector in Ireland. The Foreshore Section of my Department also assesses foreshore consent applications for a range of other proposed activities and developments relating to ports and harbours, strategic infrastructure projects like water and waste water infrastructure, local authorities&rsquo; infrastructural works such as bridges, marinas, coastal protection works, flood relief works, as well as strategically important telecommunications and interconnector projects. </p>  <p>  Each application must be assessed appropriately in accordance with the applicable requirements of domestic and EU law including the EIA Directive, Birds and Habitats Regulations and the Foreshore Act. Over the last eighteen months, my Department has more than doubled the staffing resources available within the Foreshore Section to address this increasing workload. In parallel, the processes underpinning the statutory assessment processes have been refined allowing the various procedures to run in parallel, where appropriate. This should reduce the average time taken to assess an application. In addition, a panel of external specialist environmental consultants is in operation to assist in the technical assessment of applications. Recognising the increasing complexity and volume of applications being received; the importance of expediting the advancement of activities to assist in achieving our Climate Action Plan targets, as well as the competition for what is a limited pool of technical expertise in this area, my Department is exploring how it can further expand the technical expertise available to it to meet these demands. </p>  <p>  In relation to foreshore licence applications from ORE related developers, my Department is continuing to prioritise site investigation licence applications linked to a set of seven qualified ORE projects, known as "relevant projects" or Phase 1 project, which qualify to make an application to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) as part of the transition provisions in the MAP Act 2021. Any project in this category granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new marine planning system.</p>  <p>  The first phase of offshore wind development in Ireland will be necessary but not sufficient to reach our 2030 5GW ambition. An additional phase is required, comprised of projects which can deliver by 2030. The Minister for Energy, Climate and Communications is currently considering the Phase Two selection process, with a public consultation recently having been held on this matter. Applications for a foreshore licence for site investigations linked to proposed ORE projects outside of the first Phase are currently being processed in my Department on a chronological basis, with a degree of flexibility provided to cater for situations, for example, where a developer has several applications lodged and wishes to progress one ahead of the other for commercial or other reasons. The basis on which these applications are prioritised, and the public interest matters associated with the assessment process, will be revisited when the policy approach to the management of the Phase 2, including matters relating to grid capacity, have been settled.</p>  <p>  MACs for the Phase Two projects will be granted by the MARA. The aim is to have MARA established by Q1 2023 and, to facilitate this, a dedicated Unit has been set up within my Department to progress the Implementation Plan to establish this new agency. Extensive preparatory work will be required over the coming months to enable MARA to undertake the wide range of its statutory functions post-establishment. This work includes drafting commencement orders, and preparing a series of regulations and statutory guidelines as well as developing the processes dependent on same. The MAP Act will also introduce the possibility of applying for a licence for marine environmental surveys for the purposes of site investigations in the maritime area, without the requirement for a MAC, upon the commencement of MARA and its consenting functions. While I and Government colleagues are delighted to see the strong interest from developers in seeking to advance offshore wind projects and other strategically important infrastructural projects on the State&rsquo;s foreshore, it is Government&rsquo;s position that the continuing development of the ORE industry and related energy infrastructure must be progressed under a plan-led centralised approach as provided for under the MAP Act.</p></reply>

It commits to an examination of defects in housing, having regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing&rsquo;s report <i>&quot;Safe as Houses?&quot;</i>. <i>Housing for All</i>, the Government&rsquo;s national plan on housing to 2030, reiterates this commitment. </p><p>In this regard, I established a working group to examine defects in housing. This working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021 (except for August). In addition, regular subgroup meetings take place to advance elements of the work. </p><p>The group&rsquo;s terms of reference, adopted in May 2021, are focused on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013.  The full terms of reference of the Working Group are to: </p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:</p><p>- Identification and description of defect,</p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage,</p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected,</p><p>- Type of dwelling affected,</p><p>- Location of dwellings affected.</p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated.</p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>6. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>7. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>8. Report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>As part of its deliberations, the working group is consulting with a wide range of relevant stakeholders.  As part of this stakeholder engagement, the Working Group conducted a series of online surveys between 31 January and 14 March 2022 seeking the experiences of homeowners, landlords, Directors of Owners&rsquo; Management Companies and Property Management Agents. These submissions are currently being analysed.</p><p>The insights gained through engagement with stakeholders as well as the outcome of the online consultation are informing the ongoing deliberations of the Working Group and are supporting the delivery on its extensive terms of reference and finalisation of its report. </p><p>I am satisfied that the Working Group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter, and will require sufficient time to complete its work. In that context, I look forward to a report later this year following completion of their consultations and deliberations. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents.</p></reply>

Local authorities submitted initial affordable plans to me in December 2021. Preparation of these Plans allowed each local authority to assess the level of demand with affordability constraint in their area based on the Housing Need and Demand Assessment and plan provision accordingly. The Plans are being revised and updated by local authorities in the light of ongoing engagement and clarifications, and I expect that they will be ready for publication by local authorities before the Summer. They will provide a comprehensive overview of projected delivery of affordable housing nationally.</p>  <p>  In Q1 of this year, 50 affordable units were delivered at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside. These homes were completed as part of the new Cost Rental tenure, and rents are set at &euro;1,200 per month for the two bed apartments, a reduction of approximately 40% on comparable market rents in this area.</p>  <p>  In Q2 2022, affordable purchase homes are expected to be delivered in the following areas: 22 two and three bed homes at Boherboy and 15 two, three and four bed homes at Tower in Cork City, 14 two and three bed homes at Dun Emer in Lusk, and 16 three bed homes at Kilcarbery Grange in Clondalkin.</p>  <p>  Cost Rental projections for delivery in Q2 2022 will see completion of 44 homes at Parklands, Citywest. These homes are two-bedroom apartments and two-bedroom duplexes, with starting cost rents projected to range from &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,300, representing a discount of approximately 30% on comparable market rents in the area. 74 Cost Rental units will be completed by the Tuath AHB at Kilcarbery Grange, Clondalkin and a further 16 Cost Rental units will be tenanted by Cl&uacute;id at the Barnhall Meadows project in Leixlip, Co. Kildare. First phases of two further schemes in Newcastle, Dublin and in Newbridge, Co. Kildare are expected to see 57 new cost rental homes completed later this quarter with details to be made available shortly.</p>  <p>  Other measures to allow buyers to access newly-constructed housing affordably such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Local Authority Home Loan (formerly the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan), are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.

AHBs will be supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding and Local Authorities will be able to avail of funding for Cost Rental delivery through the Affordable Housing Fund. The LDA will also deliver Cost Rental on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh. </p>  <p>  The first 65 CREL-funded Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB in 2021, with 25 at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan and a further 40 at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip. Both developments delivered cost-covering rents at least 40% below comparable open-market prices. </p>  <p>  The first quarter of 2022 has seen tenants being allocated homes in a further 50 Cost Rental dwellings at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside. These homes were delivered by the Tuath and Respond AHBs, in a collaboration with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and supported by Serviced Site funding from my Department. The cost-covering rent for these two-bedroom apartments is &euro;1,200 per month, which represents a very significant discount on market prices in the area (c. &euro;2,000). </p>  <p>  Tenants were also been selected by the Tuath AHB for 44 Cost Rental homes at Parklands, Citywest.

The funding was introduced originally to tackle long term vacant units and is now increasingly targeted to support authority's to ensure minimal turnaround and re-let times for vacant stock. </p>  <p>  From 2014 to 2021, expenditure of some &euro;261 million was recouped to local authorities under the Voids Programme which funded the return to productive use of 18,527 properties nationwide. Local authorities also provide significant funding from their own resources to address the level of vacancy within the social housing stock.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support local authorities in their work in this area. Continuing on from the process commenced in 2021, all local authorities were asked earlier this year to provide information on their level of vacancy as at 1 January 2022. This information has been received and reviewed and will help inform this years&rsquo; Voids Programme. Funding allocations under the Programme will be announced shortly. </p>  <p>  Given the very significant investment into the Voids Programme over recent years, particularly in 2020 and in 2021, local authorities should now be in a strong position to begin the transition to a strategic and informed planned maintenance approach to stock management and maintenance. To that end, my Department and local authorities are working to transition from a largely response and voids based approach to housing stock management and maintenance, to a planned maintenance approach as referenced in Housing for All, policy objective 20.6. This will require the completion of stock condition surveys by all local authorities and the subsequent development of strategic and informed work programmes in response. My Department will support these work programmes by ensuring that the funding available under the various stock improvement programmes is aligned with this approach. </p></reply>

The HSF is a competitive grant scheme for conservation works to heritage structures in both private and public ownership.

Applications are assessed under a series of clearly-defined criteria, the details of which may be found in the HSF circular on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/32ae3-financial-assistance-for-architectural-heritage/.</p>  <p>  Under HSF 2022, a total of 129 applications were received by my Department for assessment. While this year&rsquo;s fund of &euro;4m represents an increase of 33% on 2021, HSF2022 was heavily over-subscribed and it was unfortunately not possible to make awards to all applications that met the minimum assessment criteria. This includes the structure in question. </p>  <p>  While further consideration cannot be given to unsuccessful applications, officials in my Department can, at the request of the local authority, provide feedback in respect of an individual application should the applicant wish to apply to the scheme again the following year. It is intended to run the HSF again in 2023 and details of the scheme will be made available this November.</p></reply>

It was agreed by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it should be implemented &ndash; for the families and victims who have waited for too long. </p>  <p>  We have taken every opportunity in our regular engagements with the British Government, including at the recent British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) on 23 March, to set out this position. We have cautioned the British Government strongly against any unilateral action on this most sensitive of issues.</p>  <p>  As agreed at the BIIGC in June 2022, the Government joined the British Government and the Northern Irish parties in a process of engagement of these issues, with discussions beginning in July 2021. The intention is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland.</p>  <p>  As we have consistently stated, a statute of limitations as proposed by the UK Government in their Command Paper is not something the Government can support. It is important to say that there has been a clear message from victims groups throughout this process that this cannot be the way forward. It has also been strongly and publicly opposed by all the parties. It would also go against the conclusions of the UK Government&rsquo;s own extensive public consultation in Northern Ireland on legacy legislation in 2019. There would be very serious questions as to whether such an approach would be consistent with the obligations of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is itself a key element of the Good Friday Agreement. We believe it would face well-founded legal challenges, causing further years of uncertainly and pain for families.</p>  <p>  We have consistently said that we are ready to engage with concerns or issues to do with the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement but any such changes must be discussed and agreed by the parties and both Governments. It is vital that any approach is collective if it is to work, and crucially, that it meets both the needs of victims and our shared international human rights obligations.</p></reply>

At the most recent British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference in Farmleigh on 23 March 2022, I raised the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, as well as other individual legacy cases.</p>  <p>  We have made clear to our counterparts that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government, and that there remains an urgent need for a response. The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this request, at senior political level and in official level engagement by my Department, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue until a resolution is found.</p>  <p>  The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 25 May 2016, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, calls on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.

The group, recommended by Indecon in its review of Career Guidance Tools and Information, comprises senior officials from relevant Departments including the Department of Education, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. </p>  <p>  The key role of the National Policy Group will be to develop a coherent long term strategic framework for lifelong guidance.  As set out in the Terms of Reference for the group, each Department will engage with relevant stakeholders to guide and advise its work.  The Department of Education has commenced work on the establishment of an Advisory Group on Guidance for schools comprising key stakeholders to inform its own work in this area.  The Department will consider how teachers and Guidance Counsellors can best be represented on its Advisory Group through national representative organisations.   The Department may also in time establish working groups to further progress various elements of work if necessary.  Membership of any working groups will be considered in the context of the work required.</p>  <p>  As with all policy development work undertaken by the Department, it is likely that there will be a public consultation phase included in this policy development process at which time individuals will be able to provide input/ observations.  </p></reply>

The Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025 is a whole of Government strategy, which aims to reduce consistent poverty and improve social inclusion in Ireland, with specific commitments focusing on children and families. The Roadmap recognises the importance of child related services, working in conjunction with income supports, in reducing child poverty.</p><p>The most recent data from the 2020 Survey on Income and Living Conditions was published in December 2021.  It shows the consistent poverty rate for children was 8.0%, which is in line with trends in recent years, despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Government will continue to focus on measures aimed at reducing the number of children experiencing poverty.  </p><p>The Department of Social Protection offers a range of supports to children and families to alleviate poverty.  Recent Budgets have consistently targeted supports on reducing the number of children in poverty and deprivation.  This reflects the Roadmap commitment to continue to target a reduction in poverty among children and families on low incomes as part of the annual budget process.  In line with this approach, Budget 2022 included:</p><p>- an increase of &euro;5 per week to all Working Age payments with proportionate increases for qualified adults;</p><p>- an increase to the weekly qualified child payment by &euro;2 to &euro;40 for children up to age 12, and by &euro;3 to &euro;48 for children aged over 12;</p><p>- an increase of &euro;10 per week in the Working Family Payment thresholds for families of all sizes; and</p><p>- an increase of &euro;10 in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) for older and younger children, accompanied by an increase in the weekly income limit for receipt of BSCFA for a one parent household to match that of a two-parent household.</p><p>This has occurred alongside Roadmap commitments under the Department&rsquo;s remit to support children and families, such as the extension of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit; the provision of the School Meals programme; and the development and rollout of the Hot School Meals programme.  </p><p>The above-mentioned supports are accompanied by a range of measures delivered across Government, including:</p><p>- prevention and early intervention initiatives and supports for parents through the work of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, including implementation of the First 5 Strategy;</p><p>- the rollout of free GP care to children and the provision of medical cards to families on low incomes under the Department of Health and</p><p>- the continuing delivery of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) programme by the Department of Education.</p><p>Progress in relation to the implementation of Roadmap commitments over the period January 2020 to September 2021 was published in January.</p><p>The social impact assessment of Budget 2022, produced by the Department using the ESRI's tax-benefit model, SWITCH, found that the tax and welfare measures in Budget 2022 most positively impacted non-earning parents (both single and couples), who would be vulnerable to child poverty.  </p><p>Official poverty data from the 2021 Survey on Income and Living Conditions is expected to be released by the CSO in April 2022 and will provide a more up-to-date picture of poverty levels, including child poverty, in Ireland. </p></reply>

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.  There are currently approximately 1,025,000 customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2022 is &euro;95 million.</p><p>It is not possible for my Department to provide an estimate of the cost of extending the free travel scheme to persons who are diagnosed with epilepsy.  The HSE estimates that there are 40,000 people who suffer with epilepsy in Ireland, with between 12-15,000 of this cohort who have breakthrough seizures.  My Department does not retain data on how many epilepsy sufferers are already in receipt of DSP qualifying payments that entitle them to access the free travel pass or are aged 66 or over.  Furthermore, the additional cost to the scheme, should it be extended to all people with epilepsy, would also depend on factors including the type of travel pass issued (e.g., single or companion pass), the number of journeys made using the free travel pass, the prevailing fares, and the type of journeys undertaken, i.e., rail, bus or Luas.</p><p>I am aware of an ongoing campaign by Epilepsy Ireland and recognise the issues and difficulties that can arise due to a person being diagnosed with epilepsy.  I have recently met with representatives of Epilepsy Ireland to discuss its proposal in detail.  </p><p>Following the meeting I have asked my Department officials to examine the issues raised by Epilepsy Ireland and to explore options to help alleviate these issues.  Further engagement with Epilepsy Ireland will be arranged once this exploratory work has been concluded.</p><p>However, it is really important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Crucially as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these schemes is not provided on the basis of a simple diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way resources can be targeted to people with most need.  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.  (The sole exception to this general approach is in respect of people who are blind.)</p><p>While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.</p><p>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <b></b></p></reply>

If the Deputy is aware of any individual case where an applicant is waiting that long, I would ask that he forward the details of the case to my Department and it will be examined.</p><p>My Department has put in place arrangements to expedite the allocation of PPSNs to those arriving in the State under the Temporary Protection Directive. In doing so, my Department is not only playing its part in ensuring that Ireland fulfils its obligations under EU law, but also ensuring those seeking this protection can avail of other vital public services.</p><p>Unlike many others who come to this State for education, employment and other reasons, the vast majority of those seeking temporary protection are totally dependent on this State for their housing, medical, education and income support needs. Given the numbers of arrivals experienced to date, it is right and proper that special arrangements be put in place to ensure we as a country can meet those needs, and I am proud of the flexibility and dedication to customer service and public service that the staff of my Department has shown in this regard.</p></reply>

These include regular payments like the Fuel Allowance, the Electricity or Gas Allowance available under the Household Benefits scheme and discretionary payments made under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. </p><p>The purpose of the Exceptional Needs Payments (ENP) is to assist people with essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.</p><p>The ENP scheme is demand led and payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.</p><p>Applications for ENPs are administered by Designated Persons in the Community Welfare Service in my Department.  When considering an application from people in financial difficulty for any payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, the Designated Person must consider all of the relevant circumstances when examining a case in determining the most appropriate scheme type and level of assistance required. The Designated Person may ask for a number of supporting documents to ensure the customer receives a level of payment appropriate to their needs. </p><p>My Department has enhanced the Community Welfare Service in recent months. Information provision on Community Welfare Services at Intreo Centres, Social Welfare Branch Offices and the Citizens Information/Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) has been improved, supported by easier telephone and email contact arrangements, and speedier processing of claims received. Exceptional needs application packs are available in all Intreo Centres and the application form can be downloaded from <i>www.gov.ie</i></p><p>This has ensured that customers do not have to attend in person to access services or to make a claim.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Therefore the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available. The current CWS staff numbers and vacancies are outlined in the tables below. Work is underway to fill the vacancies which have arisen through staff retirements and staff moving to other Departments. Activity within the CWS is closely monitored at all times and resources are deployed as necessary.</p><p>It is important to note that as part of my continued commitment to improve the CWS across the country, customers no longer have to meet in person with a CWO in order to make a claim.  This change means that those who require community welfare assistance urgently no longer need to wait to visit a clinic if they do not wish to.  These initiatives that I have put in place will ensure that the service is easily accessible and responsive to customer needs, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency.</p><p>The CWS remains a flexible service to meet the varied needs of vulnerable customers.  For this reason, consultations can be arranged via phone, at our office or, indeed can be a direct home visit depending on the customer&rsquo;s need.  </p><p>It is vital that the CWS is easily accessible and responsive to customer needs and developing and enhancing access to the service remains my priority.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Tabular statement</b></p><p><b>Table 1 - The number of CWOs by county</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th><div>No. of CWOs by county </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow </td>       <td><div>3 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan </td>       <td><div>3 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td><div>8 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td><div>37 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td><div>17 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td><div>80 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td><div>16 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td><div>14 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td><div>9 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td><div>4 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td><div>5 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td><div>4 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td><div>16 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford </td>       <td><div>4 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td><div>8 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td><div>11 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td><div>4 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td><div>3 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td><div>5 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td><div>4 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td><div>4 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td><div>13 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td><div>9 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td><div>6 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td><div>9 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td><div>8 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td><div>304 </div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p><b>Table 2 - The number of CWO vacancies by county</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>County </th>       <th><div>No. of CWO vacancies by county </div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td><div>2 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td><div>1 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td><div>3 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td><div>1 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td><div>2 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total </td>       <td><div>9 </div></td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Of particular significance was the substantial increase in guaranteed annual referrals to the new services under Phase 2. The increase in guaranteed referral numbers was calculated on the basis of ensuring the financial viability of the new employment services with due regard to the cost structures of existing Job Clubs and Local Employment Services in the Phase 2 lot areas.</p></reply>

The Directive which is effective from 24 February 2022, allows Ukrainian citizens and others fleeing Ukraine to move through the EU and receive supports. </p><p>Reception facilities have been established at Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort, where officials from my Department, together with the Departments of Justice, and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, are available to meet arrivals from Ukraine and provide the relevant information and supports.  Furthermore, dedicated City Centre Ukraine Support Centres have also been established in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. </p><p>Officials from the Department of Justice provide those from Ukraine, who are seeking temporary protection, with permission letters to confirm their legal entitlement to reside in Ireland for 1 year which may be further extended. Those requiring accommodation are referred to the International Protection Accommodation Service of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. This can also be requested at a later stage if required. </p><p>Unaccompanied children under 18 years who are seeking temporary protection from the war in Ukraine will be referred to the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) for relevant supports. </p><p>My Department&rsquo;s main aim is to provide immediate financial assistance. To achieve this, a fast-track approach is in operation. As personal public service numbers (PPSN) are required to access social welfare supports, they are provided on site or arrivals from Ukraine are invited to call into their nearest Intreo or local social welfare office to apply for PPSN and other social welfare supports. As of Monday 4 April my Department has allocated over 18,300<b></b>PPSNs.</p><p>The priority is to make emergency payments initially and therefore basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) is paid at rates up to &euro;206 per week with increases for adult and child dependents. Urgent and Exceptional Needs payments will also be available through the Community Welfare Service where urgent financial assistance is required.  To 4 April my Department has processed 8,930<b></b>basic SWA claims. </p><p>Once the initial payments are in place, customers will be transferred to the appropriate social welfare payment as quickly as possible.  This could include disability payments, State Pension and Jobseekers payments.  Any ancillary supports will also be available such as free travel for those who will receive a State Pension.</p><p>Child Benefit is also paid to a parent or guardian for each child aged under 16 years.  The rate of payment is &euro;140 a month for each child.  Child Benefit can also be paid for children aged 16 and 17 if they are in full-time education or full-time training or have additional needs and cannot support themselves.  The parent or guardian will not be expected to provide evidence of training or education until after the first 2 months after they have arrived in Ireland. As of 4 April 3,637<b></b>Child Benefit claims have been awarded in respect of 5,512<b></b>children.</p><p>Furthermore, all the services and supports of my Department&rsquo;s Public Employment Service will be made available to people which includes our Activation Service and Case Officer support. </p><p>I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy at this time,</p></reply>

It will operate alongside the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and in addition to the income that services receive from parents' fees.</p><p>Core Funding is designed to meet the combined objectives of:</p><p>- Improved affordability for parents by ensuring that fees do not increase; </p><p>- Improved quality through better pay and conditions for the workforce by supporting agreement on an Employment Regulation Order through the Joint Labour Committee;</p><p>- Supporting the employment of graduate staff; and</p><p>- Improved sustainability and stability for services.</p><p>Core Funding is a new and different way of providing substantial additional funding to the sector.</p><p>Extensive information was communicated to the sector on 7<sup>th</sup>March, including detail on the way in which Core Funding will be allocated to individual services.  A Ready Reckoner calculator has also been launched to assist providers in estimating the impact of Core Funding for their individual service.</p><p>Core Funding will address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP) from September 2022.</p><p>Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. It is based on operating hours, number of places offered by services and the age group of children for whom the places are offered, given the staffing requirements determined by the regulatory ratios for different care categories. </p><p>Services opening longer hours or offering more places will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher. </p><p>ECCE is 15 hours per week over 38 weeks of the year this amounts to 570 hours per year and is equivalent to 23% of the annual hours of a full day service operating from 8am to 6pm for 50 weeks of the year. ECCE ratio requirements are 11 children to one adult. Services offering places for 2-3 year olds can have a maximum of 6 children to one adult.  ECCE therefore has less than half the hourly staffing requirement of a service for 2-3 year olds. Due to the nature of ECCE provision &ndash; 15 hours per week for 38 weeks per year &ndash; even a small Core Funding allocation can take account of increased delivery costs including staffing costs.</p><p>In fact, the value of funding offered is weighted in favour of sessional services for 2.5-6 year-olds. ECCE services receive proportionately more than other types of services relative to the staffing requirements of sessional pre-school provision. </p><p>Core Funding is equivalent to an increase of <i>at least </i>9.5% on the standard capitation for ECCE. At a minimum, for every ECCE child &euro;78.75 per week is now available (compared to &euro;71.90 previously from ECCE standard capitation and programme support payment combined).</p><p>Because Core Funding is paid in respect of places rather than children, effectively this often means a greater &lsquo;per child&rsquo; marginal increase if the service has unfilled capacity. With average ECCE occupancy of 9 children, Core Funding is equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.</p><p>Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly.</p><p>No service will lose out.  I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding that it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same.  An estimated 1% of services will be caught by the funding guarantee.  All other services will see increases in funding, and most substantial increases in funding.</p><p>The 1% of services for whom the funding guarantee will apply and those who will see just small increases from Core Funding are ECCE-only services in receipt of higher capitation for large groups of children and with high occupancy levels. Such services are currently in receipt of between &euro;110-&euro;120 per hour of service provided, which is the highest levels of public funding relative to the staffing levels required for operating those types of services and significantly in excess of average staffing costs required for this type of service.</p><p>I would also like to note that there is a sustainability fund in place where services are experiencing sustainability issues that can be availed of by services.</p><p>Core Funding is designed to facilitate a partnership between the State and early learning and childcare services for the public good.  Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a fair income to providers.  I look forward to working together in partnership with the many providers who which to deliver services for the public good.</p></reply>

The Ready Reckoner is accessible to all and is designed to give an idea of what services can expect to receive based on their characteristics. It also allows different scenarios of provision to be tested. This will show the benefits of applying for Core Funding when it is possible to do so. </p><p>Core Funding is related to the costs of delivery. Services opening longer hours or offering more places and places for younger children will receive a higher value of Core Funding than other services. This is because their costs of operation are higher.</p><p>Core Funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain staff, including degree qualified staff; establish career structures; introduce or improve other features of provision that are demonstrated to contribute to quality (e.g. non-contact time, planning, training, curriculum implementation). Staff costs comprise approximately 70% of a service's operating costs. Core Funding makes available &euro;138 million of new funding available to contribute to staff costs, which will be in addition to the existing income available to providers through the public funding through ECCE and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and parents' fees.</p><p>The precise implications of the funding for staff pay and conditions depends on the agreement of an Employment Regulation Order (ERO) by the Joint Labour Committee (JLC). However, the level of funding provided is significant enough to achieve a substantial improvement in levels of staff pay for the sector as a whole as well as the development of career frameworks. Improved terms and conditions,  opportunities for progression and greater rates of staff retention are important steps to improving quality in the sector.</p><p>Core Funding will also make a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (for example, utilities, rent) that make up the remaining 30% of providers costs. In a full year, there is an allocation of &euro;20 million for a contribution to non-staff overhead costs through Core Funding. This is the first time this type of funding has been provided.  </p><p>Extra funding to support administration costs is also contained within Core Funding. This means that the budget previously allocated to Programme Support Payments, with an increased allocation, is now incorporated into Core Funding. Core Funding will make &euro;25 million available to providers to support the costs of administrative time.</p><p>&euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The graduate premium aspect of Core Funding will encourage employment of graduates as Lead Educators across all ELC, not just in ECCE rooms as was the case with higher capitation payments.</p><p>Core Funding is equivalent to an increase of at least 9.5% in funding for ECCE services not lead by a Graduate Lead Educator. At a minimum, for every ECCE child &euro;78.75 per week will be available from ECCE and Core Funding, compared to &euro;69 in ECCE standard capitation only. As Core Funding is paid in respect of places rather than children, effectively this could mean a greater &lsquo;per child&rsquo; marginal increase if the service has unfilled capacity. For example, with an ECCE occupancy of 9 children per staff member, Core Funding and ECCE together will be equivalent to weekly per child capitation of &euro;80.92.</p><p>The overwhelming majority of ECCE-services with graduate Lead Educators will benefit substantially.  While the approach of providing funding for graduate Lead Educators is different, the increased base rate funding plus payment based on capacity rather than attendance means that most services currently in receipt of higher capitation will see significant benefits from Core Funding.</p><p>Sessional services with standard capitation, Full Time, Part Time and School Age services will all see substantial increases in funding. Most ECCE services currently in receipt of higher capitation rates will also benefit significantly.</p><p>No service will lose out.  I have issued a funding guarantee to ensure that no service will receive less in Core Funding that it previously received in higher capitation and programme support payments, if their circumstances remain the same.  An estimated 1% of services will be caught by the funding guarantee.  All other services will see increases in funding, and most substantial increases in funding.</p><p>The 1% of services for whom the funding guarantee will apply and those who will see just small increases from Core Funding are ECCE-only services in receipt of higher capitation for large groups of children and with high occupancy levels. Such services are currently in receipt of between &euro;110-&euro;120 per hour of service provided, which is the highest levels of public funding relative to the staffing levels required for operating those types of services and significantly in excess of average staffing costs required for this type of service.</p><p>I would also like to note that there is a sustainability fund in place where services are experiencing sustainability issues that can be availed of by services.</p><p>Core Funding is designed to facilitate a partnership between the State and early learning and childcare services for the public good.  Its primary purpose is to improve pay and conditions in the sector as a whole and to improve affordability for parents, as well as ensuring a fair income to providers.  I look forward to working together in partnership with the many providers who which to deliver services for the public good.</p></reply>

More than 100,000 children now participate on the universal pre-school programme on an annual basis and the National Childcare Scheme subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p><p>To ensure that the supply of early learning and childcare places meets demand, my Department has, since 2015, funded the creation of more than 27,000 new places through an Annual Capital Programme.</p><p>Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p><p>Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services.

While this analysis shows a fall in vacancy rates from June 2021 to February 2022 &ndash; with vacancy rates falling from 21% to 19%, this analysis suggests that there is unused capacity across the country. </p><p>Pobal has commenced the new data collection as of 4 April 2022, as part of the Annual Early Years Sector Profile survey. This will allow for updated information on capacity among early learning and childcare services to be established.</p><p>In addition to these efforts to monitor capacity issues across the country, my Department is planning a range of steps to address any issue of under supply. A new funding model, to roll out in September, will provide funding for services aligned to costs of delivery so, for example, greater funding will be available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher than older children. Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places. Another important step being taken by my Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government (DHPLG), is to update the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings. In addition, CCC are currently proactively engaging with early learning and childcare services to identify unused capacity and explore the potential for services in increase capacity where there is evidence of unmet early learning and childcare needs of families.</p><p>Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

While progress has been made in recent years, significant challenges remain. As highlighted by recent European reviews, gender inequalities persist in research and innovation systems across Europe and there is a gap between the adoption of policies and strategies at EU and national level and their implementation at institutional level.</p>  <p>  The new European Research Area policy framework, which was adopted by EU Research and Innovation Ministers in November 2021, reaffirms Member States&rsquo; commitment to promote and support gender equality and foster inclusiveness. It prioritises the implementation of the actions identified in the 2021 Ljubljana Declaration on Gender Equality in Research and Innovation, which was endorsed by a large majority of Member States &ndash; including Ireland.</p>  <p>  Ireland has made significant progress in recent years and is often cited as an example of best practice in European discussions. As part of the Irish gender equality framework in higher education, the Higher Education Authority's Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality was established in June 2019, evolving into the Centre of Excellence for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in August 2020. Among our main research and innovation related actions is a requirement to promote gender equality to access research funding. Only higher education institutions that have at least an Athena SWAN bronze institutional award can apply for funding from Ireland&rsquo;s main research funders.</p>  <p>  I am committed to working with my European counterparts to ensure a renewed focus on progressing gender equality related issues at European and national level.</p></reply>

This represents 8.5% of my Department&rsquo;s voted allocation for 2022. HEIs also fund R&amp;I from their block allocations, but have autonomy in how that funding is applied.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding for postgraduate research through both Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Irish Research Council (IRC). Funding is also provided by other statutory funders and, of course, private funders.  Stipends are typically a feature of such funding globally, providing an income to the awardee in recognition of the need to devote themselves on a full-time basis to their research. </p>  <p>  My Department is monitoring the issue of stipends, in the context of the resources available to my Department and the competing needs to which they can be allocated. In this regard, I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding to the IRC in 2021 to enable it to increase postgraduate scholarships by &euro;2,500 per annum, or 16%. This was made effective from 1 January 2021 and, together with an increase to funding for postdoctoral salaries, benefited close to 1,300 early-career researchers in the system. The move also aligned the stipend level for both the IRC and SFI. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been undertaking am examination of the issues in relation to academic support activities of PhD students.  This has been done in collaboration with the Irish Universities Association and Technological Higher Education Association and the National Advisory Forum for Ireland&rsquo;s Framework for Doctoral Education.</p>  <p>  This work includes looking at international practice and gathering information on the institutions&rsquo; expectations of PhD students to undertake academic support activities across the higher education system.</p>  <p>  Building on this initial work, I wrote to the Presidents of the HEIs requesting that they undertake a sectoral exercise to agree a set of high-level principles to which all institutions can work towards. As part of this I am proposing that they undertake a gap analysis to determine the next steps in progressing towards greater consistency and transparency in arrangements for postgraduate researchers, in advance of the next academic year. I have also written to the sector&rsquo;s representative bodies, the IUA and THEA, requesting that they work in close partnership to ensure that the pathways scoped out allow for convergence of approaches across the entire higher education sector.</p>  <p>  I will be seeking regular updates on progress with this work at meetings of the National Advisory Forum for Ireland&rsquo;s Framework for Doctoral Education.</p>  <p>  Specifically, the Irish Research Council (IRC) does not implement means-testing for Irish Research Council PhD scholarships. Postgraduate scholarships are allocated solely on the basis of the quality of the research proposal as determined by independent international peer review. All successful applicants who meet the terms and conditions of the scheme are awarded a stipend of &euro;18,500 per year, up to a maximum of four years. Students in receipt of a stipend can also apply for SUSI grant support. </p>  <p>  The IRC has taken specific measures this year to enhance the support it provides to researchers of any career stage who are parents or carers. The IRC published a new policy in this regard effective 1 November 2021 which gives postgraduate awardees the entitlement to continuity of the stipend for approved periods of leave for purposes of maternity, paternity or the adoption of a child. This policy introduces a new and important level of support for early-career researchers that become parents, including lone parents.</p></reply>

The plan includes a target of 10,000 new apprentice registrations per annum across the further and higher education sectors by 2025. One of the five unambiguous objectives in this plan is &lsquo;Apprenticeship for all&rsquo;, meaning that the profile of the apprenticeship population will more closely reflect the profile of the general population. </p><p>On March 24, I launched the National Apprenticeship Alliance. The Alliance will have an advisory role in relation to the development of the apprenticeship system and will oversee and sanction the development of new apprenticeships over the coming years. There are plans to establish an equity of access subgroup of the National Apprenticeship Alliance which will look at addressing underrepresentation on apprenticeships from groups such as: socio economically disadvantaged, Travellers and Roma, migrants, persons with disabilities and women.</p><p>The 10-year Adult Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy for Ireland was launched on the 8 September 2021 to mark/coincide with the International Literacy Day.  Work has commenced on implementation with initial activity focussing on the set up of the Adult Literacy for Life Programme Office to coordinate implementation activities. A National Awareness campaign is underway, and a new website has been launched (www.adultliteracyforlife.ie) which will act as central repository for literacy, numeracy, and digital skills resources with contact points available for services across the country. I secured funding of &euro;3m in Budget 2022 which will enable the establishment of the necessary partnership structures, such as the Adult Literacy for Life National Programme Office and a network of Regional Literacy Coordinators.</p><p>Work on the development of the new National Access Plan is at an advanced stage. Following an extensive consultation process, over 122 submissions were received and reviewed from a wide range of stakeholders.</p><p>The National Access Plan seeks to target vulnerable students or students who have experienced disadvantage and therefore face challenges in accessing higher education and experience belonging in higher education. The consultation process highlighted the importance of recognising and naming additional &lsquo;priority groups&rsquo; in the NAP.  I can say that all submissions received have been carefully considered in the development of the National Access Plan. I hope to publish the new plan in the coming months.</p><p>The promotion of gender equality in education is an area that I have prioritised. On 8 March 2021, I launched the National Gender Equality Dashboard for Higher Education Institutions. Based on published <i>Higher Education Institutional Staff Profiles by Gender</i>from the HEA. This dashboard developed by Maynooth University provides an interactive and comparative visualisation of key staff data and gender profile, from Irish higher education institutions (HEIs). The<i>National Gender Equality Dashboard for HEIs</i>, which will be updated annually, offers a valuable baseline (2017-2019), from which progress on gender equality can be visualized and measured across all grades of staff in the Universities, Colleges, and Institutes of Technology.</p><p>On 15 March 2022 I announced the second National Review of Gender Equality, which is being carried out by an expert group, on behalf of the Higher Education Authority (HEA). This review will assess progress since the first review of its kind in 2016 and make recommendations to ensure that gender equality is amplified in higher education institutions (HEIs) as they move into the future. The expert group is expected to make five to ten high-level recommendations as to how, in their view, higher education institutions might enhance their equality policies and their implementation to support gender equality. I expect to be in a position to publish this report towards the end of 2022.</p><p>In addition to the submission of progress updates, the Governing Authority of each HEI must submit a statement to the HEA confirming that the Institution has an action plan in place and that this action plan is being implemented as part of its Annual Governance Statements. All HEIs are required to submit an Annual Governance Statement and Statement of Internal Control to the HEA, covering a comprehensive list of governance requirements, with non-compliance in any matter to be identified within the statement.</p><p>Progress is continuing on the range of indicators included in the Gender Action Plan:</p><p>- All HEIs have institutional gender action plans and submit annual progress updates to the HEA.</p><p>- The HEA continues to publish the <i>Higher Education Institutional Staff Profiles by Gender </i>on an annual basis.</p><p>- New and additional gender-specific posts - the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative was launched in 2019. To date, 20 posts at senior academic level were awarded to Irish HEIs under the first cycle of the initiative and 10 posts were awarded under the second cycle of the initiative.</p><p>- Attainment of Athena SWAN awards is linked to eligibility for research funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, Health Research Board, Irish Research Council, and Science Foundation Ireland. 15 additional awards were announced on March 31. This brings the total number of awards up to 98; 20 HEIs have achieved a Bronze award and 78 departmental awards have been made to date.</p><p>The HEA has awarded funding of over &euro;500k under the Gender Equality Enhancement Fund in 2020/21 to advance gender equality initiatives in Irish higher education. Awards were made across three areas regarding: research on or advancing gender quality initiatives in Ireland; training programmes specifically addressing gender equality; and Athena SWAN capacity-building activities.</p><p>Projects were funded across several areas including the promotion of female role models in the physical sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics (pSTEM), development and implementation of gender identity, expression and diversity training for staff in Irish HEIs, establishment of networks to support female participation in computer science, resources to support the academic advancement of mid-career female staff, provision of gender equality-based leadership training to future leaders, development of resources to assist departments in modelling gender-disaggregated data against national trends, embedding equality, diversity and inclusion into the curriculum, teaching and learning and teacher education, an investigation of how gender stereotypes contribute to gender inequality, support for the increased visibility and participation of women economists in public discourse, and research into the impact of menopause on the careers of women in Irish higher education.</p></reply>

The<i>National Gender Equality Dashboard for HEIs</i>, which will be updated annually, offers a valuable baseline (2017-2019), from which progress on gender equality can be visualized and measured across all grades of staff in the Universities, Colleges, and Institutes of Technology.</p><p>On 15 March 2022 I announced the second National Review of Gender Equality, which is being carried out by an expert group, on behalf of the Higher Education Authority (HEA). This review will assess progress since the first review of its kind in 2016 and make recommendations to ensure that gender equality is amplified in higher education institutions (HEIs) as they move into the future. The expert group is expected to make five to ten high-level recommendations as to how, in their view, higher education institutions might enhance their equality policies and their implementation to support gender equality. I expect to be in a position to publish this report towards the end of 2022.</p><p>In addition to the submission of progress updates, the Governing Authority of each HEI must submit a statement to the HEA confirming that the Institution has an action plan in place and that this action plan is being implemented as part of its Annual Governance Statements. All HEIs are required to submit an Annual Governance Statement and Statement of Internal Control to the HEA, covering a comprehensive list of governance requirements, with non-compliance in any matter to be identified within the statement.</p><p>Progress is continuing on the range of indicators included in the Gender Action Plan:  </p><p>-All HEIs have institutional gender action plans and submit annual progress updates to the HEA.</p><p>-The HEA continues to publish the <i>Higher Education Institutional Staff Profiles by Gender </i>on an annual basis.</p><p>-New and additional gender-specific posts - the Senior Academic Leadership Initiative was launched in 2019. To date, 20 posts at senior academic level were awarded to Irish HEIs under the first cycle of the initiative and 10 posts were awarded under the second cycle of the initiative.</p><p>- Attainment of Athena SWAN awards is linked to eligibility for research funding from the Environmental Protection Agency, Health Research Board, Irish Research Council, and Science Foundation Ireland. 15 additional awards were announced on March 31. This brings the total number of awards up to 98; 20 HEIs have achieved a Bronze award and 78 departmental awards have been made to date.</p><p>The HEA has awarded funding of over &euro;500k under the Gender Equality Enhancement Fund in 2020/21 to advance gender equality initiatives in Irish higher education. Awards were made across three areas regarding: research on or advancing gender quality initiatives in Ireland; training programmes specifically addressing gender equality; and Athena SWAN capacity-building activities.</p><p>Projects were funded across several areas including the promotion of female role models in the physical sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics (pSTEM), development and implementation of gender identity, expression and diversity training for staff in Irish HEIs, establishment of networks to support female participation in computer science, resources to support the academic advancement of mid-career female staff, provision of gender equality-based leadership training to future leaders, development of resources to assist departments in modelling gender-disaggregated data against national trends, embedding equality, diversity and inclusion into the curriculum, teaching and learning and teacher education, an investigation of how gender stereotypes contribute to gender inequality, support for the increased visibility and participation of women economists in public discourse, and research into the impact of menopause on the careers of women in Irish higher education.</p></reply>

This represents 8.5% of my Department&rsquo;s voted allocation for 2022. HEIs also fund R&amp;I from their block allocations, but have autonomy in how that funding is applied.</p>  <p>  My Department provides funding for postgraduate research through both Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Irish Research Council (IRC). Funding is also provided by other statutory funders and, of course, private funders.  Stipends are typically a feature of such funding globally, providing an income to the awardee in recognition of the need to devote themselves on a full-time basis to their research. </p>  <p>  My Department is monitoring the issue of stipends, in the context of the resources available to my Department and the competing needs to which they can be allocated. In this regard, I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding to the IRC in 2021 to enable it to increase postgraduate scholarships by &euro;2,500 per annum, or 16%. This was made effective from 1 January 2021 and, together with an increase to funding for postdoctoral salaries, benefited close to 1,300 early-career researchers in the system. The move also aligned the stipend level for both the IRC and SFI. </p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been undertaking am examination of the issues in relation to academic support activities of PhD students.  This has been done in collaboration with the Irish Universities Association and Technological Higher Education Association and the National Advisory Forum for Ireland&rsquo;s Framework for Doctoral Education.</p>  <p>  This work includes looking at international practice and gathering information on the institutions&rsquo; expectations of PhD students to undertake academic support activities across the higher education system.</p>  <p>  Building on this initial work, I wrote to the Presidents of the HEIs requesting that they undertake a sectoral exercise to agree a set of high-level principles to which all institutions can work towards. As part of this I am proposing that they undertake a gap analysis to determine the next steps in progressing towards greater consistency and transparency in arrangements for postgraduate researchers, in advance of the next academic year. I have also written to the sector&rsquo;s representative bodies, the IUA and THEA, requesting that they work in close partnership to ensure that the pathways scoped out allow for convergence of approaches across the entire higher education sector.</p>  <p>  I will be seeking regular updates on progress with this work at meetings of the National Advisory Forum for Ireland&rsquo;s Framework for Doctoral Education.</p>  <p>  Specifically, the Irish Research Council (IRC) does not implement means-testing for Irish Research Council PhD scholarships. Postgraduate scholarships are allocated solely on the basis of the quality of the research proposal as determined by independent international peer review. All successful applicants who meet the terms and conditions of the scheme are awarded a stipend of &euro;18,500 per year, up to a maximum of four years. Students in receipt of a stipend can also apply for SUSI grant support. </p>  <p>  The IRC has taken specific measures this year to enhance the support it provides to researchers of any career stage who are parents or carers. The IRC published a new policy in this regard effective 1 November 2021 which gives postgraduate awardees the entitlement to continuity of the stipend for approved periods of leave for purposes of maternity, paternity or the adoption of a child. This policy introduces a new and important level of support for early-career researchers that become parents, including lone parents.</p></reply>

The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the centralised student grant awarding authority SUSI (Student Universal Support Ireland) to determine.</p>  <p>  Assessment of means under the Student Grant Scheme 2022 is based on gross income from all sources, of the applicant and his parents or partner.  No deduction is given for outgoings with the exception of pension contributions, legally enforceable maintenance payments and employment related expenses as approved by Revenue.  </p>  <p>With regard to this specific application, I have been advised by my officials that the student to whom you refer has recently appealed to the Appeals Officer to SUSI.  The appeal was considered and the determination of that appeal was communicated to the student directly on 4th April.</p>  <p>  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by an appeals officer in SUSI and remains of the view that the scheme has not been interpreted correctly in his/her case, an appeal may be submitted to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board within the required timeframe (i.e. not later than 30 days after the notification of the determination of the appeals officer to the applicant). Such appeals can be made by the appellant on line via www.studentgrantappeals.ie. </p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects. </p><p>Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health. Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.</p><p>The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT). The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.</p><p>Regarding the HRT patches, the suppliers have confirmed that they have increased the planned supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. With respect to the gels, Divigel was received by the wholesaler on 25th March and has been released for sale this week. An alternative gel product (Oestrogel) has recently gone short and is expected to resume supply in April. In the interim, the company is working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues.  <b></b></p><p>The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within our regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised the companies that we are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. We are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.</p><p>The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages. The information is made available to assist healthcare professionals in managing medicine shortages when they do arise and reduce their impact on patients. The information relating to shortages on the HPRA website is dynamic and changes depending on the current information the HPRA has to hand, including removal from the list when a shortage has been resolved.</p><p>The HPRA will continue to liaise with suppliers of HRT medicines over the coming weeks with a view to securing updates and commitments regarding the restoration of normal supplies for patients as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In accordance with the 2009 Act, state support is only payable from the date funding is released.  All NHSS applicants are advised in writing that funding will be available only from the date of funding approval, or admission to a registered nursing Home, whichever is the later.  Many NHSS clients are in receipt of Transitional Care Funding to cover costs within this interim period.</p>  <p>  Transitional Care Funding approvals to private nursing homes are funded separately to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Transitional Care Funding is a delayed transfer of care support to assist medically approved clients in Acute Hospitals applying for NHSS to be discharged into the nursing home of their choice, while awaiting NHSS funding release or for clients in acute hospitals who require a short period of convalescence before returning home.</p>  <p>  As transitional care funding is to assist discharges in the Acute Hospital, ideally Transitional Care Funding should be applied for while the client is in the hospital.  If a decision is made to apply for NHSS funding once the client has been discharged to the nursing home for convalescence, this requirement needs to be assessed by a multi-disciplinary team and a determination made on the Common Summary Assessment Report (CSAR) as medically requiring long term care.  Requests for Transitional Care Funding when this occurs is reviewed and a decision is made on a case-by-case basis.</p></reply>

Officials from my Department and from the HSE have also held three rounds of discussions with the IDA, the most recent on 2nd March 2022 when my Department and the HSE presented proposals to invest additional resources in the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS), including &euro;10m provided in the Budget, on top of the 2022 Estimate allocation of &euro;56 million.</p><p>I have recently given approval for significant fee increases to be paid to contracted dentists across a number of items, including the Dental Examination and Fillings. I have also approved the reintroduction of Scale and Polish for medical card patients on the DTSS. These new measures are designed to address access problems for patients, and address dentist&rsquo;s concerns about the viability of the DTSS, while aligning the DTSS more closely with the Dental Treatment Benefits Scheme, which is widely operated by private dentists for PRSI patients. These measures should amount to an additional investment this year of about &euro;26 million over what was spent on the Scheme in 2021. My Department and the HSE will work together to quickly implement the changes to the Scheme for the benefit of patients.</p><p>The National Oral Health Policy, &quot;Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte&quot; (2019) sets out the roadmap for the future provision of oral healthcare to the eligible population. It has two key goals; first, to provide the supports to enable every individual to achieve their best oral health, and second, to reduce oral health inequalities across the population, by enabling vulnerable groups to access oral healthcare and improve their oral health. My Department will be working with stakeholders to address the issues raised by the Deputy, implement the actions identified in the Policy and overcome the delays caused by the pandemic.  </p><p>I have asked the HSE to forward the requested data on the number of dentists participating in the DTSS to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The measure will be ring fenced to staff ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments within the period between 1 March 2020 and 30 June 2021. Full details of how this measure shall apply including eligibility and terms and conditions will be published by the HSE shortly.</p><p>This payment will be made to those eligible public sector frontline healthcare staff (inclusive of agency staff working for the HSE) who worked in clinical settings, noting this list is not exhaustive: those Doctors / Nurses / Health Care Assistants / Porters / Cleaners etc. that work in clinical settings. The measure encompasses Health Care Support Assistants (also known as Home Carers / Home Help) employed by or carrying out duties contracted to the HSE.</p><p>The measure further extends to those equivalent healthcare workers in private nursing homes and hospices. Arrangements for this sector encompassed by this measure are currently being progressed by the Department of Health.</p><p>The announcement covers eligible frontline healthcare workers only. I am also mindful of the many, many other workers throughout the country who played their own part during this difficult period.

Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.</p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The Minister for Health has no role in these decisions.</p>  <p>  The HSE advise that Melatonin (Circadin) has never been available through the Reimbursement List under the Community Drug Schemes. Melatonin (Circadin) underwent a review in 2008 and reimbursement was not recommended by the NCPE as there was insufficient evidence to support the reimbursement of this product under the Community Drug Schemes (available at www.ncpe.ie/drugs/melatonin-circadin/). </p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the pricing and reimbursement of Melatonin (Slenyto) in July 2019 from Flynn Pharma for the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents aged 2-18 with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and / or Smith-Magenis syndrome, where sleep hygiene measures have been insufficient.</p>  <p>On 31   July 2019, the HSE requested that Flynn Pharma submit a rapid review dossier to the NCPE for assessment. To date Flynn Pharma has not submitted a rapid review dossier to the NCPE for assessment. Submission of a completed rapid review dossier to the NCPE is required to progress this application, as per the formal processes governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  Finally, individuals may be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%.</p></reply>

There are approximately 8,000 known rare diseases; 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin and are often chronic and life-threatening.  Up to 1 person in 12 in Ireland may have a rare disease at some stage in their life.  Approximately 300,000 persons in Ireland are living with a rare disease.</p><p>Many of the recommendations of the <i>National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland (2014 &ndash; 2018)</i>have already been implemented including the establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) and HSE National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases which has now been  operationalised and incorporated into the NRDO which is the main contact point and driver for National HSE rare disease projects and initiatives. </p><p>The National Rare Disease Plan elaborates on Ireland&rsquo;s participation in European Reference Networks (ERN).  ERNs are virtual networks involving healthcare providers across Europe where the networking of knowledge and expertise through reference centres and teams of experts takes place.  These links are emphasized in the Plan to address the care of patients with rare diseases at both National and European levels.  Significant progress has been made with regard to participation in ERNs with Ireland&rsquo;s 15 applications for entry to ERNs recently being approved from 5 academic hospitals. Entry to these networks commenced on 1 January 2022 and represents a significant achievement for the Irish Health Service which will drive innovation, training and clinical research for highly specialised care. It is also a very positive development for individuals and families affected with rare diseases.</p><p>In order to ensure that the input and the voice of the patient is represented in the ongoing work in relation to Rare Diseases, in 2021 I met with the HSE, NRDO and the Rare Diseases Task force which comprises the main rare disease advocacy groups; Rare Disease Ireland (RDI), the Medical Research Charities Group (MRCP), and  the Irish Platform for Patient Organisations, Science and Industry (IPPPOSI). At this meeting priority areas for the future were discussed with a view to building further on the significant progress made to date in implementing the Rare Disease Plan. A number, of priority areas for the coming period were agreed including; patient awareness, European Reference Networks, research and registries, access to services, access to medicines, diagnosis, education, legislation and policy.</p></reply>

The third level sector will play a key role in providing thought leadership, critical analysis, research as well as the development of knowledge and skills to better support public health leadership, policy making and public health practice.</p><p>Dr Tony Holohan is taking up the Professorship of Public Health Strategy &amp;amp; Leadership in Trinity College Dublin to further this potential. Specifically, the Department intends for Dr Holohan to lead the development and activities of inter-institutional collaboration between universities and the health sector and to develop stronger links with the WHO and agencies of the EU.</p><p>This secondment to Trinity College Dublin means that Dr Holohan has agreed to relinquish his role as Chief Medical Officer; it is not Dr Holohan&rsquo;s intention to return to this role at any point in the future.</p><p>The Department, at a senior level made this decision in order to show innovation and lead by example. All arrangements in relation to staffing are the responsibility of the Secretary General. In making the arrangements for this, the Department was mindful of the general principles of the Civil Service secondment policy which applies to secondments within the Civil Service.  That policy provides for specialist sectoral secondment arrangements to be made.</p><p>Dr Holohan will take up the role on 1 July 2022.  Arrangements are being made between the Department and Trinity College regarding the funding of the post.  It is important to note that there is no increase in remuneration or financial benefit accruing to Dr Holohan on foot of this arrangement.</p><p>The role of CMO will be filled in the usual way for posts at this level subject to the appropriate sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>It is anticipated there will then be an open competition for a new appointment to the role of CMO under the auspices of the Public Appointments Service and the Top-Level Appointments Committee (TLAC).</p></reply>

A further &euro;77 million has been invested in the 2021/22 Winter Plan.  My Department asked the HSE to take account of  the Report&rsquo;s recommendations when drafting the Winter Plan and the 20/21 and 21/22 Winter Plans have funded initiatives such as Frailty Intervention Teams, greater community support for older people including more home care packages, support for those with respiratory conditions and community response teams (nursing and therapies) which address some of the recommendations in the report.</p>  <p>  &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure were provided nationally as part of the Winter Plan and Budget 2021 to fund 1,146 additional beds on a permanent basis in our acute hospitals. As of the 31st of March 2022, the Winter Plan / Budget 2021 has provided over 800 non-ICU acute beds nationally to the hospital system over the number available on 1 January 2020. There have also been significant increases in staffing since 2019.</p>  <p>  The report contains 30 consolidated recommendations and further recommendations specific to each of the nine hospitals reviewed. As implementation of the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

In order to protect patients, it has a responsibility to ensure that all doctors registered to practise medicine in Ireland meet the requirements to practise as set out in its legislation. Officials from my Department have been working closely with the Council in recent weeks to examine the ways in which support can be provided to doctors arriving from Ukraine and the Council has established an internal working group to explore and address the issues that arise. </p>  <p>  Depending on where a doctor qualified and the type of qualifications they hold, some doctors arriving into Ireland from outside the EU may be required to take a pre-registration exam and an English language exam. These exams look at a number of areas including communication and clinical skills and are an important step to ensure patient safety. The HSE in partnership with various stakeholders are also looking at other options which these doctors can avail of while registration is pending, such as medical translation and access to CPD resources. To date the Council has not received a full application for registration from any of the new doctors arriving in Ireland, however it is directly supporting a number of doctors with queries about the registration process and the requirements.</p>  <p>  The Council is working directly with key stakeholders in the HSE, Postgraduate Training Bodies and the Irish Medical Schools Council. Discussions with these partners are ongoing and it is hoped to have a further update in the near future. The President and the CEO of the Medical Council also met with Ambassador Larysa Gerasko and the Ambassador has offered the support of the Embassy in acting as a liaison with Ukrainian authorities to support the registration of Ukrainian doctors in Ireland and also to assist the Council in disseminating information to Ukrainian doctors in Ireland.</p></reply>

It is a one-stop shop to provide people with temporary protection immediately when they arrive, as well as giving them access to social welfare, to accommodation if required, and to care packages and other supports provided by the private sector. The HSE Team are ensuring that Ukrainian arrivals get information on how our health service works, immediate care, prescriptions, and can get started on applying for a medical card. Equivalent arrangements are being implemented by the Government agencies involved at other ports of entry.</p>  <p>  It is a priority for the Department and the HSE to ensure that Ukrainians arriving to Ireland are provided with appropriate health and social care services including primary health care services for adults, children and older people, ongoing care of priority medical conditions and vaccination services including for COVID-19 and childhood immunisations. Ukrainian refugees will be able to access the equivalent health services as people who are ordinarily already living here, including Irish citizens.</p>  <p>  There is a simplified and streamlined medical card application process for Ukrainians granted temporary protection status with 2692 medical cards issued as of 06/04/22. Translated versions in Ukrainian and Russian are available on the dedicated HSE Ukrainian webpage (Healthcare services for Ukrainian nationals in Ireland - HSE.ie). It is recognised that whilst awaiting their medical card, some individuals may need access to prescription medicines. The HSE has put in place a means to enable reimbursement to pharmacies for such medicines dispensed.</p>  <p>  For Ukrainians placed in temporary accommodation, the HSE and local healthcare workers are providing GP and primary care services and connections to more specialist services as needed. i.e. maternity services. In addition, Safety Net are providing GP clinics to facilities located in Dublin and out of hours services are accessible as required. </p>  <p>  In conjunction with the National Women&rsquo;s and Infant Health Programme, a specific urgent referral service at the Rotunda Hospital for pregnant women near term (over 32 weeks) or those who require urgent access is in place. The senior midwife can refer to any maternity unit nationally. </p>  <p>  The Inclusion Health Service at CHI Temple Street is being reoriented to assist with the Ukrainian situation in the area. </p>  <p>  In collaboration with National Cancer Control programme (NCCP) and the Irish Cancer Society (ICS), a Ukrainian cancer information page on how to access services is live (www.cancer.ie/ukraine).  The ICS will be appointing a Ukrainian Cancer Coordinator which Acute Operations will work in close collaboration with. </p>  <p>  Refugees can find information and other resources about public healthcare services at www2.hse.ie/services/healthcare-in-ireland/ukrainian-refugees.html. This information is available in Ukrainian, English and Russian.</p>  <p>  The above information is provided on the dedicated government webpage for Ukrainian refugees at www.gov.ie/ukraine.</p></reply>

Just over 33,000 participants joined the scheme and over &euro;77 million was paid to them in 2019 representing a supplemental exchequer allocation of &euro;27 million.</p>  <p>  The core support for the beef sector under the outgoing RDP is the &euro;300 Million Beef Data and Genomics Programme. In addition to this support, since 2020, over &euro;260 million of additional supports were made available specifically to the beef sector, including the Beef Finishers Payment and BEEP-S in 2020. In addition, the Beef Sector Efficiency Programme with allocation of  &euro;45 million which ran in 2021 and has been launched for 2022 recently also with a budget of &euro;45 million. I have also, secured &euro;6m in funding to promote our world-class suckler brand abroad.  All of these supports are additional to the more general supports that beef farmers can avail of under the current RDP including ANCs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the proposal for suckler farmers in Ireland's new CAP strategic plan is to continue to provide support to farmers by building on the efficiency gains of the BDGP and the BEEP-S measures through the Suckler Carbon Efficiency Programme. This important scheme will deliver &euro;150 on the first 10 cows and &euro;120 on remaining cows compared to &euro;90 on the first 10 cows and &euro;0 thereafter on the outgoing BDGP.</p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the economic and environmental sustainability of the suckler and beef sector. Beef farmers, in addition to being the driving force behind a multi-billion euro sector, are the foundation of local economic activity and rural society.</p></reply>

No clover is cultivated in Ireland for the production of seed. The clover seed is primarily imported from continental Europe, but additional imports can be sourced from third countries (e.g. New Zealand) that are members of the OECD seed certification scheme where seed is produced to equivalent standard to those that pertain in the EU. Italy, Germany, Denmark and the Czech Republic are among the main producers of clover seed for cultivation in Europe.</p>  <p>  The Multi Species Sward Scheme including support for the Red Clover Silage Measure is one of three schemes under the &euro;12m Tillage Incentive Package that I announced recently to support farmers. Its purpose is to promote environmentally sustainable methods of farming and thereby greatly reduce nitrogen fertiliser while maintaining forage yields. Both Multi Species Swards and Red Clover Silage Measure can save farmers money while maintaining production levels and reducing the farm carbon footprint.  The Measures will support the establishment of approximately 12,000 hectares of Multi Species Swards and approximately 4,000 hectares of the Red Clover silage mix.</p>  <p>  To ensure that there will be an adequate supply of clover seed, the Department has amended the Terms and Conditions of the Multi Species Swards Scheme and the Red Clover Silage Measure so that it is no longer a requirement for clover seed to be on the Department&rsquo;s Recommended List thereby ensuring seed agents can gain access to a wider range of clover varieties.</p>  <p>  The Department is confident that, with the incentive provided through these measures, the seed merchants can fulfil this shortfall through additional imports this coming year from producers in continental Europe and other third countries. </p></reply>

The success of my Department's diplomatic representation abroad in assisting in the retention, expansion and securing of access to markets is directly related to the support and additional work carried out in my Department&rsquo;s line divisions at home.</p>  <p>  With specific focus on my Department&rsquo;s resources in Brussels, currently there is one officer deployed at Counsellor level (which is equivalent to Principal Officer grade) and a further two officers are deployed at First Secretary level (which is equivalent to Assistant Principal).  On 23 June 2016, there was one officer serving as Counsellor and two officers from my Department serving in First Secretary roles.</p>  <p>  From time to time, my Department considers allocating staff to Seconded National Expert (SNE) positions.  In selecting SNE posts, my Department gives consideration to achieving a balance between filling these posts and the need to retain key expertise within the Department for ongoing responsibilities. The roles of any SNEs that we approve to be filled are linked to priorities, for example, the Common Agriculture Policy and ensure policy coherence between EU environmental objectives and funding in respect of agriculture and forestry.  Currently, there are a total of three officers from my Department assigned to SNE roles.  On 23 June 2016 there were three officers from my Department assigned to SNE positions in Brussels.</p>  <p>  My Department also utilises the bi-annual National Experts in Professional Training scheme to provide an opportunity to work in the European Commission for limited periods of three to five months. Currently, there is one Administrative Officer from my Department engaged in this role. The skills and experiences acquired by Irish officials during their traineeship have the potential to benefit my Department and facilitate greater understanding of the functioning of European institutions.  Participation in this programme is in line with the Government&rsquo;s overall EU engagement strategy. There was no officer from my Department in such a role on 23 June 2016.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above roles, my Department currently has one Executive Officer assigned to the Permanent Representative, Brussels.  This officer provides support to my Department officials through attendance and reporting on weekly meetings of the Special Committee on Agriculture, monthly meetings of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, management of the day-to-day administration within the Agriculture Office, co-ordination of briefing material and logistical organisation.  On 23 June 2016 there was also a staff member assigned to this position. </p>  <p>  My Department regularly reviews overseas assignments, assessing vacancies in line with workforce planning, to ensure that our presence abroad supports market access and delivers on the expected benefits.</p></reply>

This is done through the enhancement of the national herd dataset for genetic evaluations, with a view to supporting the adoption of best practice and more informed decision making at farm level. The Programme targets the weaning efficiency of suckler cows and calves through the collection of the live weights of cows and progeny in the herd of each participant; improving the welfare of suckler calves at the time of weaning through vaccination and meal feeding; and controlling liver fluke in adult suckler cows.</p>  <p>  The scheme opened on 16th March 2021 and closed without late penalty on 26th April 2021. It remained open, albeit with a late penalty from 27th April 2021 until 21st May 2021. </p>  <p>  All dates were clearly set out in the Terms and Conditions, in the Press Releases and in the farming media.

This matter was examined and it was determined no application had been recorded. The person named was informed of the outcome of the examination and the decision that no application could be lodged at that time. </p>  <p>  A request for a review of this decision was received. The review was carried out and a letter issued on the 3rd March, 2022 upholding the original decision.
