The measures in the Budget are in addition to those announced in the July Stimulus, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), cash for businesses, low cost loans, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities. Details of the wide range of COVID-19 schemes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>As a result of the fact that businesses have to close, we are making changes to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the EWSS. The new payment structure for the PUP includes the increase in the top rate to &euro;350 for those who were earning in excess of &euro;400 per week. This change to payment rates will apply in respect of all existing and new applicants. The EWSS is also being amended to align with the amendment to PUP, with the top payment increasing to &euro;350 for those earning over &euro;400. </p><p>As part of Budget 2021, a new COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), became operational from 13<sup>th</sup>October through Revenue and offers a targeted, timely and temporary sector-specific support to businesses forced to close or trade at significantly reduced levels due to COVID of up to &euro;5,000 per week.</p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme </p><p>We have also announced a six-month reduction in the VAT, going down from 23% to 21%, a reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate to 9%.</p></reply>

As such, no national Government has sole discretion to make changes to these rules but each Member State provides input into the development of the rules be this through the State aid Modernisation process which is currently underway, State aid Fitness Checks and their associated consultation processes.  The State Aid Unit of my Department coordinates Ireland's position in the development and/or revision of State aid rules and engages widely across Government on specific state aid issues.</p>  <p>  For example as part of the recent review of the Regional Aid Guidelines, Ireland set out the importance of specific measures for Just Transition areas, a position also taken by other Member States who considered that the uniqueness of Just Transition areas should be included in the revised Regional Aid Guidelines. </p>  <p>  The Green Deal and Just Transition are very much a priority for the Commission and for Member States with new flexibilities already in place.  Ireland has recently developed the Just Transition Fund under the General Block Exemption Regulation.  This will provide funding to innovative projects that contribute to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the Wider Midlands region.  The Government has allocated &euro;11 million to this Fund for 2020.</p>  <p>  As part of the State Aid Modernisation Programme, a number of State Aid rules are being considered in the context of the Green Deal and Just Transition.  These include the Environmental and Energy State Aid Guidelines which will be subject to consultation over the coming months and my Department will coordinate a cross Government input into the revision process.  </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 - a 51% reduction over the decade - and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The 2050 target will be set in law by the Climate Action Bill, which will drive the implementation of a suite of policies that will help achieve the Programme for Government's goal of a 7% yearly reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  The drafting of the Bill is a key part of our journey towards achieving the 7% annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.This step-change in ambition will be challenging and require fundamental changes in so many parts of Irish life, but I believe that Ireland can and will rise to this challenge. In doing so we will be able to improve the health, welfare and security of all our people. The next iteration of the Climate Action Plan will identify and set out the far reaching policy changes across every sector to deliver these emissions reductions. In particular, the Programme for Government commits to:</p><p>- Delivering a National Aggregated Model of Retrofitting reaching over 500,000 homes by 2030, as part of the EU Renovation Wave.</p><p>- Learning from district heating pilot projects to launch a scaled-up programme.</p><p>- Accelerating the electrification of the transport system, including electric bikes, electric vehicles, and electric public transport.</p><p>- Developing a strategy for remote working and remote service delivery, taking advantage of the opportunity for a rapid roll-out of the National Broadband Plan. </p><p>- Ensuring an unprecedented modal shift in all areas by a reorientation of investment to walking, cycling and public transport.</p><p>- Developing a new Sustainable Rural Mobility Plan.</p><p>- Introducing a transformational programme of research and development, to ensure that Ireland is at the cutting edge of scientific and technological innovation in meeting our climate targets. </p><p>- Developing a major drive to realise the immense potential of Ireland's offshore renewables.</p><p>- Devising a systemic programme of sectoral audits of the commercial and industrial sector to underpin, area by area, strategies to meet the new national targets.</p><p>- Expanding and incentivising micro generation, including roof-top solar energy.</p><p>- Developing a new strategy to expand afforestation, particularly Close to Nature Forestry and agro-forestry.</p><p>- Transforming the scale of organics farming, with the delivery of a fair price for farmers at its heart. </p><p>- Building on Ireland's relative carbon efficiency in food production and ensuring the delivery of the measures identified by Teagasc to the fullest extent possible.</p><p>- Delivering an incremental and ambitious reduction in the use of inorganic fertiliser through to 2030. </p><p>- Rapidly evaluating the potential role of sustainable bioenergy. </p><p>- Completing and implementing a major Waste and Circular Economy Action Plan.</p><p>My Department has commenced work on the next iteration of the Climate Action Plan, due to be published in 2021.  As part of this work, modelling inputs will be drawn from the broad spectrum of expertise available to the Government as well as contracted expertise. This work will include examining the expected abatement potential of Programme for Government commitments in relevant sectors, including those in the transport sector, in order to assess how Ireland will be able to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030.</p></reply>

My Department has worked with key State bodies, including the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and Gas Networks Ireland, to ensure they have updated plans in place.</p><p>It is expected that the current rules for trading natural gas across interconnectors with the UK will remain the same. However, in the case of any future gas supply emergency disruption, the UK will no longer be bound by current EU obligations. These obligations include Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 which replaced Regulation (EU) 994/2010 and sets out a range of requirements that apply to EU Member States in relation to the security of gas supply.</p><p>Ireland will continue to meet the &lsquo;N-1&rsquo; infrastructure standard set out in Article 5 of the Regulation on a regional basis with the UK until the end of this year. From 1 January 2021, following the end of the transition period, Ireland will not be in a position to meet the infrastructure standard. However, it should be noted that there will be no adverse impact on security of supply as the same gas infrastructure will remain in place.</p><p>From 1 January 2021, the UK will not be required to provide solidarity to Ireland during natural gas supply disruptions under Article 13 of the Regulation. It should be noted that in order for the UK to provide solidarity to Ireland, agreement on technical, legal and financial arrangements would be required. Similar to the majority of other Member States, such agreement is not yet in place. The absence of solidarity will therefore not lead to a reduction in natural gas security of supply from the current position.</p><p>Ireland continues to work with our EU partners in the negotiations with the UK to ensure continued future cooperation on natural gas security of supply.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. As of 27 October, design work is complete or on-going in target townlands across 25 counties and steady progress is being made with over 118,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year.</p><p>Given that the contracted delivery of the National Broadband Plan State led intervention is over a 7 year period and the nature of the works involved in delivering a fibre telecommunications network, it is not possible to provide a detailed timetable on a Townlands basis. NBI provides a facility for any premises within the Intervention Area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website (). In Clare, I can advise that surveys have commenced in the areas of Cratloe, Ballycannan, Ballyglas and Cloghrea and further surveys are due to commence in the areas of Kilkishen before the end of this year. </p><p>This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December in Cork. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 23 October, some 179 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and 59 of theses are now connected with high speed broadband service through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites. In addition, school BCPs will be provided with high speed broadband, for educational use only, through a service provider contract managed by the Department of Education and Skills. To date, 6 schools have been connected with high speed broadband for educational access only. It is anticipated that 275 BCP sites will be connected by the end of the year. Further details can be found at . </p><p>There are a number of BCPs located across County Clare including at Cree Community Centre, Loop Head and Michael Cusack Visitor Centre. A number of schools including Shragh, Ennistymon and Stonehall National Schools are also now connected. Further details can be found at https://nbi.ie/bcp-locations/.  </p></reply>

It is an SME sector, and as such travels agents and tour operators have access to all of the various business supports made available in the July stimulus package and in last month's Budget.    Budget 2021 contains historic levels of State support for the SME sector in the form of wage supports, financial grants and waived commercial rates.  </p>  <p>  In addition, under current Level 5 Covid restrictions, travel agents and tour operators operating from business premises that customers are prohibited or significantly restricted from accessing may be eligible for the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS).  Any queries in relation to the operation of the CRSS should be directed to the Revenue Commissioners. Taken together, I would be hopeful that these significant measures will help safeguard the travel sector throughout the difficult months ahead so that it will be ready to trade fully again when circumstances permit.</p></reply>

In addition, Revenue and the UK Revenue and Customs undertook a joint initiative to introduce a new marker for use in marked fuels, which came into operation in April 2015.  </p><p>The number of samples of Marked Gas Oil drawn and the consequential detections of misused fuel for the years 2018 and 2019 are set out below.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Samples Drawn</th>       <th>Misuse Detections</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>27,875</td>       <td>835</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>33,984</td>       <td>867</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Revenue conducted random National Sampling Programmes in the years 2016 to 2019 to assess the extent of fuel laundering. The results for all 4 years of the sampling programmes to date are summarised in the report of the 2019 programme published at: . </p><p>The 2019 programme involved samples being taken from over 200 randomly selected licenced fuel outlets and transport sector trades. Evidence of misuse of fuel was discovered in only 3 cases.</p><p>The results represent confirmation of the effectiveness of the various measures introduced by Revenue in recent years to enhance compliance in the fuel trade and among users of diesel.  The random sampling programme results do not signify the complete elimination of the illicit trade in fuel. However, they do demonstrate that systematic selling of illicit fuel through retail outlets and its use in the transport sector is negligible.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that it does not measure on an annual basis the level of tax loss due to diesel laundering. By its nature, an illicit activity such as fuel laundering is not something that can be easily assessed or accurately estimated. However, a number of indicators are used to monitor trends in this area and are detailed in the information I have provided to the Deputy. </p><p>Despite the success in combatting the misuse of fuel I am assured by Revenue that combatting such criminality continues to be a priority. Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against cross-border fuel crime and also co-operate with their counterparts in Northern Ireland under the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force. This cooperation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups who operate across jurisdictions and are responsible for much of this criminality.</p></reply>

I also announced in Budget 2021 that warehousing arrangements would be extended to the balance of 2019 income tax and 2020 preliminary tax obligations for the self-assessed taxpayers whose income has been adversely affected by Covid-19 restrictions. </p><p>Businesses that avail of the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; scheme also qualify for a Tax Clearance Certificate if they continue to meet their qualifying obligations &ndash; that is, filing all tax returns and paying other liabilities as they fall due. I should add that taxpayers with non-COVID-19 tax debts which are included in a phased payment arrangement (PPA), can also qualify for tax clearance.</p><p>Revenue adopts a pragmatic approach in circumstances where a taxpayer has payment difficulties and it is important that the taxpayer or their tax agent contacts Revenue as early as possible so that alternative arrangements can be agreed.  </p><p>Tax clearance allows taxpayers to avail of other essential Covid-19 related supports such as the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Stay and Spend Scheme and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) to which the Deputy refers.</p><p>The details of the CRSS are set out in the Finance Bill 2020 and guidelines on the operation of the scheme are available on the Revenue website ( ).  The CRSS is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The support will be available to companies and self-employed individuals who carry on a trade or trading activities from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions, introduced in line with the Living with Covid-19 Plan, with the result that the business is required to prohibit or considerably restrict customers from accessing their business premises.  </p><p>As I have previously indicated, it is not sufficient that the business supplies goods or services to another business that qualifies for the support because, under the Covid restrictions, that other business is required to temporarily close, or significantly reduce, its activity. Each business must satisfy the eligibility criteria in their own right.</p></reply>

The legislation provides that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% in either the turnover of the employer&rsquo;s business or the customer orders received by the employer by reference to the period from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.  </p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in/opt-out&rdquo; basis.  Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.  At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period.  </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the EWSS contains sufficient flexibility to take account of changes in business circumstances and is targeted at employers across all sectors who are most in need of support.  </p>  <p>  For those who may not be eligible for the EWSS, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS), the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.</p></reply>

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. </p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p><p>The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; </p><p>- be without one or both legs; </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  </p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th</sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. I am currently giving consideration to policy and legislative proposals set out by my officials and will seek to progress this issue in the coming weeks.  </p><p>In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p><p>My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. </p><p>While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.</p><p>Finally, I would like to clarify that the Scheme itself is still operating. All persons or charitable organisations that can currently access the Scheme will continue to be able to do so and make claims for tax reliefs and the fuel grant in the normal manner.</p></reply>

The three main retail banks assured the T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar T.D., Minister McGrath and me at meetings in July that they were considering applications and mortgage drawdowns from customers on the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which replaced the TWSS, is to support employers by helping them to continue trade as they deal with risk arising from COVID-19, and this puts employers in a position to retain key staff and ensure the viability of businesses and firms.  </p>  <p>  In respect of the approach of regulated mortgage lenders on new mortgage lending, the Central Bank has advised that it expects all regulated firms to take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customers&rsquo; best interests at all times, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. If mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application, they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.</p>  <p>  However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework, as set out below, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity. Also a loan offer may contain a condition that the lender can withdraw or vary the offer if in the lender&rsquo;s opinion there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial decision for the lender.</p>  <p>  The European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement.  The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>  <p>  Where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal.

Despite the many challenges they faced this year, they have retained their focus and devoted time and effort to their training and preparations for the Championship. The public health advice at this time is to stay at home. Individuals, businesses, community groups and sporting bodies are being asked to continue to suspend their activity in order that we can once again suppress the virus, to save lives and protect the health service.</p>  <p>  In the current circumstances, unfortunately, only a very limited number of national and international sporting matches and events is being permitted to proceed during this period. This approach is part of the Government's efforts to minimise the level of personal contact outside of essential functions such as healthcare and education. </p></reply>

The question regarding the publication of the business case presented to councillors is  also a matter for Dublin City Council.</p><p>In relation to my Department&rsquo;s involvement with the project, the Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund (LSSIF) was launched in 2018 to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects with at least &euro;100m being made available over the period to 2027.  Provisional allocations totalling &euro;77.4m for 25 projects under Stream 2 (construction) of the LSSIF were announced on 10 January 2020. On 13th January additional provisional allocations of &euro;5m for a further 7 projects under Stream <b></b>1 (design) of the LSSIF were announced.</p><p>Dublin City Council made an application for a grant towards the design work associated with the redevelopment of Dalymount Park and the allocations announced in January included a provisional grant under Stream1 of &euro;918,750 towards a portion of the design cost of the stadium. </p><p>The evaluation procedures and guidelines for the LSSIF provide that once provisional allocations are announced, the projects being suggested for funding undergo a further process of due diligence. This process includes a further review of projects including economic appraisals and feasibility studies as appropriate. This has now been completed for the Dalymount project in respect of the application for the design funding.</p><p>As the LSSIF is a new scheme with the first grants only announced earlier this year, it has been necessary to agree an appropriate grant agreement which will protect the State investment and provide clarity in relation to the respective responsibilities to ensure that projects are completed. The finalisation of this grant agreement has involved engagement with the Chief State Solicitors Office who act as my Department's legal advisors in relation to all sports capital grants.  Work in this regard was recently finalised in respect of the Dalymount project and my Department has now requested Dublin City Council to forward details of its solicitor so that legal formalities can be completed.</p><p>The possible sale of Tolka Park is a matter for the owners of the site. In that regard it should be noted that a deed of charge on the property is already in place which would require the owner to seek the approval of my Department before any sale is made.</p><p>In relation to the LSSIF generally, the priority in the short term is on advancing the projects allocated funding in January. While it is not proposed to open the LSSIF for new applications at present, it is planned to review progress on existing grants in 2021 when the question of whether or not it would be appropriate to seek new applications will be considered.</p></reply>

In Level 3 it is not permitted to have any matches or sporting events except for elite and professional sports. Sports training outdoors must be non-contact, in pods of up to 15 people, and training indoors must be on an individual basis only. Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools are permitted to open for individual training only.</p>  <p>  Sport Ireland and the Expert Group on Return to Sport, chaired by an official from my Department, are supporting the sporting bodies to develop and implement COVID-19 protocols in order to practice their activity in a safe way which mitigates the risk of disease transmission. Different activities and sports carry different degrees of risk related to the level of close contact involved. Combat sports with regular close contact carry a higher risk and this risk assessment and associated mitigation measures needs to be reflected in the protocol of the National Governing Body concerned.</p>  <p>  The Expert Group on Return to Sport has developed guidance on indoor individual training in Level 3 and the draft guidelines have been with shared with other relevant Departments. Following completion of the consultation process, it is my expectation that these guidelines can be published within the next few weeks, in sufficient time to be applies under the appropriate level of the Government&rsquo;s Resilience and Recovery plan.</p></reply>

In particular, section 10 of the Act requires all local authorities to include policies to support the provision, or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure including, inter alia, waste recovery and disposal facilities and any ancillary facilities or services in their development plans. This is in order to support sustainable development and the provision of services.</p><p>With specific regard to apartments, my Department issued the <i>Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities (2018) </i>under section 28 of the Act. These Guidelines include a section on design considerations for the provision of refuse storage facilities and note the following:</p><p><i>The following general design considerations should be taken into account in the provision of refuse storage facilities:</i></p><p><i>- Sufficient communal storage area to satisfy the three-bin system for the collection of mixed dry recyclables, organic waste and residual waste.</i></p><p><i>- In larger apartment schemes, consideration should also be given to the provision of separate collection facilities for other recyclables such as glass and plastics</i></p><p>Under planning legislation, the decision as to whether to grant permission on a planning application, with or without conditions, is a matter for the relevant planning authority or the Board on appeal or in the case of a strategic housing development.</p><p>In making decisions on a planning application, a planning authority, or the Board as appropriate, must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received from the public and the statutory consultees, and any relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by my Department.</p></reply>

The Housing Agency provides a central credit assessment service to local authorities and credit checks are undertaken as part of the credit assessment process.  The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis.  Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the statutory credit policy, that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and the lending local authorities. </p>  <p>  As with the previous local authority home loan offerings, the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is available to first time buyers only. This is to ensure the effective targeting of limited resources, and I have no plans to amend this requirement.</p></reply>

Anyone considering travel to Great Britain should also check the latest information from the local authorities there regarding requirements for international passengers arriving in the country.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s restrictions and advice for individuals arriving into the State are also based on the EU 'traffic lights' system. Travellers from 'green' regions can enter the State without being requested to restrict their movements. Travellers from orange, red or grey regions within this classification system, with the exception of certain exempted categories of personnel, are requested to restrict their movements for 14 days. It is expected that it will shortly be possible to disapply this request if passengers from orange regions have a negative PCR test up to 72 hours before arrival. The red or grey status currently applies to Great Britain. Therefore, individuals arriving from Great Britain, including England, are at present subject to the attendant restrictions of the 'traffic lights' system.</p>  <p>  Restrictions imposed on passengers entering a country in the 'traffic lights' system are based on the location of the passenger during the 14 days prior to arrival, not on the airport or seaport of arrival or the point of disembarkation. Currently, passengers arriving into Ireland who have travelled from England should restrict their movements for 14 days. This includes those who may travel from England to an airport or seaport in Northern Ireland in order to transit onward to a final destination in Ireland. </p>  <p>  All passengers travelling to Ireland from overseas, apart from certain limited exceptions, must fill in the COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form before they arrive into the State. This requirement does not apply to those whose journey begins in Northern Ireland, but does apply to those whose journey begins in Great Britain, including England. Passengers who may be travelling to Ireland from England via Belfast must complete the form and can indicate their final destination in Ireland within the fields provided. The COVID-19 Passenger Locator Form is now an online form.</p></reply>

In the absence of these examinations, every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students as possible.</p>  <p>  The process of national standardisation, which forms a key part of the Calculated Grades process, was applied to the information provided by schools in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.  In order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied. It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates of subject percentage marks staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p>  <p>  A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.  In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p>  <p>  The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data, there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year it is approximately 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.    </p>  <p>  While some students will be disappointed at the results they have achieved, this is the case every year when the Leaving Certificate results are published. It may be more difficult for students to understand when they see the estimated mark from the school. </p>  <p>  The appeals process for Calculated Grades was open to students who were disappointed with the Calculated Grades they received in one or more subjects. Students unhappy with the outcome of the above process could invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These scrutineers are independent of my Department. The independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered in the appeals process.  </p>  <p>  In addition, students had the option to register to sit the 2020 written Leaving Certificate exams which are due to commence on 16 November. </p></reply>

This announcement was accompanied by a published document detailing these changes, Assessment Arrangements for Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate Examinations 2021, and forms part of the Roadmap for the Full Return to School.</p>  <p>  These arrangements are designed to take account of the disrupted learning experienced by students during the 2019/20 school year and to factor in for some further possible loss of learning time in the 2020/21 school year as a contingency measure. As the loss of learning through school closures will have affected students&rsquo; engagement with their course of study in different ways, the adjustments put in place will play to students&rsquo; strengths by leaving intact the familiar overall structure of the examinations, while incorporating additional choice. The adjustments were arrived at through discussions between my Department, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and key stakeholders.  </p>  <p>  These changes to the national assessment arrangements have been made with due regard for the principles of equity, fairness and integrity, as these principles apply to assessment and examinations and refer to student to-student, subject-to-subject, and year-to-year comparisons over time. </p>  <p>  The State Examinations Commission (SEC), which has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, intends to operate the 2021 state examinations as normally as possible, with appropriate contingency built in, in line with prevailing public health advice. It is not intended that there would be any change to the length of the written examinations. For subjects where the SEC issues project briefs during the 2020/21 school year, the intention is to issue these at least four weeks earlier than normal. For subjects with course work completion dates typically late in the school year, schools will be asked to submit this coursework two weeks earlier than normal as a contingency measure. In this context teachers are being encouraged to plan and undertake these projects as early as possible in the programme of study. </p>  <p>  Other documents published by the Department to support the return to school include Guidance for Practical Subjects in Post-Primary Schools and Centres for Education and Returning to school: Guidance on learning and school programmes for post primary school leaders and teachers. These documents provide guidance for teachers and schools that is specific to each practical subject area, so that students can be facilitated to actively engage with their learning.  All documentation published is available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool</p>  <p>  The www.gov.ie/backtoschool site also contains information on wellbeing supports for Leaving Certificate students.  This includes a series of supports on managing wellbeing, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, developed by the National Educational Psychological Service, to support students. The webpage has links to more individualised support for students to access, should these be needed. My Department worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  </p>  <p>  Promoting the wellbeing of school communities has been a fundamental element of my Department&rsquo;s overall plan to support a successful return to school as we continue to manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. We know that most students have been happy and relieved to get back to school, reconnect and prepare to re-engage with learning.  The Department is providing for approximately 120 extra posts for guidance to support student wellbeing, recognising the particular importance for this support in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic challenges.  </p></reply>

In that regard, all the contractors who tendered for the contract tendered for the provision of temporary accommodation. The successful tenderer was PJ McLaughlin. </p>  <p>  The temporary accommodation that was installed on site when the main Contractor commenced construction remains on site and is the only accommodation available to the school until the new school building is completed. The provision of this accommodation was an integral part of the tender and the Contract awarded and is not available as a separate sum. </p>  <p>  The value of the Bond put in place at the start of the Contract is &euro;1,062,424 representing 12.5% of the contract amount. The Bond remains in place and will called upon by the school to cover its costs in completing the construction of the new school. The Bondsman has been duly notified. </p>  <p>  The Contractors obligation to complete the works was terminated under Clause 12.1.1(3) of the Public Works Contract in March of this year. Clause 12.1.1(3) of the Contract provides that &ldquo;The Employer may &hellip; terminate the Contractors obligation to complete the Works if &hellip; the Contractor fails to proceed regularly and diligently with the execution of the Works&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  There are no monies owing to the Contractor following the termination notice. </p>  <p>  The school, with funding from my Department, has fully paid the main contractor for all works completed on-site up to the date of the termination of works. </p>  <p>  There is no provision within the Public Works Contract for any compensation to the Contractor following a termination notice. No amounts have been paid or been agreed to be paid in this respect.</p>  <p>  The Contractor continues to periodically send letters and emails to the school and its design team. These are responded to by the school and its design team based on legal advice and with assistance from my Department. </p>  <p>  The Board of Management are in the process of appointing a new Contractor to complete the envelope of the building including finishing the installation of all windows, sealing the roof and making the site safe. It is envisaged that that this Contractor will commence work in November.</p>  <p>  The school's Design Team are also currently working to complete tender documentation in order to hold a tender competition to appoint a Completion Contractor to finish out the building. It is anticipated that the Completion Contractor will be appointed when the work to seal the building has been completed.</p>  <p>  When the new school building is completed and occupied by the school, the school and its design team will make arrangements with PJ McLaughlin to remove the temporary accommodation from the site at that time. </p></reply>

This number excluded students who initially entered for an appeal but later withdrew their application. </p>  <p>  As a result of the process, a total of 18 increased grades were awarded to 18 individual students.  Eleven of these were upgrades following an appeal by the student. A further seven grades were upgraded following quality assurance checks as part of the appeals process which involved checks on the documentation submitted by schools; the entry of that data on to the schools' data collection system; and the subsequent transmission of the data through the various IT systems used in the generation of calculated grades. </p>  <p>  The appeals process was a process review focussed on looking for errors in the transmission and processing of student data through the process.  It was not possible to appeal the information (estimated percentage mark or rank order) provided by the school.  Due to the nature of the Calculated Grades system the professional judgement of the school was outside of the appeals process.  The design of the statistical model and the application of the national standardisation process was also outside of the scope of the appeals process.  </p>  <p>  The CAO were also notified of changes to students&rsquo; results on 16 October. Candidates who are eligible for a new offer as a result of the upgraded mark received following the appeals process will be contacted as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Students unhappy with the outcome of the above process could invoke a separate process to have their appeal reviewed by independent Appeals Scrutineers. These scrutineers are independent of my Department. The independent Appeals Scrutineers will check to ensure the correct procedures were followed throughout the appeals process. The scrutineers will have access to the records and documentation considered in the appeals process. Students who were advised of the results of their appeal on 16 October were also advised that information regarding the next stage of the process was available on the www.gov.ie website. The relevant section of that website stated that the closing date for receipt of completed forms for review by Independent Appeals Scrutineers was 5pm on Friday 23 October 2020. This information, together with further details regarding the Independent Appeals Scrutineers process, was also included under the 'Frequently Asked Questions' section of that website. Details of the process were also available on the Calculated Grades Student Portal.</p>  <p>  Following the conclusion of the appeals processes, students who consider that their case has not been processed correctly can make a complaint to the Ombudsman or, in the case of students under 18 years of age, the Ombudsman for Children.</p>  <p>  Students were also given the opportunity to register for the postponed Leaving Certificate examinations which are due to begin on 16 November.</p></reply>

This allocation of SNAs is to meet the care needs of pupils in 2021 and will enable the establishment of new special classes, creation of new places in special schools, support children in mainstream classes and the transition to the new allocation model for the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  There are currently 16,969 SNAs allocated to schools. The Budget 2021 increase to 18,000 SNAs posts represents an increase of increase of 70% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.</p>  <p>  A new model for allocating SNAs to primary and post primary schools for students in mainstream classes only was to be introduced in the 2020/21 school year as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM).  In light of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis the Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs was deferred until the beginning of the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  Further advice will issue in the course of the 2020/21 school year on the introduction of the frontloaded model with effect from September 2021. This will outline the overall approach, including the professional development and other supports to be made available for schools and teachers.</p>  <p>  The change to a new allocation model was recommended by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in policy advice published in May 2018 entitled the "Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme &ndash; a new School Inclusion Model to deliver the right supports at the right time to students with additional care needs&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  The Review highlighted the important role SNAs play in assisting students with additional care needs to attend school and acknowledged that the scheme is greatly valued by parents, students and schools.  There is evidence of an enduring loyalty and a strong attachment between many schools, students, parents and SNAs.  </p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs. While SNAs are very much valued in the provision of care support, the Review recommended that a more broadly based set of supports was required including therapeutic supports.  </p>  <p>  Under the new model the allocation of SNAs for mainstream classes to primary and post primary schools will be based on the school profile used for the allocation of Special Education Teachers and will not be based on an annual application process, this means that schools will have certainty around their SNA allocation going forward, and it will enable schools to engage SNA&rsquo;s on contracts of employment for a longer duration than is currently possible. SNA will then have more certainty around their tenure of employment and the new model does not change their roles and functions. </p>  <p>  The Review also referenced SNA training. Among the recommendations was the introduction of a national training programme for SNAs currently employed in our schools. Following a public procurement process, University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, were selected to develop and deliver this important educational initiative. UCD&rsquo;s wide-ranging experience and expertise will enable the delivery of a broad-ranging and high-quality programme. This programme will begin in January 2021 with 500 participants in the first year. Priority is being given to SNAs working in School Inclusion Pilot Schools.</p>  <p>  This major educational initiative will enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life. For some SNAs, this programme may present the first opportunity in recent times for them to engage with the theory and research based best practice underlying their role. There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education and Skills.</p></reply>

The changes are effective from 13 October 2020.</p>  <p>  In effect an earnings threshold of &euro;480 per rolling four week period will be used to assess whether or not a self-employed person is substantively employed/unemployed.  Any self-employed person earning below this amount will be considered to be unemployed for the purposes of assessing entitlement to the Pandemic Unemployment Payment. The earnings threshold is aligned with the income disregard currently in place for people in receipt of Disability Allowance. A self-employed person availing of this does not need to seek approval from the Department and they do not need to report these earnings to the Department on a regular basis. They do need to keep a record of all income for the period.</p>  <p>  The earnings threshold approach will be implemented in the first instance by means of self-assessment, with spot checks of a sample of claims by Social Welfare inspectors and ultimately reconciliation with Revenue earnings returns.</p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is available to employees who lost their employment on or after 13 March 2020 as a direct consequence of Covid-19. It is also available to self-employed people whose income from self-employment ceased or reduced as a direct consequence of the pandemic to the extent that they would be available to take up full-time employment. </p>  <p>  The Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment is payable where a person was an employed contributor in the week immediately before he or she ceased to earn an income from the employment concerned. Similarly, a self-employed person must have been in insurable self-employment in the week immediately before the date on which their self-employment income ceased or reduced. It is a long-standing feature of social welfare legislation that individuals who are engaged in employment or self-employment are liable to pay PRSI on those activities. In those circumstances, persons claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Payment should have no difficulty satisfying these conditions.</p>  <p>  In the case of employees, the Department uses earnings data supplied by the Revenue Commissioners for 2019 and 2020 in the case of employees, and 2018 and 2019 in the case of self-employed people. Data is updated as often as practicable, and in the case of employees on a daily basis. </p>  <p>  Where the Department cannot find any record of contributions or earnings in the reference period  (for example because returns have not been filed with Revenue or are filed late) it contacts the people concerned and asks them to submit evidence of employment in the form of recent payslips etc.  When this is received and verified, claims are put into payment as soon as possible. Dedicated teams are in place to follow up on replies as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department is doing everything in its power to process payments efficiently and quickly and, since Level 5 restrictions were introduced, has processed and paid over 100,000 new claimants.  </p>  <p>  It is always the case when processing such a large volume of claims in such a short period that there will be some cases where claims are not paid due to incomplete or missing information or because a person does not satisfy the eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  In general, the numbers concerned are relatively low. This week, for example, 330,000 claims were paid while just 8,600 (just under 3%) were held where the Department  could not validate entitlement using Revenue records or where the information provided by the applicant was incomplete or where it is clear that the applicant does not meet the eligibility criteria.  As I have outlined, the Department has contacted the people concerned and asked them to submit evidence of employment or other information required.  </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The period during which this leave can be taken will be extended from 12 to 24 months so it can be taken up to a child's second birthday or within two years following adoption.  </p>  <p>  There is a necessary lead-in time following the announcement of this extension to facilitate its implementation.  Firstly, legislative change is required by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth which has responsibility for parents leave policy.  This legislation needs to be carefully prepared and drafted before being brought through the Oireachtas, given that it extends a statutory leave entitlement that, in addition to benefitting workers, has implications for employers.</p>  <p>  It will also be necessary for parallel amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) to be drafted and brought through the Oireachtas to provide the legislative basis for the extended payment of benefit.</p>  <p>  In addition, significant changes are required to the Department's systems to administer this extension, including the provision of retrospective entitlement.  This work needs to be undertaken in such a way that is does not compromise existing supports in an environment where there are unprecedented levels of demand on the Department&rsquo;s services due to Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The extra weeks of leave will be made available as soon as the necessary legislation which is being drafted by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is enacted. </p>  <p>  Once the new application and payment system goes live in April, my Department will then process and issue benefit payments - to include backdated payment of benefit as appropriate - in respect of Parents Leave taken from the date of enactment.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The process was unfortunately interrupted by the general election and subsequent change in Government. In addition, it was necessary to put these meetings on hold from March 2020 in the context of the restrictions introduced in an effort to reduce the spread and impact of COVID-19. A number of members travel from outside the jurisdiction and, given the age profile involved, some members would also be categorised as being in the 'at risk' groups identified by public health authorities. </p>  <p>  From our experience to date, it is evident that remote meetings based on the use of technology would present additional challenges for an engagement process as sensitive as this one. </p>  <p>  However, throughout 2020, the members of the Forum have been appraised of developments and updated on any matters related to the Commission of Investigation by the Secretariat to the group. It is the practice and policy of my Department to issue updates and announcements to the Forum and other relevant stakeholders before they are issued more generally. With regard to the Commission of Investigation (Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters) Records, and another Matter, Act 2020, the Forum and other stakeholders were the first to receive news of the Government's support for the development of legislation to address the difficulties and opportunities raised by the Commission, and the subsequent news of the publication of the Bill. </p>  <p>  The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related Matters has now submitted its final report, and I recognise the importance of consultation and dialogue with those who have lived experiences of these institutions.  I have commenced direct engagement with Forum members and other former residents and their advocates. </p>  <p>  The Commission investigated the lived experiences of mothers and children in Mother and Baby institutions and I am acutely aware that this is not simply a historical or legal matter, but that these experiences continue to impact the lives of many women, children and their families today.  I am committed to effective stakeholder engagement on all matters that impact former residents of these institutions. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that a copy of the Collaborative Forum's report was provided by my Department to the Commission of Investigation for its appropriate attention and consideration in the context of its statutory investigation. Now that the Commission has submitted its final report, the Government will be in a position to examine its findings and conclusions and engage with former residents and their advocates in formulating an appropriate State response. The significant work of the Collaborative Forum to identify the priority concerns of those most centrally involved will greatly assist to inform this process. It will also be possible to reconsider the question of publishing the Forum's report, subject to any further advices of the Attorney General.</p></reply>

On-site activity in further and higher education will be minimised so long as these measures are in place. Campuses will remain open to facilitate learners and researchers in accessing laboratories, practicals and apprenticeship training, scheduled library attendance and small group activity on a prioritised basis. With the country being placed on Level 5 of the Plan for Living with COVID for a period of six weeks, it is clear that this will be the case for the remainder of the first semester.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that this is disappointing for students who had hoped to have as much time on campus as possible, however these measures are very important from a public health perspective in controlling the spread of the Coronavirus.</p>  <p>  Responding to these issues is a significant matter of concern for myself and for my colleague the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and we are examining how accommodation providers can be encouraged to show greater flexibility to students during this challenging time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the university sector is already engaging with these issues. I will be continuing to liaise with the sector through the Irish Universities Association to encourage the availability of fair solutions to students in university-owned student accommodation.  The majority of universities have confirmed that students who choose not to take up their accommodation will receive a refund and I have made it clear that I wish to see this principle applied by all universities.</p>  <p>  For students in the private rental market, I am urging providers to be flexible in finding solutions given the circumstances in which students find themselves.  There are, however, no powers available to me under the current legal framework to direct any particular course of action.  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year.  In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached. If this is not possible, students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board.</p>  <p>  I have asked my Department to continue to engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to monitor and report to me on developments on student accommodation issues in order to ascertain whether any further policy response is feasible.</p></reply>

However, as with other policy and legislative reforms, interested parties are welcome to make submissions on this matter.</p>  <p>  The position with regard to gazumping is that instances normally arise where a non-enforceable agreement for the sale of property at a particular price is reached between a vendor and intending purchaser but subsequently the vendor refuses to complete a formal contract and sells the property to another purchaser for a higher price. The non-enforceable relationship between the original parties is preserved by use of the term "subject to contract". </p>  <p>  The problems associated with gazumping were examined in detail by the Law Reform Commission in its 1999 "Report on Gazumping" (LRC 59-1999). The Commission noted that delays arising between the conclusion of negotiations and completion of the formal contract were usually for the benefit of the intending purchaser, e.g. to ensure the availability of funding for that property, or to ascertain if there were any legal difficulties in relation to the title. The Commission concluded that the only practicable reforms were to improve the information available to intending purchasers and to regulate the terms according to which booking deposits are paid and accepted. It did not recommend any specific legislative reforms to the legal framework within which gazumping occurs.  </p>  <p>  The Property Services Regulatory Authority, which was established under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, published a detailed &ldquo;Guide for Users of Property Services Providers in Ireland" which explains the legal position in relation to gazumping and related matters such as payment of deposits and signing of contracts. The Guide is available on the Authority's web site (www.psr.ie). </p>  <p>  I would also like to advise the Deputy that the Property Registration Authority (PRA) is responsible for registering ownership of land in the State. This statutory function is conferred on the PRA under the Registration of Deeds and Title Acts 1964 and 2006. These Acts make provision for the making of more detailed statutory rules setting out the procedures to be followed when registering land. Statutory responsibility for the PRA, and land registration policy, now rests with the Minister and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></reply>

The first window for accepting proposals ran from 14 May 2018 to 30 June 2018. Processing of the proposals from this first window was completed in 2018. A second window for the submission of proposals ran from 20 December 2018 until 8 February 2019.</p>  <p>  The first IHAP round granted permission to 165 beneficiaries. To date, the second round of the IHAP has granted permission to 556 beneficiaries. </p>  <p>  When the IHAP was announced in May 2018, it was envisaged that there would be approximately 530 beneficiaries. In December 2019, the allocation was increased to approximately 740 beneficiaries, of whom 721 have already been approved under the IHAP. It is expected that between the pending applications and review requests, that the revised allocation of 740 beneficiaries will be reached, or possibly exceeded.  </p>  <p>  There are currently around 15 pending applications in respect of approximately 60 beneficiaries and it is expected that these pending applications will include both grants and refusals. The processing of these applications is ongoing however the COVID-19 restrictions have impacted the delivery of normal services to date this year.</p>  <p>  694 proposals in respect of 1672 beneficiaries were deemed incomplete under the first round. Some of those refused under the first round would have made successful proposals under the second round. 552 applications in respect of 1157 beneficiaries have been rejected under the second round as they did not meet the criteria set out in establishing the programme. </p></reply>

I am further informed that the Data Protection Officer in my Department investigated the circumstances surrounding the missing USB stick and the outcome of that investigation was subsequently notified to the DPC.  </p>  <p>  The investigation found that: </p>  <p>  - Despite a thorough search of both premises the missing USB stick was not located.</p>  <p>  - An Post indicated that no USB stick was identified in their Recovery/Reclaim Unit.</p>  <p>  - The USB stick in question was an INTEGREL Courier USB key with hardware encryption. The encryption used with this device is AES 256-bit, which is ISO27001 compliant. </p>  <p>  - The data contained on the USB stick had been uploaded to the Commission&rsquo;s secure system prior to the stick being mislaid. </p>  <p>  As the data contained on the USB stick continued to be available to the Commission and the missing USB stick was encrypted to industry standard, the risk to individuals whose personal data was on the USB stick was evaluated, as required by data protection legislation, and found to be low.  Any third party finding the USB stick would be unable to access any information contained therein.  In circumstances where the USB stick&rsquo;s technical protection measures (i.e. encryption) rendered the data unintelligible, there was no reason to notify the data subjects. I understand that the details of the investigation were notified to the DPC and that, in mid-June 2019, the DPC notified my Department that the breach was closed.</p>  <p>  I regret the upset and anger caused by the breach and in particular I regret that those concerned found out about it through the media.   To avoid this occurring and as a courtesy, those concerned should have been notified of the data breach at the time that it occurred. I have written to them to express my regret about what happened. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the use of USB keys by my Department, I wish to inform you that my Department&rsquo;s policy in relation to the use of USB sticks is strictly controlled and it is not common practice for sensitive data to be stored in such a manner. In exceptional circumstances where they must be used, my Department uses dedicated encrypted USB keys.</p></reply>

The central focus of the response to COVID-19 has been to control the spread of the virus in so far as possible to protect those who are most vulnerable from infection, as well as protecting against causes, situations, circumstances, and behaviours that may lead to the spread of COVID-19.</p>  <p>  Sustained communication and interagency cooperation also remain central to the response to COVID-19. The State&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to the public health emergency created the need for the HSE to set up a structured nursing home support system in line with NPHET recommendations.  This package of supports has been a critical intervention in supporting the resilience of the sector in meeting the unprecedented challenges associated with COVID-19. Guidance, PPE, staffing, serial testing, infection prevention and control training, accommodation and financial support have been provided to the nursing home sector, both public and private. In addition, multi-disciplinary clinical supports are in place at CHO level through 23 COVID-19 Response Teams as well as outbreak control teams responding to outbreaks.  </p>  <p>  It remains a legal obligation that every provider ensures that the number and skill mix of staff within its nursing home is appropriate having regard to the needs of the residents and the size and layout of the nursing home concerned. HIQA has published a regulatory assessment framework of the preparedness of designated centres for older people for a COVID-19 outbreak. Under this framework the provider should ensure that they have contingency plans in place, that their contingency plan is based on national guidance from the HSE, HPSC and Government and that it is reviewed regularly to include clear contingency arrangements, including,  to establish surge capacity and arrangements to address potential staffing shortage. </p>  <p>  In addition, as part of a package of support measures for nursing homes, a COVID-19 Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme was established.  This opened for applications on 17th April 2020. The core concept of the scheme is that the State will provide additional funding to those nursing homes that require it, to contribute towards costs associated with COVID-19 preparedness, mitigation and outbreak management. Eligible costs include both additional payroll and non-payroll COVID-19 related costs. The scheme was originally devised to operate for a 3-month period to the end of June, this scheme was extended to the end of September. The scheme is now being further extended to the end of 2020 and for the first 6 months of 2021 (end June 2021).</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts.

Weddings and funerals are exceptions and can continue at every level with limited numbers. </p><p>Churches and other places of worship can remain open for private prayer. It is also important to note that at all levels, Ministers of Religion are permitted to travel to perform a service on-line, to minister to the sick, and conduct a funeral or wedding ceremony.

I know that that includes many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19. Indeed, as the Deputies will be aware, the Taoiseach met with the leaders of the Catholic Church last week to consider the range of issues relating this matter.</p><p>Finally, the Deputies will wish to note that comprehensive guidelines are in place to ensure that religious services can take place safely when<b></b>they recommence: </p></reply>

I am therefore working with my Government colleagues to ensure that we are providing the most appropriate supports to help sustain carers in their caring role. To this end, my colleague Minister Butler in her capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health and Older People, held a roundtable with family carers on 15th September to hear about their experience as carers and how we can best support them in their caring role, in particular, given the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>It should be noted that under the existing National Carers' Strategy, a range of measures have been introduced or extended by my Department to support family carers in recent years. Since September 2018, free GP visit cards have been extended to persons in receipt of the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. The Programme for Government commits to further extending this service to recipients of the Carer's Support Grant.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to delivering a &lsquo;Carers Guarantee&rsquo; that will provide a core basket of services to carers across the country, regardless of where they live. This commitment is consistent with the National Carers' Strategy, which seeks to support family carers to care with confidence through the provision of adequate information, training, services and supports. In line with this commitment, &euro;2 million has been allocated in Budget 2021 to provide a more standard package of supports to family carers in every region. The specific measures to be introduced will be determined through service level agreements between the HSE and relevant service providers.</p><p>Financial supports for family carers such as Carer's Allowance fall under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  In the region of &euro;1.2 billion is expected to be provided to family carers in 2020 through Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit, Carer's Support Grant and Domiciliary Care Allowance payments.</p><p>The HSE and disability representative bodies recognise that people with disabilities want their services resumed as quickly as possible. However, it may not be possible to restore services in exactly the same way as they operated previously, because of the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and the need to continue to protect people from infection risk. The HSE&rsquo;s <i>A Safe Return to Health Services</i>outlines a three phased approach to the return of health and social care services.  This plan has ensured that short-stay residential and emergency/residential respite have begun to re-open since July and August. Activity will increase further in the next two phases, i.e., September &ndash; November and December 2020 to February 2021.  <s></s></p><p>In line with the Governments Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery Framework (2020 &ndash; 2021), the HSE regards the provision of disability services as essential to maintaining a response to people with a disability, in the same way that schools and creches are. It is important to note that Government&rsquo;s intention is that disability services will remain open at each level of the Resilience and Recovery Framework, subject to public health guidance.</p><p>The additional funding secured by my Department for disability specialist services in Budget 2021 will include provision for additional respite services for people with a disability and their families next year, which will be of assistance to grandparents who are carers of children with special needs. </p><p>To address the health-specific needs of family carers themselves, the HSE has developed a family carer&rsquo;s support page on its website at . In addition, Family Carers Ireland, which receives funding from the State, operates a freephone helpline for family carers (1800 24 07 24).</p></reply>

COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the Government's Framework are based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. </p><p>At level 5 of the Plan, unfortunately, this means closing many businesses and amenities to reduce the person-to-person contacts which allow the virus to spread.

The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027.</p>  <p>  In the context of the current COVID-19 Pandemic response, the HSE advised on 22 June 2020 that an additional 324 acute beds have opened since March, bringing the current total of acute beds in the system to 11,597. </p>  <p>  In addition, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) agreed to support the marginal costs of funding additional beds to the end of December 2020 at a cost of &euro;24 million.

The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet this and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds. </p>  <p>  A proportion of these beds will be funded as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. </p>  <p>  At the start of the year, permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland stood at 255 beds, according to the National Office of Clinical Audit. This included 204 Level 3 ICU beds and 51 Level 2 HDU beds.  As part of the initial response to the pandemic, funding was provided for an additional 40 adult critical care beds in March 2020 as well as two paediatric beds. The HSE has advised that between 280 and 285 critical care beds are currently open, with the number open any given day subject to fluctuation in respect of available staff and other operational considerations. </p>  <p>   Where necessary, the number of critical care beds can surge beyond the baseline of 280-285 as part of an emergency response. However, it is essential to understand that the use of surge capacity for critical care is necessarily tied to a reduction of services in other areas of the hospital. Moreover, the clinical advice is clear that the greater the reliance on surge ICU capacity, the greater the clinical risk with potential impact on patient outcomes.</p>  <p>   Our critical care units have coped well so far, largely due to the fact that the curve was flattened successfully in early stages. As a result, our outcomes for Covid patients in ICU have compared well with other jurisdictions including the UK.</p>  <p>   Budget 2021 will allocate funding totalling &euro;52m in 2021 to critical care. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 42 critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis this year and add significant new capacity. Funded adult critical care beds will increase to 321 by end 2021, an increase of 66 over the baseline number of 255 funded beds in 2020. Funding for 2021 will also include money to allow for the development of a workforce plan as well as education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce.</p>  <p>  This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review which found that an additional 2,100 inpatient acute beds were required, in a reform scenario, by 2031. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.</p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Vaccines are being administered via GPs and pharmacists, as in previous years. </p>  <p>  This season, 1.95 million doses of influenza vaccine have been purchased, double the amount administered last season. The HSE has procured 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV), made available to all persons in an at-risk group and aged from 6 months up. In addition, the HSE has purchased 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and is being made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.  </p>  <p>  This expanded programme will ensure that those most vulnerable to the effects of influenza will have access without charges.  This is in line with the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and represents a significant step forward in providing vaccination without charges. </p>  <p>  International markets for influenza vaccine are extremely tight this year, and in Ireland this resulted in deliveries from the manufacturer taking longer than intended. However, the full quantity of vaccine ordered has now been received. Vaccines are distributed in two-week cycles. 950,000 doses of the injected vaccine have already been distributed to GPs, pharmacists, and healthcare settings.  This is 10% more than the amount distributed at the same time in 2019 and is equal to almost the full amount administered in the 2019/20 season. The quantities distributed to GPs and pharmacists has been based on the orders from the same sources last year, in order to ensure an equitable distribution. The remaining 400,000 doses will be distributed to GPs and pharmacists in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Given the difficult international market for flu vaccines this year, it is unlikely that any further increase in supply will be possible. Demand for vaccination this year is unprecedented.  This is the case across Europe and beyond.  Given the finite supply available, it is important that even the increased quantities available in Ireland are targeted where they will have the greatest impact.  </p>  <p>  The new nasal (LAIV) influenza vaccine programme for children is well underway across the country. A high uptake of the vaccine in children has been shown to reduce the spread of influenza, helping to protect others in the community. The full quantity of LAIV ordered has also now been received and is being distributed to GPs and pharmacists.</p>  <p>  Given the importance of increasing the level of uptake of the flu vaccine this year, GPs and pharmacists are incentivised not only to deliver vaccination to the expanded groups, but to actively seek out relevant patients and deliver vaccinations in a programmatic way, such as through dedicated flu vaccination clinics. The fees payable by the HSE to GPs and pharmacists for vaccine administration have been set in recognition of logistical challenges and possible need to establish vaccination clinics.</p></reply>

The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. </p>  <p>  People who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations. </p></reply>

The Code prohibits the hunting of foxes where the animal is injured and advocates the humane disposal of a fox when captured.  The code also takes into account local concerns and the concerns of the landowner(s) on whose land hunting takes place.  </p><p>My Department has no plans to change the existing legislation. </p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone.</p><p>A Policy Directive was issued by the Minister to the independent Licensing Authority for Sea Fishing Boats under Statute and was intended to give effect to the measures announced by the then Minister. As stated above, this Policy Directive provided that vessels over 18m LOA (Length Overall) will be excluded from trawling activity inside six nautical miles, including inside the baselines, from 1 January 2020. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels.</p><p>A Judicial Review was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy. An unapproved judgement was issued on 31 July 2020 and the key points to come out of that Judgement is that while the applicants did not succeed on four of the five grounds of challenge, the challenge was made against the entire Policy Directive 1 of 2019 and was successful. </p><p>The findings on the grounds of challenge were: </p><p>1. The Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was not ultra vires, </p><p>2. The Directive did not impinge the applicants constitutional rights.</p><p>3. Given the impact on the applicants there was a particular duty on the Minister to provide a fuller explanation and engage in further talks with the applicants. On this ground the applicants succeeded.</p><p>4. The policy directive was not disproportionate to what was to be achieved.</p><p>5. The Policy directive did not breach EU law. </p><p>On 6<sup></sup>October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect.</p><p>The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them once a preferred option had been identified.</p><p>I am currently considering, on an urgent basis, the implications of the judgment in consultation with my legal advisors.</p><p>I should advise the Deputy that I am committed to the sustainability of fishing in Irish waters and the commitment made in our Programme for Government that inshore waters continue to be protected for smaller fishing vessels and pair trawling be prohibited inside the six-mile limit. </p></reply>

The four headings funded through the Rural Regeneration and Development allocation are (i) RRDF major projects (ii) RRDF Seed Funding (iii) Town and Village Renewal and (iv) the Outdoor Recreational Infrastructure Scheme.</p><p><b>RRDF Major Projects (Category 1)</b>supports ambitious and strategic projects that can drive sustainable rural regeneration and development. Funding is awarded through a competitive assessment process. All projects must be collaborative, involving more than one body, and with clear community support and engagement. Grants awarded have been in the range of &euro;0.5 million to &euro;10 million, enabling large scale investment with long term benefits for rural economies and communities. </p><p><b>RRDF Seed Funding (Category 2)</b>generally provides smaller grant funding to enable the development of project proposals suitable for future applications to the RRDF Major Projects strand. Funding can be provided towards the cost of project development, including for technical or expert assistance. Issues that may need to be addressed could include land ownership/title, planning and design work, value for money assessment, and procurement. This funding aims to ensure that early stage project ideas generated at local level can progress into fully developed and costed proposals. </p><p><b>The Town and Village Renewal Scheme </b>covers a range of projects to support and rejuvenate rural towns and villages. It is administered by Local Authorities on behalf of my Department and projects are developed in consultation with town/village community and business interests.  </p><p>Funding can be provided for a wide range of interventions including public-realm projects, town centre enhancements, encouraging town centre living, and economic development projects. Applications for funding are submitted to DRCD by local authorities. The scheme has an annual budget of &euro;15m, with &euro;25m available in 2020 due to an additional &euro;10m from the July Stimulus Package. </p><p><b>LEADER Programme:</b>Under the LEADER Programme, &euro;250 million in grant aid is available to rural communities and businesses. This is provided to projects focused on economic and enterprise development, job creation, social inclusion and supporting the rural environment. Funding is allocated to 28 sub-regional areas based on administrative or county boundaries. Interested parties should contact their Local Action Group (LAG) through its Implementing Partner to discuss the eligibility of the project and the funding that may be available. A full list of LAGs is available on </p><p><b>The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme</b>(ORIS) provides funding for the development of new and existing outdoor recreational infrastructure in rural areas such as cycleways, walking trails, blueways and mountain access routes. </p><p><i>Other Rural Supports:</i></p><p><b>The Community Enhancement Programme </b>provides small capital grants to community groups to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas. The CEP is administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs), with support from the local authorities.</p><p><b>The Local Improvement Scheme</b>provides funding for improvements to private and non-publicly maintained roads. Such roads can lead to multiple residences, farmland or amenities like lakes, rivers or beaches.</p><p><b>CL&Aacute;R</b>is an investment programme for small-scale infrastructural projects in depopulated rural areas. CL&Aacute;R supports the development of identified areas by attracting people to live and work there<b>. </b></p><p><b>The Community Services Programme</b>provides local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model, providing a contribution towards the cost of staff in these organisations. It meets local service gaps and provides services and facilities that would not be available otherwise. The Expression of Interest (EOI) application process is currently closed but it is expected that the Programme will open targeted calls to address identified gaps in service delivery in 2021. </p><p>My Department has also provided funding for Tidy Towns groups and Agricultural Shows in recent years.</p><p>All programmes delivered by my Department are open to applications from eligible parties during the relevant application timeframes set for each programme.  Public Participation Networks and Local Community Development Committees are useful first ports of call for community groups interested in accessing community development funding. It is anticipated that these funding streams and supports will continue and will be available in 2021 and full details of how to register or apply for financial assistance under these programmes can be obtained on my Department's website [www.gov.ie/drcd] together with more detailed information on all programmes delivered by my Department.</p></reply>

The current 2014-2020 LEADER programming period concludes in December 2020.  </p><p>Proposals for new regulations for the CAP 2021-2027 were launched in June 2018 by the European Commission.  However, given the protracted nature of discussions on the post-2020 CAP and on the wider EU Budget at EU level, there has been a delay in adopting these proposals<b>.  </b>This means that the next LEADER programme will not commence until January 2022 at the earliest.</p><p>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme.  The objective of this commitment is to allow local-led rural development projects to be delivered under a Transitional Programme until the new EU programme commences.</p><p>The European Commission has published proposals for transitional measures to allow for continuity between the programming periods.  The Commission's proposals are still under discussion at EU level and there are a number of issues yet to be resolved, including the duration of the transitional period.  </p><p>Nonetheless, I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the details of a Transitional LEADER Programme for Ireland, to come into effect in 2021. Details of the funding available to the Local Action Groups which implement LEADER locally will be made available when the Transitional Programme is announced. </p><p>An extra &euro;4 million has been provided for LEADER in Budget 2021, to bring the total allocation for next year to &euro;44 million.  The allocation will be used to fund a combination of existing projects as they come to completion, as well as for new projects to be approved under the Transitional Programme and to support the administration costs of Local Action Groups in closing out the existing programme and delivering the Transitional Programme.</p><p>It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years, depending on the nature and scale of the projects concerned.  In this context, costs related to projects under the Transitional Programme are also likely to be met from the provision in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2022 and 2023.</p></reply>
