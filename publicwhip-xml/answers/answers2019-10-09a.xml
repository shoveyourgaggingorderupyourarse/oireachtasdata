    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-09a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100900070#WRA00700"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, on 28 June, the EU concluded negotiations for an Association Agreement with Mercosur after nearly 20 years and 40 rounds of talks which would mark the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date.</p>  <p>  The Agreement will see a significant reduction, or elimination, of tariffs and barriers to trade which will allow an increased flow of trade and investment between Ireland, the EU and the Mercosur region, potentially increasing the demand for Irish products and the jobs that supports.</p>  <p>  As with every Free Trade Agreement, Ireland had "defensive" as well as "offensive" interests. The Agreement with Mercosur presents sectoral opportunities for Ireland across a wide range of sectors.  On the other hand, I was always keenly aware of the potential impact that this Agreement could present to the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector. In that regard, Ireland, along with a number of other Member States, asserted early on in the negotiations that these agricultural sensitivities - and beef in particular - must be fully considered in the negotiations.  Ireland has also continually highlighted the cumulative impact of agricultural market access in relation to all EU trade agreements. </p>  <p>  Our concerns have been raised at all political levels, including by myself and my officials raising the issues with counterparts, both at Trade Council of Ministers, and bilaterally with the EU Commission, and with my Member State counterparts. For example, in my discussions with fellow Trade Ministers, including from Germany, at the EU Council just last Tuesday, I reminded colleagues that while the Mercosur Agreement offers clear geopolitical and economic opportunities the beef tariff rate quota presents difficulties for Ireland given the current economic viability challenges faced by our primary producers.</p>  <p>  I had previously written to the EU Trade Commissioner in May this year on beef &ndash; an offensive demand from the Mercosur side &ndash; identifying the very tight parameters that should obtain in terms of volume, the phasing-in periods, quota monitoring, quota composition, robust checks at point of import regarding "SPS" and food safety issues.  Additionally, An Taoiseach also wrote to the Commission in June to highlight our particular sensitivities in these negotiations, together with the leaders of France, Poland and Belgium.</p>  <p>  We have also engaged on these issues throughout the negotiating period through the Trade Policy Committee in Brussels, as well as joining with other Member States in formally writing to the Commission outlining our specific concerns. </p>  <p>  I might add that as recently as July this year I held a bilateral meeting with The State Secretary at the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, Ms. Claudia Dorr-Voss, where once again I outlined Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding the potential impact of the Mercosur Agreement on Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector.</p></reply>

As recognised in Future Jobs, increasing female participation is a vital way to grow the diversity and strength of our indigenous business sector. </p>  <p>  My Department, and the Government as a whole, continue to monitor and assess the number of women in business. While I welcome Ireland&rsquo;s recent improvement to 5th from 8th in Europe for the rate of female entrepreneurship in the 2018 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Report, there is more we can achieve. My Department with Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) have introduced a number of initiatives to increase female participation in business, such as EI's female-only Competitive Start Up Fund and female specific training and mentoring run by the LEOs.  Enterprise Ireland has also developed a series of female accelerator programmes in partnership with knowledge providers such as Going for Growth and the National Digital Research Centres (NDRC) Female Founders Programme.</p>  <p>  This spotlight on female entrepreneurship resulted in a doubling in the proportion of EI female-led high-potential startups from 11% in 2011 to 28% in 2017. </p>  <p>  I have asked EI to bring forward a new Female Entrepreneurship Strategy by the end of this year. This new strategy will have a specific focus on addressing barriers to women in business including attitudes to risk, access to finance, networking opportunities and visible role models. </p>  <p>  The new strategy will include initiatives to support women progressing to senior levels in business and to improve the broader entrepreneurship policy environment for women. The strategy will also target an increase in the numbers of ambitious female led companies that scale in international markets and increasing the numbers of female founded high potential start-ups.</p></reply>

That is why I led the development of the Regional Enterprise Plans, which are enterprise focused strategies that are the result of a refresh and refocus of the Regional Action Plans for Jobs to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020.  The refreshed North-West Regional Enterprise Plan launched on the 25th February 2019.</p>  <p>  In 2018, companies supported by Enterprise Ireland in Sligo employed 1,917 people, a 7% increase on the 2017 employment figure. Enterprise Ireland is actively working with companies with global ambition in Sligo to drive competitiveness, innovation and market diversification.  In 2018 there were record growth levels in employment in every region which saw 61% of employment growth occurring outside of Dublin, bringing total employment in Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in the regions to 64%, another record high.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also works with the Institutes of Technology to support entrepreneurship in the regions. A total of 7 new companies from Sligo IT recently participated in the Enterprise Ireland New Frontiers Programme and it is expected that these will progress to either Enterprise Ireland or the Local Enterprise Offices for further support and development.</p>  <p>  In 2018, the Local Enterprise Office (LEO) in Sligo had 236 clients which supported 920 jobs in the county.  </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland markets County Sligo as part of the North-West region which includes Leitrim and Donegal. I am pleased that all three counties have seen net job gains with FDI employment in the North-West region increasing by 3% between 2017 and 2018.   There are a total of 2,251 people employed across 23 IDA clients companies in Sligo.  </p>  <p>  The IDA continues to work hard to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in Sligo. As part of the pilot phase of its Regional Property Programme in 2016, the IDA constructed an Advanced Technology Building in Sligo and successfully secured Abbott Ireland as a tenant.</p>  <p>  Through my Department's Regional Enterprise Development Fund, Sligo County Enterprise Fund were approved for &euro;1.9m for a development in Strandhill.  The project focuses on the development of the Strand Campus to operate as a leading location for entrepreneurs in digital gaming and associated tech sectors, providing holistic support for start-up, innovation and growth.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-09a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100900070#WRA01900"><p>The Government is committed to supporting job creation and investment in the regions, including in County Sligo and the North-West as a whole. We are determined to ensure that employment and investment are distributed as evenly as possible across the country and we have set ambitious targets in pursuit of that goal.</p>  <p>  A "Landing Space" in Sligo was opened in November 2018 as a partnership between IDA Ireland, IT Sligo and Sligo County Council. It provides open plan, turnkey office space in Sligo City for companies who wish to quickly and effectively establish operations in the North-West region. The addition of this fast landing space has boosted Sligo's attractiveness to multinational companies and is a selling point for the area from a wider enterprise perspective. </p>  <p>  County Sligo has also benefited from the IDA's Regional Property Programme (RPP), with the construction of an Advanced Technology Building there in 2017. The IDA successfully leased this facility to Abbott, leading to the creation of valuable new jobs for the area. Abbott's presence in Sligo also serves as another endorsement of the County's potential and should help to attract further foreign direct investment to the North West. </p>  <p>  My Department and the IDA are determined to build on this success. That is why the second phase of the RPP includes plans for further facilities in Sligo. The IDA has already obtained planning permission for an Advanced Office Building and its construction is scheduled to begin at the end of this year. In addition, the Agency will construct an Advanced Technology Building in Sligo with construction expected to start at the beginning of 2020. Once the first and second phases of the RPP are completed, a total of three buildings will have been constructed in Sligo by the IDA. I am confident that these will stimulate further investment and job creation for the County and the wider North-West region.</p>  <p>  There are other grounds for optimism that Sligo will continue to experience FDI-driven job growth, not least the number of recent job announcements there. For example, Allstate Sales Group chose Sligo as their first location outside of the US with plans to create 100 new jobs. GW Plastics has announced plans to expand its existing operations at Finisklin, which will create 200 new positions. These investments are a great vote of confidence in Sligo and they build on our commitment under the North-West Regional Enterprise Plan to boost investment and job creation for the region.</p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities in Sligo, the Government remains determined to achieve more. Our work will therefore continue, across Government, to further unlock the economic potential of the County.</p></reply>

These include facilities like Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard,  and the Customs Insight course, which offers businesses dealing with customs for the first time a resource for the key customs concepts, documentation and processes they will need to operate in a post-Brexit environment. </p>  <p>  Direct supports to businesses, including EI supports like the Be Prepared Grant, as well as those available through the Local Enterprise Offices and InterTradeIreland, are demand-driven and available funding can be adjusted to ensure ongoing coverage.in the first 6 months of 2019, some 43% of the most exposed EI clients received grant aid.</p>  <p>  Other supports and schemes available are limited by the availability of funding. Of the &euro;300m fund made available for the Brexit Loan Scheme, &euro;44.1 million in loans have been sanctioned as at 04 October 2019 to help businesses to mitigate their Brexit exposure. However, it should be noted that there is a large pipeline of businesses, with 833 applications to the SBCI, who have not yet progressed to the bank - loans sanctioned amount to just under a third of the net total of eligibility approvals.  This is also the case for the &euro;300 million Future Growth Loan Scheme, which has had 1445 applications sanctioned as at 04 October 2019 - but more than 75% approved.</p>  <p>  With the 31 October fast approaching, I  encourage businesses to consider the range of supports available to them and to take advantage of those they feel are appropriate. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-09a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100900070#WRA02500"><p>I, and my Department, understand the importance of remote and flexible working and the potential of new digital technologies to support well-paid employment in all parts of the country.  As the nature of work and society changes, the way we organise work is also changing.  A labour market which offers flexible working solutions can result in tangible benefits for employers, employees and wider society. </p>  <p>  With cities becoming increasingly crowded leading to scarce accommodation and increased commutes, remote work is an intervention with the potential to lessen accommodation pressures and support the transition to a greener economy.  Remote work also has the potential to stimulate regional growth and to widen the talent pool in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Harnessing this potential is a key focus of Pillar 4 of the Government's Future Jobs Ireland initiative.  This Pillar is focussed on increasing participation in the labour force and more equitable, balanced and sustainable development of Ireland&rsquo;s workforce.  As part of this, my Department is conducting research on remote working to understand the prevalence and types of remote working arrangements within the Irish workforce and the attitudes towards such arrangements.</p>  <p>  The research will also be informed by the inputs from a Remote Working Consultation Forum that I hosted in Cavan Digital Hub in July and which was attended by key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  During February and March this year, I launched nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, including the new Regional Enterprise Plan for the Mid-West region, which covers Clare, Limerick and Tipperary.</p>  <p>  The Regional Enterprise Plan for the Mid-West, which includes Co. Clare has as one of its Strategic Objectives to create and roll-out a regionally co-ordinated co-working Smart e-Hub network, bringing talent and space together. The aim is to build on the region&rsquo;s value proposition as a location of choice to live and work and is led by the local authorities in Clare, Limerick and Tipperary, working in partnership with community groups such as the IFA, ICA, Community Enterprise Centres, LEADER etc and Education and Training Boards. </p>  <p>  The project complements work already undertaken by local authorities and existing hubs. One of these new projects is Digiclare, a new initiative of Clare County Council as part of its Rural Development Strategy to support rural communities by providing flexible, affordable and local office facilities and high-speed broadband connectivity in rural locations in County Clare. In March 2018, the first three digital hubs in Kilrush, Feakle and Miltown Malbay were opened. Over the next 12 months, a digital hub will be developed in Ennis, including a hot desk facility and incubation units. A multi-service centre incorporating a digital hub and other social/community services is planned for development in Ennistymon.</p>  <p>  Hubs and remote/co-working space in general will play an integral role in revitalising towns and villages in every region of the country.</p></reply>

A total of 17,000 more people in the South-East are in employment in Q2 2019 than in Q1 2015 when the Regional Action Plan for Jobs started and unemployment in the South East has reduced from 11.7 percent to 8.1 percent in the same period. </p>  <p>  While we have had great success through the Action Plan for Jobs in reducing unemployment, in the context of Brexit and other global challenges, we need to also focus on the creation of quality and sustainable jobs. Future Jobs Ireland is our plan to meet these challenges. Launched last March, it includes ambitious targets and actions to drive this transformation of our economy. </p>  <p>  In the South East, there are 15,580 people employed across 76 IDA Ireland client companies in 2018. This is an increase of almost 7% over 2017. The IDA will continue to work to identify opportunities for new investment or expansion in the South-East, promoting the region's strengths including the existing concentrations of financial services, IT and high-value manufacturing activities. </p>  <p>  In 2018, there were 25,278 people employed in EI supported companies in the South-East, up 5% from 2017. 'Powering the Regions' is Enterprise Ireland's new regional plan which sets out the focus of its activities in each region, including a specific strategy for the South East. There was a net increase of 461 jobs supported by the five South East LEOs during 2018.</p>  <p>  I launched the South-East Regional Plan last March in Waterford, with Strategic Objectives focused on: building enterprise resilience; marketing the region; a regional engagement strategy on key infrastructure priorities; ensuring the South East is a learning region; and tourism growth.</p>  <p>  The Government has put several funding streams in place to support regional development, and the South-East has seen a number of successes, including under my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). Under the REDF to date, the South-East region has secured total funding of over &euro;10 million. In June 2019, I announced a further &euro;45m Call 3 of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) and it is my intention that the successful projects will be announced before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Guided by the Regional Enterprise Plan, and with all regional stakeholders working together, the South-East is well positioned to realise its enterprise potential and see better quality, sustainable jobs and investment.</p></reply>

Attracting more foreign direct investment (FDI), and supporting the growth and expansion of overseas firms already located here, is an important part of that. Our country is performing very strongly in terms of FDI and we are looking for that to continue into 2020 and beyond, with a particular focus on increasing the spread of investment across Ireland.</p>  <p>  2018 was a record year for FDI and FDI-driven employment in Ireland. Every region experienced FDI employment gains, with over 132,000 people, 58% of total supported jobs, now employed in approximately 700 IDA client companies located outside of Dublin. Some 56% of all net new FDI jobs created last year were outside Dublin, which represents the highest number of people employed by IDA clients outside of Dublin in the history of the Agency.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted FDI only forms one part of investment,  indigenous enterprise and the role of enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices are also responsible for significant employment growth. </p>  <p>  As for Carlow in particular, it has experienced a year-on-year increase in FDI employment since 2011. In fact, there has been a twofold increase in employment by IDA client companies during that period. Last year alone, the number of IDA supported jobs in the County increased by 31% with 275 net new jobs added.</p>  <p>  A key recent FDI development in Carlow was the beginning of the construction of MSD&rsquo;s second manufacturing facility in the County. The new facility will focus on the production of vaccines and biologics and will create up to 170 new jobs. This expansion reflects Carlow's appeal to overseas investors and bodes well for future investment in the area.</p>  <p>  The County will also benefit from the IDA's Regional Property Programme. The IDA has acquired a 12.6 hectare site at Rathnapish, Carlow Town and will shortly submit planning permission for the construction of an Advanced Technology Building there. I am confident that this new facility, once completed, will help attract further investment to the County.</p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the IDA will continue to engage with its clients to identify further opportunities for new investment in Carlow and the South-East. The region is very well positioned to attract further FDI and the IDA is actively working with all stakeholders in the region in support of that goal.</p></reply>

My Department through the LEOs, has continued to promote the importance of local businesses preparing for Brexit, and has developed a range of supports to help them achieve this. The LEOs are working vigorously to enable companies to consolidate market share within the UK and to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets. I am pleased to say that as part of Budget 2019, the LEOs were provided with an additional capital funding of &euro;5 million in 2019 to enable the LEO network to ramp up its supports, in light of Brexit, to drive improvements, providing companies with mentorship and training programmes to prepare for any kind of Brexit. In particular the LEO network focused on promoting its core programmatic and soft supports for its client companies and individuals requesting Brexit related assistance.</p>  <p>  Those core offerings were comprised of:</p>  <p>  - The Brexit Mentoring Programme</p>  <p>  - The Prepare Your Business for Customs Workshops</p>  <p>  - The Online Customs Insights course from Enterprise Ireland</p>  <p>  - The LEAN for Micro programme from Enterprise Ireland </p>  <p>  - The Technical Assistance for Micro-Exporters (TAME) Grant</p>  <p>  LEOs offer Priming Grants to support business start-up costs have seen an increase year on year which shows entrepreneurial activities continue to increase in the country regardless of the uncertainty that Brexit provides. With the direct grant aid and Brexit supports available it puts entrepreneurial activities in a strong position to the lead up of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office is the First Stop Shop for anyone seeking information and support on starting or growing a business in Ireland.  The LEOs were established to offer direct grant aid to microenterprises which have the potential to develop into strong export entities.  </p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that there is a strong pipeline of young and emerging entrepreneurial talent in the country right now.  I had the pleasure on 15th September last to present awards at Google's European Headquarters in Dublin to some of our finest young entrepreneurs from all parts of the country whom took part in the Ireland's Best Young Entrepreneur (IBYE) competition, which is now in its fifth year.   The programme, which is run by the network of Local Enterprise Offices has gone from strength to strength, attracting over 1,600 applicants in 2019, which is well on a par with previous years. I recommend that you take a look at the IBYE website to gain a clearer picture of how promising the future of entrepreneurship in Ireland looks at this time.  </p>  <p>  Clearly, Brexit is as much a challenge to microenterprises as it is to any other sized enterprise.  Nevertheless, I am pleased to say that there has been strong and meaningful engagement throughout 2019 from the microenterprise sector with the LEO network and in particular the LEO Brexit offering.  By way of example, the data in regard to the LEOs Brexit programmes and supports show a marked increase in 2019 relative to 2018 and this with three months of 2019 left to run.  </p>  <p>  I am confident therefore that in the days and weeks ahead, the LEO network will continue its robust and meaningful engagement with its many clients and will remain an integral component in this Government&rsquo;s toolkit to prepare our microenterprise sector to face any challenge that comes its way as a result of Brexit.</p></reply>

The agencies under my Department have a wide range of supports available to enable companies to consolidate their existing market share and also to become more resilient by broadening their sales to other international markets.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus is to assist client companies to build on the strength of their current performance by supporting them to start, innovate, be competitive and to diversify their global footprint. In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined, a Global Ambition campaign launched and an intensive programme initiated to support companies to take action and plan ahead so that they have the resilience necessary to navigate the challenges and opportunities posed by any kind of regional or global policy changes.</p>  <p>  A key strategic priority of Enterprise Ireland has been to increase the diversification of client companies exports into new markets, with two-thirds of exports to go beyond the UK by 2020. The proportion of exports to the UK has reduced by 10% over the last ten years, reflecting the success Irish companies are having in substantially increasing and broadening their exports to other international markets which has resulted in strong export and employment growth. Exports by EI supported companies have doubled to markets outside the UK since 2008.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has assisted client companies to increase their exports to a record &euro;23.8 billion in 2018, a growth of 6% compared to 2017&rsquo;s exporting results.</p>  <p>  In 2018, Enterprise Ireland assisted Irish companies to win 1,604 new overseas contracts, to establish 417 new overseas presences and helped 93 companies to export outside the UK for the first time.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to promote high level international events including trade missions which support the goal of securing high level market access for Irish companies</p></reply>

In March 2018, I as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation commissioned the OECD to conduct a Country Review of SME and Entrepreneurship Policies in Ireland.</p><p>This 18-month project aims to provide tailored analysis and recommendations to my Department and the wider Government on how to improve the design and implementation of national SME and entrepreneurship policies and programmes. The outcome will be founded on an assessment of the country&rsquo;s current SME and entrepreneurship performance, framework conditions and policies based on international comparisons. </p><p>My Department has played a central role supporting and facilitating the OECD during this process. My officials have organised and officiated at stakeholder events throughout the process to facilitate detailed engagement between my Department, other Government Departments, agencies, academia, business representatives and small businesses themselves. This engagement has enabled the OECD to gain insightful knowledge of the Irish SME and entrepreneurship ecosystem at the various critical stages of building this report. </p><p>I have, and will continue to, champion the development of our SMEs. I will ensure that the work and findings of the OECD Review and Strategy Roadmap will be central to our Future Jobs initiative into the future. </p><p>To this end, I and Minister of State, Pat Breen TD, hosted a very successful SME and Entrepreneurship Strategy Conference, which incorporated Future Jobs Pillar 2, at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on July 12 last. The event drew over 200 attendees with a broad representation of Irish SMEs, policy makers, agency leaders, academia and international representatives. </p><p>The Taoiseach also attended and addressed the event, reinforcing the natural alignment between that of the OECD Review and the Future Jobs Initiative.  He spoke of the need to change the way we work and to focus on improving our productivity to ensure continued progress and prosperity for all Irish citizens, throughout all of the regions. </p><p>The key recommendations of the Review include:</p><p>- Publish a whole of government SME and entrepreneurship-specific national policy and strategy;</p><p>- Establish an interdepartmental committee on SMEs and entrepreneurship;</p><p>- Introduce a pre-approval procedure of R&amp;amp;D tax credits to help reduce uncertainty for SMEs;</p><p>- Enhance Network and cluster organisations operational capacity;</p><p>- Scale-up the policy focus of Local Enterprise Offices to include SMEs with more than 10 employees;</p><p>- Encourage a wider take-up by SMEs of Skillnet Ireland programmes especially in management capabilities, financial management and next stage digital skills;</p><p>- Implement a simple diagnostic assessment tool for micro and small enterprises that can be completed online; </p><p>- Promote SME involvement in standards development and adoption in order to enhance their productivity and facilitate supply chain linkages.</p><p>This review is currently nearing completion and I, together with Minister Breen and OECD Deputy Secretary General Knudsen will be launching it, with an accompanying SME Strategy Roadmap, on the 23rd October 2019. This will assist my Department in developing a SME and Entrepreneurship Strategy for Ireland which will be part of the Future Jobs Framework.</p><p>It is evident in the significant literature produced by the OECD that regional development is essential to drive forward our indigenous small businesses. The network of clusters and the enhancement of the LEOs, who are present in every county, is a clear indication that the development of businesses in every region will benefit Ireland as a whole. It will remain a key focus of mine.  </p><p>The final Report and Roadmap will provide my Department and the whole of Government with the necessary recommendations to progress and develop future policies specific to the needs of our business ecosystem, both on a national and regional basis.</p><p>The outcome of the OECD Review, including both the Report and the Roadmap, will provide highly valuable inputs to enable us to move on to prepare our own national SME and Entrepreneurship Strategy. Given the depth and detail of the OECD Report, and the very significant level of informed analysis both at a domestic and international level that it provides, it will be important that we distill the findings of the Report to ensure that our own national Strategy benefits fully from the comprehensive detail of the Report.</p><p>I intend to bring forward a properly informed SME and Entrepreneurship Strategy for Ireland by the end of the year.</p></reply>

In 2018, the Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 7.6% to &euro;4.8bn, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1bn in exports.  Exports to North America increased from &euro;3.87bn in 2017 to &euro;4.08bn in 2018, an increase of 5.5%.   Our Enterprise agencies are now opening new offices around the world to support our companies in competing and thriving in global markets.  </p>  <p>  Ministerial-led Trade Missions support the Government's major drive towards market diversification.  The majority of trade missions are taking place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represent the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies.   These Trade Missions focus on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences.   </p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more. The existing suite of EU Free Trade Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p></reply>

INAB was established in 1985. Following the dissolution of Forf&aacute;s in June 2014, INAB, which has statutory independence, became part of the Health and Safety Authority for administrative purposes. INAB is the national body with responsibility for the accreditation of certification bodies such as the National Car Testing Service, inspection bodies whose functions include the examination of material and products to determination their conformity and laboratories. </p>  <p>  INAB offers accreditation in areas such as Environment Management, Medical Laboratory Management and Quality Management Systems. This would include such activities as; metrology, chemical, biological, mechanical and construction materials testing, for example public health laboratories which test food and water. The provision of the accreditation service is managed by the INAB executive and over-seen by the INAB Board with the support of externally contracted expertise. INAB is statutorily independent in carrying out its accreditation and certification roles. My Department has no role in relation to decisions of this nature made by INAB.</p>  <p>  In relation to correspondence and discussions between my Department and INAB the primary nature of ongoing contact is related to the appointment of Notified Bodies. My Department is the Notifying Authority for the conformity assessment of certain products being placed on the EU internal market. If a Conformity Assessment Body applies to my Department to be appointed as a Notified Body under certain EU Directives, then the Department seeks confirmation from INAB officials that the Conformity Assessment Body has received accreditation from INAB. This arises only in relation to accreditation provided by INAB to a Conformity Assessment Body under a specific number of EU Directives and it is in this context only that my Department seeks information from INAB on individual accreditations</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department have been in regular contact with INAB since June 2016 in relation to matters concerning accreditation processes in the context of Brexit. INAB officials have participated in a number of publicity events organised by my Department, and other Departments, in order to highlight the potential impact of Brexit on Irish businesses who currently use UK based accreditation services.</p>  <p>  Other interactions between officials from my Department concerning INAB include interaction with the Health and Safety Authority on the financing and staffing of INAB in the context of the overall operational management and staffing of the Health and Safety Authority. </p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with the CEO of the Health and Safety Authority in April this year to discuss the overall organisational structure of INAB in view of upcoming five-year anniversary of INAB becoming a committee of the HSA. In particular, the HSA is keen to explore new accreditation opportunities in emerging sectors such as GDPR and cybersecurity. The Health and Safety Authority recently issued a tender to undertake a review of INAB. This report will assist the Board of the Health and Safety Authority on the appropriateness of the current structure and operation of INAB going forward. </p>  <p>  INAB is also a member of the Market Surveillance Forum, an inter-Departmental/Agency forum, chaired by my Department, involving all the Market Surveillance Authorities within the State in addition to other relevant stakeholders. This forum meets on a quarterly basis. </p>  <p>  The Board of INAB is appointed by the Board of the Health and Safety Authority and INAB has statutory independence in the carrying out its accreditation role. I have no reason to have correspondence or discussions with other Departments regarding how INAB carries out its accreditation function.</p></reply>

At its peak in early 2012, the unemployment rate was 16% and almost 50,000 Irish people emigrated that year. Currently, the unemployment rate is down to 5.3% in September 2019 and there are more people employed in Ireland than ever before. </p><p>Since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in Q1 2012 there has been a 20 per cent increase in employment outside Dublin. The target set out in the Programme for Government is the creation 135,000 jobs outside Dublin by 2020. As of Q2 2019, some 136,000 jobs have been created outside Dublin. </p><p>Employment has increased in six of the eight regions over the twelve months between Q2 2018 and Q2 2019. Over the year to Q2 2019 employment grew faster in the West (5.1 per cent), Border (3.9 per cent), Midland (3.3 per cent), Mid-East (3.3 per cent) and Dublin (3.1 per cent) than in the State overall (2.0 per cent). Furthermore, 52 per cent of newly employed people were living outside Dublin in the year to Q2 2019.</p><p>At a regional level, the goal is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020 and ensure that the unemployment rate is within 1 percentage point of the State average. As of Q2 2019, six of the eight regions had unemployment rates within 1% or the national average. The exceptions to this were the Midland and South-East regions. </p><p>While we can be proud of the progress made, there is no room for complacency. Significant vulnerabilities are evident in the domestic economy such as declining productivity levels in small-to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Infrastructural constraints, skills deficits and labour availability, as well as concentrations in some sectors and markets could, unless ameliorated, impede further progress. Internationally, Brexit, growing trade protectionism and the undermining of the rules-based international trading system threaten our future economic welfare.</p><p>The Government is ambitious to build upon the gains we have made in recent years and to ensure our people enjoy higher standards of living and quality of life now, and into the future. By 2025, our workers and enterprises will be operating in a changed economy. As detailed in Enterprise 2025 &ndash; Ireland&rsquo;s National Enterprise Policy 2015-2025 and Enterprise 2025 Renewed &ndash; Building Resilience in the Face of Global Challenges, we need to shift our enterprise and jobs focus to ensure quality jobs that will be resilient into the future. For these reasons, earlier this year, the Government launched Future Jobs Ireland 2019 &ndash; Preparing Now for Tomorrow&rsquo;s Economy.</p><p>Future Jobs Ireland is a whole-of-Government multi-annual framework designed with the aim of integrating innovation and resilience into our economy and actioning critical elements of our national enterprise policy. It will ensure our enterprises and workers are well-positioned to adapt to the technological and other transformational changes our economy and society will face in the years ahead. Future Jobs Ireland focuses on five Pillars in the areas of:<ol type="1"><li>Embracing innovation and technological change;</li><li>Improving SME productivity;</li><li>Enhancing skills and developing and attracting talent;</li><li>Increasing participation in the labour force; and</li><li>Transitioning to a low carbon economy.</li></ol>Future Jobs Ireland 2019 sets out core ambitions for each of these Pillars, each backed up by a set of specific deliverables representing crucial steps toward achieving each ambition. The deliverables for 2019 represent the first stage of Future Jobs Ireland which will be built upon in subsequent annual editions.</p><p>Future Jobs Ireland builds upon and complements several Government strategies which enhance the potential of the regions in terms of economic development in particular Project Ireland 2040 which sets out an integrated spatial and public investment framework for the development of our regions to 2040.  The Future Jobs Ireland agenda also aligns with the ambitions of regional initiatives such as the Regional Enterprise Plans and the Action Plan for Rural Development. The Regional Enterprise Plans foster a collaborative approach in each region, bringing together Local Authorities, the enterprise agencies, higher and further education institutions, Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), the business community, and others, to work towards a better future for their region. </p><p>A Future Jobs Ireland Summit will be held this November, bringing together key stakeholders, to help develop Future Jobs Ireland 2020. Officials from my Department, alongside officials from the Department of the Taoiseach, are now coordinating inputs from across Government Departments and agencies, business representative groups, social partners, academia, industry and other interested parties in order to develop the next iteration, Future Jobs Ireland 2020 which will be launched in the new year and which will further prepare our enterprises and people across Ireland for tomorrow's economy.</p></reply>

The recruitment and assimilation of a large number of new professional staff into a multi-disciplinary organisation that undertakes complex work in a fast-moving environment is a project that requires careful management. </p><p>In addition, one of the actions in the Government's package of Measures to Enhance Ireland&rsquo;s Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework, published in November 2017, is the establishment of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) as a stand-alone agency. </p><p>The General Scheme of the Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Bill 2018 to establish the ODCE as a stand-alone agency was published on 4 December 2018.  The General Scheme is currently subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>Changing the structure of the ODCE from an office to a statutory agency will provide greater autonomy to the agency in relation to staffing resources and ensure it is better equipped to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law. Sourcing of expertise and specialist staff, such as forensic accountants, will be enhanced under the agency model.</p><p>The transition of the ODCE to an independent Agency will give rise to additional expertise requirements and, as such, it is prudent that those considerations should be factored into developing the roles required for the new Agency , and the associated skill set, required of the appointees.</p><p>The establishment of the ODCE as a stand-alone agency is intended to:</p><p>-Enhance the ODCE&rsquo;s independence, by providing it with more autonomy, particularly the ability to recruit the required specialist skills and expertise; </p><p>- Build on its existing expertise and experience; </p><p>- Strengthen its capability to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law; and</p><p>- Build on the organisational and procedural reforms that have been implemented.</p></reply>

The European Commission acts as lead negotiator on behalf of all EU countries in relation to trade agreements with non-EU countries. Member States, in Council, approve negotiating directives (or mandates) before negotiations begin, are consulted with as the negotiations proceed, and have final approval at Council, as has the European Parliament.  I and my Department lead for Ireland on these matters.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the EU concluded negotiations for an Association Agreement with Mercosur countries on 28<sup>th</sup>June, after nearly 20 years and 40 rounds of talks. This marks the EU&rsquo;s largest trade deal to date and is four times the size of the trade agreement with Japan.</p><p>Irish exporters have been subject to trade tariffs, barriers and restrictions when exporting to Mercosur. This Agreement will see a significant reduction, or elimination, of tariffs and barriers to trade which will allow an increased flow of trade an investment between Ireland, the EU and the Mercosur region. The EU-Mercosur Agreement should make exports from Ireland more attractive, and potentially increase the demand for Irish products and the employment that supports.</p><p>As with every Free Trade Agreement, Ireland &ndash; like all Member States &ndash; has defensive as well as offensive interests. The Agreement with Mercosur presents sectoral opportunities for Ireland in areas such as software and services in telecoms, financial services, digital content and travel, engineering products and services, life sciences, food and beverages, and education services.</p><p>On the other hand, I was always keenly aware of the potential impact that this Agreement could present to the EU&rsquo;s and Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural sector. In that regard, Ireland, along with a number of other Member States, asserted early on in the negotiations that agricultural sensitivities &ndash; and beef in particular &ndash; must be fully considered in the negotiations.</p><p>Ireland has also continually highlighted the cumulative impact of agricultural market access in relation to all EU trade agreements. Our concerns have been raised at all political levels, including by myself and my officials raising the issues with counterparts, both at Trade Council of Ministers deliberations and bilaterally with the EU Commission, and with my Member State counterparts. </p><p>Further, I wrote to the EU Trade Commissioner, on 31<sup>st</sup>May this year to restate my views, which I had previously articulated at European Trade Council meetings, as well as directly with the Trade Commissioner, regarding the current challenges facing the beef sector. I had sought assurances from the Commission that the final offer on beef &ndash; an offensive demand from the Mercosur side &ndash; would ensure that:</p><p>- the tariff rate quota for beef was low,</p><p>- that phasing-in periods were designed to allow sufficient time for Irish and EU industry to adjust,</p><p>- the Commission continually monitor quota levels taking into account domestic market conditions,</p><p>- the composition of beef imports from the region would be limited in relation to fresh chilled beef, and</p><p>- robust checks would be established and monitored at points of import to the EU to ensure animal health and welfare standards have been maintained.</p><p>As recently as Tuesday of last week 1st October, in my discussions with fellow Trade Ministers at the EU Council, I reminded colleagues that while the Mercosur Agreement offered clear geopolitical and economic opportunities the beef tariff rate quota presented difficulties for Ireland given the current economic viability challenges faced by our primary producers. </p><p>Following the conclusion of the negotiations for the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement, the Government committed to undertake full economic and environmental sustainability assessments of the political agreement. My Department, is working collaboratively with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this regard.  These assessments will consider the impact the Agreement will have on the Irish economy and on jobs, as well as the environmental sustainability aspects of the deal. It will also consider how the EU-Mercosur Agreement might mitigate/exacerbate the likely impact of Brexit for our economy. This assessment will help to inform our future actions in relation to the EU-Mercosur Agreement.</p><p>In relation to EU-US trade, on 25<sup>th</sup>July 2018, European Commission President Juncker and President Trump met in Washington to launch a new phase in trade relations between the United States and the European Union. In a joint EU-US Statement, they agreed to:</p><p>- work together toward zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, and zero subsidies (on non-auto industrial goods) and to work to reduce barriers and increase trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products, as well as soybeans,</p><p>- strengthen strategic energy cooperation to potentially increase US imports of LNG to diversify the EU&rsquo;s energy supply,</p><p>- launch a close dialogue on standards to ease trade barriers, reduce bureaucratic obstacles, and slash costs, and</p><p>- work closely together with like-minded partners to reform the WTO and to address unfair trading practices, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfer, industrial subsidies, distortions created by state-owned enterprises, and overcapacity.</p><p>On the foot of this joint statement, an EU-US Executive Working Group (EWG) was established to carry forward this joint agenda, co-chaired by EU Trade Commissioner and the US Trade Representative.</p><p>On 18<sup>th</sup>January 2019, the EU Commission adopted proposals, or mandates, for two negotiating directives for sector specific trade talks with the United States: one on conformity assessment (making it easier for companies to prove their products meet technical requirements on both sides of the Atlantic), and one on the elimination of tariffs for industrial goods (excluding agricultural products). After discussions by Member States in the Trade Policy Committee on a number of occasions and against the backdrop of the European Council in March 2019 calling for the &lsquo;necessary steps towards rapid implementations of all elements of the US-EU Joint Statement of 25 July 2018&rsquo; to be taken, the EU Council voted by qualified majority on 15th April 2019 to approve both negotiating directives. These mandates enable the EU Commission, in consultation with the Member States, to work towards removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to EU-US trade in industrial goods &ndash; a key goal of the July 2018 Joint Statement.</p><p>The negotiating directives make it clear that agriculture is specifically excluded from these negotiations. This was something I had sought specific assurances on from Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m in Council last year. </p><p>I believe a future trade agreement between the EU and US that is targeted specifically at the sectors of conformity assessment and the removal of tariffs on industrial goods, coupled with the lifting of current US tariffs on steel and aluminium products, would be a positive development for our economy and for jobs.  In this regard, a recent economic analysis released by the EU Commission found that a targeted EU-US agreement eliminating tariffs on industrial goods would increase EU exports to the US by 8% and US exports to the EU by 9% by 2033. In this context, where Ireland and the US have a bilateral trading relationship worth more than &euro;100 billion per annum, the potential gains for Ireland, and resultant employment, from an EU-US trade agreement would be very positive.</p></reply>

In the first instance, this will put a strain on the working capital position of businesses. I am progressing legislation to increase the amount which Microfinance Ireland can lend from &euro;25k to up to &euro;50k, which increases support to any microenterprise employing 10 or less. This will support an additional 1,000 enterprises with short term loans.</p>  <p>  For higher working capital challenges, the &euro;300 million Brexit Loan Scheme provides loans of up to &euro;1.5 million at a rate of 4% or less and approval is valid for 4 months. I would advise businesses to secure approval now, to be ready for any scenario.</p>  <p>  For longer term loan requirements, the Future Growth Loan Scheme, is another &euro;300 million for investment by SMEs, primary agriculture and seafood business. Both Government Schemes are administered by the SBCI and delivered through the banks.</p>  <p>  Most recently, the joint Skillnet and Enterprise Ireland Clear Customs Scheme was launched on 7th August to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses deal with additional customs requirements.   This is a free customs training programme delivered nationwide by Skillnet coupled with &euro;3 million funding which I allocated to Enterprise Ireland for a support payment of up to &euro;6,000 per employee to help with extra costs to manage customs compliance.</p>  <p>  The large suite of supports available also include the Brexit Scorecard, Grant aid, Consultancy, Mentoring, Advisory Clinics, Agile Innovation Fund, Operational Excellence Offer and Market Discovery Fund. These supports help companies consider various risks such as supply chain vulnerabilities and act to mitigate against them.</p>  <p>   All of these supports are critical for businesses in the highly vulnerable border areas and for exporters who are heavily exposed to the UK market in sectors such as construction, engineering and food.</p>  <p>  I recently collaborated with the Accountancy Bodies of Ireland on four breakfast Brexit briefing events between July and September covering a number of counties in the border regions that are likely to be most impacted by Brexit.  The events took place in Cavan (4 July), Monaghan (8 July), Donegal (25 July) and Louth (23 September), with over 500 in attendance. </p>  <p>  These Brexit events covered a broad range of important topics to help businesses prepare for Brexit such as customs, supply chain, cashflow and accreditation. The events provided an opportunity for me to speak directly to companies impacted by Brexit in the border region, and for these companies to hear first-hand from a large number of Government Agencies about the range of supports available to assist them with their Brexit preparations. Representatives from the Local Enterprise Offices, Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, Revenue and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine attended the events to engage with businesses.</p></reply>

While we cannot yet know the form that Brexit will take, these measures aim to assist businesses in identifying key risk areas and practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p>  <p>  Brexit is my top priority at this time and was central to my decision-making on the allocation of the additional &euro;14.2m Current and &euro;65m Capital funding I secured as part of Budget 2019. An additional &euro;5 million capital funding has been allocated to the Local Enterprise Offices, which represents an increase of 22%, and a further &euro;1 million allocated to InterTradeIreland to help SMEs prepare for the particular North-South challenges associated with Brexit. </p>  <p>  I have also allocated an additional &euro;3m to Enterprise Ireland and &euro;2m to IDA Ireland in 2019 to expand their global footprints and drive the diversification of trade and investment.  Additional resources have been distributed across Science Foundation Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority and the NSAI for 2019 to support enterprises as they adjust to the new relationship with the UK and pursue new opportunities.</p>  <p>  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s [ITI] Brexit Advisory Service provides a focal point for SMEs working to navigate any changes in cross-border trading relationships arising as a result of Brexit. As part of this service, ITI has organised a series of awareness-raising events focused on improving knowledge of customs processes and procedures and identifying actions that can be taken in areas such as logistics and supply chain management. This year to the 27th of September, more than 4,500 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service. </p>  <p>  ITI&rsquo;s Brexit Planning Voucher scheme aims to enable businesses to seek professional advice on how best to plan and prepare for Brexit. This support helps businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, and regulatory and customs issues.  Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. To the 27th of September, 1,893 applications have been submitted for the Voucher, 1,630 of which have been approved. </p>  <p>  In March, ITI launched a further financial support in the form of the Brexit Implementation voucher, which offers financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50% towards implementing critical changes in relation to Brexit matters.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business, including businesses in the border counties.  The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. 1,017 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit this year to the 27th of September. Since February, the LEOs have offering customs training workshops to support businesses trading with third countries in advance of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. To the 27 September, there have been 917 training participants.</p>  <p>  The LEOs engage in a number of other schemes to help businesses prepare for Brexit. The Technical Assistance Grant for Micro Export is offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. As of 27 September, 729 LEO clients were approved assistance under the grant.</p>  <p>  In addition, the six LEOs in the Border region are working together with their Northern Ireland counterparts under the EU Co-Innovate Programme.  The aim of Co-Innovate is to give SMEs from the manufacturing and tradeable services sectors in the eligible regions the tools and tailored support to help them to innovate, differentiate and compete successfully. </p>  <p>  In Quarter one of this year, I launched nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, including Plans for the North East and the North West. These Plans build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017. The new Plans will ensure that regional stakeholders continue to work together to help achieve the Government&rsquo;s 2020 targets for regional employment taking account of new and emerging opportunities and challenges, including Brexit. </p>  <p>  In June, I launched my Department's new Regional Enterprise Development Fund Call 3 for &euro;45m in competitive funding which has a strong emphasis on building resilience in our enterprise base in the context of Brexit. </p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched in March 2018. It provides relatively short-term working capital, up to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges.  The scheme is open to eligible businesses from all regions of the country, including those in the Border counties. Dublin aside, the most recently available quarterly report shows that the border region is the most active region in terms of eligibility applications for the scheme. As of 27 September, there have been 816 eligibility applications received, of which 738 have been approved and 153 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;43.52 million. It should be noted that 153 of total applications received relate to repeat / duplicate applications. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme opened for eligibility applications in April 2019.  This scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme has been jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make available loans of &euro;100,000 (&euro;50,000 for primary agriculture) to &euro;3 million, with loans of under &euro;500,000 being provided on an unsecured basis.  The scheme is open to eligible Irish businesses, including those in the primary agriculture and seafood sectors, to support strategic, long-term investment in a post-Brexit environment.  As of 27 September, there have been 1,353 eligibility applications received, of which 1,283 have been approved and 270 loans progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;43.805 million. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland [EI] has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit.  It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  Over 6,500 businesses have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms are now taking actions, while 216 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved.  288 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience.  </p>  <p>  EI&rsquo;s Customs Insights course helps businesses looking at customs for the first time to understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes. The course advises on the key actions companies can take to prepare for Brexit and highlights the various supports available. To the 27 September, there have been 1,706 Customs Insights Course participants. </p>  <p>  In order to help build enterprise capability, under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) EI invested in seven successful projects in the Border region with a total funding allocation of more than &euro;10.6 million.  This funding will drive enterprise development and job creation in the Border Region. Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with its clients to ensure they have the supports required to prepare for any kind of Brexit. In June, at a visit to the recently opened Cavan Digital Hub, I announced that I will be making a further &euro;45 million available under the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF). </p>  <p>  My Department and I have participated in the whole-of-Government 'Getting Ireland Brexit Ready' public information campaign. This campaign features workshop events throughout the country, aimed primarily at business and people most impacted by Brexit, including events in Monaghan and Donegal. In addition to these events, Enterprise Ireland has rolled out a series of Brexit Advisory Clinics to help businesses across the country, including events in Dundalk, Letterkenny and Cootehill over recent weeks. </p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the lasting uncertainty around the Brexit process may be leading businesses to defer their Brexit preparations.  The UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will bring change for Irish businesses and I want businesses, particularly those around the Border counties to know my Department and agencies are here to help.</p></reply>

Together with my Department and its enterprise Agencies, I have been focused on strengthening investment and job creation all over the country. That was the case in 2018 and 2019 and our collective emphasis on regional development will continue in 2020.</p>  <p>  With respect to 2018 in particular, 56% of all net new jobs created by IDA Ireland were in locations outside Dublin. Similarly, every region in Ireland, including the North-East Region, posted net gains in jobs last year. There are now over 132,000 people employed across approximately 700 firms in IDA client companies outside the capital. In fact, 58% of all IDA-supported employment is now outside of Dublin. This represents the highest number of people employed in the regions by IDA clients in the Agency&rsquo;s history. It also reflects the absolute importance that the Agency and Government have attached to increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) outside of our main urban areas.</p>  <p>  As for County Louth, FDI levels in the County are trending in the right direction. Louth experienced a 3.5% increase in FDI employment in 2018, with 28 IDA-supported client companies now based there. Those same firms employ over 3,900 people, with 139 net new jobs added in 2018. IDA client firms in Louth are continuing to grow and develop. Last year alone saw announcements from Almac, Wuxi and PCI, which will result in the creation of over 700 jobs. The investment by Wuxi was particularly significant, with construction beginning earlier this year on the company's &euro;325 million state-of-the-art facility in Dundalk. </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the IDA will continue to draw the attention of investors to Louth and the Border region. The Agency's Regional Property Programme (RPP) is important in that context by helping provide property solutions for overseas companies considering locating in the area. Construction is progressing, for example, on an office building in County Louth which will be completed this year. The RPP also includes plans for an Advanced Technology Building in Dundalk and construction is expected to begin on this facility at the end of this year. The wider Border region will benefit as well from the RPP, with new buildings planned for Sligo and Monaghan. I am confident that these facilities, together with the wider work the IDA is undertaking to promote the region to overseas investors, will help attract further investment and generate new employment opportunities to the Counties concerned.</p></reply>

This practice is the norm internationally.</p><p>Normally the holder of an employment permit is required to remain with their first employment for a period of 12 months after which time there is no restriction on changing employer.  This requirement strikes a reasonable balance between, on the one hand, the employer&rsquo;s expectations that the foreign national remain in his or her employment for a reasonable period of time given the costs involved in recruiting that foreign national and, on the other hand, not unduly binding the foreign national to the employer.  A new employment permit is required prior to commencement of employment with any new employer. </p><p>In certain circumstances, during this initial 12-month period with their first employer, a new application for an employment permit may be considered for instances such as:</p><p>- redundancy, or </p><p>- where circumstances (unforeseen at time of application) arise in the employment that fundamentally change the employment relationship (e.g. the employer plans to change the location of the business to a site a significant distance from its current location, or the hours of work are being significantly changed, or significant changes are being made to the nature of the work that the foreign national is required to do). </p><p>If the criteria in this regard are met then a non-EEA national may submit a new employment permit application following all of the procedures for the relevant employment permit type and it will be considered in line with the provisions of the Employment Permits Acts.  All such applications should include documentary evidence and/or supporting documentation explaining the circumstances in the particular case e.g. P45, letter from the current employer confirming redundancy/change in employment terms etc. .</p><p>Statistics in relation to companies issued with permits and permits issued by sector is available on the Department&rsquo;s website and can be accessed through this link:<i>.</i></p></reply>

Regional development is a key priority of the Government and I am focused on supporting and sustaining existing employment levels while also working to create new economic opportunities and jobs in the regions, including Co. Cork.  </p>  <p>  Earlier this year I launched the Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, a refresh and refocus of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs, which includes the South-West Regional Enterprise Plan, covering counties Cork and Kerry. The priority focus of the Plan is on building capability and resilience in the region&rsquo;s enterprise base, developing the region&rsquo;s enterprise hubs and tourism sector, supporting growth in the region&rsquo;s marine and maritime sector and ensuring the availability of skills and talent to underpin the region&rsquo;s economic growth potential.</p>  <p>  The enterprise agencies under my remit play a key role in achieving those objectives, with a comprehensive range of supports provided to companies by Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices and IDA Ireland. </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is actively working with companies with global ambition in Co. Cork to drive competitiveness, innovation and market diversification. In 2018, 24,444 people were employed in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Co. Cork. Enterprise Ireland has also approved funding for a number of projects in Co. Cork under Calls 1 and 2 of the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF), with the South-West Region securing funding of over &euro;10.8 million.</p>  <p>  The network of 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) nationwide is a very useful first port of call for small businesses seeking supports and for people who wish to start their own business. LEO Cork North &amp;amp; West has been engaging extensively with local businesses in the North Cork area this year, with a wide range of programmes delivered, including Trading Online Seminars, Start Your Own Business &amp;amp; 10 Steps to Self-Employment Programme, Management Development Programmes including LEAN for Micro, and tailored programmes to support Female Entrepreneurship. </p>  <p>  Last week, as part of the LEO Competitive Fund 2019-2020, I approved funding of &euro;100,000 to support the LINC cluster of 40 engineering firms in the North Cork and East/ West Limerick area. LINC works on behalf of member companies to build and deepen linkages with other businesses, third level institutions and Regional Skills Forums.</p>  <p>  Cork has traditionally been a strong performer in terms of foreign direct investment (FDI). This trend is continuing, with a steady and positive increase in employment numbers in IDA Ireland client companies in the County over the past number of years. There are currently 169 IDA client companies in Cork, employing approximately 38,867 people. </p>  <p>  While progress has been made in helping to generate new economic opportunities at a regional level, the Government remains committed to achieve even more. Accordingly, my Department and its agencies will continue its efforts to secure quality and sustainable jobs throughout the regions, including in north-west Co. Cork.</p></reply>

That is why my Department and its agencies have put in place extensive supports, schemes and advisory resources to ensure that businesses around the country are prepared for Brexit. These measures aim to assist businesses in identifying and managing key risk areas and develop practical preparatory actions regardless of the circumstances of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU. </p>  <p>  he Local Enterprise Offices [LEOs] are the first-stop-shop for anyone seeking guidance and support on starting or growing their business. The LEOs have organised various events to enable companies to learn about the potential impacts and opportunities of Brexit. </p>  <p>  In addition, over 1,000 LEO clients have received one-to-one mentoring solely focused on Brexit. Technical Assistance Grants for Micro Export are offered as an incentive for LEO clients to explore and develop new market opportunities. 729 LEO clients have been approved for the Grant.</p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Office interactive one day Prepare Your Business for Customs workshop helps businesses understand the key customs concepts, documentation and processes required to succeed in a post Brexit environment. 917 Participants have so far attended this Customs Training.</p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland also plays a major role as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit response and offers Brexit-related advisory services to eligible businesses. So far this year, more than 4,500 SMEs have directly engaged with the Brexit Advisory Service.  </p>  <p>  ITI offers a Brexit Planning Voucher and Brexit Implementation Voucher schemes, which enables businesses to get professional advice on how best to plan, prepare and implement for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These supports help businesses obtain advice on specific areas such as tariffs, currency management, regulatory and customs issues and movement of labour, goods and services. </p>  <p>  ITI Brexit Planning Vouchers are worth up to &euro;2,250 (inclusive of VAT) each. Over 1,800 businesses have applied for a Brexit Start to Plan voucher, of which over 1,600 have been approved. ITI new Brexit Implementation Voucher provides financial support up to &pound;5,000/&euro;5,625 (inclusive of VAT), with InterTradeIreland paying 50%. This will support businesses in implementing critical changes making them better prepared to deal with a new trading relationship.</p>  <p>  In August, ITI launched a new advertising campaign and a new online resource to encourage and assist firms in preparing for Brexit. The online &ldquo;Bitesize Brexit&rdquo; resource is a one-stop-shop for cross-border traders, presenting information in easily digestible segments and includes specific actions businesses should take in preparing for Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme was launched in March of 2018. The Scheme, using a combination of Irish Exchequer and EU guarantees, leveraged up to &euro;300 million of lending at a maximum interest rate 4% at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;23 million - &euro;14 million provided by my Department and &euro;9 million provided by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Loan Scheme provides relatively short-term working capital, 1 to 3 years, to eligible businesses with up to 499 employees to help them to innovate, change or adapt to mitigate their Brexit challenges. Businesses can confirm their eligibility with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and, if deemed eligible, can apply to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme.  </p>  <p>  As at 27 September, there have been 816 applications for eligibility under the scheme, of which 738 have been approved to date by SBCI. 194 of those applications have progressed to sanction at bank value, to a total value of &euro;43.5 million. It is important to note that 153 of total applications received relate to repeat / duplicate applications. </p>  <p>  The Future Growth Loan Scheme launched in March. The scheme provides a longer-term facility, 8 to 10 years, of up to &euro;300m to support strategic capital investment for a post-Brexit environment by business at competitive rates. This scheme is jointly funded by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (&euro;37.2 million) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (&euro;24.8 million) at a total cost to the Exchequer of &euro;62 million.</p>  <p>  This scheme is available to eligible businesses in Ireland and the primary agriculture (farmers) and seafood sectors to support strategic long-term investment. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, the scheme operator, opened for eligibility applications on 17 April and up to 27 September it received 1,353 eligibility applications and issued 1,283 eligibility letters. 270 applications have progressed to sanction at bank level to a value of &euro;43.8 million.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland has established a Prepare for Brexit online portal and communications campaign, as well as an online &ldquo;Brexit SME Scorecard&rdquo; to help Irish businesses self-asses their exposure to Brexit and a &ldquo;Be Prepared Grant&rdquo; to support SME clients in planning to mitigate risks arising from Brexit. It has also launched a new Eurozone Strategy to help SMEs broaden their export footprint beyond the UK.</p>  <p>  Over 6,500 business have used Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit Scorecard to date and 85% of EI client firms have a plan in place, while 216 applications for the Be Prepared grant have been approved. 288 EI clients have received funding under its &ldquo;Act On&rdquo; programme, which supports the engagement of a consultant to help clients identify weaknesses and improve resilience. EI has also hosted 16 Brexit Advisory Clinics. </p>  <p>  EI also launched a Customs Insights Online course at the beginning of the year. This is a new online training support to help all businesses understand how customs work including the documentation and process required to operate and succeed post Brexit. The Customs Insights course explains in clear and simple terms the main customs rules and included the key actions companies can take to prepare for customs after Brexit and the options from Revenue that are available to make the customs process more efficient. This will be available for any company to use whether they are importers or exporters and also whether they are agency clients or not. There have been over 1,700 Customs Insights Course participants.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland also recently launched twelve &lsquo;Brexit Essential&rsquo; questions aimed at helping exporting businesses further prepare and take action ahead of the UK&rsquo;s impending withdrawal from the EU.  The Brexit Essentials campaign highlights the key questions and documentation that businesses need to address in order to trade successfully with the UK post 31 October.</p>  <p>  My Department, together with the Department of Education and Science, in association with key industry partners, also launched a new support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses develop the capacity to deal with the additional customs requirements due to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. The new initiative is called Clear Customs, and it comprises of a free customs training programme provided through Skillnet and a financial support payment from Enterprise Ireland to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning staff to customs roles in addition to necessary customs IT requirements. As of the 27th of September, 168 applications have been made to access financial support through the scheme.</p>  <p>  While I have seen a very positive uptake of the supports available, I am conscious that the delays to Brexit may have led businesses to defer their immediate planning. However, the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will mean changes for Irish businesses. I want businesses to know that my Department and its agencies are here to help.  The existing supports, schemes and advice are in place to ensure that businesses are prepared for any Brexit scenario.</p></reply>

It is important to emphasise that these difficulties are not attributable to overseas firms or the jobs they have created here.</p>  <p>  Housing remains an absolute priority for the Government and intensive work is continuing to provide solutions, both now and in the future. The Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan &ndash; which includes a range of initiatives and actions aimed at increasing the supply of affordable and quality homes &ndash; is already producing results, especially in terms of completed dwellings. Work on the implementation of that Plan is continuing and the Government is doing everything it can to increase housing availability. </p>  <p>  Overseas firms operating in Ireland are aware of the housing challenges we are facing. But they understand too how much of a priority this is for Government and what has been done to increase supply. It&rsquo;s important to remember as well that many of the countries Ireland competes against for foreign direct investment have difficulties of their own when it comes to residential housing. That doesn&rsquo;t diminish our own housing challenges &ndash; which we remain determined to address &ndash; but it does serve as a reminder that these are problems that many other States are also wrestling with.</p></reply>

Revenue has indicated to me that most businesses use customs agents with typically only large businesses having in-house customs arrangements to complete their customs formalities. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that based on an analysis of businesses who submitted customs declarations to date in 2019 there are currently 10,542 businesses who are trading with non-EU countries. These businesses have the facility, either in-house or through customs agents, to complete customs formalities.</p>  <p>  Revenue has advised that it is not possible to state the percentage of businesses that will have the facility to make customs declarations or have plans in place for a customs agent to make these declarations, post Brexit. This is a commercial decision for each business and not a decision in which Revenue has any involvement.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, industry raised concerns regarding the level of customs agent capacity in the market. As a result, the Deputy will be aware that the Government&rsquo;s Clear Customs initiative was launched by Skillnet Ireland on 7 August. This is a new support measure to help customs agents, intermediaries and affected Irish businesses to develop the capacity to deal with the completion of customs formalities post Brexit. There are two components to the support &ndash; a training element, and a grant element to support businesses taking on new staff or training existing staff to carry out customs work. </p>  <p>  I understand that over 1,000 applications from businesses have been received for the Clear Customs initiative to date. The training element is ongoing and is being provided by Skillnet Ireland in partnership with industry bodies from the freight, transport and logistics sector. 660 people have either completed the training course or are scheduled to participate on the course in the coming weeks. To date over 150 grants have been approved under the scheme by Enterprise Ireland. The Clear Customs initiative is making an important contribution to the preparedness arrangements of businesses by enabling them to build the necessary capacity to complete customs formalities post Brexit.</p>  <p>  I strongly urge all businesses that intend to trade with the UK post Brexit to ensure that they have the capability to complete customs formalities, by either putting in place the appropriate arrangements in-house or engaging a customs agent.</p></reply>

Any delay in the collection of tax revenue impacts on the level and timeliness of the financial resources available to the Exchequer and adds to Government borrowing and public debt interest. Accordingly, Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that all taxpayers comply with their responsibilities to file and pay the right amount of tax on time. </p>  <p>  In circumstance where a taxpayer submits a return and declares a liability that remains unpaid, Revenue issues a request for payment. Where the taxpayer fails to make contact or engage on the issue within the specified period, Revenue issues a further notification demanding payment. This notice also sets out the debt collection/enforcement options that can be deployed if the taxpayer continues to ignore the matter. </p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that its clear preference in such situations is to engage with the taxpayer and agree a mutually acceptable solution rather than using debt collection sanctions. For this reason, I recommend that if the Deputy is aware of a particular case, that he advise the person/s in question to make contact with Revenue as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in that school planning area.  There are no current plans to revise school planning areas.</p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy is a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school established in 2017 to serve the Carpenterstown_D15 &amp;amp; Castleknock_D15 school planning areas as a regional solution.</p>  <p>  New schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required, in the first instance, to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area where they have sufficient places. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.</p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </p>  <p>  The question of enrolment in individual schools, including the setting of catchment areas, is the responsibility of the Board of Management on behalf of the school Patron and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website www.education.ie. The Education Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. </p>  <p>  The question of enrolment in individual schools, including the setting of catchment areas, is the responsibility of the Board of Management on behalf of the school Patron and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.</p>  <p>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. Further information on the Section 29 appeals process is available on the Department's website www.education.ie. The Education Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The EWS can be contacted at 01-7718500.</p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022). The announcement followed nationwide, demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country. While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the school planning area referred to by the Deputy, the requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and will have regard for the increased rollout of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  The post-primary school in the area referred to by the Deputy is under the patronage of Louth and Meath Education and Training Board and has a current enrolment in the region of 1,000 pupils. The school is experiencing demand for additional school places and the ETB is open to assisting in meeting this demand.  The ETB has submitted an application for additional accommodation which my Department is currently considering. The outcome will assist my Department in determining the future need in the area. In the meantime, my Department has approved the provision of additional temporary accommodation - 8 general classrooms and 1 science lab - to Louth and Meath Education and Training Board to meet the school&rsquo;s immediate needs and the project for this accommodation is currently on site.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-10-09a.154.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019100900072#WRC05200"><p>I recognise the very important work done by these staff, and the other support staff in the running of our schools.  I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.</p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  </p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.</p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  </p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.</p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey analysis.  In these circumstances any industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered unwarranted, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.  </p>  <p>  Officials from the Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives in September. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.  </p>  <p>  The Department restated to the trade union that their claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of these surveys.   The Department reiterated its view to the union that any industrial action is premature and unwarranted, and called on F&Oacute;RSA to reconsider their action. </p>  <p>  On 30 September F&Oacute;RSA requested the Department to agree to use the services of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) to resolve the dispute.  As is normal practice the Department has agreed to use the industrial relations machinery of the state in an effort to resolve this matter.  </p>  <p>  In order to address the various issues within the claim and to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution, the Department will participate in discussions with F&Oacute;RSA under the auspices of the WRC. The Department will be requesting the assistance of the WRC in ensuring that once talks commence the industrial action be stood down to enable these discussions to progress.</p></reply>

The Healthy Ireland agenda is committed to supporting everyone&rsquo;s efforts to improve their health and wellbeing.  Schools are strongly encouraged to have a formal healthy eating policy that has been developed in consultation with students and parents.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills works closely with the Department of Health and the HSE on the Healthy Ireland agenda. Healthy Lifestyles guidance issued to post primary schools in 2015 and primary schools in 2016. This guidance was drafted in consultation with the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme is a mandatory part of the curriculum in junior cycle.  SPHE for Junior Cycle builds on the primary SPHE curriculum.  Nutrition is specifically addressed in the SPHE curriculum. Students are made aware of the elements of a balanced diet and the importance of healthy eating for physical and mental well-being.  In addition, cross-curricular links with other subjects, such as Home Economics, PE and Science that deal with SPHE-related topics are encouraged. Also, Home Economics as an exam subject remains popular.  </p>  <p>  Given the issues of overload which are emerging in evaluations, allied with criticisms that some of these areas receive inadequate coverage, it is not feasible for the curriculum to be further extended to include all students being taught cooking in schools.  However, some schools through the transition year programme offer short courses in cookery that support students to develop the necessary skills for independent living.</p>  <p>  The decision on what is offered in terms of subject choices or short courses for Junior Cycle or modules for the Transition Year Programme remains at the discretion of the individual school. The aim is to support students to have as broad a range of options (that reflect their interests) to choose from as possible. Curriculum choice is important in motivating students to learn, and to remain in school to completion of senior cycle.</p></reply>

Subsequently, a WTO arbitrator evaluated the claim and reported on the 2 October 2019 that the value of countermeasures that the US can impose commensurate with the adverse affects caused by EU subsidies is $7.496 billion. In the parallel Boeing case, the WTO arbitrators&rsquo; report is due for finalisation and publication in 6-9 months&rsquo; time &ndash; Q2 2020.</p>  <p>  On the same day as the WTO Arbitrators' Findings were released, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) published its final list of products that will be targeted with new tariffs.

The new tariffs can be introduced once the US obtains "authorisation" from the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DBS) at the next scheduled DSB meeting and my Department understands that a special sitting of the DSB has been arranged for 14 October 2019 to fulfil this procedural requirement.</p>  <p>  The latest CSO data shows that Ireland recorded goods exports to the US of approximately &euro;39.27 billion in 2018. The US is Ireland&rsquo;s largest goods export market, accounting for 28% of total goods exports in 2018.  For those products effected by the USTR list, Ireland exported approximately &euro;362m worth of goods to the US in 2018, with the principal exports being:</p>  <p>  - liqueurs and cordials valued at &euro;168.5m,</p>  <p>  - butter valued at &euro;156.8m and</p>  <p>  - cheddar cheese valued at &euro;37.3m.</p>  <p>  Exports of these products will attract an additional 25% tariff on entry into the US. </p>  <p>  As International Trade Policy is a competence of the EU Commission under the EU Treaties, the EU Commission takes the lead on this issue taking into account the views of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union.  Therefore, we continue to be engaged with the Commission, both at a Ministerial and Official level on these issues. For example, at the Informal Trade Council in Brussels on 1 October 2019, in discussing the Airbus case, I placed particular stress on the impacts the imposition of tariff measures by the US could have for both the global and Irish economy.  I was also keen to highlight how EU and US trade had developed over the decades in a spirit of openness and mutual gain such that imposing tariff measures on one another, as had already arisen in relation to steel and aluminium, and was now in looming in the context of the Airbus and Boeing cases, would be damaging to both economies.  Furthermore, I also argued that Ireland had clearly shown how a two-way flow of trade and investment means jobs growth in both economies. I, therefore, urged the EU Commission to continue to work with our US colleagues on a range of current trade challenges, given the strong role both the US and the EU play on the global trading stage, to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome for our citizens.</p>  <p>  I also emphasised to fellow EU Trade Ministers that it is only with a continued, clear and united, approach that we can hope to successfully engage with current US trade policies. I reiterated Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for pursuing all available avenues to reach a negotiated settlement with the United States, which the EU Commission and Member States support.</p>  <p>  In addition, I held a bilateral meeting with Trade Commissioner-elect Phil Hogan in Brussels on the same day and we discussed a number of trade matters with particular focus on the WTO Airbus and Boeing cases. I raised the potential impact the imposition of tariffs, as per the US tariff list, could have on Ireland.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I and my Department continue to actively engage with US interlocuters to highlight Irish concerns as to the impact of tariffs, particularly on the Irish agri-food sector, given the potential impacts that may simultaneously arise for the sector and our border communities from Brexit.  My Department has also engaged with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as well as industry (IBEC &amp;amp; Sector Groups, ISME) and our Enterprise Agencies in relation to the USTR proposed list of tariffs. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has highlighted our concerns at EU level as well as in appropriate bilateral engagements with US interlocuters in Dublin and Washington. Specifically, these issues were raised by our Ambassador in Washington with a number of political figures.   Finally, senior officials from my Department raised our concerns during a series of bilateral meetings with a number of US officials during a visit to Washington in June.</p>  <p>  Our position remains that the mutual imposition of sanctions will only inflict damage on businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic and harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time. Ireland does not want to see this escalation at this time and we strongly support pursuing all available avenues to reach a negotiated settlement.</p></reply>

Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) are essential components of a company&rsquo;s ability to maintain its competitiveness, its employment levels and be resilient to withstand the challenges posed by Brexit. Irish companies are using RDI in a bid to protect their current exports in the UK and to explore different markets.</p><p>Year on year the Government is increasing its support for and investment in innovation, research and development. At &euro;3.7bn public and private R&amp;amp;D investment is strong in Ireland. Through its Enterprise Development agencies, my Department is driving greater engagement in research, development and innovation by both Irish and foreign owned enterprises and by both SME and large-scale enterprises.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s (EI) Annual Business Results Survey 2018 shows that companies that invest in innovation are higher performing in terms of employment, export sales and are more sustainable through recessionary and other economic shocks such as Brexit. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland therefore provides a wide range of supports to companies to support innovation, competitiveness and market diversification. Examples include EI&rsquo;s Agile Innovation Fund &ndash; which gives fast-track access to innovation funding and EI&rsquo;s Market Discovery Fund, along with the Brexit Loan Scheme and the Future Growth Loan Scheme.  </p><p>Specifically, with its range of R&amp;amp;D supports, EI supports and de-risks RDI either by giving grants to companies to do RDI within the company, or by facilitating enterprise collaboration with Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Supports, such as its R&amp;amp;D Grant, Innovation Vouchers or its Programmes on Innovation Partnerships, Technology Gateways, Technology Centres or Campus Incubators assist all its client companies to develop new and improved products and services and maintain their employment levels. </p><p>The most significant and relevant support available for new start-ups is Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s High Potential Start Up (HPSU) support.  There is a number of supports available under the HPSU offer such as the Innovative HPSU Fund, New Frontiers Programme and Competitive Start Fund.  The Innovative HPSU Fund offer provides support to early stage companies considered to have an innovative product, service or technology with the potential to achieve international sales and create employment.  </p><p>Direct Government support through IDA Ireland for applied RDI investment in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) companies can be a key factor in winning buy-in from company HQ to maintain the Irish operation and employment. FDI will continue to require and avail of innovation, technology and EU support and while external factors such as Brexit may have an effect on job creation performance, IDA Ireland expects that the trend of job creation achieved in the past number of years will continue in the future. </p><p>The first Pillar of Future Jobs Ireland (FJI), &lsquo;<i>Embracing Innovation and Technological Change&rsquo;</i>, builds on progress made to date by focusing on securing the quantity and quality of skilled workers required in light of increased automation and digitisation, improving the capacity of enterprise to absorb technology and exploit its advantages and opportunities; and encourages greater RDI activity to keep Irish enterprise at the frontier of innovation. It also calls out measures to promote indigenous entrepreneurship and encourage clustering and stronger links between domestic and foreign owned companies.  Achieving the Innovation 2020 vision of becoming a Global Innovation Leader is recognised in FJI as being key to fully embedding resilience and ensuring long term sustainable growth. </p><p>In recognition of the impact of Brexit, the Government has launched the &lsquo;<i>Getting Your Business Brexit Ready &ndash; Practical Steps&rsquo;</i>campaign which focusses on the nine steps every business should take to help prepare for the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. In September 2019 the Government also launched a booklet &lsquo;<i>Quick Brexit Guide for Businesses&rsquo;.</i>This aims to answer many of the questions that Irish businesses have when assessing their exposure to Brexit and determining the best course of action to mitigate their likely Brexit-related difficulties.</p><p>The &lsquo;<i>Brexit Preparedness Checklist&rsquo;</i>prepared by my Department, identifies the essential actions that firms can take in advance of 31 October.  It includes links to all the relevant Agencies who can provide the necessary guidance and support.</p></reply>

While the Copenhagen Economics report of 2018 prepared for my Department estimated up to 20,000 jobs could be at risk, my focus is on ensuring businesses at risk and their employees are prepared and resilient for whatever form Brexit may take. Enterprise Ireland (EI) and the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the main agencies for supporting new start-up businesses across every region of the country.</p><p>A key strategic priority of Enterprise Ireland has been to increase the diversification of client companies exports into new markets, with two-thirds of exports to go beyond the UK by 2020. The proportion of exports to the UK has reduced by 10% over the last ten years, reflecting the success Irish companies are having in substantially increasing and broadening their exports to other international markets which has resulted in strong export and employment growth. Exports by EI supported companies have doubled to markets outside the UK since 2008.</p><p>EI client company exports increased in 2018 to a record &euro;23.8 billion, representing a 6% increase on 2017. In addition, exports to the UK were up 4% in 2018 when compared with 2017, to &euro;7.9bn. However, due to the increase in exports to other jurisdictions the overall dependency of Irish exporters to the UK declined to 33%, a target EI had set to reach by 2020.</p><p>To be resilient to economic shocks, such as Brexit, Irish exporting companies need to be innovative, competitive and have a diversified global footprint. In delivering on this, new supports have been introduced, others streamlined and a Global Ambition campaign launched.</p><p>My Department will continue to work with businesses in all regions and sectors, and to help them to identify potential markets for their products and services.</p><p>My Department also continues to promote high level international events including trade missions which support the goal of securing high level market access for Irish companies.</p><p><b>New Business Supports</b></p><p>When it comes to identifying vulnerabilities, the Brexit SME Scorecard is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies, not just EI client companies, to self-assess their exposure to Brexit under six business pillars. As of 27<sup>th</sup>September 2019, over 6,585 companies have utilised this Scorecard.</p><p>The Be Prepared Grant that supports the costs of SME clients up to &euro;5k in preparing a plan to mitigate risks and optimise opportunities arising from Brexit. As of 27<sup>th</sup>September 2019, a total of 216 companies have been approved for support under this initiative.</p><p>In December 2018 my Department launched the new Customs Insights to help companies understand key customs procedures, documents and concepts, and the actions needed to prepare for Brexit.</p><p>My Department has also run a &euro;60m competitive fund through the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF) in 2017 over two calls to support step change Enterprise Development projects in each region with funding of between &euro;250k and &euro;5m/project. The first Call was launched in April 2017 and the second call in May 2018. In Call One a total of 21 projects were approved funding of &euro;30.5m with a further 38 Feasibility Projects supported. In Call Two a further 21 projects were approved funding of approximately &euro;29m approximately in November 2018. These 42 successful projects are at various stages of implementation and execution of their plans at present.</p><p>Call Three of the regional Enterprise Development Fund was launched by Minister Humphreys on 24<sup>th</sup>June along with a Feasibility Scheme. Assessment and evaluation of applications is expected to take place in October.</p><p><b>New Technologies</b></p><p>In terms of utilising new technologies to mitigate some of the negative effects of Brexit, technological innovation is at the heart of this Government&rsquo;s vision for the Irish economy. For example, the Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund, or DTIF, is an Irish Government Fund recently launched as part of Project Ireland 2040 and the National Development Plan. It is implemented through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and its agencies with a resource allocation of &euro;500 million over the period 2018-2027 consisting of an initial Exchequer allocation of &euro;180 million to 2022. As a first tranche, &euro;20 million will be allocated during 2019.</p><p>Informed by the Research Priority areas, the Fund is competitive and is seeking investment in the research, development and deployment of disruptive technologies and applications on a commercial basis. It will drive collaboration between Ireland&rsquo;s world-class research base and industry as well as facilitating enterprises to compete directly for funding in support of the development and adoption of these technologies.</p><p>A total of 27 projects have been announced from the first tranche of funding, worth &euro;75m to 2021. All projects include collaborations between start-ups, SMEs, multinationals and academic institutions. Every project involves at least one SME, and many are led by an SME. The second call has just closed for applications, with successful applicants expected to be announced in December 2019. Over the next ten years a total of &euro;500 million will be allocated through the fund, which was announced as part of Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

Innovation drives productivity through new, higher value-added products and services and more efficient business processes and is an integral part of any business wishing to continue to grow and expand.</p><p>Ireland continues to perform strongly in terms of innovation.

Preparations and contingency measures by Government were set out in December 2018 in the Government&rsquo;s Contingency Action Plan for a No Deal Brexit and subsequently updated in July 2019.</p><p>In the case of my own Department I secured, in budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019, significant additional resources for my Department and the enterprise and regulatory agencies under my remit to ensure that they can work with businesses to prepare for Brexit.</p><p>Preparations for a No Deal Brexit occupy the highest priority across Government and Budget 2020 is based on the assumption of a No Deal Brexit. From a business perspective, the focus is on providing targeted, temporary measures for the most impacted sectors and regions i.e. those in vulnerable but viable employment. But there should be no doubt that while the Government has put a range of mitigation measures in place, there will be serious disruption in a No Deal Brexit. </p><p>In my own Department, through our enterprise agencies, we have put in place a full range of supports, schemes and advice to ensure that businesses across the country are prepared for the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU. </p><p>Key business supports include a range of assistance programmes available through the Local Enterprise Offices, including Technical Assistance for Micro-Enterprises; the Lean for Micro Programme; the Innovation and Investment Fund; and a Brexit Mentoring Programme. The LEOs also provide Customs Training Workshops that provide businesses with a better understanding of the potential impacts, formalities and procedures to be adopted when trading with a country which is outside the Single Market and Custom Unions.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland are key providers of a range of supports &ndash; through their SME Scorecard, Be Prepared Grants, Act on Programme and Market Discovery Fund, amongst other supports. </p><p>InterTradeIreland helps companies to prepare for Brexit through a range of supports and services suited to all businesses no matter what stage they are at with their Brexit plans. Key measures include Brexit Planning Vouchers, Implementation Vouchers and a range of Brexit advisory services. </p><p>The Department, working with other key stakeholders has also put in place a range of Brexit specific measures to enhance access to finance through, for example, the Brexit Loan Scheme (which provides affordable working capital to firms impacted by Brexit); the Future Growth Loan Scheme which provides a longer-term facility to support capital investment; and the Rescue and Restructuring Scheme which is available to provide restructuring support to undertakings in severe financial difficulties as a result of Brexit.</p><p>In addition, responding to the needs of businesses trading with the UK, we have put in place the <b><i>Clear Customs </i></b>initiative which offers eligible customs agents, customs intermediaries and affected businesses a free training programme to build capacity in the customs sector. Additional support of &euro;6,000 per trainee will be available through Enterprise Ireland to participating eligible companies to assist with the costs of recruiting and assigning new staff to undertake training and take up new customs roles.  </p><p>The Department is also leading negotiations with the European Commission DG Competition, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other colleagues, on relevant State Aid issues.</p><p>We continue to enhance the resources of the Department&rsquo;s regulatory agencies, to ensure that they are sufficiently resourced to fulfil their mandates, which are vital to the efficient functioning of the economy and which are essential to the maintenance of the Single Market.</p><p>Of course while Government can put in place support measures for businesses, there are specific actions too that firms must take themselves. With just over three weeks until 31 October, there are 9 steps that businesses, large and small, should take and these are outlined in a booklet entitled &ldquo;Getting Your Business Brexit Ready: Practical Steps&rdquo; which was launched in September 2019. The booklet provides a comprehensive overview for businesses on the core steps they should take to prepare for Brexit and is available at . </p><p>To further assist firms, my own Department developed a checklist of the key actions for businesses to consider to be Brexit prepared. The checklist is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>To promote and build awareness of the need for businesses to prepare for Brexit, working in collaboration with the Accountancy Bodies of Ireland, I held four Brexit briefing events in July and September, covering a number of counties in the border regions that are likely to be most impacted by Brexit.  These Brexit events covered a broad range of important topics to help businesses prepare for Brexit such as customs, supply chain, cashflow and product conformity. </p><p>In addition, the enterprise and regulatory agencies under my Department have been working closely with businesses for months through their own engagement campaigns and client clinics. These include Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Boards, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), the Health and Safety Authority, the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB), the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission as well as InterTrade Ireland.</p><p>As the Brexit deadline of 31 October 2019 draws nearer, I am very conscious of the urgent need for businesses to take action to prepare and plan for Brexit, despite continuing political uncertainty. </p><p>I recently asked my officials to contact over 220,000 companies listed with the Companies Registration Office (CRO) to advise them of the array of supports and the organisations available to assist them with their Brexit preparations. This latest initiative through the CRO was just one of the many channels and campaigns that my Department has been engaged in to communicate with businesses to get out the key messages in terms of steps to take to prepare for Brexit.</p></reply>

Export-led growth and foreign direct investment have been cornerstones of successive Governments' economic and trade policies.</p>  <p>  As Ireland has benefitted immensely from our export orientated enterprises trading across the globe, we fully support a multilateral, rules-based, global trading system, as embodied in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).  An effective WTO dispute settlement system is an essential element of this order.</p>  <p>  As International Trade Policy is a competence of the EU Commission under the EU Treaties, the EU Commission takes the lead on WTO matters taking into account the views of individual Member States and the collective good of the Union. Therefore, Ireland continues to be fully engaged with the Commission on the area of WTO reform.</p>  <p>  One of the most imminent threats facing the WTO is acknowledged to be the impasse with the Appellate Body as a result of the continued veto by the United States of the appointment of Appellate Body Panel Members. This continued vetoing of appointments to the Appellate Body means that it will officially cease functioning after 10 December 2019, when there will be only one panel member remaining.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has been very active in attempts to resolve the Appellate Body impasse and, more generally, to lead on essential WTO reform. In that regard, the Commission published a &ldquo;concept paper&rdquo; on WTO reform on 18 January 2018. More recently, an informal process to examine the issues raised by the United States and others was established and chaired by New Zealand WTO Ambassador David Walker, the current Chairman of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body. Ambassador Walker presented a set of possible "landing zones" on reform to the General Council of the WTO in July of this year.  And Ambassador Walker, with full EU support, continues to engage with WTO members to resolve the impasse. The European Commission has continued to engage with other like-minded WTO members to encourage reform as part of this process.  </p>  <p>  Should the Appellate Body cease to function after December 2019, the EU has proposed an Interim Arbitration Agreement process grounded in the framework of Article 25 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding of the WTO. The EU hopes to agree, on a bilateral, case-by-case, basis with countries with whom it may, from time to time, have trade disputes to agree to operate under this Interim Arrangement. </p>  <p>  In discussions by EU Trade Ministers in Council, I have strongly supported the Commission's proactive engagement on WTO Reform, with officials in my Department and on assignment to our Permanent Mission to the UN and WTO in Geneva actively promoting Ireland's and the EU's interests in maintaining and improving the multilateral, rules-based, international trade order embodied in the WTO.</p>  <p>  Finally, I should add that EU Commission President-elect, Ursula von der Leyen, in her "Mission Letter" to Commissioner Phil Hogan, who has been nominated as the next Trade Commissioner, highlights WTO Reform as one of the key priorities for Commissioner Hogan's term, thereby, once again, making clear the EU's commitment to the multilateral, rules-based, global order for world trade.  </p></reply>

In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified. </p>  <p>  The Irish exporting landscape is strong and companies in Ireland are succeeding in winning business worldwide for their products and services.  Enterprise Ireland client companies achieved record levels of exports in 2018 of &euro;23.8bn, against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. In 2018, the Eurozone region, which is a key focus of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s diversification strategy, saw growth of 7.6% to &euro;4.8bn, with Germany, France and the Netherlands each exceeding &euro;1bn in exports.  Exports to North America increased from &euro;3.87bn in 2017 to &euro;4.08bn in 2018, an increase of 5.5%.   Our Enterprise agencies are now opening new offices around the world to support our companies in competing and thriving in global markets.  </p>  <p>  Ministerial-led Trade Missions support the Government's major drive towards market diversification.  The majority of trade missions are taking place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represent the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies.   These Trade Missions focus on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences.   </p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. The EU has successfully concluded a number of important trade agreements with trading partners and is in the process of negotiating or upgrading its agreements with many more. The existing suite of EU Free Trade Agreements and new trade deals will continue to be very important for Ireland. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities. </p></reply>

This engagement helps to inform the policies and strategies that will assist our enterprises in overcoming business impediments and to avail of opportunities in domestic and international markets.</p>  <p>  My Department, through its agencies, provide a wide range of supports to enable companies to consolidate market share and also to become more competitive and to operate in international markets.  </p>  <p>  A key strategic priority of Enterprise Ireland has been to increase the diversification of client companies exports into new markets, with two-thirds of exports to go beyond the UK by 2020.  This is particularly important in the context of Brexit. The proportion of exports to the UK has reduced by 10% to one-third of exports over the last ten years, reflecting the success Irish companies are having in substantially increasing and broadening their exports to other international markets which has resulted in strong export and employment growth. Exports by EI supported companies have doubled to markets outside the UK since 2008.  </p>  <p>  EI clients' exports for 2018 rose for a ninth consecutive year, and now stand at &euro;23.8 billion, the highest level in the history of the State.  This represents a 6% increase on 2017, and a &euro;10.9 billion increase in exports since 2009. In relation to employment, as of the end of 2018 a total of 215,207 people are now employed by Enterprise Ireland supported companies. This is the highest in the history of the agency.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to promote high level international events including trade missions which support the goal of securing high level market access for Irish companies.  </p>  <p>  In March 2017, my department launched the Regional Enterprise Development Fund (REDF).  The REDF is a &euro;60m competitive fund complementary to the Regional Enterprise Plans with the overarching aim of driving enterprise development and job creation in each region throughout Ireland. The Fund is administered for my Department by Enterprise Ireland and it is aimed at supporting collaborative and innovative projects that can have a significant impact on enterprise development and help to sustain and add to employment at a national, regional and county level.</p>  <p>  During 2017 and 2018, 42 projects have been awarded funding as part of Government initiatives under Project Ireland 2040, over two completed Calls for Proposals worth a total of almost &euro;60m, with collaborative projects supported in every region.  Call Three of the Fund closed on 25 September last. </p>  <p>  The Local enterprise Offices (LEOs) are the "first stop shop" for advice on starting and growing a business locally.  In 2018, 8,007 new jobs (gross) and 3,656 jobs (net) were created by LEO-backed client companies, with jobs growth across every LEO area.  At the end of 2018 there were 36,666 people employed by 7,164 small businesses and start-ups that had received financial assistance from the Local Enterprise Offices.</p>  <p>  The Government is nevertheless conscious of our need to also continue attracting FDI.   IDA Ireland continues to work with their client companies and prospective clients to promote Ireland as an excellent location to do business. FDI companies have a hugely positive effect on the local economy.   Direct employment of 229,057 jobs along with indirect employment of a further 183,246 jobs translates to a total of 412,303 jobs supported by FDI in Ireland at the end of 2018.</p></reply>

There are now over 229,000 people employed in IDA Ireland client companies. Last year alone IDA Ireland won 265 projects, compared with 237 in 2017.  Within this figure, a record number of 134 were from new companies investing in Ireland for the first time, which represented an increase of 20% over 2017. </p>  <p>  The release in June of the IDA's mid-year results for 2019 further demonstrated that the pipeline of FDI into Ireland remains strong, with confirmation of 13,500 job approvals and 140 investments secured. There have been a number of significant investments in 2019 across all regions including 150 jobs by Meissner in Castlebar, 100 new positions at JRI America in Tralee and 75 new jobs at Greenfield Global in Portlaoise.  </p>  <p>  It is therefore clear that Ireland remains attractive to overseas investors. Our key selling points include our talented workforce, pro-enterprise policy environment and continuing membership of the European Union. Our track record as a proven successful home for overseas firms is also important. </p>  <p>  However, we cannot take future FDI success for granted. That is why the Government is working hard to strengthen the competitiveness of the economy and ensure that Ireland remains attractive to overseas investors. Steps are also being taken to diversify further our sources of investment, including through the expansion of the IDA presence overseas.</p></reply>

The NTPF procures capacity for each of the procedures identified in the Action Plan, including cataract procedures, in both private hospitals and public hospitals. The Action Plan also strikes the appropriate balance between maximising the number of patients treated in both public and private capacity, as appropriate, and ensuring the best return for the taxpayer. </p><p>Cataracts were also one of the specialties targeted by the NTPF under the Inpatient Day Case Action Plan for 2018, and by end of August 2019, the number of people waiting nationally for a cataract procedure had almost halved, from 10,024 in July 2017 to 5,528. In this same period, there has also been a reduction of 88% in the number of patients waiting over 9 months for a cataract operation. Further details of the reduction in the number of people waiting, by time band, is provided below. </p><p>Furthermore, as part of the IPDC Action Plan 2018, a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre was opened by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital, in November 2018. This initiative continues to have a positive impact in reducing waiting times for patients waiting for cataract procedures, especially in the mid-west. Given the central location of Nenagh Hospital it is envisaged that, in time, it has the potential to provide capacity for cataract surgery for patients on waiting lists in public hospitals in the surrounding geographical areas.</p><p>In addition, in line with the objectives of Sl&aacute;intecare, I have asked the HSE and NTPF to work together this year with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. A Working Group comprised of representatives from the HSE, NTPF, and Departmental officials, has been established to examine ways of improving access for patients waiting for scheduled care. Part of this work includes examining initiatives which would move care to the most appropriate setting, and at the lowest level of complexity, such as providing ophthalmology services in the community.</p><p>The following table provides details of the national waiting list for cataract surgery at the end of August 2019.<table><tr><th></th><th>Total</th><th>&amp;gt; 3 Mths</th><th>&amp;gt; 6 Mths</th><th>&amp;gt; 9 Mths</th><th>&amp;gt; 12 Mths</th><th>&amp;gt;18 Mths</th></tr><tr><td>End July 2017 </td><td>10,024</td><td>7,967</td><td>6,060</td><td>4,371</td><td>2,784</td><td>629</td></tr><tr><td>End December 2018</td><td>6,440</td><td>3,607</td><td>1,426</td><td>554</td><td>276</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>End Aug 2019</td><td>5,528</td><td>3,173</td><td>1,510</td><td>527</td><td>201</td><td>62</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These issues do not exist in isolation, and can only be addressed through a multi-faceted, intersectoral approach.  <i>Healthy Ireland, A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025</i>, launched in 2013, is the national framework for action to improve the health and wellbeing of the country over the coming generation.  It takes a &ldquo;whole of Government&rdquo; and &ldquo;whole of society&rdquo; approach to improving health and wellbeing, which is based on international experience and thinking in addressing the broad social determinants of health.  Through the Healthy Ireland Framework and its constituent policies including <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>, <i>A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan </i>and <i>Get Ireland Active! National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland</i>, actions are being progressed in a number of areas to address the root causes of health problems including cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Raising awareness among the population and engaging citizens and communities in improving their own health is an important part of the Healthy Ireland agenda. The current Healthy Ireland communications and citizen engagement campaign aims to encourage people to make better health choices using three main themes - healthy eating, physical activity and mental wellbeing - all relevant to preventing cardiovascular disease, and signposts them to trusted sources of information and support to help make positive lifestyle changes.</p></reply>

IFI also has to have regard to EU legislation, most notably the Habitats Directive under which salmon are protected. </p>  <p>  Scientific and management assessments use an average of the 5 years of data to estimate expected returns to ensure that a good or bad year does not have a disproportionate impact on the stock assessment in any single year.</p>  <p>  Fisheries are only open to harvest where their individual conservation limit is sufficiently exceeded to safeguard the reproductive capacity of the unique stock. The conservation limit is the number of adult salmon required to maintain a healthy stock.  The Owenascaul River is not closed to angling activity and has been open for catch and release angling since 2012. The river has a salmon conservation limit of 181 fish and the latest assessment is that the river is meeting 22% of its conservation limit. Electro-fishing surveys on the river in recent years have revealed a good average juvenile salmon density of 16.9 salmon fry. This is above the management threshold index of 15 salmon fry average where a river may be open for catch and release angling. The river has remained open for catch and release angling since 2012 based on juvenile salmon electro-fishing results. The river will not be open for harvesting of salmon until it meets is salmon conservation limit.</p>  <p>  The Ballyseedy River is more commonly known as the River Lee in Kerry. The Scientific Group determined in 2007 that salmon rivers, such as the Lee, where rod catches were less than 10 salmon annually in the preceding 5 year period would remain closed on a precautionary basis until additional information is made available to assess salmon stock status relative to their Conservation Limits. This is consistent with responsibilities under the EU Habitats Directive which identifies salmon as a protected species.</p>  <p>  Electro-fishing of juvenile salmon was undertaken most recently on the Lee in 2014 to provide an alternative scientific means of assessing the state of the stock. This recorded an average salmon fry (juvenile) count of 0.7 fry which is considerably below the management threshold index of an average salmon fry of 15 for a river to be open even for catch and release angling. I am advised by IFI that the stock will be kept under review and electro-fishing will be undertaken in 2020 to determine the current juvenile salmon density.</p></reply>

The Map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. The AMBER area represents the parts of the country where commercial operators have no plans to build high speed broadband networks.</p><p>-  Premises in the AMBER area will be provided with high Speed Broadband through a State Intervention. </p><p>-  The BLUE area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services. </p><p>-  The LIGHT BLUE area represents eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017. </p><p>Ballymore Eustace comprises a number of townlands. The table below outlines the number of premises in each of the townlands where access to a high speed broadband connection is, or will be, delivered by commercial operators (BLUE/LIGHT BLUE) and those where access to this vital service will be delivered under the State led intervention (AMBER).<table><tr><th>Townland Name</th><th>AMBER<br /><br />Premises within the NBP State Intervention Area</th><th>BLUE<br /><br />Premises within Commercial Operator&rsquo;s Area</th><th>LIGHT BLUE<br /><br />Premises within eir's commercial rural deployment</th></tr><tr><td>Ballymore Eustace East</td><td>18% (48)</td><td>81% (214)</td><td>1% (1)</td></tr><tr><td>Ballymore Eustace West</td><td>2% (1)</td><td>98% (65)</td><td>0% (0)</td></tr><tr><td>Tinnycross</td><td>0% (0)</td><td>93% (14)</td><td>7% (1)</td></tr><tr><td>Bishopslane</td><td>5% (1)</td><td>95% (20)</td><td>0% (0)</td></tr><tr><td>Bishopsland (Naas South By)</td><td>11% (6)</td><td>89% (48)</td><td>0% (0)</td></tr><tr><td>Broadleas Commons</td><td>36% (53)</td><td>64% (96)</td><td>0% (0)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>19% (109)</td><td>80% (457)</td><td>1% (2)</td></tr></table></p><p>Of the 568 premises in Ballymore Eustace, 457 or 80% now have access to high speed broadband. Another 2 will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment. The remaining 109 premises in the area will receive access to high speed broadband through the State intervention. </p><p>The State intervention is the subject of the procurement process to engage a company to build, operate and maintain the NBP State intervention network. In May I brought a recommendation to Government to confer Preferred Bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the NBP procurement process and Government agreed to this. </p><p>The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract to the Bidder. This award is subject to contract close. The finalisation of financial closure and legal requirements are progressing towards contract award. Deployment of the NBP State Intervention network will commence shortly after that. </p><p>The Bidder has indicated that the NBP State intervention will take an estimated 7 years from the beginning of deployment.</p><p>A deployment plan will be made available by the Bidder once the contract is signed. In the first year of roll out, the Bidder will deploy approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) across all counties. It is anticipated that between 7 and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county. BCPs will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations. </p><p>The Bidder is aiming to pass 133,000 premises at the end of the second year, with 70-100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll out is completed.</p><p>Work continues on finalising the contract and in parallel to this work, I am considering the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Communications Committee report which was published recently. I will bring my deliberations of the report to Government in due course.</p><p>Where a citizen living in a Blue area is unable to obtain a high speed broadband service, I would encourage them to email my Department at broadband@dccae.gov.ie with their Eircode and details of the service providers they have contacted and the issues encountered in respect of accessing high speed broadband.</p></reply>

The procurement process is ongoing and continues until contract award.    The Government Decision of 7 May 2019 means that it is intended to award the State Intervention contract for the NBP to the Bidder. This award is subject to the completion of the final stage of the procurement process, including finalisation of financial and legal documents. </p>  <p>  Not proceeding to a contract would involve significant opportunity cost for the State and its citizens. Firstly, it would at best result in a delay of a number of years in the delivery of a future proofed high speed broadband service to the 1.1 million citizens in the intervention Area and would also introduce considerable uncertainty as to whether or not some premises would be left behind. In addition, the analysis carried out suggests that any alternative option may be more costly than that to be delivered under the existing NBP draft contract. </p></reply>

They are intended to help the EU achieve its energy policy and climate objectives: affordable, secure and sustainable energy for all EU citizens. The majority of PCI projects are electricity or gas interconnection projects but other types of project such as LNG, specific storage and smart grid technologies are also open to apply. The majority of projects are public in nature, i.e. promoted by state bodies such as network operators, but merchant &ndash; or private - projects are also open to apply.    The selection of PCIs is underpinned by an EU Commission-led evaluation process in accordance with the requirements of EU Regulation 347/2013. Project promoters submit their projects into this process. Member States impacted by those applicant projects, together with the EU Commission, decide whether or not to support them. Projects that are successful in the process will be listed in published PCI lists. The fourth such list is due to be adopted formally in early 2020. </p>  <p>  Among the benefits of achieving PCI status is access &ndash; subject to successful application - to financial support via the EU Commission&rsquo;s Connecting Europe Facility.

The production of a tourism satellite account would further develop our understanding of the economic impact of tourism.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement recognises the importance of identifying additional sources of data that can be harnessed to provide enhanced understanding of tourism performance and its economic contribution. Therefore, an action has been included in the Tourism Action Plan 2019-2021 to ensure that the development of a tourism satellite account for Ireland will be progressed by the CSO in order to gauge how important tourism is to our economy. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the CSO to bring this action to a successful conclusion. I believe that a Tourism Satellite Account for Ireland is the next logical step in the development and progression of tourism statistics.</p></reply>

Since 2015, &euro;41m has been invested in SFZ by SCP which has resulted in the delivery of over 650,000 square feet of new or upgraded office, manufacturing and warehouse facilities with occupancy rates now over 90%.    SFZ is now home to 170 companies employing over 8,000 people.</p>  <p>  In 2018 the Government published Project 2040.

The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts and the making of valuations for rating is his sole responsibility. As Minister, I have no function in decisions in this regard. </p><p>Under the relevant legislation,, there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Commissioner of Valuation multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of each local authority. </p><p>Having a modern valuation base is very important for the levying of commercial rates on a fair and equitable basis across all economic sectors. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. A national revaluation programme is well underway and revisions of valuations can take place when the relevant circumstances of a rateable property occur.</p><p>A valuation for commercial rates purposes is arrived at by estimating the <i>Net Annual Value</i>(NAV) of the property in question, at a specified valuation date. The term &ldquo;net annual value&rdquo; is defined in section 48 of the Valuation Act 2001 and the NAV is applied to all rateable properties and classes of business on a nationwide basis.</p><p>Estimating the NAV of a rateable property is an evidence-based exercise. I am informed that, during a revaluation, the Valuation Office analyses relevant market rental transactions for all rateable properties, in accordance with the legislation, best practice internationally as set out in published Practice Guidance Notes, well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the independent Valuation Tribunal and the Courts. The conclusions drawn from that analysis are applied to similarly circumstanced property using the &ldquo;comparative&rdquo; method of valuation which, as the name implies, employs direct comparison with other similar properties. </p><p>All valuations determined for rating purposes under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001-2015 must reflect open market rental values at the valuation date specified in the relevant Valuation Order made by the Commissioner of Valuation, and must also endeavour to be correct, equitable and uniform. These are fundamental principles of any modern system of rateable valuation and are specifically enshrined since 2015 in the Valuation Acts.</p><p>There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property that is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts, 2001-2015. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office. There is also a right of appeal to the Courts on a point of law. Appeals are made on an individual case basis. However, the decision in one case can have relevance in other similar cases.</p></reply>

Where the conditions and size thresholds specified in the exemption class are not complied with or are exceeded, planning permission is required. This Class 31 exemption makes no distinction between the various generations of wireless mobile telecommunications technology. </p><p>These arrangements are considered appropriate for the purpose of supporting the roll-out of a high quality communications service while also taking account of the ongoing technological advances in this area. The legislative provisions are supplemented by planning guidelines entitled the Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structure Guidelines, which originally issued to planning authorities in 1996 and were revised in 2012, and which are available on my Department's website at the following link: .</p></reply>

The receipt of calls from the public for assistance by the fire service is provided on a 'shared service' basis by three Regional Communications Centres (RCCs) at Limerick, Castlebar and Dublin.  </p>  <p>  I have no role in relation to legislation, policy, mobilisation arrangements and operational practices of ambulance services.</p>  <p>  My Department supports fire authorities mainly through setting national policy and co-ordinating its implementation; providing capital funding for fire appliances, emergency equipment and the construction and upgrading of fire stations; centralised training programmes and co-ordination of the development of guidance on operational and other fire service related matters.  </p>  <p>  I understand that all calls for fire service assistance are initially answered by the 999/112 Emergency Call Answering Service (ECAS). Calls for the fire service are then transferred to one of the three RCCs. The operators in the RCC take relevant information from the caller. A Computer-Aided Mobilising System holds data on the Pre-Determined Attendances (PDAs) for each category of incident and every address in the country. </p>  <p>  Once alerted by the RCC, the appropriate response is then decided by each fire service, having regard to national policy, including the PDAs. Where appropriate, the nearest available fire brigade resources and appliances will attend.  Fire service mobilisation can also occur on foot of requests from the other emergency services attending an incident.</p></reply>
