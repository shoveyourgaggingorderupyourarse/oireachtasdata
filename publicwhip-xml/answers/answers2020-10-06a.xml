At present there are 6 Special Advisers working in my Private Office. These staffing levels are in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's Instructions on Ministerial Appointments for the 33rd D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The make-up of my team currently consists of a Chief of Staff at Deputy Secretary level, a Deputy Chief of Staff at Assistant Secretary level, a part-time Economic Adviser at Assistant Secretary level, and 3 Special Advisers at Principal Officer level. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that all of the above appointments are subject to Government approval over the coming weeks following which relevant contracts including salary scale, statements of qualifications and statements of relationship will be laid before the Oireachtas.  </p>  <p>  The Special Advisers working in my office provide briefings and advice on a wide range of policy matters, as well as performing other functions as I may direct from time to time. They liaise with other Special Advisers in each Government Department so that I remain informed on developments across Government. In addition they monitor, facilitate and help ensure delivery of the Government's ambitious work programme and commitments set out in the Programme for Government. </p>  <p>  As outlined in the Programme for Government, a number of reforms have been implemented in order to ensure openness and constructive cooperation within government. These include the establishment of an Office of the T&aacute;naiste and an Office of the Leader of the Green Party within the Department of the Taoiseach, located in Government Buildings. The Special Advisers assigned to me will also work closely with their counterparts to ensure cohesion and good communication across the Government partners.</p>  <p>  Where expenses are incurred by any staff in the performance of duties relating to their brief, my Department pays mileage and travel and subsistence at normal civil service rates.</p></reply>

With a maximum &euro;50,000 available per home, 6,200 new homes can be facilitated.  From the overall approved funding of &euro;127m some &euro;74 million has been approved for 14 projects across Dublin, and the 4 local authorities have indicated an intention to deliver almost 2,200 affordable homes. </p><p>The Government is also committed to driving forward on Cost Rental. I will ensure that the three key projects at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside, Emmet Road, Inchicore and Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, are accelerated and that further projects are brought forward. In parallel, we will finalise the cost rental scheme working with key delivery partners.</p><p>The Land Development Agency is working with stakeholders in assembling key strategic sites in Dublin and other areas. The LDA has a strong development pipeline for social and affordable homes. </p><p>In terms of affordable housing generally, I have confirmed an intention to outline further detailed plans in the autumn.</p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  In February 2016, my Department announced a five-year Fire Services Capital Programme with an allocation of &euro;40 million, based on an annual &euro;8 million allocation, to be used for the purchase of fire appliances and specialist equipment, building or upgrading of prioritised Fire Stations, an upgrade of the Communications and Mobilisation system and improvements to Training Centres.</p>  <p>  The five-year programme proposed the construction/refurbishment of twenty six fire stations. This included sixteen new builds and ten upgrade/refurbishment projects. The programme included a new fire station at New Ross. </p>  <p>  Indeed, Wexford County Council has indicated that New Ross is their number one fire station priority. The Council completed a tender process in December 2019, and in March 2020 my Department received the tender report and cost plan, along with further detail in May 2020. My Department is engaging intensively with Wexford County Council on this project and I expect a decision to be made in the next month that will allow the Council to progress this important project to construction.</p></reply>

This funding stream is for delivery of social housing homes. I would like to make it clear that any funding models that may be advanced for the purposes of measures such as affordable purchase or cost rental, would be distinct from, and additional to, the CALF facility which will remain ring-fenced for social housing purposes.</p>  <p>  With regards to affordable housing, this Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone in Irish society, and this is reflected in the Programme for Government "Our Shared Future".  The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing, and I will outline further plans in terms of affordable housing later in the autumn.</p></reply>

The Manual is available to download from my Department's website.  The relevant weblink is below.</p><p>The Manual is aimed at property owners, members of the public, local authorities and stakeholders in the construction industry who are interested in developing spaces within vacant buildings and bringing them into use for residential purposes.  </p><p>The manual complements new planning regulations - the Planning and Development (Amendment)(No.2) Regulations 2018 - which came into effect on 8 February 2018 and allow for the change of use of certain vacant commercial buildings to domestic use without having to go through the planning process. A copy of the Regulations is available on the Irish Statute Book and the relevant weblink is below.</p><p>A Vacant Homes Unit was established in my Department to drive and co-ordinate actions at central and local government levels in addressing vacancy and to support local authorities in their actions.  </p><p>The Vacant Homes Unit provides support to the Vacant Homes Officers in each of the 31 local authorities who have been mandated to quickly identify vacancy hotspots, particularly in areas where there is a high demand for homes, and to engage with property owners in terms of advising them of the opportunities available, including through the Repair and Leasing Scheme and the Buy and Renew Scheme, to assist in bringing vacant properties into productive use for housing purposes.</p><p>I am satisfied that there are a range of measures and supports available to encourage and facilitate the provision of residential accommodation including the conversion of vacant commercial spaces over retail units for residential use, and I continue to keep this under review.</p></reply>

The NPWS took part in the stakeholder group that contributed to the report produced as a result of that exercise. </p><p>Under the Habitats Directive, Ireland reports to the EU on the conservation status of all habitats and species of European Community interest, as listed in Annexes to the Directive. Such scientific assessment is carried out on a range of representative sites, both within and outside SACs, over a 6&ndash;year cycle. The most recent report was submitted to the EU in 2019 and is available on the NPWS website.</p><p>Two of the listed habitats were surveyed in recent times at the Gearagh. </p><p>The priority habitat &ldquo;Alluvial forests with Alder and Ash&rdquo; is one of the qualifying interests of the Gearagh SAC and a monitoring site for this habitat is located within the SAC. It was most recently surveyed during the 2017-2018 monitoring period. The area, structure and functions, and future prospects of the SAC were all assessed as favourable. No significant negative impacts on the Alluvial forests habitat were recorded. The overall conservation status of the site was assessed as favourable.</p><p>This contrasts with the national conservation status of the Alluvial forests habitat in Ireland, which is considered to be bad, and deteriorating.</p><p>The Gearagh SAC is also listed for the habitat &ldquo;Rivers with muddy banks&rdquo; which has certain characteristic vegetation. The Gearagh was surveyed  in  2018 and in addition to the survey, results of a 2018 botanical survey of the Gearagh were made available to the NPWS by the ESB. </p><p>The habitat was assessed as favourable in the Gearagh and at national level.</p><p>There is one invasive plant species (Tall Flatsedge) that requires monitoring at the Gearagh, but there is no clear evidence that the species is negatively impacting on the habitat. </p><p>These positive findings from scientific survey are indicators of a good management regime.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-06a.34.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100600071#WRC00400"><p>The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provided for a temporary moratorium on tenancy terminations, other than in exceptional and limited cases, and on all increases in rent during the emergency period from 27 March to 1 August 2020.  The emergency measures aimed to assist in restricting the movement of people to suppress the spread of Covid-19 and applied to all tenants, irrespective of their financial circumstances.</p>  <p>  While this Act did have a positive impact in reducing the numbers presenting as homeless, the landlord's right to terminate a tenancy on the grounds in the Residential Tenancies Act was temporarily limited in a bid to suppress the spread of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act  2020 targets enhanced protections to the most vulnerable tenants until 10 January 2021 and respects the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords. As we learn to live with Covid-19, these provisions enable the residential rental sector to resume activity in as near as normal manner as possible.</p>  <p>  With effect from 1 August 2020, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 introduced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears and, as a result, are at risk of losing their tenancy. If a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply. Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021.</p>  <p>  In all other cases, a landlord can again serve a notice of termination. For example, some landlords might need to occupy their rented dwelling or to sell it, possibly on foot of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  These protections are having a significant effect on the level of tenancy termination.  Of the 844 notices of arrears issued since the protections were enacted on 1st August, less than one in four has led to a notice of termination being issued.  One in five tenants has availed of the protections available under the act and their tenancies cannot be terminated before 11th January next year.  The remaining 487 tenancies, representing over 57% of all those who received the 28 day arrears notice, have not received any notice of termination.

My Department supports fire authorities through general policy setting and preparing legislation, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.  </p><p>The Fire Service in Ireland is fortunate to have available to it, in the full-time and retained cadres of staff at all levels, a large number of professional, competent and highly committed personnel. At the moment there are 31 fire authorities which provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures.  Local authorities are the employers of these 3,300 staff engaged at 218 fire stations nationwide, and the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) engages with appropriate staffing representative bodies in relation to overall terms of employment.  Fire services issues are managed in my Department through its National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management (NDFEM). </p><p>I understand that in large urban areas where there is a full-time service, there remains a high level of interest in working in the Fire Service. This is evidenced by the very high number of responses to recruitment campaigns, the most recent of which is underway in Cork. This recruitment drive which is encouraging applications from diverse backgrounds with the slogan <i>Be the Difference</i>, and has just closed to applications on 25th September last.  It is understood however, that the situation outside these areas, with full-time services, can vary. In this regard, local authorities and the LGMA continuously monitor the issue of recruitment and retention and work on developing strategies to address such issues, involving and briefing the NDFEM as appropriate.</p><p>A review of fire services in Ireland resulted in the publication of &quot;Keeping Communities Safe - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland&quot; (KCS) in 2013.  This report was the outcome of a wide-ranging review of fire services in Ireland which was undertaken in 2011/12 and was endorsed as national policy in early 2013.  It is available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>The KCS policy document sets out the overall approach, the methods and the techniques to achieve the objective of keeping communities safe from fire. It concluded that local authorities were best positioned to continue to provide fire services in Ireland.</p><p>Furthermore, an External Validation Group (EVG) commissioned by the Management Board of the NDFEM, visited every fire service in the country as part of a new external validation process arising from implementation of KCS. In April 2016, they published their Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;. It concluded that the public are served well by fire services in Ireland and that the retained fire service model is seen as a particularly effective, flexible and efficient model of community service.  The findings of that process are available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Nonetheless, it was recognised that fire services, both retained and fulltime,  face significant challenges, including tapering down of traditional firefighting activities. </p><p>A follow-up to this process was unfortunately delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, I do expect that work will begin on this in 2021. As part of this process any issues of concern raised, which may include the retention and recruitment of retained firefighters would be examined in conjunction with local authority employers.</p><p>In summary, the broad issue of recruitment and retention in the Fire Service is one that is continously monitored by the Management Board of the NDFEM. I would expect that should the issue become more problematic in the coming period then the Board will act to address this in close consultation with the Local Government sector. The aim as always will be to ensure that the entire country continues to be served effectively going forward into the coming decades by a Fire Service that is equipped to face and meet the challenges of our rapidly changing society.</p></reply>

This is evident in the high number of HAP tenancies that continued to be set-up this year. The 2020 HAP target is for 15,750 additional tenancies and, at the end of Q2 2020, 7,825 HAP tenancies (49% of target) had been established.</p>  <p>  My Department and local authorities are keenly aware of the importance of minimising HAP processing times and the critical need to keep this under review at a local level. My Department has recently communicated this to local authority management through the County and City Management Association. </p>  <p>  Despite difficulties experienced due to Covid-19, local authorities carried out extraordinary work during this time.  Unsurprisingly, measures that were required to be taken in the context of Covid-19 do, however, appear to have had an impact on HAP processing times, particularly in Q2 2020 when average processing time was 40 days. An analysis of more recent data from the HAP SSC indicates a reduction on that average processing time in the period July / August 2020 to 38 days.</p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that any delay in tenants and landlords supplying relevant information, or inaccuracies or missing information, will impact on the processing time of the HAP application. However, in instances where there are delays at the processing stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority. The landlord is, therefore, not penalised for any delay.</p>  <p>  Through our ongoing engagement with local authorities my Department has stressed the need to minimise delays in processing these vital applications to ensure the social housing needs of tenants can be met through the HAP scheme where required. My Department is closely monitoring this situation and will continue to do so over the coming months.</p></reply>

Irish Water is responsible for monitoring the quality of public water supplies while local authorities are responsible for monitoring the quality of water provided by other suppliers.  The role of the EPA in relation to public drinking water supplies is set out in the European Union (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014 (as amended).  </p><p>Under these regulations, the EPA can direct Irish Water to improve the management or quality of a public water supply. The regulations also require Irish Water to notify the EPA of drinking water quality failures or risk to public health from a public water supply.</p><p>In their role as the supervisory authority, the EPA also carries out audits of public water supplies. These audits are an important way of checking how water suppliers are performing in compliance with Drinking Water Regulations and examine a number of areas including the water source, the water treatment works, management of the distribution system, sampling and analytical methods used and consumer contacts.</p><p>Where the EPA requires Irish Water to take corrective action to ensure the safety and security of a supply, it may place the supply on the EPA&rsquo;s Remedial Action List (RAL). The RAL is a register of public water supplies with the most serious deficiencies and where remedial action is required to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Drinking Water Regulations. The EPA uses the RAL to focus attention on resolving any deficiencies in public water supplies in order to ensure a supply of clean and wholesome drinking water.</p><p>For the supplies on the RAL, the EPA will instruct Irish Water to submit an action programme for the improvement of each of these water supplies and where action programmes have not been prepared or implemented to the satisfaction of the EPA, it will implement enforcement proceedings. This includes issuing legally binding Directions requiring specific work to be carried out to ensure the safety and security of a water supply and ultimately the EPA may take court action, when necessary and in accordance with its enforcement policy.</p><p>The EPA also produces an annual Public Supply Drinking Water Report and Private Supply Drinking Water Report, which provide an overview of the quality of drinking water in public and private supplies. The reports are based on the assessment of monitoring results reported to the EPA by Irish Water and the local authorities, and on EPA and local authority enforcement activities. </p><p>The EPA&rsquo;s latest report &lsquo;Drinking Water Quality in Public Supplies 2019&rsquo; published in July, shows that overall our water supplies are safe, with over 99% of water samples complying with safety limits. The report also highlights a further reduction in the number of supplies on the EPA&rsquo;s remedial action list. Copies of the EPA's Drinking Water Reports for Public Supplies and Private Water Supplies are available on the EPA website at and in the Oireachtas library.</p><p>While the quality of our drinking water supplies remains very high, the EPA has also set out the risks and challenges that remain, with Irish Water also recognising that &ldquo;much more remains to be done&rdquo;.  Our entire water system needs substantial and sustained investment over a number of investment cycles to fully improve performance and resilience.  Investment will also need to deliver new water capacity for our growing population and to deal with the increasing impacts of climate change.  </p><p>Prioritising the order of this work, and the associated investment, involves ongoing engagement between Irish Water and its regulators (the EPA and Irish Water's economic regulator, the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities) to ensure an effective and efficient delivery of necessary water quality outcomes and to improve overall water-system resilience.</p></reply>

These matters are under active consideration in my Department.  Local authorities have been requested to capture all related costs in their financial systems to aid financial analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the local government sector.</p>  <p>  In order to support the sector generally, my Department continues to keep income, expenditure and cash flow under review and will continue to work with all local authorities, both collectively and individually, on issues arising.   </p>  <p>  To support both the sector and the business community, &euro;600m has been allocated by Government, as part of the July Stimulus package, to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates for six months for eligible businesses badly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This takes the form of a credit in lieu of rates. </p>  <p>  It is important to take account of the important role of elected members in the financial affairs of local authorities. The elected members have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting the annual budget and authorising borrowing. The Local Government Act 2001 requires that local authorities prepare their annual budgets in a statutory format. This format requires that budgeted expenditure equals budgeted income. The cost of servicing any existing loans must also be included in the annual budget and it is a matter for the local authority to engage with lenders on the cost of servicing such loans.</p></reply>

The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p><p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way.

The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.  </p><p>In terms of affordable housing for purchase, the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable new housing for purchase on local authority lands is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced in June 2018.</p><p>Under my Department's Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), &euro;310 million has been allocated to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable new homes for purchase or rent in those areas where local authorities have identified an affordability challenge and the viability to deliver homes and below open market purchase prices.  Funding under the SSF is available for new-build homes on local authority land.  With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, Serviced Sites funding of &euro;127 million has been approved in principle in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes.</p><p>In relation to the rental sector, the Programme for Government also commits to improving security and affordability for renters. To help achieve that, we are developing a Cost Rental model for delivery of housing that creates affordability for tenants and a sustainable model for construction and management of homes. Cost Rental is housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. Cost Rental is not intended to overlap with or replace traditional social housing for low-income households. </p><p>Work to outline the consistent and sustainable delivery of Cost Rental at scale is underway through an inter-departmental multi-agency Cost Rental Working Group, and is being assisted by an external research project sponsored by the European Investment Bank on behalf of my Department.  Furthermore, three initial Cost Rental projects are already being progressed, including 50 units at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside, that is currently under construction, while sites at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate) and Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, are at the design phase.  </p><p>In addition, the Land Development Agency (LDA) is examining the potential to deliver Cost Rental homes at scale from its initial portfolio of eight sites and the broader State land bank. My Department is working closely with the LDA in relation to policy development, with the aim of assisting the LDA in its development of Cost Rental projects.</p><p>Cost Rental will help the LDA to fulfil the Public Lands Affordability Requirement, the Government&rsquo;s decision that at least 30% of the housing potential of surplus State lands should be delivered as affordable housing.</p><p>Other measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.  As part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus plan, an enhanced version of the Help-to-Buy scheme was announced. This will allow first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 paid in income tax and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available at .</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build.  This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan.  Full details of the scheme are available at .</p><p>In terms of affordable housing more generally, I will outline my detailed plans in the near future, taking account of progress to date under the SSF, experience from these Cost Rental pilots, a number of other measures, as well as the input of key delivery partners.</p></reply>

Irish Water&rsquo;s primary function is to provide clean safe drinking water to customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that our waste water networks require ongoing and sustained investment to bring these up to the required standard of treatment; to deal with population growth; and to adapt to the impacts of climate change. In this regard, significant investment in waste water infrastructure continues and is provided for in the Irish Water Strategic Funding Plan. It is estimated that &euro;1.9bn will be invested in waste water projects between 2019 to 2024. </p>  <p>  In relation to Dublin Bay, the EPA has classified the water quality as &lsquo;good&rsquo; under the water framework directive for the period 2013 to 2018, an improvement on the &lsquo;moderate&rsquo; status achieved during the 2007 to 2009 period.</p>  <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s most recent bathing water quality report, released earlier this year, also highlights the encouraging progress being made in improving bathing waters across the country and I was particularly pleased to see the continual increase in the number of bathing waters meeting or exceeding the minimum water quality requirements.</p>  <p>  However, there are instances of bathing water quality issues in some specific areas of Dublin Bay, with Merrion Strand recently delisted as a bathing water. There are multi-faceted sources of pollution that may be impacting on the bathing water quality in Dublin Bay. This includes sewer misconnections to surface water drains and streams, sewer storm water overflows, wildlife and dog-fouling.  Through a recently created task force, my Department, Dublin City Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Irish Water are currently working together to diagnose the root-causes and put in place programmes to solve these issues. </p>  <p>  In addition to these pressures, the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant was originally designed and built to treat wastewater for a population equivalent of 1.64 million and is now overloaded. In response, Irish Water is currently undertaking a major upgrade of the plant. This upgrade will increase the capacity of the plant to cater for the growing population of the Greater Dublin Area and will address compliance with EU law.  Planning permission was granted for the project in April 2019, and the project is currently underway. </p>  <p>  Given a legacy of underinvestment in water services infrastructure in Ireland, the scale of remedial work necessary in our water system will take a number years and investment cycles to fully resolve.  The Government has committed to ambitious funding of Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plans for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis.  The Government plans to deliver the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

We will put affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.  To this end, I can confirm that both Affordable Purchase and Cost Rental homes will be delivered on State and public lands through a number of channels, including by local authorities and the Land Development Agency.</p><p>Under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), &euro;310 million has been allocated to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable homes on local authority lands.  With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, Serviced Sites funding of &euro;127 million has been approved in principle in support of 35 projects across 14 local authorities which have the capacity to deliver 3,200 more affordable homes.  Details of these projects can be found at the following links:</p><p>In relation to the rental sector, the Programme for Government also commits to the development of the Cost Rental model to improve security and affordability for renters. Cost Rental is not intended to overlap with or replace traditional social housing for low-income households. It is public housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. </p><p>Work to outline the consistent and sustainable delivery of Cost Rental at scale is being assisted by an external research project sponsored by the European Investment Bank (EIB) on behalf of my Department. Furthermore, three initial Cost Rental projects are already being progressed, including 50 units at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside, that are currently under construction, while sites at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate) and Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, are at the design phase.  I can also confirm that the Land Development Agency is progressing a significant development pipeline including many thousands of both Cost Rental and Affordable Purchase homes across a range of its sites. </p><p>Other measures such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan are also available to eligible purchasers nationally to make home ownership more affordable.  As part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus plan, an enhanced version of the Help-to-Buy scheme was announced. This will allow first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 in income tax paid and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available at .</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build. This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan.  Full details of the scheme are available at </p><p>In terms of affordable housing more generally, I will outline my detailed plans in the near future, taking account of progress to date under the SSF, experience from these Cost Rental pilots, a number of other measures, as well as the input of key delivery partners.</p></reply>

This allows qualified applicants to 'register an interest' in available homes. </p><p>Applicants can act on their own initiative to respond to adverts and express an interest in dwellings that they would like to live in, rather than waiting for an authority to offer them a dwelling. This approach offers more choice and involvement for applicant households in selecting a new home, thereby reducing the likelihood of a refusal, and helping to build sustainable tenancies and stable communities.</p><p>  The Social Housing Allocation (Amendment) Regulations 2016 required all local authorities, if they had not already done so, to provide for CBL as a method of allocation for social housing in their allocation schemes by the end of 2016. The way in which CBL is implemented, including decisions on which properties are to be offered through it, is a matter for the individual authority concerned. However, it must be done in accordance with the relevant regulations and their own scheme of priority.</p><p>  Given the clear benefits offered by CBL, my Department continues to liaise with the local authorities to ensure that it is implemented as widely as possible across the country and has undertaken a number of surveys in both 2017 and 2018 to determine its uptake and impact.  Data garnered through these surveys has shown that over half of all local authorities are operating a CBL system while others are in the process of running pilot schemes with a view to wider roll out in their respective areas. Of those authorities that are operating CBL the expressed view is that it is having a positive effect on how they allocate houses. The data also shows that where CBL is in operation the rate of refusals has dropped.</p><p>  My Department hosted a workshop on CBL with representatives from the local authority sector on 15 November 2019. The aim of the workshop was to bring relevant officials from local authorities together and to provide a forum to discuss the potential for increasing the use of CBL across the State. The workshop also provided an opportunity to those authorities who, for various reasons, are not operating CBL to discuss the issues arising for their authorities.</p><p>  The Programme for Government commits to developing a website to allow for CBL on a nationwide basis and my Department is working with the Local Government Management Association and the County and City Managers Association to progress this.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation and related services rests with individual local authorities.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing Act 1988 it is a matter for each local authority to determine whether a person is regarded as homeless; section 2 of the Act sets out the requirements in this regard.

Frontline conservation rangers are deployed through a regional structure and assignments are determined in light of Departmental business needs and priorities. The Department  is currently working with the Public Appointments Service (PAS), with a view to establishing  a new  recruitment panel for Conservation Rangers.</p>  <p>  It is to be noted that it is not only officers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service that have a role in relation to wildlife crime.  Officers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also authorised under the Wildlife Acts to investigate and prosecute wildlife crimes and additional prosecutions have also been taken by the Gardai in this regard. </p>  <p>  While bringing perpetrators of crime to justice is important, the success of dealing with wildlife crime cannot be judged on this alone, as ensuring compliance in the first instance is clearly of critical importance.</p></reply>

Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021.</p><p>My Department has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords. </p><p>  This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears.

The RTB will acknowledge receipt to the landlord and tenant and provide the tenant with written information to enable them to get advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and on the income and other supports available.

If the problem cannot be resolved, registered landlords and all tenants can apply to the RTB for dispute resolution. Further information is available on .</p><p>My Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) operate a programme of collaborative research principally focused on housing economics. Under this programme, researchers from the Institute and my Department prepared a research paper exploring the short-run implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on the private rental market. The research paper is focused on rental payment affordability and the potential incidence of arrears during the first three months of the pandemic among non-supported private market renting households, that is, among renting households which do not receive a housing subsidy. Changes in consumption patterns arising from public health measures are also considered in the paper. The research findings do not identify a significant rent arrears problem emerging during the first three months of the pandemic.</p><p><i>Principal Findings on Affordability</i></p><p>- Prior to Covid-19; circa one-in-three or approximately 70,000 private renter households did not have sufficient income remaining after housing costs to cover a minimum standard of living expenditure prior to the pandemic. The evidence suggests that in the very short run (between <b>mid-March to mid-June 2020</b>), the unique and extraordinary circumstances of the prevailing situation mean the affordability pressures are not likely to have worsened overall. Indeed, some private renter households may be better off.</p><p>- This is due to the fact that short-run changes to expenditure and consumption, which came about mainly as a result of the public health restrictions, are likely to have outweighed the decline in incomes.</p><p>- The research paper finds that the share of households who's after rent income is insufficient to purchase a minimum bundle of goods falls to just under one-in-five (from one-in-three).</p><p>- However, these are very short-term effects and unique to the period in which households have been advised to stay at home and restrict movements.</p><p>- Many non-supported private renters face longer-term structural affordability pressures that are likely to worsen quickly as expenditure requirements (such as on transport and childcare) rebound quicker than incomes.</p><p>- Indeed, the Covid-19 labour market shock has been heavily concentrated in sectors (such as accommodation and food) of the economy whose employees are more likely to be renters than homeowners.</p><p><i>Principal Findings on Missed Payments</i></p><p>- Understanding the level of missed rental payments and arrears (both before and since the pandemic) is exceedingly difficult given the absence of national, real-time data on missed payments.</p><p>- Given the unprecedented nature of the current pandemic, it is very difficult to estimate the trajectory of the actual rate of missed rental payments using historical relationships.</p><p>- Model estimates suggest that there is likely to be an increase in missed payments due to the income and particularly, unemployment shocks faced by certain households. However, this increase in missed payments is likely to be tempered in the short-run due to consumption expenditure falling more rapidly that incomes which reduces the likelihood of missed payments for many households in the short-term. Model estimates suggest a moderate rise in missed payments due to the combination of these factors from 9.8% to 10.8% of households.</p><p>Given the State income supports available, including those available for tenants in arrears, and informed by the evidence provided by research into this area, it would not be appropriate to establish a scheme for write-offs of rents payable in the residential rental sector which plays an important role in providing accommodation for many.</p></reply>

For example approximately 1,100 persons were able to purchase their own home via RIHL mortgages in 2019.  </p>  <p>  This Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone and this is reflected in the Programme for Government.

The emergency measures aimed to urgently assist in restricting the movement of people to suppress the spread of Covid-19 and applied to all tenants, irrespective of their financial circumstances.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act  2020 targets enhanced protections to the most vulnerable tenants until 10 January 2021 and respects the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords. As we learn to live with Covid-19, these provisions enable the residential rental sector to resume activity in as near as normal manner as possible.</p><p>With effect from 1 August 2020, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020 introduced protections for those tenants who are facing rent arrears and, as a result, are at risk of losing their tenancy. If a tenant&rsquo;s ability to pay rent has been impacted by Covid-19 and the tenant meets specific criteria, new procedures and protections apply. Tenants who follow these procedures cannot be required to vacate their rental accommodation before 11 January 2021, and are not required to pay any rent increase in respect of the period ending 10 January 2021.</p><p>My Department has published a guidance document, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020: What this Means for Landlords and Tenants, which sets out exactly what is expected as the rental protections under the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 expire, and provides details on the new protections for tenants in rent arrears and the income and other supports available to tenants and landlords. </p><p>  This guidance document clearly explains the new rent arrears procedure for both landlords and tenants facing rent arrears. The Guidance document is available on the Department's website - www.housing.gov.ie - and on the RTB's website - .</p><p>The RTB has engaged with stakeholders with regard to the recent tenancy protection enhancements and launched a related YouTube video. The RTB also launched targeted advertising campaigns informing the public of the enhanced protections and directing people to its website for more information. The advertising campaigns ran from 15 April until to 1 August 2020 and a mail-shot to tenants and landlords is underway since mid-September.</p></reply>

As the House will be aware, Ireland has always maintained close relations 'across the aisle' in U.S. politics, working in particular to maintain strong bipartisan support for the peace process in Northern Ireland and the continued implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and we will continue to do so. The forthcoming U.S. elections, both for the Presidency and for Congress, are a matter for the American people and for the American people alone. Regardless of the outcome of these elections, we are committed to strengthening relations with the Administration and Congress, as we have always done.  </p>  <p>  On the matter of the protests in the United States, as I have stated previously, I am deeply concerned about the issues of racial inequality and racism that underpin them. I have raised these issues on multiple occasions with the U.S. Ambassador, Edward Crawford, and I continue to call for a de-escalation of tensions and a deepening of engagement at the community and political level. </p>  <p>  I welcome the debate it has opened up, not just in the U.S. but in our own society too and elsewhere, and believe that the stories of those who have experienced racism and exclusion must continue to be heard. I also believe that creating a more inclusive society must be a proactive endeavour, which is why I was delighted to announce during my visit that, from next summer, Ireland will partner with the US Council on International Educational Exchange to support ten students from Minority Serving Institutions in the United States to study here as part of the Frederick Douglass Global Fellowship programme.</p></reply>

I want to make clear that I fully support the European Commission Vice President in carrying out her duties and that Ireland has full trust in the Vice President. The Commission has a role as the guardian of the EU&rsquo;s treaties and I believe that the Vice President&rsquo;s actions are in keeping with this role. It is important that Commissioners are empowered to speak and act independently in the fulfilment of their duties. I understand that President Von der Leyen will respond to Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n in due course. </p>  <p>  Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n&rsquo;s letter to President Von der Leyen came on the eve of the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s first annual report on the rule of law situation across the EU and in all Member States. Ireland welcomes the publication of the Commission&rsquo;s report which forms an important element of the Commission&rsquo;s rule of law mechanism and complements the ongoing work of the Commission, Council and European Parliament on promoting and protecting the rule of law. We look forward to discussion of the report at Council level.  </p>  <p>  As the contents of the report have shown, no Member State is immune from criticism regarding the rule of law, including Ireland. While criticism may sometimes be difficult for Member States to hear and accept, it is important that the Council has an objective basis on which to conduct its dialogue on the rule of law across the Member States and the Commission is best placed to provide that basis.  </p>  <p>  It is important that all Member States remain open to, and encourage, dialogue regarding the rule of law and seek to constructively address concerns raised by the institutions of the Union or fellow Member States.</p></reply>

The US asserted that this triggered a 30 day period for reimposition of UN sanctions. </p>  <p>  However, I note that the US announced its withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018. President Trump&rsquo;s memorandum of 8 May 2018 formalised this position, and since then, the United States Government has consistently taken steps to end its participation in the JCPOA. Consequently, the US is no longer a &ldquo;JCPOA participant state.&rdquo; Accordingly, the US triggering of snapback is incapable of having legal effect. </p>  <p>  It also flows from this that any actions or outcomes based on the US declaration of &ldquo;snapback&rdquo; would also be devoid of legal effect. This is a view shared by all the remaining participants in the agreement, the EU, and the majority of the Members of the Security Council. </p>  <p>  The UN Secretary General also wrote to the President of the Security Council to note that he was not in a position to take any action on the US notification. </p>  <p>  In addition to its approach at the UN, the US has is also imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran. This is a sovereign decision for the US. However, we are concerned by the unilateral imposition of sanctions, which could harm efforts to preserve the JCPOA, and ultimately damage peace and stability in the region.</p>  <p>  Ireland remains committed to the JCPOA, which remains the best available mechanism for preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Ireland is deeply concerned by Iranian breaches of the JCPOA, and calls on it to come swiftly back into full compliance with the agreement. We will continue to work with partners to preserve and advance the agreement. </p></reply>

Immigration issues have been raised on an ongoing basis in our engagement with the US Administration and political leaders, including by the Taoiseach during calls to members of the US Administration. I have also raised immigration issues in my recent contacts with Special Envoy Mick Mulvaney, with the US Ambassador, and with members of the US Administration and both Houses of Congress on my visit to Washington D.C. last week. </p>  <p>  In the US, our Embassy and Consulates General across the country continue to monitor the situation closely and to engage with US officials on immigration issues, including with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They also actively support Irish community groups that provide support and information to vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. Many of these community groups are members of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, which receives significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme for their work. </p>  <p>  In 2019, over &euro;3m ($3.7m) was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including those that provide front-line welfare assistance to Irish citizens. Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated COVID-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad was set up to help these organisations meet the needs of those who are particularly vulnerable. Over the past four months, Minister Brophy and I have met virtually with many of these organisations and heard first-hand of the challenges faced by our diaspora, and the valuable support these organisations are providing.</p>  <p>  While comprehensive immigration reform is a complex and sensitive political issue in the US at present, our Embassy and our Consulates General across the United States will continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to engage with any Federal and State initiatives on this issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of securing future pathways for immigration, we continue to prioritise the E3 visa Bill and hope to see it pass through Congress at the earliest opportunity.</p></reply>

In particular, I welcome efforts made towards a Joint Declaration between the Government of Yemen and the Houthis which would commit the parties to a nationwide ceasefire, bring forward a number of economic and humanitarian measures, and resume a political process. </p>  <p>  We note the recent announcement on prisoner exchange, which is an important confidence building step. However, despite the Special Envoy&rsquo;s efforts over the last months, agreement has still not been reached, and we encourage all parties to the conflict to redouble efforts towards securing a ceasefire. </p>  <p>  Ireland is deeply concerned by the level of humanitarian suffering in Yemen, and has provided over &euro;27 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen since 2015, including &euro;5 million in 2020. As a member of the EU, Ireland also contributes to the EU response to the crisis in Yemen. Since the beginning of the conflict in 2015, the EU has allocated &euro;484 million in humanitarian aid.</p>  <p>  We also remain deeply concerned at the ongoing conduct of the conflict. The recent report of the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen highlights a consistent record of violations of IHL and human rights law. We condemn the indiscriminate attacks by the Houthis, including against Saudi Arabia. We continue to call on all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. </p>  <p>  Ireland calls again on the parties to the conflict to continue their engagement with the Special Envoy with a view to agreeing a declaration and ceasefire that will be in the best interests of the people of Yemen.</p></reply>

Among the detained are seven former HDP MPs, including the current Mayor of Kars, and some of whom have serious health issues. These arrests apparently relate to protests which took place in 2014. </p>  <p>  The strong suspicion is that these latest arrests are politically motivated and an attempt to marginalise and isolate the opposition. Hundreds of local politicians and elected officeholders and thousands of members of the HDP have been detained on terrorism-related charges since the local elections in March 2019, and investigations have been launched against other mayors.   </p>  <p>  Ireland is clear that arrests and legal proceedings should not be used for political reasons as they seriously undermine the proper functioning of local democracy. The Turkish Government needs to ensure that its actions are in accordance with the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. The detention of thousands of members of opposition parties on terrorism-related charges raises serious concerns regarding Turkey&rsquo;s backsliding in fundamental areas as expressed on numerous occasions, in the European Commission&rsquo;s annual reports as well as in European Council Conclusions.</p>  <p>  On the wider Kurdish issue, it is clear that this can only be addressed through dialogue aiming at establishing a peaceful, comprehensive, and sustainable solution. Ireland has called for the resumption of such a dialogue to allow the political process to resume. We continue to support efforts to maintain contacts between Kurdish community representatives and the Turkish authorities through our funding of the Democratic Progress Institute&rsquo;s Turkey Programme.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to closely monitor developments in Turkey both in terms of these detentions, and in terms of the wider picture regarding human rights, freedom of expression, the rule of law, and democracy. </p></reply>

The Bill, in its current form, undermines the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol. Any unilateral departure from the terms of the Agreement is not acceptable and seriously damages trust in Northern Ireland, and between the EU and the UK. The suggestions that the UK&rsquo;s unilateral approach is designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement were of particular concern. The Protocol itself is specifically designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process, including avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach raised our concerns directly with the British Prime Minister on the day the Bill was published. He and I have discussed these issues with a range of interlocutors including Commission President von der Leyen, Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic and the EU's chief negotiator, Mr Michel Barnier. The Government has remained in close contact with our EU partners on this issue over recent weeks.</p>  <p>  The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement met on Thursday 10 September and Monday 28 September. The Joint Committee, and Specialised Committee, are the  appropriate channels for considering issues around the implementation of the Protocol. However, they cannot be used to renegotiate the Protocol.</p>  <p>  At these meetings, Ireland set out clearly our concerns. Commission Vice President &Scaron;efcovic urged the British Government to remove the problematic measures from the Bill by the end of September. Ireland, together with the EU, also sent a clear message, on the need for the UK to restore trust and to accelerate its work to implement the Protocol in all its aspects.</p>  <p>  On 1 October  the Commission sent the UK a letter of notice for breaching obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement. This marks the beginning of a formal infringement process against the United Kingdom. We continue to urge the British Government to work to repair the severely damaged trust between the EU and UK.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, I have also discussed this issue with Special Envoy Mick Mulvaney during his visit to Dublin. I also visited Washington DC last week, and discussed the issues with Deputy Secretary of State Stephen E. Biegun, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Richard Neal. Each reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Throughout the Brexit process, I have maintained close contacts with leaders in Northern Ireland.  I welcome that the EU and UK are engaging closely on relevant implementation issues to find appropriate and agreed solutions, which should fall within the framework of the agreed Protocol.</p>  <p>  Despite noise and setbacks, this Government&rsquo;s focus remains on implementation - in full and in good faith - of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Protocol, and on achieving a successful conclusion to the future relationship negotiations.</p></reply>

It includes the expansion of Ireland&rsquo;s Mission Network which will deepen our impact across priority regions, provide opportunities to grow our trade and inward investment, strengthen political relationships with our partners, promote our values, and support Irish citizens and our diaspora abroad. A deepened footprint will also enable us to better shape and influence international events in our interests.  </p>  <p>  My Department plans to open 26 new Diplomatic Missions over the lifetime of Global Ireland. Since its launch in 2018, my Department has been working closely with the Department of the Taoiseach and a range of other Government partners to ensure effective delivery.  </p>  <p>  To date we have opened new Embassies in Wellington, Bogot&aacute;, Amman, Monrovia and Santiago de Chile, and new Consulates General in Vancouver, Mumbai, Cardiff, Frankfurt and Los Angeles. Our efforts continue including through the planned opening of new Embassies in Kyiv, Manila and Rabat. These locations have been chosen based on a range of factors, including their potential to diversify our markets, to grow trade and investment with Ireland, and to enable Irish companies to better take advantage of new opportunities. </p>  <p>  A critical component of the Global Ireland programme is identifying new opportunities to diversify our markets in a post-Brexit world. Global Ireland 2025 will support efforts to grow and diversify export markets, inward investment and tourism, as Brexit becomes a reality. It will ensure that Ireland is better positioned to build the alliances necessary to advance its interests and defend its positions in a post-Brexit EU, while also helping to secure our deep and positive relationship with the UK and its constituent parts into the future.</p>  <p>  Ireland has a long-standing policy of maintaining Embassies in all EU Member States. This policy has been of incalculable benefit to our country since the UK made the decision to leave the European Union. With this in mind, we will also continue to strengthen our teams in EU Member States, assigning additional resources as necessary.</p>  <p>  In considering any further expansion of the diplomatic network, a range of factors will be taken into account including our national, political, economic and trade priorities, as well as the availability of resources.</p></reply>

The German Presidency has been leading intensive negotiations in Brussels at official level on the proposal.</p>  <p>  One of the measures under discussion is the introduction of a traffic light system under which countries and regions within the EU and EEA would be classified in terms of COVID-19 risk. </p>  <p>  The factors used to calculate risk remain to be agreed. They are likely to include, at a minimum, the prevailing 14-day COVID incidence rate per 100,000; the percentage of recent positive COVID-19 tests from the area; and the number of tests being carried out by area. The respective thresholds for each of these criteria, to determine which areas are of higher or lower risk, remains subject to agreement.</p>  <p>  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will be mandated with producing the necessary data on a weekly basis, setting out which areas are at higher or lower risk by way of traffic-light style colour-coded mapping. </p>  <p>  The data and mapping are likely to be produced at sub-national regional levels. Accordingly, Member States may then apply their respective protective measures targeted with regard to higher-risk sub-national regions, rather than whole countries. Although not yet agreed, it appears likely that it will remain with Member States to decide what protective measures to apply, in accordance with respective national competences.</p>  <p>  The Presidency is according major priority to this issue. As set out in the National Plan for Living with COVID-19, Ireland has made clear its broad support for the Commission proposal and our intention to align with the new arrangements, once agreed.</p></reply>

Ireland has not been quiet on this matter, and I have spoken in this House about our concerns regarding the situation in Xinjiang on numerous occasions. </p>  <p>  We, along with our EU partners, remain deeply concerned about the credible reports regarding restrictions on freedom of religion and belief, arbitrary detention, widespread surveillance, forced labour, and forced sterilisations and birth control in the region.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been vocal about raising this issue, along with other partners in the international community. In our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 25 September, Ireland reiterated our deep concern regarding the treatment of ethnic Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, and urged China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the High Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>  <p>  At EU level, the deterioration of the human rights situation, including the treatment of minorities in Xinjiang, was raised by EU leaders with China on 14 September, and it was agreed to discuss these issues further at an EU-China Human Rights Dialogue in Beijing later this year. The matter was also raised during the EU-China Summit on the 22 June. </p>  <p>  Prior to this, Ireland was also one of 27 States to support a Joint Statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 30 June 2020, which also called on the High Commissioner to provide regular information about the situation in the region, in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed under international law. </p>  <p>  This week, Ireland is supporting a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee which reiterates our grave concern regarding the situation in Xinjiang, and recalls the exceptional letter of concern issued by 50 UN Special Procedures mandate holders which called on China to respect human rights and to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers.</p>  <p>  Ireland has previously supported a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee in October 2019, and a Joint Letter at the UN Human Rights Council in July 2019, which called for the Chinese Government to urgently implement eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, and to uphold its international obligations and respect human rights in Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation and, along with our EU partners, engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora as appropriate. </p></reply>

The Government has consistently affirmed its unwavering commitment to North South co-operation across all sectors, including all-island engagement on education, research and innovation. This involves fostering collaboration and encouraging those involved in research to take advantage of the opportunities available. </p>  <p>  Higher education institutions have a key role in North South collaborative research across the island and in undertaking research which results in innovation and leads to economic growth. Everything possible must be done to ensure that this cooperation continues to grow and strengthen. The Government remains committed to keeping the island of Ireland at the forefront of global research and innovation.</p></reply>

The very sudden displacement of thousands of people has caused great suffering to those in the camp, as well as posing a huge logistical challenge for the Greek authorities in the midst of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, spoke with his Greek counterpart immediately after the fire to offer Ireland's full solidarity and support. The Greek authorities requested assistance from EU Partners in dealing with the immediate humanitarian needs arising from the fire. My Department, through our Embassy in Athens, is in contact with the Greek Ministry of Migration Policy and has confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s readiness to provide assistance from emergency stocks which we have in place at the UN Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy.  The Greek authorities have thanked us for this offer of assistance, and we stand ready to work with them regarding the deployment of the emergency supplies.</p>  <p>  In terms of the situation within the camp, Greek authorities have started to transfer refugees and migrants to the Greek mainland in order to reduce overcrowding. In addition, the European Commission has now established a dedicated Taskforce with the aim of resolving the emergency situation on Lesbos effectively and humanely. The Taskforce will work closely with the Greek authorities to build new reception facilities in the coming months, which will be of a European standard and will provide access to healthcare and adequate sanitation.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have repeatedly urged the need for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among Member States in dealing with the wider issue of migration. The migration crisis continues to be one of the major challenges confronting the European Union and it needs to be urgently addressed. We must find more sustainable solutions involving consensus among Member States based on solidarity and responsibility. I am committed to continuing to work with our EU partners to resolve these issues and to ensure that humanitarian and legal obligations continue to be met.</p>  <p>  On 23 September 2020, the Commission published a major new proposal on reforming the EU migration and asylum system - a &ldquo;New Pact on Migration and Asylum&rdquo;. I welcome this initiative by the Commission. The publication of the Migration Pact proposals represents an opportunity to renew and intensify efforts to agree a common approach and put in place more effective and humane arrangements to manage the considerable migratory pressures that Europe continues to face.</p>  <p>  We in Ireland are endeavouring to do our part, having already received 1022 asylum seekers (including six unaccompanied minors) from Greece under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. </p>  <p>  In the context of the very difficult situation now arising from the destruction of the Moria refugee camp, the Government has decided that Ireland will welcome refugee families from Greece under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP). Up to 50 people in family groups will be resettled following displacement due to the fire.  This is in addition to the four unaccompanied minors, to be taken as part of our overall commitment to take 36 unaccompanied minors from Greece.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality are liaising with the European Commission on the detail of this commitment, and along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will travel to Greece in the coming weeks to make the arrangements.</p></reply>

Since then the situation has become considerably more grave.</p>  <p>  We have seen indiscriminate mass detentions, including of minors, credible reports of torture and ill-treatment of those detained, forced exiles and disappearances, and curtailments of media freedoms, including internet shutdowns.</p>  <p>  Ireland acted quickly and clearly to these events. I, and Minster of State Byrne made statements expressing our deep concern following the use of State violence against peaceful protesters. We have called for the immediate and unconditional release of those unjustly detained, for an end to the violence, and for a sustainable and peaceful resolution through dialogue.</p>  <p>  This was also the message I conveyed during a UN Security Council Members meeting on 4 September and at the 45th Session of the Human Rights Council, where Ireland also supported a Joint Statement expressing concern at internet shutdowns.</p>  <p>  We have condemned the actions of the Belorussian authorities and Ireland has continued to work with other EU Member States to ensure a firm EU response. We support the imposition of targeted sanctions against those responsible for the falsification of the election result and the use of State violence against the Belorussian people. However, sanctions are just one element of a broader response, and we are working constructively with our EU partners on a review of EU-Belarus relations. </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who has a well-known connection to this country having spent many summers here in her youth. I met Mrs. Tsikhanouskaya, along with several other EU Foreign Ministers, in Brussels on 21 September. We both commended her on her bravery and expressed the support of the Irish people to the people of Belarus.</p>  <p>  The recent secretive so-called 'inauguration' of Lukashenko lacks any democratic legitimacy. We will maintain our call for the authorities to engage in meaningful dialogue for fresh elections that are independently observed. The OSCE, of which Belarus is a member, has offered to visit Minsk and help facilitate talks and we will continue to encourage the authorities to grasp this offer with both hands and to uphold their OSCE commitments.</p>  <p>  The future of Belarus is for the people alone to decide in fresh elections.  Ireland will remain steadfast in our support for the Belorussian people as they continue to defend their rights and democratic principles.</p></reply>

The Government respects everyone&rsquo;s right on this island to make the case for the constitutional future they wish to see for Northern Ireland - whether the continuation of the union with Great Britain or a sovereign united Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement - and the two sovereign Governments - explicitly recognise and validate the legitimacy of both of these constitutional positions, which are deeply held.</p>  <p>  The holding of a referendum in this jurisdiction is connected with the calling of a border poll, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, in Northern Ireland. The decision to hold such a poll in Northern Ireland rests with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The full implementation and effective operation of the Good Friday Agreement is a priority for this Government. The principle of consent and the possibility of change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland are fundamental elements of the Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island of Ireland, North and South. Should there be a vote in favour of constitutional change in the future, it will be a binding obligation on both Governments to introduce and support in their respective Parliaments legislation to give effect to that wish.</p>  <p>  These are extremely important issues which naturally require very careful and serious consideration. The Government will continue to listen to and engage with the views of everyone on this island, on the constitutional future that they wish to see for Northern Ireland. It is for that reason that the Government has established a Shared Island unit within the Department of An Taoiseach. This unit will examine the political, social, economic and cultural considerations underpinning a future for this island in which all traditions are mutually respected.</p></reply>

In addition to the prolonged conflict and the resulting humanitarian crisis, they are now facing a health emergency caused by Covid-19.</p>  <p>  The underlying cause of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is armed conflict. Along with the UN and the EU, Ireland believes that the only way to bring about a long-term sustainable improvement in the situation is through a negotiated end to the conflict. Ireland fully supports the efforts of the UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths. We urge all parties to the conflict to engage with the Special Envoy without pre-conditions, to enact confidence-building measures to secure a sustainable peace and to allow the people of Yemen to begin to rebuild their lives.</p>  <p>  Ireland reiterates that all parties to conflict have a duty to uphold International Humanitarian Law, and we remind all parties to the conflict in Yemen of their legal and moral obligations to take all necessary steps to prevent attacks on civilians and civilian buildings.</p>  <p>  Humanitarian assistance will not resolve the crisis in Yemen but it is vital for the immediate welfare of its people. Since 2015, Ireland has contributed &euro;27 million to address the situation in Yemen, with over 90 per cent of that total, including &euro;5 million in 2020, going to the Yemen Humanitarian Fund. This Fund mobilises and channels funding to NGOs and UN agencies which have the capacity and are best placed to deliver life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable.  Ireland will continue to provide support through the agencies and mechanisms at the heart of the humanitarian response.</p>  <p>  In Yemen, every day is a struggle for humanitarian and health workers to provide basic care. We call on all parties to the conflict to ensure those workers have safe, secure, unfettered access to all people in need within Yemen.</p></reply>

The Government stands in solidarity with all those who lost loved ones or were injured on that day.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the All-Party D&aacute;il motions relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is a priority for the Government, as highlighted in the Programme for Government. The All-Party motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government. These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to seek the full truth of these appalling attacks, and some measure of closure for those affected. We have consistently raised the issue with the British Government on a bilateral basis, including at the British-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference. </p>  <p>  I have made clear to my counterparts that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government, and that there remains a pressing need for a response. </p>  <p>  The Government welcomed the announcement by the PSNI on 30 November 2019 that former Chief Constable Jon Boutcher will head an Independent Police Team to conduct an analytical report on the Glenanne Gang series of cases. We will be supportive of facilitating this investigation, subject to the requirements of the law, as we have other investigative processes in Northern Ireland, in relation to the attacks that were, or may have been, linked to the Glenanne Gang and other cases from the Troubles.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this request, at senior political level and in official level engagement by my Department, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue, consistent with the request made by this House and until a satisfactory resolution is found.</p></reply>

While a degree of progress was made, there remains some distance to go on the key issues of fisheries, the level playing field and governance. Unlocking these issues is key to moving towards a more intensified phase of the talks. The EU has been clear that an overall agreement on the Future Relationship cannot be secured without progress on these fundamental issues. Commission President von der Leyen spoke to PM Johnson on 3 October to take stock of the negotiations. Contacts between the EU and UK will continue in the period ahead with a view to making further progress.</p>  <p>  On the level playing field in particular, both the EU and UK agreed in the Joint Political Declaration in October 2019 that, because of our proximity and economic interconnectedness, measures to ensure a level playing field would be an integral part of the Future Relationship. Those measures are designed to protect fair and open competition. The arrangements that the EU is proposing in this area reflect the level and intensity of our trade with the UK.</p>  <p>  The UK will be the EU&rsquo;s partner, but also our competitor, and it is important that we have clear rules in place to make sure that this competition operates fairly and in a way that protects our businesses and our consumers.</p>  <p>  Fisheries remains a challenging area in the negotiations. A positive resolution of this issue is an important priority for Ireland. We are seeking to protect the interests of the Irish fleet in terms of both access and the quota share it currently enjoys in British waters. The Task Force is continuing to push for better UK engagement in this area. We, together with other affected Member States, remain in close contact with the Task Force on this issue. </p>  <p>  We are all aware that time is growing short, and that a no deal outcome is in no one&rsquo;s interests. Ireland is engaged in these negotiations as part of the EU27, and we have been working hard to ensure that the EU&rsquo;s approach to these negotiations reflects Ireland&rsquo;s values and interests.</p>  <p>  Only a few weeks remain to secure a deal. Ireland, and the EU, will continue to engage positively and in good faith in the time remaining.</p>  <p>  I must also be clear that together with our focus on the Future Relationship negotiations, the EU will also be working hard in the weeks ahead to find a resolution to the challenge created by the UK's Internal Market Bill. Certain provisions of this Bill amount to a unilateral reopening of the Withdrawal Agreement, which is unacceptable. We remain committed to building a future relationship with the UK, but it can only be on the basis of trust and confidence that the Withdrawal Agreement is being fully implemented.</p>  <p>  On 1 October, the Commission issued a letter of formal notice to the UK for breaching its obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement. This marks the beginning of a formal infringement process against the UK. </p>  <p>  The EU27 remain firmly united in support for the Commission's approach to both the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the Future Relationship negotiations. Michel Barnier and his team have Ireland's full confidence. We will stay in close contact with them in the coming days and weeks.</p></reply>

These commitments, which are annexed to the NDNA Agreement but do not form part of it, include a commitment in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at the Ulster University Magee Campus in Derry, alongside the commitment made in the context of the agreement by the British Government. </p><p>The Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision at the Magee Campus, including in the context of the British Government&rsquo;s City Deal and Inclusive Future Fund initiative which is being advanced by Derry City and Strabane District Council. This investment has the potential to increase access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. </p><p>We look forward to continued engagement with the Northern Ireland Executive including in taking the NDNA commitments forward through the regular pattern of Ministerial-level Sectoral meetings across the North South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s twelve policy sectors over the coming months.</p><p>The funding requirement in the years ahead to deliver these projects will depend on the timing and details for projects being agreed on a North/South basis,  and will need to take account of necessary discussions with the Executive through the North South Ministerial Council, the progress of implementation of each project, and, where relevant, our engagement with the British Government.</p></reply>

The E3 Bill was also raised by the then Taoiseach when he spoke with Mr. Mulvaney in February, and with members of the US administration when he visited Washington D.C. for St Patrick's Day this year. Our Embassy in Washington D.C. also continues its extensive outreach in support of the E3 Bill, working with a range of Members of the US House of Representatives and the Senate, from both sides of the aisle. </p>  <p>  The Bill is currently before the US Senate, having been passed in the House of Representatives. It was reintroduced by Congressmen Neal and Sensenbrenner in May 2019, having failed to gain Senate approval the previous year. If passed, this could allow access to thousands of US visas per year to Irish citizens, providing new opportunities for Irish citizens to live and work in the US. The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted upon the congressional agenda; however, we hope that when the circumstances allow, the Bill will also be passed in the Senate, and we will continue to explore all available options for securing this.</p>  <p>  While comprehensive immigration reform is a complex and sensitive political issue in the US at present, our Embassy, along with our Consulates General across the United States, will continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to engage with any Federal and State initiatives on this issue. They are supported in this work by the US &amp;amp; Canada Unit of my Department.</p></reply>

The United Nations is the primary platform for multilateral cooperation among states, and Ireland engages in a principled way with the UN, across the three pillars of its work &ndash; development, human rights, and peace and security.  </p>  <p>  In our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 25 September, Ireland reiterated our deep concern regarding the treatment of ethnic Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang, and urged China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the High Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland was one of 27 states to issue a Joint Statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 30 June 2020, which called on the High Commissioner to provide regular information about the situation in the region.  Ireland previously supported a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee in October 2019, and a Joint Letter at the UN Human Rights Council in July 2019, which called for the Chinese Government to uphold its international obligations and respect human rights in Xinjiang. </p>  <p>  This week, Ireland is supporting a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee which reiterates our grave concern regarding the situation in Xinjiang, and recalls the exceptional letter of concern issued by 50 UN Special Procedures mandate holders which called on China to respect human rights and to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers.</p>  <p>  At EU level, the deterioration of the human rights situation, including the treatment of minorities in Xinjiang, was raised by EU leaders with China on 14 September, and it was agreed to discuss these issues further at an EU-China Human Rights Dialogue later this year.</p>  <p>  Ireland is now working on preparations for taking up our seat on the UN Security Council next January. We will engage openly with all members of the Council, including China, across the Council agenda.

The UK will be outside the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union from 1 January 2021.  This means that any business that moves goods to, from or through Great Britain will be subject to a range of customs formalities, SPS checks and other regulatory requirements that do not apply today.</p>  <p>  Ensuring that the UK landbridge remains an efficient and effective route to market for Irish traders is a priority of the Government's Brexit planning.  When the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, operators will still be able to move goods via the landbridge but the way they use the landbridge will change.  Each movement will involve new procedures and require a financial guarantee to be in place.</p>  <p>  While the UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Transit Convention (CTC) is welcome and we continue to work positively with our EU partners on addressing challenges in EU ports for transit landbridge traffic, delays and blockages at UK ports for Irish operators using the landbridge is a very real and substantial risk, and outside of our control. The Government has pointed out for some time now including in our readiness plans in 2019 and 2020 that there will likely be delays at ports immediately after the end of the transition period, with Dover-Calais identified as a particular likely bottleneck.  This is also the view of the UK Government which has  written to traders in the UK and published its &lsquo;Reasonable Worst Case Scenario&rsquo; modelling which envisages queues of up to 7,000 HGVs in Kent, in the vicinity of Dover Port and of a possible 60%-80% reduction in trade flows using the crossing.  It is vital that all operators understand the risk of delays and the changes that will arise for importers and exports on 1 January and take steps to address them.  These are outlined in detail in the Government's Brexit Readiness Action Plan published on 9 September where there is a specific chapter on trade in goods and using the landbridge.</p>  <p>  By contrast, goods moving directly between Ireland and elsewhere in the EU will not be subject to any new procedures.  The Government has been engaging extensively with the shipping sector to assess the capacity available on direct routes to continental ports and I am working closely with my colleague Eamonn Ryan, the Minister for Transport.  The sector has indicated that sufficient capacity is available on direct routes and that the sector is capable of responding to any further increase in demand.  I encourage engagement between traders, hauliers and ferry companies to align capacity with needs.</p>  <p>  A number of new direct services have been launched in the past year and extra sailings are also planned on existing routes.  Traders should now consider switching to direct route options where feasible.</p></reply>

The WRC&rsquo;s core services include the inspection of employment rights compliance, the provision of information, adjudicating on complaints under employment protection, equality and industrial relations legislation and the provision of mediation, conciliation, facilitation and advisory services.</p><p>1. Number of Inspectors:</p><p>The WRC Inspectorate is staffed by civil servants of my Department. As at 30 September 2020, there are a total of 48 WRC Labour Inspectors. Table 1 attached provides details of the grade, number and regional location of these inspectors.  In addition, there are panels in place for the assignment of 5 further inspector grades and, working with the Public Appointments Service, new regional panels will shortly be established.</p><p>2. Number of inspections 2019 and to date 2020:</p><p>The aim of the WRC Inspectorate is to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and enforcement where necessary. While every effort is made to secure compliance, some employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and/or pay money due to their employees. These cases are referred for prosecution. </p><p>The Inspectorate Division of the WRC carries out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislations. These inspections arise: </p><p>- In response to complaints received of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation; </p><p>- As part of compliance campaigns which focus on compliance in specific sectors or specific pieces of legislation; or </p><p>- From routine inspections (announced and unannounced) which act as an overall control measure.</p><p>In 2019 WRC inspectors carried out 4,804 inspections or compliance checks with &euro;3,929,840 unpaid wages recovered. The draft figures for 2020 to date indicate that 5,166 inspections or compliance checks have been carried out with &euro;1,323,913 unpaid wages recovered. Since early June, all inspectors and inspector team managers of the WRC have also been engaged in compliance visits on behalf of the HSA to ensure that Covid-19 Return to Work Safely Protocols were being observed by businesses in specific sectors.  Of the total number of inspections in 2020, approximately 3,500 inspections included checks on the Covid-19 Return to Work Safely Protocols.</p><p>3. Cost of the WRC Inspectorate 2019 and to date 2020:</p><p>As an office of my Department, the WRC is funded through my Department&rsquo;s Vote. In 2019, the basic pay cost for the inspections services of the WRC was &euro;2,427,500.  Travel and subsistence costs amounted to a further &euro;381,477 in the same period bringing the total cost of the WRC inspections services in 2019, to &euro;2,808,977. </p><p>Up to 2nd October 2020, the basic pay cost for the inspections services was &euro;1,917,442 with expenditure of &euro;171,377 on travel and subsistence incurred up to the 29 September 2020.It is anticipated that these costs will increase by 25% over the remainder of this year. As such the estimated total expenditure in respect of the inspections services on basic pay in 2020 is &euro;2,396,803 and &euro;214,221 on travel and subsistence, totalling &euro;2,611,024 estimated for full year 2020. This is slightly less than last year as it includes the Covid-19 lockdown period when most businesses were closed and travel was severely restricted.</p></reply>

The system is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages, however, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one. </p>  <p>  The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit.  An employment permit may be granted for an eligible occupation where there is a direct contractual arrangement between an employer and an employee and are not sector specific.  Once granted, the employment permit allows the non-EEA national to commence employment in the State in the employment, with the employer, and for the period as stated on the permit. </p>  <p>  Under the Employment Permits Acts a permit holder on their first employment permit in the State is expected to stay with the initial employer for a period of 12 months. An application for a new employment permit for a different employer, submitted within that period, will only be considered in certain circumstances such as where the employment relationship has fundamentally changed or where the permit holder has been made redundant.  This attempts to strike a reasonable balance between, the employer&rsquo;s expectations that the permit holder remain in his or her employment for a reasonable period of time given the costs involved in recruiting the permit holder and, on the other hand, not unduly binding the permit holder to the employer. </p>  <p>  After 12 months the permit holder may move employer subject to a new application for an employment permit and subject to the relevant criteria.</p></reply>

This will build on the various improvements that have been made to social protections for workers over the last five years, including paternity benefit, parental leave benefit and the extension of social insurance benefits to the self-employed and those in the gig economy. In addition, further significant benefits, including enhanced illness benefit, have already been introduced by the Government in response to Covid-19.

It is administered by Enterprise Ireland on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p>  The Fund is available for collaborative projects seeking investment in the development and deployment of disruptive innovative technologies and applications, on a commercial basis, targeted at tackling national and global challenges. SME participation is a requirement of all consortia.</p>  <p>  One of the eligibility criteria for DTIF is the requirement for all enterprise partners to provide matching funding, equal to the amount they are seeking from the Fund. This is in keeping with the EU State Aid rules under which the Fund operates, and which are aimed at preventing the use of State resources to distort competition in the marketplace.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is engaging with all the project partners as part of the DTIF portfolio management process and provides special attention to SME participants. A number of small companies, awarded funding in principle from DTIF (subject to meeting drawdown requirements), have received advice on private funding options available to help them meet the financial capacity requirements under the Fund and Enterprise Ireland will continue to engage with such companies in this regard. While providing as much flexibility as possible, there are key drawdown requirements that must be observed.</p>  <p>  The Fund is an important mechanism for facilitating SMEs to grow, to scale-up and to attract investment. Indeed, there have already been several notable successes where SMEs involved in DTIF projects have attracted significant additional private investment even beyond what they have already invested themselves.</p></reply>

Indeed, it is bigger in scale than most budgets and it is being deployed at speed.</p>  <p>  Having come through the initial economic shock with unprecedented levels of State intervention stabilising the economy, the focus is now on sustaining the recovery in the face of uncertainty and disruption while seeking to minimise permanent loss of economic activity and employment. As such, the next steps in our recovery journey will be mapped out in the October Budget and the subsequent National Economic Plan.</p>  <p>  The National Economic Plan will set out a vision for what our post-COVID economy will look like. The plan will set longer term objectives for the economy post crisis and identify policies and strategies to achieve those objectives. While the focus of Government action up to now has been on protecting workers, households and firms, the plan will need to look to the future and show how our economy can be positioned to exploit opportunities for growth in emerging sectors and in areas such as new ways of working, while also addressing how we will prepare for the transitioning of enterprises and workers in response to technology and climate change developments. Ireland&rsquo;s flexible and skilled labour force has traditionally been a strength of the country and reskilling and upskilling of the labour force in response to anticipated future skills needs a core element to be progressed under the plan.</p>  <p>  The plan will be progressed over the coming weeks and I would expect it to launch in November. </p>  <p>  In 2019, the Action Plan for Jobs series was replaced by Future Jobs Ireland, a whole-of-government framework to prepare Ireland for the challenges and opportunities ahead in terms of the transition to a digital and low carbon economy. Future Jobs Ireland was designed with the aim of integrating innovation and resilience into our economy and ensuring our enterprises and workers would be well positioned to adapt to the twin transitions.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to updating the Future Jobs Ireland framework and will be taken forward as part of the implementation of the National Economic Plan.</p></reply>

It is designed to incentivise participating finance providers to continue to play their role in supporting the availability of additional liquidity to Irish businesses.</p><p>The main features of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme are:</p><p>- The amount available under the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is &euro;2 billion. </p><p>- A guarantee rate of 80% for the State with the lenders retaining 20% of the risk of the loan. </p><p>- Loans from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1,000,000 are available for terms of up to five and a half years.</p><p>- There will be no portfolio cap for individual lenders.</p><p>- Lenders will set the interest rate on the products offered, which will reflect the benefit of the State Guarantee. The discount on the interest rate will be transparent to borrowers and will be specified in the loan agreement. </p><p>- Loans under &euro;250,000 are unsecured.</p><p>- A guarantee premium on each loan under the Scheme is required to be paid.  The premium will range from 0.15% - 0.68% for SMEs, depending on the term of the loan, and from 0.3% - 1.55% for small Mid-Caps depending on the term of the loan.</p><p>- The scheme will be timebound and will be available initially until 31 December 2020.</p><p>The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is currently available through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  Further to the Open Call, other finance providers are currently being assessed by the operator of the Scheme, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, and my Department and will be coming online in a number of weeks. </p><p>The eligibility criteria for the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme includes:</p><p>- The borrower must be an SME, Primary Producer or a small Mid-Cap established in Ireland. </p><p>- In order to qualify for the Scheme, the borrower will have to declare an adverse impact of minimum 15% of actual or projected turnover or profit due to the impact of COVID-19.</p><p>- The borrower must declare that on the 31/12/19 it was a viable business and was not in financial difficulty.  As an exception to the above, the Scheme is also available to micro or small enterprises which were already in difficulty on 31 December 2019 provided that they are not subject to collective insolvency procedures and that they have not received rescue aid or restructuring aid.</p><p>- The borrower must be able to demonstrate to the lender that it can return to viability in the future.</p><p>- Certain sectors are excluded from the scheme:</p><p>- Construction of buildings and construction of residential and non-residential buildings</p><p>- Real Estate Activities - buying and selling of own real estate</p><p>- Mining - extraction of crude petroleum, extraction of natural gas, support activities for petroleum and natural gas extraction</p><p>- Manufacturing - manufacture of tobacco products, manufacture of weapons and ammunition, manufacture of military fighting vehicles</p><p>- Financial and Insurance Activities - monetary intermediation</p><p>- Gambling and betting activities</p><p>The total amount of COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme funding per participating enterprise shall not exceed:</p><p>- double the annual wage bill of the participating enterprise (including social charges as well as the cost of personnel working on the undertaking&rsquo;s site but formally in the payroll of subcontractors) for 2019, or for the last year available. In the case of undertakings created on or after 1 January 2019, the maximum finance agreement must not exceed the estimated annual wage bill for the first two years in operation; or</p><p>- 25% of the participating enterprises&rsquo; total turnover in 2019.</p><p>The lender assesses whether the business will be able to make the necessary repayments on the credit, according to its normal assessment criteria and the decision of the lender in terms of assessing viability is final.  There is no automatic entitlement to receive a guaranteed facility even if a business believes it satisfies the basic eligibility criteria. The normal redress processes are available to declined businesses.  The Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process, which, is fully delegated to the participating lenders.</p></reply>

Full details on all COVID-19 supports for business are available at: <i></i></p><p>The July Stimulus Package is a substantial financial package to stimulate our economy worth more than &euro;5 billion, with an additional &euro;2 billion in loan guarantees which is bigger in scale than most budgets and is being deployed at speed. The July Stimulus package was designed to help businesses to open, to help those already open to stay open, to get staff back to work and for those who cannot go back to their old jobs, there are new opportunities. </p><p>The range of measures in place to assist businesses include direct grants to support viable businesses and jobs, including new hire. We have extended the wage subsidy scheme, which will run until the end of March 2021 and will be open to firms that do not currently participate and open to workers like seasonal workers who were not previously included, and we are giving companies extra assistance through an enhanced Restart Plus grant of up to &euro;25,000. From 1 September, the six-month reduction in the VAT came into effect, going down from 23% to 21%. </p><p>We are providing more and cheaper loan finance through MicroFinance Ireland, SBCI and the new &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme. I announced the reopening of MFI lending on 3August and I launched the &euro;2bn Credit Guarantee Scheme on 7 September.</p><p>SMEs may also be eligible for the Government's new Restart Grant Plus Scheme where they operate from a rateable premises. Grants of between &euro;4,000 up to a maximum of &euro;25,000 are available. Those businesses that accessed funding through the previous round of the scheme are eligible to apply for a second top-up payment to a total combined value of the revised maximum grant level. </p><p>On 1st October I published a new voluntary Code of Conduct that has been agreed between landlords and business representatives for commercial renters.  </p><p>The Code, which is a commitment in the Programme for Government, has been developed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, including IBEC, Retail Excellence Ireland, Chambers Ireland and Irish Institutional Property (IIP), who manage approximately &euro;14bn of Irish property. It is based on an approach taken in other jurisdictions, including Australia, France and the UK.</p><p>The Code, which will apply until 31 July 2021, sets out a structured approach for engagement between both commercial landlords and tenants, based on their mutual interest in continuing to work together.</p><p>The Code sets out a number of principles that both parties should commit to abide by, including transparency and collaboration. The Code asks commercial landlords to provide concessions where they can and where this is not possible, asks them to set out clearly the reasons for this. It lists some of the issues to consider when determining the impact of COVID-19 and the public health restrictions on a business and the need for concession. Where a concession is being considered, the Code provides some suggested options for new arrangements. The Code also suggests that commercial tenants seeking new arrangements should be clear as to why assistance is needed when seeking concessions from their landlord.</p><p>I am working with my colleagues across Government to assist businesses impacted by COVID-19 and I will continue to keep the supports provided for enterprise under review with the goal of setting our country towards economic recovery.</p></reply>

The new plan contains a specific chapter on food waste, which outlines a number of actions to tackle this problem and to reduce Ireland's food waste by 50% by 2030. Ireland currently generates an estimated one million tonnes of food waste per annum, even when agricultural activity is excluded.  <i>One</i>of the measures proposed in the food waste chapter is to work with retailers to end the sale of multi-buy packs to prevent over-buying by consumers. The focus here is on &quot;over-buying&quot;, where this results in wasted food and an economic cost to the consumer. This issue has been considered in other jurisdictions across the European Union and in the United Kingdom.  The European Commission is proposing to work with relevant organisations to ensure that food price campaigns do not undermine public perception of the value of food (<i>Farm to Fork</i>, 2020).</p><p>Early research on this matter was carried out by the UK based Waste Resources Action Programme (WRAP) in their December 2011 report 'Investigation into the possible impact of promotions on food waste'. At a national level, the Environmental Protection Agency is currently conducting the first National Food Waste Attitude Survey. Results will become available from October and will provide important insights into consumer behaviours around purchasing, food management in the home, the impacts of Covid 19 on these matters, as well as the understanding of best before and use by dates. Follow up surveys in future years will be used to target additional relevant themes affecting food waste prevention. Most of the major food retailers in Ireland have already signed up to the EPA's Food Waste Charter and have already pledged to reducing food waste in their stores and amongst their customer base.</p><p>The priority measure in delivering our ambition around food waste will be the development of a Food Waste Prevention Roadmap. This will involve consultation and collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders from both industry and consumer interest groups. All policies deriving from the Action Plan will be carefully calibrated to protect low-income households and applied only where sustainable alternatives are available and affordable.</p></reply>

A number of other Member States have utilised the exemptions available under Article 24 of the Waste Framework Directive to manage the treatment of particular waste streams, including C&amp;amp;D waste. The new Waste Action Plan commits to reviewing how Article 24 exemptions are utilised in these other Member States with a view to informing how the exemption process can help manage certain waste streams to support resource efficiency and the transition to a more circular economy while also safeguarding human health and the environment.</p><p>In addition, the plan commits to establishing a working group to examine how Article 24 exemptions can encourage greater repair, reuse or recycling in appropriate waste streams, including reuse in the C&amp;amp;D sector.  Finally, the plan specifically proposes the use of the exemption process to manage the on-site treatment of invasive alien plant species, including on C&amp;amp;D sites, as such an exemption would help mitigate environmental risks associated with transporting this material to off-site treatment facilities.</p></reply>

The July Stimulus commits to increasing the SEAI budget by &euro;100 million in 2021. This additional funding will be focused on community retrofit schemes, retrofit schemes supporting those in energy poverty as well as other initiatives to support the achievement of our retrofit targets.  The funding supported the first call for projects under the new National Homes Retrofit Scheme which was launched on 25 September.  This scheme is suitable for one-stop-shops, residential service providers, employers, financial institutions, Approved Housing Bodies and local authorities.  Details are available at: <i>www.seai.ie.</i></p><p>By announcing this additional funding as part of the July Stimulus, the Government is providing certainty to the sector so that they can continue approved programmes of work, bid into new and expanded schemes, maintain a pipeline of retrofit activity, and sustain and create jobs.  Further details on other new and expanded schemes will be announced in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

An interactive map showing ESB charger locations and their status can be found at www.esb.ie/ecars.</p><p>We have committed &euro;10 million from the Climate Action Fund to promote the charging network and this has leveraged a further &euro;10 million investment from ESB. This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers (150kW), each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers (50kW), which may replace existing 22 kW standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers (22kW) with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>The high powered and fast chargers will be mainly concentrated on or near national roads and motorways to enable longer journeys to be completed. </p><p>Since the delivery stage of the project commenced in October 2019, County Kerry has received nine new 22kW charger replacements with a total of 18 charge points now available in the county. </p><p>In addition, there are upgrades planned at Kenmare and Tralee to replace the existing standard 22kW chargers to fast chargers. More information on these upgrades can be found at <i>https://esb.ie/ecars/our-network/high-power-charging-hubs.</i></p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department, administers an EV Home Charger Grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.</p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI).The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>As of 28 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 23 counties and steady progress is being made with over 98,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year. </p><p>NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website ().In County Westmeath, 4,109 premises have been surveyed to date and network designs are in the process of being completed to deliver the new fibre network. NBI crews are currently surveying in the areas of Mullingar. </p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 155 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. </p><p>In County Westmeath, the public will be able to benefit from this service at locations across the county such as Milltown Emper Community Centre, Sean Doolin Park and Moyvougly Community Centre. Further details can be found at .</p><p>In addition, a number of schools will also be connected to high speed broadband as part of the BCP initiative. In Westmeath 5 schools will be connected this year namely Scoil Naisiunta Bhride, Downs National School, Dalystown National School, Scoil Naisiunta Naomh Michael and  Scoil Aogha Naofa.</p><p>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible. The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.</p><p>The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) launched a pilot micro-generation grant scheme in July 2018 to help domestic customers who install rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) equipment on their homes.  As of end September 2020 there were 3,837 applications who received grant support over the lifetime of the scheme with some &euro;9.5 million spent to date, saving approx. 3 kilotonnes of CO2 per annum.   Action 30 of the Climate Action Plan commits to the delivery of a framework for micro-generation from renewable technologies, whilst ensuring principles of equity, self-consumption and energy efficiency first are incorporated.  A Micro-Generation working group chaired by my Department is examining an enabling framework for micro-generation which tackles existing barriers and establishes suitable supports within relevant market segments. This work is an integral part of our emerging Photovoltaic Solar Strategy. </p>  <p>  The proposed support mechanism will be outlined in a public consultation in the coming months.

To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level. Earlier this year, in line with public health and Government guidelines in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, all works under SEAI funded schemes were advised to pause for a period of time.  On June 29<sup>th</sup>SEAI advised contractors working on the Warmer Homes scheme, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for reopening society and business and Return to work safely protocol, that works in homes that could be classified as lower risk under the scheme could resume. This allowed works to resume/commence in a small number of homes, subject to the parameters set out by SEAI and a<b></b>thorough risk assessment of the property and all occupants by the contractor. The aim at all times was to minimise the risks for the homeowners and property occupants, contractors, their employees and the wider community.　 </p><p>On July 20th SEAI broadened these parameters, enabling contractors to carry out more works in more homes, again subject to risk assessments taking into account COVID-19 risks associated with engaging with any occupants during instances such as but not limited to, induction meetings, visits, customer service tasks, heating system guidance and key handover tasks at the start and end of works. It remains the case however that approximately 50% of the homes allocated to contractors are deemed &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo;, and therefore activity has not returned to pre COVID-19 levels.　</p><p>Officials in my Department have contacted SEAI regarding the constituent referred to by the Deputy.  SEAI has confirmed that this application has been assigned to a Contractor, who will contact the homeowner directly in relation to when works will commence on the home.  SEAI also confirmed works taking longer than one day to complete remain postponed on all homes where any occupant is in the &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo; group, as defined by the HSE. This is due to the intrusive nature of the works on the schemes, with multiple crew members in homes working in close proximity and often over long periods.</p><p>SEAI is mindful of the concerns that homeowners have with winter approaching and this is taken into account in its decision making as to how soon the scheme can move to the next phase.  This must be balanced, however, with the continuing risks of COVID-19 for applicants, contractors and the wider community. SEAI have been reviewing how to ensure the scheme aligns with the recently published 'Plan for Living with Covid-19'.  My officials have been informed by the SEAI that a communication to contractors in this regard is imminent. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government recognises that a modernised post office network will provide a better range of financial services and e-commerce services for citizens and enterprise, as part of our commitment to a sustainable nationwide post office network.</p>  <p>  While it is longstanding Government policy that postal services will not be directly subsidised by the Government, we remain fully committed to a sustainable post office network as a key component of the economic and social infrastructure in both rural and urban areas.  </p>  <p>  An Post's social value has been particularly evident during the current Covid crisis.  It has played a valuable role in its commitment to rural communities and to the elderly and vulnerable in our society.</p>  <p>  In response to the structural challenges facing the postal sector generally and An Post, the company put in place a Strategic Plan for the medium-long term future of the company. The Plan covers the period 2017 &ndash; 2021. </p>  <p>  In order to implement the Plan, the cost of which was estimated to be in the region of &euro;150m, the Minister for Finance provided a loan of &euro;30m to the company in December 2017 to support the renewal of the post office network (&euro;15m) and the continued fulfilment of a 5 day per week mails delivery service (&euro;15m). </p>  <p>  An Post is continuing to undergo vital transformation as part of the delivery of its strategic plan which has seen the company split into two distinct business units, An Post Mails and Parcels and An Post Retail.</p>  <p>  An Post is transforming its retail network by delivering new products and new formats. This includes, among other things, diversifying and growing the financial services products it provides for individuals and SMEs to include loans, credit cards and more foreign exchange products; local banking in association with the major banks and a full range of State Savings products. Two new dedicated sub-brands, An Post Money and a new business-to-business brand, An Post Commerce, were launched. Investment by An Post of &euro;50 million in the network is about getting communities to use the enhanced services in their local post office.</p>  <p>  The strategic plan put in place to transform the company  has resulted in An Post recording an operating profit of over &euro;41m for 2019, the third consecutive year of significant financial improvement bringing the Group out of its loss making position of 2016.</p>  <p>  Government believes An Post has untapped potential to do more and make a further significant contribution across many areas of public, business and community life in Ireland. With an evolving mandate An Post can emerge as a central hub for a wide variety of valuable community focused services.</p>  <p>   </p></reply>

The AMBER area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP State led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland (NBI). The NBP network will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500Mbps from the outset. This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. </p><p>The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years. As of 28 September, design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 23 counties and steady progress is being made with over 98,000 premises surveyed to date. This activity is increasing week on week and NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys by the end of the year. </p><p>This activity involves physically walking the routes and documenting images, notes and measurements of the poles, cables and underground ducts in each area. This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area. The laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December this year in Cork. </p><p>In Tipperary, surveys have recently commenced in the areas around townlands of Aherloe, Ballinalard and Bansha, and over 4,200 premises have been surveyed.NBI provides a facility for any premises within the AMBER area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website ().</p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 155 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools. </p><p>There are a number of BCPs located across County Tipperary where the public will be able to benefit from this service including at Aglish Community Hall, Drom Community Centre, Moyglass Community Halll, Killurney Community Centre. These BCPS have been installed by NBI and are scheduled for connection this year. Further details can be found at . In addition, there are a number of schools in Tipperary which will be connected for educational access as part of this initiative. These include Poulacapple National School and Killeen National School.  </p><p>I understand that there can be instances where premises that are close to eir&rsquo;s fibre network remain unconnected. eir&rsquo;s rural deployment of high speed broadband is a commercial undertaking and, as such, decisions regarding the areas and premises served are made by eir. My Department has no role in the matter and has no statutory authority to intervene in decisions of commercial operators as to where they build infrastructure and provide services. </p><p>Throughout rural Ireland, eir&rsquo;s fibre deployment is primarily focussed on towns and villages and the premises on their outskirts. Where that network ends is where the National Broadband Plan in effect commences to ensure that nobody is left behind. I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway.</p></reply>

To date over 142,000 homes have received free upgrades under the scheme, leaving the occupants better able to afford to heat their homes to an adequate level.  In 2019, &euro;39.8 million was allocated to the Scheme with over 3,000 homes upgraded.  Budget 2020 announced a budget allocation for the scheme of &euro;52.8 million.  This represents the biggest ever budget for the Warmer Homes Scheme.　</p><p>Earlier this year, in line with public health and Government guidelines in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, all works under SEAI funded schemes were advised to pause for a period of time.  On June 29<sup>th</sup>SEAI advised contractors working on the Warmer Homes scheme, in line with the Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for reopening society and business and Return to work safely protocol, that works in homes that could be classified as lower risk under the scheme could resume. This allowed works to resume/commence in a small number of homes, subject to the parameters set out by SEAI and a<b></b>thorough risk assessment of the property and all occupants by the contractor. The aim at all times was to minimise the risks for the homeowners and property occupants, contractors, their employees and the wider community.　 </p><p>On July 20th SEAI broadened these parameters, enabling contractors to carry out more works in more homes, again subject to risk assessments taking into account COVID-19 risks associated with engaging with any occupants during instances such as but not limited to, induction meetings, visits, customer service tasks, heating system guidance and key handover tasks at the start and end of works. It remains the case however that approximately 50% of the homes allocated to contractors are deemed &lsquo;very high risk&rsquo;, and therefore activity has not returned to pre COVID-19 levels.</p><p>SEAI has been reviewing how to ensure the scheme aligns with the recently published 'Plan for Living with Covid-19'. This must be balanced with the continuing risks of COVID-19 for applicants, contractors and the wider community. My officials have been informed by the SEAI that a communication to contractors in this regard is imminent. </p><p>There are currently over 8,000 homes on the scheme waiting list. This includes homes currently undergoing works, those that have been allocated to contractors for works, those awaiting allocation to a contractor and those awaiting the initial survey of their home.</p></reply>

I am sure the Deputy will agree that the PSO is a large expenditure area, and one which requires careful scrutiny to ensure the taxpayer receives value for money in respect of the services delivered given the considerable expenditure incurred.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-06a.426.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100600079#WRL01300"><p>On 7 April 2020, the Irish Government announced the temporary designation of five strategic maritime routes into and out of Ireland as Public Service Obligation (PSO) routes during Covid-19 for a period of up to three months. These routes were Dublin/Cherbourg and Rosslare/Fishguard, Pembroke, Cherbourg and Bilbao. The Government also approved the emergency provision of a maximum contribution of &euro;15m toward the costs involved in the continued operation of passenger ferry services on these routes in the three month period. </p>  <p>  The decision was based on the strategic importance of these routes for their contribution towards the robustness and resilience of Ireland&rsquo;s lifeline supply chain transporting goods, including foods and medical supplies, in and out of the country.  These routes also provide alternatives and maintain contingency options to the main route into and out of Dublin during COVID-19, thereby circumventing a single point of failure within Ireland&rsquo;s maritime connectivity</p>  <p>  The PSO Agreements provided that a review of the operation of the services be carried out after the first month of operation and every month thereafter. The reviews concluded that the PSAs delivered the desired effects, including the alleviation of uncertainty and supported strategically important elements of the national supply chain. Also, the stability they  provided gave stakeholders in the maritime industry - shipping companies, ports, international hauliers, and various providers of ancillary services - sufficient breathing space to adjust their operations and finances to deal with Covid-19 threats. </p>  <p>  With the gradual recovery of freight volumes and the commencement of a number of new services, evidence suggested that a market failure no longer existed to the extent experienced in March 2020. This being the case, in line with the Government Decision and following a review of their operation, the designation of these five maritime routes Dublin/Cherbourg, Rosslare/Fishguard. Pembroke, Cherbourg and Bilbao as Public Service Obligation Routes expired on 12 July 2020.   The final drawn down from the PSO support scheme will be approximately &euro;3.5m.</p>  <p>  While freight volumes have recovered and the shipping sector has shown itself to be resilient during Covid-19, there is no doubt but that risks remain as the pandemic is continuing longer than originally anticipated.  Passenger travel remains severely depressed and may not recover until well into 2021.  In addition, the Brexit transition period is nearing an end with, as yet, no clear sight on a final trading arrangement with the UK.   Mindful of these risks, my Department, together with the IMDO, is continuing to closely monitor and keep under review the evolving situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports, and will remain in close consultation with the maritime sector and other relevant stakeholders on this issue.</p></reply>

The first completed section of Greenway in County Louth was from Omeath to Carlingford Marina and this is now being extended to both Newry and Carlingford Village with significant funding from the EU's INTERREG programme, along with my Department and the Department for Infrastructure Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department recently allocated a further &euro;200,000 for planning and design work to extend this Greenway towards Templetown Beach under the Carbon Tax Fund. That was the only application made by Louth County Council under that funding call.</p>  <p>  The section linking Newry City in to Carlingford is at design phase and there are consultations being undertaken with landowners and other local stakeholders. </p>  <p>  An application for a Greenway from Blackrock to Dundalk was made in 2018 by Louth County Council. However, this application was premature as no planning permission was in place and there were some land ownership issues arising so it did not meet the criteria at the time and was not funded.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government&rsquo;s Programme for Government commitments my Department will be looking at ways of increasing Greenways around the country over the coming years, and connectivity and networks will be a key part of this. It is important that Louth County Council continue engaging with landowners and stakeholders in the area to ensure progress is being made towards a planning application for this project.</p></reply>

In addition to this, due to the social distancing requirements, normal daily capacity is considerably reduced. This means that customers will experience longer waiting times than was the case before the service was suspended. The public&rsquo;s patience and understanding in this regard is requested.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that those who had appointments cancelled due to Covid 19 are being prioritised in the first instance. Priority then will be given in order of application date.  While there is some capacity for urgent test slots, the RSA's capacity to make these available in all cases will be limited. Therefore, initially those who are frontline healthcare workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot. This approach for prioritising customers will be kept under review as the RSA moves through the service resumption.</p></reply>

Galway  Bay RNLI were tasked by the Coast Guard within three minutes of the initial call being received. The Lifeboat were recorded as proceeding to the scene at 10.25. The initial search was focused along the northern shore to ascertain if the missing persons were attempting to get ashore or had got ashore. The Aran Island All Weather Lifeboat was tasked at 11;19 pm. The Shannon based Coast Guard helicopter, which in accordance with standing arrangements was on 45 minutes notice after 10pm, was tasked to the scene at 11;02pm and was recorded as proceeding at 11.25pm</p><p>The search planning tool used  by the Coast Guard automatically utilises wind and tide conditions and subsequent checks confirmed that information for the locality was accurately recorded. Search planning had to be mindful of many potential changing scenarios in terms of the potential location of the casualties with regard to changing tides, local weather variations, size and type of recreational watercraft involved and whether the casualties might have been individually separated or separated from the boards. The possibility that they might have paddled ashore or got access to  another stationary device had also to be considered.  In that context a number of reports of potential sightings were also considered, most of which were investigated. The casualties were eventually located within the predicted search box, mindful that with the passage of time this box would have considerably expanded. Prior to the casualties being located the focus of the search was moving to the South West of Galway Bay and the Aran Islands. In the early hours of the morning of 13<sup>th</sup>August, aerial  and surface searches were conducted from Kilronan, to Inish meain and Inisheer. Further aerial, surface and coastal searches of the South West were similarly tasked. Participating units included Costelloe Bay and Doolin Coast Guard boat units.</p><p>Shortly after 11 Am on the 13<sup>th</sup>of August a member of the public on Inisheer alerted Valentia Coast Guard to a possible sighting South West of the island. A number of resources were tasked to the area. This communication was picked up by the vessel <i>Johnny O</i>, operated by the members of the Oliver family and they were requested by Valentia to also proceed to the area of interest. As is well documented the Oliver&rsquo;s were first on scene and successfully located and recovered the casualties.</p></reply>

The NTA, as the public transport licensing agency, is administering the support package through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.</p>  <p>  Among the commercial operators that are being supported under the scheme is most but not all of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s (B&Eacute;) Expressway business. As is the case in many other sectors of the economy, despite these supports, Covid-19 has resulted in significant financial pressures for public transport operators.</p>  <p>  B&Eacute; has developed plans to address its critical financial situation by reducing the size of its commercial Expressway business over time in order to focus on the profitable routes. The decision by the B&Eacute; Board to consolidate its Expressway route network was taken following extensive work within the company.  the Board has decided to indefinitely suspend the Dublin/Belfast service and to cease services on the Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Galway routes over the following months.  The Board decision will consolidate the commercial Expressway routes from 18 to 14.  The company's decisions do not affect the over 200 routes that Bus &Eacute;ireann operates under its normal PSO contract arrangements with the NTA;  these will all continue as before.  </p>  <p>  I have been assured by the company that there will be no job losses as a result of its decision and that affected staff will be redeployed to new/enhanced services which were announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s July Stimulus Package.  In this regard, B&Eacute; plans to introduce new bus services in Galway, Limerick, Cork as well as Louth and Meath, which will require more than 100 drivers</p>  <p>  As regards regional connectivity, I would like to reassure the Deputies that I have asked the NTA to assess any potential loss of connectivity along particular segments of the routes to ensure there are no gaps in the network, and to assess if there is a need to provide any additional services.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that essential transport services are protected and supported.  Services that provide vital regional and rural connections will continue to operate.</p></reply>

That involves having a strong airport in our capital city, as well as strong airports in Cork and Shannon, complemented by the smaller regional airports.  I do not accept the view that there is a question of developing one airport, either Dublin or one of the other airports around the country at the expense of another. Ireland&rsquo;s airports all have their roles to play in providing connectivity to their respective areas and for their contribution to the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 supports high quality International connectivity investments consistent with sectoral priorities already defined through the National Aviation Policy. Significant investment in Ireland&rsquo;s airports will play a major role in safeguarding and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international connectivity which is fundamental to our international competitiveness, trading performance and attractiveness to foreign direct investment. </p>  <p>  The National Aviation Policy also recognises the important role of Shannon Airport in the economic and social fabric of Mid-West Region. The airport enjoys the advantage of full US Preclearance as well as the longest runway in Ireland and the ability to handle all aircraft types. These features underpin the airport&rsquo;s ambitions to develop niche opportunities in aeronautical and aerospace engineering. This was integral to the aim of Government in the separation of Shannon Airport from daa and the establishment of Shannon Group in 2014.</p>  <p>  A maximum cap of movements at Schiphol Airport was stipulated by the Alders Agreement in 2008 and later modified. It is my understanding that the objective of the Alders Agreement was to balance the development of aviation and noise reduction measures to increase the quality of the living environment in proximity to the Airport. Substantive plans for the further development of Schiphol were therefore drawn up and a balance was struck between the further growth of the sector and local quality of life and safety. </p>  <p>  In Ireland these would potentially be considered operating restrictions which are governed by EU Regulation 598/2014 and the provision of the Aircraft Noise (Dublin Airport) Regulation Act 2019 which was enacted on 22 May 2019. The Act provides a wholly independent aircraft noise regulation process, ensuring that all future development at Dublin Airport is subject to assessment and mitigation in respect of the impact of associated aircraft movements on the noise environment around Dublin Airport.  Under section 4 of the Act the competent authority has exclusive competence in relation to operating restrictions at Dublin Airport.   </p>  <p>  The aircraft noise regulation process is tied in with the planning process, which provides safeguards against any award of planning permission until such time as the proposal has been screened and then may be fully assessed in relation to aviation noise impacts.  Specifically, the Act provides that all planning applications at Dublin Airport are copied to the Noise Regulator to consider if there are any noise implications that would require an assessment under EU Regulation 598/2014. The Noise Regulator is an independent unit within Fingal County Council (ANCA - Aircraft Noise Competent Authority). If the Noise Regulator determines that there are potential noise impacts then it instigates a detailed noise assessment process &ndash; in accordance with the EU Regulation &ndash; and the planning authority cannot make any final decisions until there is a regulatory determination on noise. </p>  <p>  For the daa, this new regime applies to all future development applications at the Airport, but also any amendments it may seek to existing planning permissions. These are statutorily independent processes, which include detailed technical assessments, environmental assessments and public consultation.  For the new North Runway project at Dublin Airport, daa are expected to submit a revised planning application with regard to operating restrictions in the near future.</p></reply>

This will have immediate implications for trade flows, particularly to UK markets but also to wider EU markets via the UK Landbridge.  </p>  <p>  The UK landbridge is an important means of access to the single market, one that is favoured by traders in high value or time sensitive goods because it offers significantly faster transit times than alternative routes. As such we continue to work positively with our EU partners on addressing challenges in EU ports for traffic in transit via the landbridge.  However, the Government has pointed out for some time now including in our 2019 and 2020 readiness plans that there will likely be delays at ports immediately after the end of the transition period, with Dover-Calais identified as a particular likely bottleneck. This is outside of our control. </p>  <p>  The process for moving goods by direct ferry routes between Ireland and other EU Member States will not be subject to new procedures.   Following ongoing consultation with the shipping sector, and given the responsiveness of the shipping companies during the Covid-19 pandemic, it is my Department&rsquo;s assessment that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports following the end of the UK&rsquo;s transition period.</p>  <p>  The performance of the shipping industry in responding to the challenges of Covid-19 has been impressive, including with a number of new direct services to Continental Europe having been established between Irish and continental ports, during the pandemic.  This indicates a high level of resilience, adaptability and commitment by shipping companies in serving Irish customer needs and the Irish market.</p>  <p>  My Department is confident that the shipping industry serving Ireland is open and competitive, is responsive to market demand and capable of responding to any increase in demand for direct connectivity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period.  I encourage engagement between traders, hauliers and ferry companies to align capacity with needs and I would encourage traders, where it is feasible to do so, to avoid the risk of disruption by moving to direct services now and not wait until after 1 January 2021.   </p>  <p>  As regards air freight, Department officials have been working closely with stakeholders in the aviation sector to prepare them for the changes to come at the end of the Brexit Transition period. The Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness Action Plan has a section on air travel with advice to businesses on what steps to take in order to be Brexit ready. This would apply to those involved in air freight, as well as passenger transport. Similar readiness preparations have been made at European level. It is not anticipated that the changed regulatory regime for aviation between the EU and the UK will have any direct impact on the movement of freight by air.</p></reply>

Since the publication of the 2018 report, my Department, in conjunction with the IMDO, has been keeping the issue of direct shipping routes to the Continent under close review, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Shipping companies have assured the IMDO and my officials that they will respond to any increases in demand for direct connectivity at the end of the transition period and shipping companies have been adding capacity even during the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-2020. </p>  <p>  At present, there is more than sufficient capacity on existing services in the RoRo network between Ireland and mainland Europe to cater, if required, for the landbridge traffic currently estimated at around 150,000 trucks per annum.   It is also considered that the shipping industry is resilient, responsive and capable, without State intervention, of adjusting to and satisfying market demand.   </p>  <p>  The Government considers that State intervention to establish a semi-State shipping sector or to establish State shipping links, in the current circumstances and in the context of the end of the UK&rsquo;s transition period, would be likely to undermine a market response resulting in an insufficient, inadequate and costly intervention being put in place.  Such an intervention would be likely to result in legal challenges from incumbent shipping providers, create difficulties for the State in extricating itself from the shipping market, would result in breaches of EU state aid rules and consequent requirements for repayment of the state aids with interest, with resulting adverse impacts on the viability of any companies receiving such aid. </p>  <p>  My Department, together with the IMDO, is continuing to closely monitor and keep under review the evolving situation regarding maritime connectivity to continental ports, and will remain in close consultation with the maritime sector and other relevant stakeholders on this issue.  We will also continue to engage with ports, hauliers, shipping companies and other stakeholders regarding the processes and facilities at Dublin and Rosslare Europort to deal with traffic post the end of the UK&rsquo;s transition period.</p>  <p>  In that context, the IMDO is specifically reviewing the conclusions and recommendations in the 2018 Landbridge Study and, in particular, the issue of direct maritime connectivity to Continental Europe at the end of the transition period.  That re-assessment is expected to be completed shortly. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Government&rsquo;s updated Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published on 9th September 2020, businesses are being asked to consider moving, in advance of the end of the transition period, to direct route options for the movement of goods from Ireland to the Continent, to avoid potential delays and the new procedures that will be introduced associated with using the UK landbridge.  Shipping companies should also continue to assess expected future demand requirements and remain ready to respond to increased capacity demands, and all the indications are that this is happening. My Department, together with the IMDO and other relevant Government Departments and Agencies, is also engaging in a communications campaign with stakeholders in this regard over the remaining weeks up to the year end. </p></reply>

However, it is not possible to facilitate any walk-ins due to the social distancing requirements and in the interest of protecting the staff and customers. Therefore, all appointments must be booked in advance. This, of course, has led to an increase in the demand for appointments.</p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is working with their providers to see how they can create the additional capacity needed as quickly as possible, while adhering to the return to work protocol. Options being introduced include a combination of additional staff, extended and additional operating hours (i.e. Sundays where needed), and the provision of overtime.  </p>  <p>  The NDLS booking system is undergoing software changes to cater for the expanded booking window associated with the additional NDLS appointment slots, with testing commencing this week.   </p>  <p>  The introduction of these steps may help ease some of the pressure on the NDLS, free up appointment slots and make it easier to find those slots at local centres. The RSA is continuing work with my Department to expand the current online facility to accommodate all driving licence and learner permit application types. Once the necessary legal amendments are in place, this should greatly reduce appointment delays.</p>  <p>  Currently, applications by post can be made by persons over the age of 70 with one year licences, but the RSA is examining how the postal system might be expanded  to handle greater numbers of postal applications. </p></reply>

All Irish airports, including the smaller regionals, have been fully exposed to the dramatic downturn in activity.  </p>  <p>  In order to assist business and protect employment, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of generalised supports for all companies such as wage subsidy schemes, grants, low-cost loans, commercial rates waivers and deferred tax liabilities.  Like all aviation enterprises, regional airports are eligible for, and can avail of, such supports in 2020. </p>  <p>  Also this year, and in line with priorities for regional development, &euro;6m in Exchequer grants is being provided to Ireland's smallest airports under the Government's Regional Airports Programme.  Three airports are eligible for capital and operational support under the related grant schemes; Donegal, Kerry and Ireland West Airport Knock.</p>  <p>  In addition to the grant aid, regional connectivity continues to be subsidised through Government funded PSO air services between Dublin and the airports of Donegal and Kerry.  Over &euro;7m is being provided to support this service in 2020.</p>  <p>  A new Regional Airports Programme for a five year period starting in 2021 is also being finalised.  This will help eligible airports remain viable as they adapt to the ongoing presence of Covid. </p>  <p>  This Government is fully committed to doing what it can to support the airport sector and recognises the important role that aviation plays in the economic well-being of Ireland.  However, the Government&rsquo;s priority must be to protect the health and safety of those living in Ireland while having regard to the best use of resources and the many other demands on the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  In relation to any additional support mechanisms for  regional airports, my Department will continue to work closely with key stakeholders and will continue to review options in the context of the Government&rsquo;s plans for international travel and the recommendations of the Aviation Taskforce. </p></reply>

To make that change, we need a whole of system perspective across all modes of transport, whether that is active travel, bus or rail. Getting that whole-of-system perspective requires evidence-based and plan-led transport infrastructure development, as well as transport infrastructure development that integrates with and acts as a catalyst for improved land-use planning.</p><p>In relation to inter-urban rail, I have recently agreed with my Northern colleague Minister Nicola Mallon, MLA, the need to develop further existing draft terms of reference for a proposed study of rail speeds on the Belfast-Dublin-Limerick Junction-Cork corridor, designated at EU level as a TEN-T Core Corridor. Our intention is to ensure the finalised terms of reference take sufficient cognisance of the need for balanced regional development, particularly in relation to connectivity with the North-West. </p><p>Our Departments will work together with other relevant stakeholders in finalising the terms of reference and moving forward with the procurement of consultants.</p><p>I look forward to the commencement of this important study in due course. </p></reply>

The analysis concluded that, the primary driver of house prices remained the continued misalignment between demand and supply rather than the Help-to-Buy Scheme.  </p><p>It is important that we continue to focus on the delivery of additional housing supply. With regard to actual housing completions this year, I am conscious that there is likely to be a significant shortfall in 2020 as compared to the targets which were envisaged in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  I believe that the enhancement of support provided Help-to-Buy in the July Stimulus Package will help to stimulate construction activity. </p><p>Furthermore, I am advised by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage that there are several initiatives in addition to the Help-to-Buy scheme to assist home buyers with affordability. These include the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan which is a Government-backed mortgage which is for first-time-buyers nationwide to purchase a new or second-hand home or to self-build. This scheme offers loans on competitive terms to those who are unable to secure a commercial bank loan.  Full details of the scheme are available at  .</p><p>  Additionally, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage advises that under his Department's Serviced Sites Fund (SSF), &euro;310 million has been allocated to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable new homes for purchase or rent in those areas where local authorities have identified and affordability challenge and the viability to deliver homes and below open market purchase prices.  Funding under the SSF is available for new-build homes on local authority land.  With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, Serviced Sites funding of &euro;127 million has been approved in principle in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-06a.590.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100600082#WRO05200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 250 to 252, inclusive, 262, 263, 269 to 271, inclusive, and 277 to 281, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from VRT and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant. The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. </p>  <p>  The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.   </p>  <p>  The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms; </p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; </p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  </p>  <p>  A Supreme Court decision of 18th June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, I acknowledge that the persons who successfully challenged a decision by the Medical Board of Appeal to refuse them a PMC are, on the basis of that Supreme Court decision, entitled to seek access to the Scheme. The Supreme Court decision raised complex issues, including the manner in which the persons concerned can access the Scheme, given that the Regulation which set out the medical eligibility criteria was not found to be invalid and given that the persons concerned were not assessed for a PMC on the single criterion of being permanently and severely disabled.</p>  <p>  However, in the particular circumstances, I consider that both persons merit access to this Scheme and I instructed my officials to liaise with the Medical Board of Appeal to request that Board Medical Certificates are issued to them in light of the Supreme Court decision. In this regard I understand that the Board are amenable to this course of action and that Board Medical Certificates will be issued to the persons concerned shortly.</p>  <p>  More generally, the Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. My officials are currently examining the judgement, in conjunction with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, and will bring forward any policy and/or legislative proposals, as necessary, for my consideration in due course.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation. While Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989.</p>  <p>  My officials were in contact with the Medical Board of Appeal and with officials in the Department of Health and will continue to liaise with them, as required, going forward. I have also written to the Minister for Health to request that there are no further PMC assessments until a sound legal basis for such assessments is re-established. </p>  <p>  While it is regrettable that PMC assessments are currently not taking place and I acknowledge that this will result in a growing waiting list, I anticipate that the work that is currently ongoing in relation to this matter will provide a proper basis for me to make a decision on the best pathway forward and to address the current legal uncertainty surrounding the Scheme. I can give a commitment that I will seek to bring clarity to this situation as soon as possible such that PMC assessments can re-continue based on a firm legal basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, I can confirm that there are currently about 170 cases waiting for review by the Medical Board of Appeal.</p></reply>

There are other holiday accommodation providers who are not legally required to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland but may choose to be voluntarily listed.  The process for registration or listing with F&aacute;ilte Ireland requires the service provider to make a self-declaration that their business complies with all statutory requirements. For those holiday accommodation providers who apply to be listed, the voluntary application process is very simple and quick and only incurs a nominal fee of &euro;1 for both 2020 and 2021. </p><p>Guidance can be found on F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s website.

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, neither I nor the Central Bank are in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level or terms or conditions that they should apply in individual cases.  </p>  <p>  It would appear that the details supplied are referring to an arrangement whereby the insurance policy is being paid by instalments, and that this is being facilitated through a financing arrangement as part of the insurance contract.  In such cases, a consumer may have to pay an additional amount of interest on the premium amount over the period.  It is my understanding that such arrangements are relatively common, and that they provide additional financing options for consumers who may not wish to pay for the insurance contract upfront. </p>  <p>  In situations where a person is not satisfied with the actions of an insurance provider in relation to the service provided, it is advisable that that person make a complaint to the firm's internal complaint resolution process.  The Consumer Protection Code requires that, if after 40 days the complaint has not been resolved to the customer&rsquo;s satisfaction, the regulated entity must inform the consumer that they may refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).   The FSPO is a statutory official who acts as an independent arbiter of disputes which consumers may have with their insurance company or other financial service provider. The FSPO can be contacted either by email at info@fspo.ie or by telephone at 01-567-7000. Investigations by the FSPO are free of charge to the complainant.   </p>  <p>  In addition to this, Insurance Ireland, the representative body for insurance providers in this country, operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, which can be accessed at feedback@insuranceireland.eu.</p></reply>

Late last year, the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) announced that it would carry out a study into dual pricing in the Irish market. Separately, the Deputy will also be aware that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to work to remove this practice from the market and the Bank&rsquo;s review is an important element of this undertaking.  </p>  <p>  The CBI&rsquo;s review is ongoing and is focussing on motor and home insurance.  It is being carried out in three phases, and the first of these was completed recently. While I welcome this, I note with concern that the Bank has observed that the majority of firms utilise differential pricing through various techniques and that a failure to recognise and / or acknowledge the practice on the part of some firms has raised significant concerns about their ability to assess its impact on customers.  On foot of its findings, the CBI sent a &ldquo;Dear CEO&rdquo; letter, on 8 September 2020, to firms to highlight its concerns following this first phase.  I now fully expect that firms will respond to these concerns in a positive manner and cooperate with the CBI.   </p>  <p>  The work of the Central Bank of Ireland is now moving to the next phases of its review, before it makes any final recommendations.  On foot of this, I believe that it would be prudent to await the outcome of the review in advance of adopting any particular approach, including in relation to considering any possible steps to legislate to remove the practice of dual pricing.  This is undoubtedly a complex issue and will need careful consideration of any potential remedies, and what overall impact they would have on consumers.  We need to guard against the risk of unintended consequences in that in attempting to address an issue we don&rsquo;t create an undesirable knock-on impact elsewhere.  This could include dis-encouraging competition or new entrants to the market, all of which is not in Irish consumers long-term interests.  </p>  <p>  Finally, while I believe the CBI's initial findings demonstrate the need for consumers to shop around when taking out or renewing insurance, I also expect that insurance firms will treat their customers fairly.  The recent preliminary findings of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commissions in relation to the motor insurance sector serve to remind us of the importance of insurance generally and the impact of the costs of insurance on consumers and businesses.</p></reply>

This latter examination was carried out by the Tax Strategy Group (TSG), which is overseen by my Department and which met on 10 September 2020. A TSG paper that sets out the consideration of the policy matters that arose during Revenue's FRE review has now been published as part of the regular Budget process.  It is available online at .</p><p>Given that the deliberations on the policy matters set out in the TSG continue, it would not be unexpected that any changes to the FRE regime might await the outcome of those deliberations. Similarly, the question of the timing of the introduction of any changes to the FRE regime is solely a matter for Revenue.</p></reply>

There is also a commitment to the development of a &rdquo;<i>national remote working strategy</i>&rdquo; and to that end, a Remote Working Strategy Inter-Departmental Group has been established.  Officials from my Department are included in this group which is chaired by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  A number of issues are being considered as relevant to these commitments, the results of which will be made public in due course.</p><p>In terms of the current tax treatment of the costs associated with working from home, I would note that any such costs incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business by an employer (for example, the provision of equipment) may be deducted by the employer in the normal course of calculating the tax liability of their business.</p><p>From the perspective of the individual employee, there is no specific tax credit available to employees where they work from home.  The consideration of the introduction of any such credit would need to balance a number of factors including issues of equity, noting that not every worker is able to work remotely or from home for a variety of reasons including the nature of their work and also the nature of their home environment.</p><p>However, I am advised by Revenue that where e-workers incur certain extra expenditure in the performance of their duties of employment remotely or from home, such as additional heating and electricity costs, there is a Revenue administrative practice in place that allows an employer to make payments up to &euro;3.20 per day to such employees, subject to certain conditions, without deducting PAYE, PRSI, or USC.</p><p>Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.</p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use. The provision of a telephone line, broadband and such facilities for business use will also not give rise to a Benefit-in-Kind charge, where private use of the connection is incidental.</p><p>Where an employer does not pay &euro;3.20 per day to an e-worker, I am advised that employees retain their statutory right to claim a deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 in respect of actual vouched expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of their employment. PAYE employees are entitled to claim costs such as additional light and heat in respect of the number of days spent working from home, apportioned on the basis of business and private use. </p><p>PAYE workers can claim e-working expenses by completing an Income Tax return at year end.  Revenue advise that the simplest way for taxpayers to claim their e-working expenses and any other tax credit entitlements is by logging into the myAccount facility on the Revenue website.</p><p>Finally, I am advised that Revenue have published detailed guidance on e-working arrangements in their Tax and Duty manual TDM 05-02-13 e-Working and Tax.</p></reply>

The Home Carer Tax Credit is therefore only available to jointly assessed couples in a marriage or civil partnership, and it is not available to single persons as the issues that the credit sought to address do not arise in their circumstances.  Instead, the Single Person Child Carer Credit of &euro;1,650 (and an increased rate band of &euro;4,000) is available to single parents (whether widowed, separated, deserted or a single parent) with caring responsibilities for a dependent child who is under 18 years or, if over 18, is an incapacitated child who satisfies the incapacitated child tax credit criteria.</p>  <p>  As regards the question of claiming tax relief on the cost of employing a care worker while also claiming the Dependent Relative or Incapacitated Child Tax Credit, the position is that there is no restriction on this and that such tax relief is available at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate of tax. However, there is an anti-avoidance provision in the legislation which prohibits claiming dependent relative or incapacitated child tax credits in respect of a person where that person is employed as the carer.</p>  <p>  On the proposal to increase the Dependent Relative Tax Credit to the same level as the Incapacitated Child Credit, each of these credits is targeted at different issues and different personal circumstances and as a result are set at different levels:</p>  <p>  - The Dependent Relative Tax Credit is a modest tax credit of &euro;70, which can be claimed by an individual who maintains, at his or her own expense, a relative who is unable to maintain himself or herself.  </p>  <p>  - The Incapacitated Child Tax Credit is a tax credit of &euro;3,300, which can be claimed by a person in respect of a child who is permanently incapacitated either physically or mentally from maintaining himself or herself and had become so before reaching 21 years of age or finishing full-time education. The person must either be the parent of the child, have custody of the child or maintain the child at their own expense.</p>  <p>  If the Dependent Relative Tax Credit was increased some 47-fold by &euro;3,230 to &euro;3,300 it is estimated to cost an additional &euro;194m in a full year.  The values of the credits have been set at levels that are intended in part to reflect the economic burden that arises from the condition of the person being cared for, as well as the resources available to pay for their care.  </p>  <p>  Finally, it is noted that these credits apply in addition to other various supports from other parts of Government, including the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Disability, Equality and Integration, that assist those with caring responsibilities.</p></reply>

The payment is due by 31 October in a year, or later if paying online via the Revenue Online Service (ROS).  </p><p>The amount of the preliminary tax payment is</p><p>- 90% of the current year&rsquo;s liability;</p><p>- 100% of the prior year&rsquo;s liability; or</p><p>- 105% of the tax due for the tax year preceding the immediately previous tax year (often called the &lsquo;pre-preceding year&rsquo;).</p><p>The &ldquo;pre-preceding year&rdquo; option only applies to taxpayers paying by direct debit.  Taxpayers not paying by direct debit can choose the lower of the other two options.</p><p>The other part of the payment &ndash; the balance of tax owing for the previous year &ndash; is the difference between the liability based on the individual&rsquo;s self-assessed income tax return, and the preliminary tax paid last year. </p><p>Revenue has extended the deadline for customers to file their 2019 self-assessed income tax return and make the appropriate payment in respect of preliminary tax for 2020 and any income tax balance due for 2019.  The due date has been extended by four weeks from 12 November 2020 to 10 December 2020.  To qualify for the extension, customers must both pay and file through ROS; otherwise the relevant return and payment is due no later than 31 October 2020. </p><p>In the correspondence provided, the person seems to think that preliminary tax is a pre-payment of next year&rsquo;s liability and the preliminary tax system discriminates against the self-assessed taxpayer compared to a PAYE taxpayer.  This is not the case; the preliminary tax due this year is a preliminary tax payment for this year, 2020.  With the extended deadline this payment is due by 10 December.  A PAYE taxpayer will have paid his or her liability through 2020.</p><p>In most cases individuals will not be paying the full amount of two years&rsquo; income tax liabilities (previous year and current year) at once, unless they paid no preliminary tax in the previous year and based on their self-assessed income tax return they now have a liability for that year.</p></reply>

This is a commercial matter for each individual credit institution having regard to the relevant legal and regulatory requirements which apply.</p>  <p>  With regard to those regulatory requirements, the Deputy may wish to note that there is an exemption from the Central Bank&rsquo;s macro-prudential mortgage measures &ndash; in respect of the loan-to-value (LTV) restriction on mortgage borrowers &ndash; for those in negative equity who wish to purchase a new home.  This means that the mortgage shortfall remaining after a person sells their existing home can be added to the balance of the new mortgage for a new home and that the macro-prudential deposit requirements will not apply to that new mortgage.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection framework also includes a number of measures to protect consumers who are taking out a mortgage and seeks to ensure that lenders are transparent and fair in all their dealings with borrowers and that borrowers are protected from the beginning to the end of the mortgage life cycle.  The Consumer Protection Code 2012 requires regulated entities to carry out affordability and suitability assessment, prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a credit product to a personal consumer.  Separately, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 require that creditors assess the creditworthiness of the consumer before concluding a credit agreement. </p>  <p>  However, subject to the requirement to comply with the relevant legal and regulatory requirements which govern the provision of residential mortgage credit to consumers, as indicated it is ultimately a commercial matter for an individual lender to decide whether to offer particular products or whether to provide a new mortgage loan or decide on how much credit to provide in any particular case.</p></reply>

The State Claims Agency (SCA) which is part of the NTMA has advised me that the figures that relate to court awards are not representative of the trends in damages, legal fees or expert costs experienced by the SCA as court awards account for a very small percentage of the total amount of damages, legal fees and expert costs that relate to claims managed by the SCA. </p>  <p>  As set out in the 2019 NTMA Annual Report, damages awarded by a court accounted for 0.5% of all claims resolved by the SCA in 2019.  The total costs incurred by the SCA in 2019 in resolving and managing ongoing active claims, as set out in the 2019 NTMA Annual Report, were &euro;416.9m (2018: &euro;347.1m).</p>  <p>  The 2020 figure set out in the PQ referred to above is higher than in previous years due to a significant award in a catastrophic injury case relating to an infant plaintiff.  High awards/settlements in such cases are driven by a requirement to provide for complex lifelong care needs.  It should be noted that costs relating to cases included in the response to PQ 26142-20 are all apportioned to the year they are finalised (all associated payments will have been issued or will be in process of being paid).  In practice such costs may have been paid over a number of years.</p></reply>

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months.  This was a welcome initiative and it allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers.</p><p>Banks have now provided for flexible options for borrowers who can recommence payments following a Covid-19 payment break, and the BPFI has produced a useful guide on this - <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i>The Central Bank has also updated its Covid-19 FAQ in relation to mortgage payment breaks on 18 September.</p><p>However, I am very conscious that many other borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and that they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends.  I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are still facing, and they will continue need assistance and support from their lenders.  At our recent meeting, this point was made very clear to the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks, and to the BPFI, by the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and myself.  It was also indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty.  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers still experiencing mortgage or other loan difficulty because of Covid-19.  These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be short term such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements.  Each individual&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.</p><p>I will also continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support following a Covid-19 payment break.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-06a.648.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100600084#WRQ02200"><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was legislated for in section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020.  The scheme was predicated on the employer wanting to keep the employees on the payroll and to retain them until business picked up.  The employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income for the duration of the scheme.  Legally, however, there was no requirement for a minimum amount that the employer had to pay as a normal wages payment to an employee to top up the wage subsidy.  The reason there is no such requirement is simple &ndash; many businesses were forced to close completely and would have had no capacity to continue to pay employees&rsquo; wages.  The purpose of the TWSS was to get much needed financial assistance to employees, while retaining the employer / employee relationship which facilitated the early recommencement of normal business when conditions permitted.</p>  <p>  Payments made under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme are income supports and share the characteristics of income.  Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, therefore, payments under the TWSS are subject to income tax and USC. </p>  <p>  While income tax and the USC on most income is deducted in real-time as and when the person is paid, the TWSS payments were not taxed in real-time and are instead liable to income tax and USC at the end of the year (2020).</p>  <p>  Revenue will make a Preliminary End of Year Statement available to all employees in January 2021, including those who were in receipt of the TWSS.  The Preliminary End of Year Statement includes information relating to an employee&rsquo;s income received, including pensions and income from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protect, as well as their tax credit entitlements.  For the tax year 2020, the Statement will also include information on the amounts of TWSS payments, if any, received by each employee.  In addition, the Statement will provide employees with a preliminary calculation of the income tax and USC position for 2020 and will indicate whether their tax position is balanced, underpaid or overpaid for the year.</p>  <p>  Upon viewing the Preliminary End of Year Statement through myAccount, which is Revenue&rsquo;s secure online facility for individual taxpayer services, employees will have an opportunity to update their personal record, declare any additional income and claim any additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses, to arrive at their final liability for 2020. </p>  <p>  Where a liability is finalised, individuals may opt to fully or partially pay any income tax and USC liability through the Payments/Repayments facility in myAccount.  Where individuals do not opt to fully or partially pay, Revenue will collect the liability by reducing their tax credits over 4 years, interest free.  The reduction of tax credits will start in January 2022.</p>  <p>  On 25 September 2020, Revenue provided an update, by way of public announcement, as to how any tax liability arising on the TWSS will be dealt with.  I am pleased to welcome this fair and flexible approach being taken by Revenue in the collection of tax due on payments made under TWSS which aims to minimise any hardship on any individuals concerned.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-06a.654.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100600085#WRR00400"><p>I am advised by Revenue that under the terms of the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS), qualifying road transport operators submit their claims, via an online system, during the three months following when the transaction took place. Once the claims are received by Revenue, they are normally processed and paid within eight weeks following completion of the necessary validation checks.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also confirmed to me that standard (non-DRS related) VAT Repayments across all sectors are generally processed within twenty days. However, on occasion, Revenue may require clarification or further information regarding a claim and this can delay repayment depending on the timing and accuracy of the responses received from the business. If the Deputy is aware of a claim that is awaiting payment for nine months, she should provide the information to Revenue so that the matter can be investigated. </p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the difficulties being experienced by hauliers arising from Covid-19, the Financial Measures (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act 2020 put on a statutory footing the arrangements for the deferral or &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; of tax debts, which is available to any businesses, including hauliers, that are impacted negatively by the pandemic.  </p>  <p>  The legislation provides that outstanding VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities incurred during the period of restricted trading due to Covid-19 can be deferred for twelve months after resumption of trading. Rather than the normal interest rate of c. 10% per annum on such liabilities, interest on &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo; debts is applied at 0% during the 12 month &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; period and 3% thereafter until the liabilities are paid. There is currently &euro;1.8 billion of debt &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo; under the scheme, which is a very significant cash flow assistance to businesses. </p>  <p>  Access to the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; arrangements is dependent on all outstanding tax returns being filed and current taxes being paid on a timely basis once trading resumes. Businesses that avail of the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; scheme also qualify for a Tax Clearance Certificate if they otherwise meet the normal qualifying conditions. This gives them access to other Covid-related supports, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme. </p>  <p>  As a further support measure for businesses, including hauliers, I introduced a reduced annual interest rate of 3% for certain tax debts as part of the July 2020 Jobs Stimulus Package. This rate represents a significant reduction from the standard 8% and 10% rates that normally apply to such liabilities and is applicable across all tax-heads and outstanding debts that cannot be &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo;, for example older liabilities and tax debts not associated with Covid-19. The interest rate reduction is a key incentive to businesses to bring their tax affairs into order, be tax cleared, and thereby become eligible for the other Covid-19 related supports that are available. </p>  <p>  To avail of the reduced 3% rate, businesses are required to agree a payment arrangement with Revenue by 31 October 2020 (extended from 30 September 2020). Revenue has advised me that almost &euro;50m of non-Covid-19 related tax debt is now covered by phased payments incorporating the reduced 3% rate.</p></reply>

In the case of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit, however,  special arrangements have been made to extend the potential benefit as widely as possible so that, even where a person does not have an income tax liability, he or she may still benefit by virtue of having a USC liability. The position is that a full-time minimum wage worker will be able to absorb fully the Stay and Spend Tax Credit in either 2020 or 2021.  In fact, a person who earns 75% of the minimum wage in the year, for example a person working part-time for 29.25 hours per week on the minimum wage, will also be able to fully absorb the credit in either 2020 or 2021.</p></reply>

This is a statutory requirement under the Arterial Drainage Acts, which now, under the recent European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Arterial Drainage) Regulations 2019, also require the MPER to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the proposed Scheme.  This now involves, inter alia, a formal review by MPER of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) prepared by the Commissioners and recently submitted (along with a Natura Impact Statement) to the MPER as part of the formal confirmation process.</p>  <p>  The River Slaney (Enniscorthy) Flood Relief Scheme is currently awaiting formal Confirmation to proceed from The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The statutory consultation period required in relation to this process has recently been completed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and any relevant observations will be taken into consideration. While it is not possible to give a construction start date until such time as the scheme is formally confirmed, Wexford County Council and the OPW are working together to ensure that the procurement of a Contractor for the flood relief works will be completed as soon as practicable after the confirmation of the scheme. The overall budget for the scheme is &euro;50.7m, provision for which has been made in the OPW multi Annual Capital Budget.</p></reply>

Ensuring the provision of the necessary funding to support our people and key public services over the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic will be the key priority in Budget 2021. In light of this, work is ongoing in assessing the impact of further Covid-19 costs in 2021. As set out in a previous Parliamentary Question, on a no policy change (NPC) basis, and assuming an improved position in relation to employment next year based on the latest macroeconomic projections, it is estimated that there could be a cost of approximately &euro;9 billion in relation to Covid-19 expenditure in 2021. This figure is inclusive of the carryover costs of the July Stimulus set out above. However, this amount is subject to significant uncertainty, with a need in particular to work through in detail the requirements for the Health service next year and also the impact on income and employment supports of the impact of the pandemic on the labour market. This work in relation to estimating the NPC position will be finalised this week and reflected in the White Paper - Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure to be published on 9th October. </p><p>Further information will also be set out in detail in the 2021 Expenditure Report. It should be noted that these pressures will be dealt with separately from core expenditure increases and given their scale, will form a significant part of the overall package of budgetary measures for 2021.</p><p>As is usual, there are a number of pre-commitments in relation to core expenditure for Budget 2021. Table 2 below sets out these current and capital core expenditure pre-commitments for Budget 2021, totalling &euro;2 billion.

The exemption applies countrywide to elite and professional sport, inter-county GAA, ladies football or camogie matches and any national senior club championships that are already underway. Senior in this context is to be understood as meaning adult. Where these exempted events are taking place in a county operating at Level 3, they must be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. The sporting bodies have also been encouraged to postpone or reschedule events and fixtures impacted by a county or region moving beyond Level 2, where possible.</p><p>Domestic travel guidance in the <i>Recovery and Resilience Plan</i>states that for Level 3 counties, people should stay in the county apart from work, education and other essential purposes, if appropriate. Travelling outside a Level 3 county to participate in or spectate at matches or sports events is generally not permitted. However, for those individuals and teams who are in an exempted category, it is permitted to travel to participate in a match or sport event. Persons who travel for this purpose are strongly encouraged to avoid all social contacts and to minimise their personal contacts outside the field of play. </p><p>As the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, Sport Ireland has issued guidance to the sport sector on the practical implications for sport of the various Covid-19 restrictions that have been introduced to date. The guidance issued by Sport Ireland is informed by and aligned with public health guidance developed by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.</p></reply>

Ireland is obliged to maintain their populations at  favourable conservation status.  We are also required to monitor these species and report to the European Commission on their conservation status.  A standardised monitoring programme has been in place for both since 2009.  The most recent report on their conservation status was submitted to the European Commission in April 2019 and is available on the NPWS website (). Both species are assessed as being at favourable conservation status.</p><p>Section 42 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 (as amended) provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that where protected wild animals or birds are causing serious damage, persons affected may on application to the Minister seek a permission to take appropriate steps to mitigate the damage.  A very small number of such applications in a given year will concern seal damage. </p><p>Applications are investigated by local staff to determine if serious damage is being caused and if so the most practical method of controlling the problem.  Consideration of the license applications made under Section 42 includes reference to any conservation issues facing the protected species in question.  Applications under this section normally involve very small numbers of animals and an environmental impact assessment is not required to issue licenses. </p><p>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, will be writing to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to arrange a meeting to discuss seal conservation and problems for fishermen from seal damage on fishing nets.</p><p>Furthermore, I understand that the Irish Seal Group has been re-established and is to meet online in mid-October.  The group includes the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, the Irish Seal Sanctuary, the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producer&rsquo;s Organisation, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, BIM and marine mammal researchers from UCC.  It will be chaired by the Marine Institute.</p><p>The group's main focus will be to agree, where possible, joint research and other recommendations to progress and address the seal-fisheries conflict issues.</p></reply>

National Policy Objective (NPO) 15 of the NPF fully supports the concept of the sustainable development of rural areas by encouraging growth and arresting decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or decline in recent decades, while simultaneously indicating the need to manage certain areas around cities and towns.</p>  <p>  The 2005 Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines are framed in the context of the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) 2002.  Given the superseding of the NSS by the National Planning Framework (NPF) in 2018, together with the long-standing need to address the implications of the 2013 European Court of Justice ruling in the "Flemish Decree" case, the Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines require updating, in a broader rural development and settlement context.  My Department has commenced scoping this work and I expect a draft by the end of this year. </p>  <p>  In the interim, the NPF objectives together with the 2005 Guidelines, enable planning authorities to continue to draft and adopt county development plan policies for one-off housing in rural areas.</p></reply>

Further orders were signed on 16 April 2020 and 9 May 2020, the last of which expired on 23 May 2020. The three Orders had the combined effect of extending the relevant planning periods and timelines by an aggregate of 56 days/8 weeks during the time period in which they had effect. Following the expiry of the final Order made under section 251A of the Act on 23 May 2020 the statutory time periods as set out in the 2000 Act and associated planning and building control legislation resumed.  </p>  <p>  Further measures were introduced on 22 May 2020 by way of the Planning and Development (Section 38) Regulations 2020, which instructed planning authorities to upload all planning application documents onto their internet websites within 5 working days of receipt, subject to exceptional circumstances.  This new statutory requirement facilitates greater use of online access to planning applications by members of the public, maintaining the integrity of the planning system in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  On 15 September 2020, the Government published its latest response to managing Covid-19 - Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for living with Covid-19. At present, I do not envisage that any further actions will be required for the planning system in the context of this framework at this time, however I will continue to keep this matter under review.</p></reply>

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.</p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.</p><p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.</p><p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p><p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.</p><p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is under way. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.</p></reply>

Consequently, since 1 April 2011, RAS tenants are now considered to be in receipt of social housing support and should not generally remain on main housing waiting lists for new applicants for social housing.</p><p>  Recognising that tenants housed through RAS prior to this change might have had reasonable expectations in regard to retaining access to traditional local authority rented accommodation, guidance issued from the Housing Agency in 2011 recommended that there should be a special transfer pathway for pre-2011 RAS tenants to other forms of social housing support. The arrangement effectively allowed these households to be designated as a &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; applicant and to maintain their position for allocation as they had on the main waiting list.</p><p>  All tenants allocated RAS accommodation post 1 April 2011 (and thus under the provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009) were informed at the time of offer and allocation that because RAS is now a social housing support, their housing need is met and that they will no longer remain on the main social housing waiting list.</p><p>  However, it is recommended that allocation schemes also provide a &lsquo;transfer pathway&rsquo; for new RAS tenants, whereby households in RAS have access to the transfer list in the same way as tenants in local authority accommodation.</p><p>Where a vacant property arises, it is a matter for individual housing authorities, in accordance with their allocation schemes, to determine whether the allocation is made to a household on the main waiting list, or to a transfer applicant, such as a household from RAS, and the method of such allocation. It is open to housing authorities to specify in their allocation schemes the proportion of allocations which will be reserved for transfers, and within this, how many may be reserved for households seeking transfers to other forms of social housing support.</p></reply>

The programme improves the insulation standards and overall energy performance of local authority housing stock, which can benefit those at risk of fuel poverty and also improve the health and comfort of the occupants of local authority homes.  </p>  <p>  The programme is open to all local authorities and has been implemented to date in two phases: Phase 1 is classed as a shallow retrofit and aims to ensure that the entire social housing stock has, as a minimum, cavity wall and attic insulation. Phase 2 focuses on the fabric upgrade works to those dwellings with solid/hollow block wall construction and includes the provision of heating upgrades and replacement windows and doors; this is deemed to be a more deeper retrofit.  In transitioning to the deeper retrofit implementation, my Department has requested local authorities to achieve a 'B2' or equivalent building energy rating for their housing stock. </p>  <p>  To date over 72,000 social homes have been upgraded under the programme with funding support of some &euro;151 million.  In Cork City it has supported the upgrade of some 7,000 homes with funding of over &euro;20.2m.  This includes funding of &euro;6.157m provided for the deep retrofit of 129 apartments across 15 different blocks.  Further to this I also recently issued funding approval of &euro;3.54m to support Cork City Council in their upgrading of a further 81 apartments.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, a national retrofitting plan is due to be rolled out in 2021 led by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action &amp;amp; Environment.  The targets set within the Climate Action Plan will see 500,000 homes nationally, retrofitted by end 2030, including private and social homes.</p></reply>

The decision to grant or refuse permission in such cases, and to assign conditions in the case of such planning applications where permission is granted, is ultimately a matter for the relevant planning authority. </p>  <p>  The ongoing implementation of the language planning process has a statutory footing under the Gaeltacht Act 2012.  As set out in the National Planning Framework (NPF), published in 2018, the language planning process, as prescribed in the Gaeltacht Act 2012, represents the primary driver in support of the commitment to the achievement of the objectives set out in the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010 to 2030. Objective 29 of the NPF makes provision for supporting the implementation of language plans in Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas, Gaeltacht Service Towns and Irish Language Networks.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended, (the Act) sets out mandatory objectives for local authorities, which must be addressed in the drafting of their statutory County Development Plan which governs local development policies. Section 10(2) of the Act includes a requirement that, where there is a Gaeltacht area within the planning authority&rsquo;s territory, the development plan must include provisions and objectives for &ldquo;the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht including the promotion of Irish as the community language&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  To provide further guidance in preparing appropriate policies, my Department produced &lsquo;Development Plans, Guidelines for Planning Authorities&rsquo;, to address this mandatory objective of the Act. These guidelines refer to linguistic and cultural heritage and the needs of the community in land-use terms for housing, community facilities, employment, tourism and design, including advertising and signage. For example, the Galway County Development Plan 2015-2021 incorporated a subsequent Variation to include a specific Gaeltacht Area Plan. Individual development plans may also oblige applicants for planning permission to submit certain particulars or information to accompany proposed development in Gaeltacht areas, such as assessments of the linguistic impact of the development that is proposed, in order for the proposal to be properly assessed against relevant policies of the development plan. </p>  <p>  Since April 2019, the assessment of all local authority development plans and local area plans is undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR).

The purpose of the review was to inform the Minister in relation to any actions he may recommend to Government concerning the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue. </p>  <p>  As the LPT review did not primarily concern itself with the allocation mechanism to individual authorities, it was important that a framework be established regarding the allocation of any additional funding that might be available to the local government sector as a consequence of any changes to LPT. Therefore, in May 2018, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government separately initiated a Local Government Funding (Baseline) Review to help inform the distribution of any such funding that may become available for general operational purposes. These options can be further considered as and when changes to LPT are advanced by Government. In this regard, I will consider the available options in parallel with implementation of the commitment in the Programme for Government that those local authorities with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Minister for Finance has recently decided to defer the next valuation date for  (LPT) liabilities from 1 November 2020 to 1 November 2021. This decision is a matter for the Minister for Finance and is primarily a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, meaning there was no formal consultation with my Department, nor was a formal consultation necessary.</p></reply>

The Programme commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.  </p>  <p>  In terms of affordable housing for purchase, the statutory basis for the delivery of affordable housing for purchase in the State is Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced in June 2018.</p>  <p>  Under my Department's Serviced Sites Fund, &euro;310 million has been allocated to provide infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable new homes for purchase or rent in those areas where local authorities have identified an affordability challenge and the viability to deliver homes and below open market purchase prices.  Funding under the Serviced Sites Fund is available for new-build homes on local authority land.  With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, Serviced Sites funding of &euro;127 million has been approved in principle in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes.</p>  <p>  In relation to the rental sector, the Programme for Government commits to improving security and affordability for renters. To achieve that, we are developing a Cost Rental model for delivery of housing that creates affordability for tenants and a sustainable model for construction and management of homes. Cost Rental is housing where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. Cost Rental is not intended to overlap with or replace traditional social housing for low-income households. </p>  <p>  Work to outline the consistent and sustainable delivery of Cost Rental at scale was initiated through an inter-departmental multi-agency Cost Rental Working Group.  It is also being assisted by an external research project sponsored by the European Investment Bank on behalf of my Department. Furthermore, three initial Cost Rental projects are already being progressed, including 50 units at Enniskerry Road in Stepaside, that is currently under construction, while sites at Emmet Road, Inchicore (the former St Michael&rsquo;s Estate) and Shanganagh Castle, Shankill, are at the design phase.  </p>  <p>  In terms of affordable housing more generally, I will outline my detailed plans in the near future, taking account of progress to date under the SSF, experience from these Cost Rental pilots, a number of other measures, as well as the input of key delivery partners.</p></reply>

However, my Department does support local authorities in improving their social housing stock through a range of programmes including energy retrofitting, regeneration and refurbishment works to vacant properties in order to return these to productive use as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  In all cases, the identification of properties for inclusion in any such programmes, is a matter for the local authority.  </p>  <p>  My Department has operated an Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme for local authority social housing since 2013, which has seen over 72,000 social homes insulated to date with funding support of some &euro;151 million. The programme improves the insulation standards and overall energy performance of local authority housing stock, which can benefit those at risk of fuel poverty and also improve the health and comfort of the occupants of local authority homes. </p>  <p>  For 2020, the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting programme for social housing has an allocated exchequer budget of &euro;25 million, while a further &euro;20 million is being made available for similar retrofitting of social homes in the midlands as part of the 'Just Transition' programme. </p>  <p>  The Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme for social housing is open to all local authorities and has been implemented to date in two phases: Phase 1 is classed as a shallow retrofit and aims to ensure that the entire social housing stock has, as a minimum, cavity wall and attic insulation. Phase 2 focuses on the fabric upgrade works to those dwellings with solid/hollow block wall construction and includes the provision of heating upgrades and replacement windows and doors; this is deemed to be a more deep retrofit.  In transitioning to the deep retrofit implementation, my Department has requested local authorities to achieve a 'B2' or equivalent building energy rating for their housing stock. </p>  <p>  In addition to the Energy Efficiency Retrofitting Programme, energy efficiency improvements have also been incorporated into the approximately 11,000 vacant social housing homes that have been returned to productive use under the Voids Programme since 2014. </p>  <p>  As part of the 'Just Transition' proposals for the midlands region, Budget 2020 also made provision for &euro;20 million to fund energy efficiency upgrades to local authority houses in the affected counties as a pilot programme. As well as retrofitting social housing stock in the midlands, the programme also aims to create opportunities for retrofitting of private housing with support from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  </p>  <p>  This Programme is being developed under a Retrofit Taskforce and has involved my Department working closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the SEAI and the relevant local authorities.</p>  <p>  As set out in the Programme for Government, a national retrofitting plan is due to be rolled out in 2021 led by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The midlands pilot along with other pilot schemes which are due to commence roll-on in early 2021, will be used to test key elements of the national plan and my Department will work with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in this work.  The targets set within the Climate Action Plan will see 500,000 homes nationally retrofitted by end 2030, including private and social homes.</p></reply>

The EPA produces an annual Public Supply Drinking Water Report and Private Supply Drinking Water Report, which provides an overview of the quality of drinking water in public and private supplies. The reports are based on the assessment of monitoring results reported to the EPA by Irish Water and the Local Authorities, and on EPA and Local Authority enforcement activities. </p>  <p>  The EPA's latest report 'Drinking Water Quality in Public Supplies 2019' published in July, shows that overall our water supplies are safe, with over 99% of water samples complying with safety limits. </p>  <p>  While the quality of our drinking water supplies remains very high, the EPA has also set out the risks and challenges that remain. Many of these issues are long-standing and without Irish Water acting to address these issues, we would be in a worse situation.</p>  <p>  The report demonstrates the work done in 2019 in key areas such as the National Disinfection Programme, removing THMs (Trihalomethanes), and Cryptosporidium risk assessments, which are vital to ensuring clean, safe drinking water throughout the country. By the end of 2019, Irish Water had assessed 811 of the 864 plants in the National Disinfection Programme and completed upgrades at 230 plants. Work is under way at a further 35 sites.</p>  <p>  The report also shows Irish Water's progress in relation to reducing the number of supplies on the Remedial Action List (RAL).  The EPA publishes on its website the RAL on a quarterly basis.  At the end of July 2020, 52 supplies remain on the RAL which collectively supply water to 1,151,288 consumers.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of lead, in 2017 Irish Water estimated that lead pipework exists in approximately 180,000 residential properties in Ireland. While there are no lead water mains in Ireland, service connections within properties can contain traces of lead. The vast majority of lead pipes are contained within properties built up to and including the 1970s.</p>  <p>  Lead in drinking water is both the responsibility of water suppliers and property owners. Irish Water is responsible for lead pipework in the public water distribution network. This is known as public-side lead. Lead plumbing in buildings and within property boundaries is a matter for the property owner. This is known as private-side lead.</p>  <p>  The Government published a National Strategy to Reduce Exposure to Lead in Drinking Water in June 2015. In response to the recommendations of this strategy, Irish Water prepared a detailed Lead in Drinking Water Mitigation Plan to identify measures to mitigate the risks to human health posed by the presence of lead in drinking water. The Plan proposes to remove all public lead service connection pipes over a ten year programme (i.e. by the end of 2026).</p>  <p>  Irish Water have also put in place an interim water treatment programme to protect consumers from lead exposure while this replacement programme is implemented. According to the recent EPA report, Drinking Water Quality in Public Supplies 2019, by the end of 2019 17% of all public side lead connections had been replaced.</p>  <p>The Lead Mitigation Advisory Group, which is chaired by officials from my Department, meets regularly to consider and make recommendations on the broader Irish Water Lead Mitigation Strategy and to consider appropriate guidelines and criteria for Irish Water's decision-making process for lead mitigation measures. The most recent of these meetings took place on 23 September 2020.</p>  <p>  The new Programme for Government sets out clear and ambitious commitments to ensure that Irish Water accelerates the resolution of schemes on the EPA's Remedial Action List; that lead pipe is removed from water supplies, that the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) is minimised, and that Irish Water integrates the Drinking Water Safety Plan approach in order to fully protect our water supplies and to direct investment to priority areas.</p>  <p>  Given the legacy of underinvestment in water services infrastructure in Ireland, the scale of remedial work necessary in our water system will take a number years and investment cycles to fully resolve.  The Government has committed to ambitious funding of Irish Water's capital investment plans for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis.

An initial three-month waiver of rates for businesses forced to close business due to COVID-19, was announced in May.  In order to enhance the supports available for enterprise, and in recognition of the fact that not only were many ratepayers forced to close business due to the public health requirements, but many that remained open suffered significant reductions in turnover, the waiver was extended from three to six months, running until 27 September 2020.  The categories of eligible enterprise were also expanded somewhat. A 100% waiver was applied to all businesses with the exception of a small number of categories. The rationale for the exclusion of certain categories of ratepayers was that their operations were not as severely impacted by the pandemic, coupled with the need to direct resources appropriately. To support both the local government sector and the ratepayers impacted, &euro;600m has been allocated by Government to fund the cost of the waiver, which took the form of a credit in lieu of rates.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates legislation provides for the refund of rates paid on vacant commercial properties in certain circumstances.  The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for rates. However, the owner is entitled to a refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes, these being if the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment. The collection of rates and the determination of eligibility for a refund in this context are matters for each individual local authority.</p>  <p>  A vacant property which has availed of, or is availing of a local authority vacancy refund in 2020, was excluded from the six-month waiver of commercial rates.</p>  <p>  Separate to rates legislation, the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015, provides for the vacant site levy.  The primary purpose of the levy is to act as an incentive for the bringing forward of vacant under-used sites for development for residential or regeneration purposes. The implementation of the vacant site levy provisions is a matter for each local authority.</p>  <p>  Local Authorities can only apply the levy if the criteria set out in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 are satisfied i.e. in the case of regeneration land</p>  <p>  - the site, or the majority of the site, is vacant or idle, and</p>  <p>  - the site being vacant or idle has adverse effects on existing amenities or reduces the amenity provided by existing public infrastructure and facilities (within the meaning of section 48 of the Act of 2000) in the area in which the site is situated or has adverse affects on the character of the area.</p>  <p>  The condition where a vacant property is excluded from the six-month waiver relates to vacancy refund provisions under rates legislation rather than whether a property was subject to the vacant site levy and on a vacant sites register.</p></reply>

The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, <i><font color="#0000FF">www.pyriteboard.ie</font></i>.</p><p>The scheme is applicable to dwellings, which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established, in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave. There are no proposals to provide for further financial assistance outside of the scheme.</p><p>Any proposal to amend the scheme is, in the first instance, a matter for the Pyrite Resolution Board and any such proposal would require detailed consideration of the evidence. The recommendations of the Pyrite Panel, which informed the establishment of the pyrite remediation scheme, were premised on a number of pertinent factors.  </p><p>As a minimum, in order to consider the appropriateness or otherwise of amending the scheme, I understand that the Board would require a report addressing the following information: - </p><p>- the extent and severity of damage to dwellings in the local authority area caused by pyritic heave in the subfloor hardcore; </p><p>- verification, if available, that the damage has been caused by pyrite; </p><p>- the background to the occurrence of the damage;</p><p>- details of any structural warranty policies for the dwellings;</p><p>- the history of the estate&rsquo;s construction, numbers, type of dwellings etc;</p><p>- the source of the hardcore supplied to dwellings in the estate; and </p><p>- any supporting geological assessments.</p><p>In addition to the above, the Board may also make such further enquiries as it considers necessary in order to assist it in considering the matter.  In this regard, it would be advisable for the residents to confirm the nature of the pyrite problems in the area and that any problems identified stem from reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material which is giving rise to pyritic heave and consequential significant pyritic damage.</p><p>I understand that the Pyrite Resolution Board received such a report in respect of pyrite in the hardcore in a number of dwellings in Limerick. The Board, in accordance with section 13 of the Act, subsequently submitted a proposal to include Limerick City and County Council area in the Pyrite Remediation Scheme to me, as Minister. Following consideration of the matter, I extended the pyrite remediation scheme to include the administrative area of Limerick City and County Council,  which will see homeowners of dwellings with significant damage attributable to pyritic heave in County Limerick eligible to apply for remediation works under the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.</p><p>As I understand it, no such report has been received by the Board in respect of pyrite in the hardcore in dwellings in County Clare.</p><p>I would encourage the relevant parties to fully engage with the Board as early as possible to facilitate this process. The Board may be contacted by phone at Lo call 1890 252842 or by email to: info@pyriteboard.ie , or alternatively at: oireachtasinfo@pyriteboard.ie.</p><p>I will consider any amendments or extensions which the Pyrite Resolution Board consider are required to the Scheme once submitted to me in accordance with the requirements of the Act. I fully intend on ensuring that ultimately all eligible homeowners of dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave can have their homes remediated under the scheme.</p></reply>

While allocation of individual homes is a matter for the Council, my Department has been working with all stakeholders to ensure the supply of social housing can be increased using a broad range of programmes under Build, Acquisition, Lease, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and the Rental Accommodation Scheme.</p><p>My Department has assisted in the delivery of over 1,850 social housing homes in Co. Kildare under Build, Acquisition and Leasing since 2016. At end June 2020, there were 2,320 households actively in receipt of HAP support in County Kildare, with additional tenancies being supported week on week</p><p>The pipeline for future delivery in Kildare is strong with approximately 1,450 homes due for delivery before the end of 2021, with more being added to that pipeline regularly.</p><p>A detailed Social Housing Construction Status Report is published each quarter which provides scheme level detail on new build activity under Rebuilding Ireland. The most recent publication covers the period up to the end of Q4 2019 and is available on the Rebuilding Ireland website at the following link:</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>The Q1/Q2 2020 Construction status report will be published soon. The construction status report gives a list of the individual projects that make up the new Build programme and is sorted by local authority.</p><p>The construction status report gives information on a range of Build programmes including Direct and Design-Build (Rapid Build Housing) projects. My Department is working closely with all local authorities in relation to increasing and accelerating the delivery of a range of social housing programmes and supports, including through the use of design-build rapid delivery methodologies. Local authorities have been advised that design-build rapid delivery approaches should increasingly become the norm in terms of delivering social housing projects on local authority-owned land.</p><p>Regarding affordable housing, &euro;310 million has already been allocated under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF) to fund infrastructure to support the delivery of more affordable homes on local authority lands.  With a maximum of &euro;50,000 funding available per home, at least 6,200 more affordable homes, to buy or rent, can be facilitated.  To date, Serviced Sites Funding of &euro;127 million has been approved in principle in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes. </p><p>Details of all SSF projects that have received approval in principle to date can be found at the following links:</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>, and</p><p><i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i>.</p><p>It is anticipated that a further SSF call to local authorities will be made later this year.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to putting affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing.</p><p>I will outline further plans in terms of affordable housing later in the Autumn, taking account of the progress made under the SSF, as well as the development of the Affordable Purchase scheme and Cost Rental scheme.</p></reply>

LIHAF is designed to specifically address the issue of housing supply, which is a crucial factor in terms of moderating house prices.</p><p>Thirty projects received final LIHAF approval, in late 2017 and early 2018, with an overall budget of &euro;195.7m, of which &euro;146.8m will be Exchequer funded, with the remainder funded via local authorities. Details of the approvals by local authority area, budget allocation, project description and projected housing delivery are available at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.rebuildingireland.ie/LIHAF</font></i>.</p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Finance established the Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) as a commercial entity in January 2019.  Its function is to assist in the delivery of new homes by providing funding for residential development projects throughout the country. For the period up to July 2020, &euro;340 million has been approved to support the delivery of 1,477 new homes, 66% of which will be private housing units. Full details are contained in the HBFI annual report published in July 2020, which includes the locations of all approved projects, and which is available at: <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i></p><p>In terms of the specific housing needs of each county, National Policy Objective 37 of the National Planning Framework refers to local authorities undertaking a &lsquo;Housing Needs and Demand Assessment&rsquo; (HNDA) for their area. The undertaking of such an assessment will inform the making of the local authority Housing Strategy which in turn feeds into the Development Plan for their county and will frame the requirement for housing development overall across tenure types. My Department is currently working on the development of a HNDA tool and framework which will assist local authorities to accurately and consistently project future housing demand in their own area.</p></reply>

One of the key objectives of the Voids Programme is to provide local authorities with funding to help minimise the turnaround and re-let time of vacant units.</p>  <p>  As announced in the July Stimulus Programme, additional funding of &euro;40m has been made available in relation to Voids for 2020 which will see an additional 2,500 vacant properties remediated and allocated this year. This funding has been provided in recognition of the very challenging financial circumstances which local authorities are experiencing and the very real risk that the vacant homes, which would normally be refurbished by local authorities using their own resources, would be significantly impacted in 2020.

The Government has committed to ambitious funding of Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plans for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis.  The Government plans to deliver the &euro;8.5 billion funding package committed to in Project Ireland 2040. </p><p>The Water Services Policy Statement 2018-2025 gives clear direction to strategic planning and decision making on water and wastewater services in Ireland.  The Policy Statement sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of Quality, Conservation, and Future Proofing, which must be pursued when planning capital investment and framing current spending plans. The Policy Statement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i><font color="#0563C1"></font></i>.</p><p>Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Services Strategic Plan (WSSP) published in 2015 sets out the strategic objectives for its delivery of water services over 25 years up to 2040 in order to ensure the provision of clean safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for social and economic development. The Irish Water Business Plan, Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021 (also published in 2015), sets out its short to medium term planning in implementing the first phase of the Water Services Strategic Plan.</p><p>Irish Water&rsquo;s Capital Investment Plan for the five year period from 2020 to 2024 will set out the financial plan for capital investments to support Irish Water&rsquo;s strategic objectives, as set out in the WSSP and in its Business Plan, to deliver improvements to water services where they are needed most. Irish Water will also take account of developing subsidiary programmes within its investment plan to assist in implementing the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan including the Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies as well as ongoing reviews of local authority statutory land use plans. It is in that context that investment decisions in relation to individual projects will be made.</p><p>For specific project and proposals, including in relation to County Kildare, it may be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email to oireachtasmembers@water.ie or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

The Acts allow me to make a preservation order where I consider a national monument to be at risk.  Responsibility for management and maintenance historical buildings and sites in State ownership, and management of related visitor facilities, rests with the Office of Public Works (OPW) which also maintains a significant ongoing programme of conservation works. This year, my Department has allocated &euro;350,000 to the OPW for the maintenance of historic buildings and sites. </p><p>My Department recently announced a call for projects under the Community Monuments Fund (CMF), for investment in our archaeological heritage, which is being funded under the July Jobs Stimulus Package. Part of this funding is prioritised for local authorities, private owners and custodians and community groups for the care, maintenance, protection and promotion of local monuments and historic sites and the provision of any required measures to ensure safe access during the Covid-19 pandemic. Total funding available nationally for projects in 2020 is &euro;900,000. The closing date for receipt of applications was 22 September 2020 and approved projects will be announced shortly.</p><p>While I have no functions, as Minister, in relation to education or tourism, the Heritage Council, which my Department funds, plays a role, including through the Heritage in Schools programme, the Adopt a Monument Scheme and National Heritage Week, all of which have been operating successfully for a number of years.

Of the 11 developments granted planning permission, 6 of these have lodged commencement notices to date.</p><p>The 2017 SHD Regulations provide for the publication of a weekly list of applications received and applications determined or otherwise disposed of by the Board in relation to SHD cases. These weekly lists are available to view on the Board's website at .</p><p>Arrangements have been put in place by all bodies under the aegis of my Department to facilitate the provision of information directly to members of the Oireachtas. This provides a speedy, efficient and cost effective system to address queries directly. The contact email address for An Bord Plean&aacute;la is oireachtasqueries@pleanala.ie.</p><p>In making a decision on an application, the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received from the public and the statutory consultees, and any relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Department. Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended), I am specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any case with which a planning authority or the Board is or may be involved.</p><p>A review of the SHD arrangements was carried out in 2019.  This review particularly highlighted that while they had generally been a success in providing a fast-track development consent process for developers of large-scale housing developments, the number of SHD permissions that have commenced development is less than might have been expected. </p><p>In this regard, with a view to influencing the earlier activation of housing related planning permissions, the new Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future commits to introducing a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; condition for all planning permissions of ten housing units or more.  I intend that the necessary legislation providing for the introduction of the proposed new &quot;use it or lose it&quot; housing-related planning arrangements will be progressed over the coming months.</p><p>National Policy Objective 37 of the National Planning Framework requires that each local authority should undertake a &quot;Housing Need and Demand Assessment&quot; (HNDA), in a co-ordinated fashion, to support the preparation of their statutory housing strategy and development plan.</p><p>Work to support the development of the HNDA process is ongoing in my Department. Research undertaken by the ESRI on population projections at county level is nearing completion while the  development of a HNDA digital tool is shortly to be piloted with a number of local authorities. This new evidence-based approach will form the basis of a more accurate and consistent projection of demand for different tenures of housing within the administrative area of each local authority. As this work evovles, it will be integrated into the review processes for statutory development plans that are underway or scheduled to be commenced over the coming years.</p></reply>

Ireland, as an EU Member State and, also, working through the United Nations and other multilateral agencies is able to match financial investment in development and humanitarian response with effective advocacy.  The Government, through Irish Aid - Ireland's official development assistance programme, managed in my Department - also support the work of Irish NGOs and missionaries in their development work around the world.  Through programmes managed by Irish Embassies in Africa, in Vietnam and elsewhere, Ireland is investing in the development of some of the world's poorest countries, complemented in recent years by a new focus on Small Island Developing States with an emphasis on climate resilience. Through these mechanisms and relationships, Ireland provides quality, vital assistance to people living in challenging and insecure environments, helping to improve their lives  These engagements give Ireland a significant global presence and footprint, including in fragile states and conflict-affected contexts. </p>  <p>  Successive OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) peer reviews have commended Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation for its poverty focus and commitment to Least Developed Countries. The OECD DAC&rsquo;s most recent review, published in May 2020, notes that Ireland 'walks the talk' in allocating ODA to least developed countries and fragile states, priority partners and sectors.  The OECD finds that this clear focus enables Ireland to exercise leadership and make a visible difference. The Overseas Development Institute, a leading development think-tank, has also ranked Ireland as the most effective international donor in directing resources to those in extreme poverty. </p>  <p>  In 2019 Ireland contributed over &euro;180 million in humanitarian aid, delivering life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable communities across the globe, in partnership with trusted NGOs, UN agencies and the Red Cross Family.  Ireland recognises that reducing humanitarian need requires an approach that anticipates the onset of crises, acts fast, and delivers assistance in a way that lays the groundwork for recovery. To this end Irish Aid funding is predictable and timely and our engagement long term. In fragile and protracted contexts such as Somalia, DRC and Yemen, Ireland supports vulnerable populations to become more resilient to shocks and stresses, including climate change and violent conflict. This reduces the need for repeated humanitarian interventions and protects hard won development gains. As the single greatest driver of humanitarian need is conflict, Ireland is committed to conflict prevention and peacebuilding, through the funding of activities as well as political and diplomatic engagement.</p></reply>

In making this commitment, the Government recognised that reaching 0.7% will require a significant expansion in ODA volumes over the next decade and that, at times, difficult choices would be required between competing priorities.</p>  <p>  Progress is being made toward 0.7%. From 2014 to 2020 Ireland's allocations to ODA grew from &euro;614 million to almost &euro;838 million, an increase of almost &euro;21 million on the 2019 budget allocation and the sixth consecutive year allocations to ODA were increased. On Budget day October 2019, it was predicted that the GNI/ODA percentage would be in the region of 0.31%. </p>  <p>  Further sustained, managed increments will be required to deliver on the 0.7% commitment by 2030, taking into consideration the range of demands across Government and the capacity of the public finances to meet them. It is critical that the Government grows our ODA programme in a steady, measured and graduated manner, ensuring that we protect and nurture the good reputation and quality of our work. </p></reply>

Although Bahrain has repeatedly stated its commitment to improving its human rights record and safeguarding human rights as enshrined in the Bahraini Constitution, we are concerned by ongoing instances of violations of fundamental freedoms, including violations of freedom of opinion and expression, as well as the targeting of human rights defenders. </p>  <p>  Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels. Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important in that regard. Ireland has raised the case of human rights in Bahrain at that forum, in the form of national statements and its support to EU Statements. </p>  <p>  Ireland also engages on the issue of human rights in Bahrain through the EU. At the most recent informal EU-Bahrain Human Rights dialogue in November 2019, issues discussed included the right to a fair trial, prison conditions, and the overall human rights situation in the country. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, has also made representations to the Bahraini authorities on human rights issues, including the detention of human rights defenders as well as the conditions of their detention.</p>  <p>  Our principled stance on human rights also feeds into our bilateral dialogue and we raise our human rights concerns directly with the Bahraini authorities at every suitable opportunity. When I met the Bahraini Foreign Minister at the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2019, I raised the human rights situation in Bahrain with him, expressing the hope that we can have an open and honest discussion on these issues. My officials regularly meet with the Bahraini authorities to discuss the full range of bilateral and multilateral issues, including human rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Bahrain, and to call on the Bahraini Government to deliver on its stated commitment to make progress in relation to human rights.  </p></reply>

The very sudden displacement of thousands of people has caused great suffering to those in the camp, as well as posing a huge logistical challenge for the Greek authorities in the midst of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, spoke with his Greek counterpart immediately after the fire to offer Ireland's full solidarity and support. The Greek authorities requested assistance from EU Partners in dealing with the immediate humanitarian needs arising from the fire. My Department, through our Embassy in Athens, is in contact with the Greek Ministry of Migration Policy and has confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s readiness to provide assistance from emergency stocks which we have in place at the UN Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy.  The Greek authorities have thanked us for this offer of assistance, and we stand ready to work with them regarding the deployment of the emergency supplies.</p>  <p>  In terms of the situation within the camp, Greek authorities have started to transfer refugees and migrants to the Greek mainland in order to reduce overcrowding. In addition, the European Commission has now established a dedicated Taskforce to resolve the emergency situation on Lesbos effectively and humanely. The Taskforce will work closely with the Greek authorities to build new reception facilities in the coming months, which will be of a European standard and will provide access to healthcare and adequate sanitation.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have repeatedly urged the need for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among Member States in dealing with the wider issue of migration. The migration crisis continues to be one of the major challenges confronting the European Union and it needs to be urgently addressed. We must find more sustainable solutions involving consensus among Member States based on solidarity and responsibility. I am committed to continuing to work with our EU partners to resolve these issues and to ensure that humanitarian and legal obligations continue to be met.</p>  <p>  On 23 September 2020, the Commission published a major new proposal on reforming the EU migration and asylum system - a &ldquo;New Pact on Migration and Asylum&rdquo;. I welcome this initiative by the Commission. The publication of the Migration Pact proposals represents an opportunity to renew and intensify efforts to agree a common approach and put in place more effective and humane arrangements to manage the considerable migratory pressures that Europe continues to face.</p>  <p>  We in Ireland are endeavouring to do our part, having already received 1022 asylum seekers (including six unaccompanied minors) from Greece under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. </p>  <p>  In the context of the very difficult situation now arising from the destruction of the Moria refugee camp, the Government has decided that Ireland will welcome refugee families from Greece under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP). Up to 50 people in family groups will be resettled following displacement due to the fire.  This is in addition to the four unaccompanied minors, to be taken as part of our pre-existing commitment to take 36 unaccompanied minors from Greece.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality are liaising with the European Commission on the detail of this commitment, and along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will travel to Greece in the coming weeks to make the arrangements.</p></reply>

I attended the General Affairs Council in Brussels on 22 September where I also had a range of meetings on Brexit-related issues.

Leaders agreed to make a fund of up to &euro;5 billion available to counter the adverse consequences of Brexit in the worst affected Member States and sectors.  On 21 September, I met Commissioner Hahn in Brussels on the Reserve.

The publication of the Migration Pact proposals represents an opportunity to renew and intensify efforts to agree a common approach and put in place more effective and humane arrangements to manage the considerable migratory pressures that Europe continues to face.</p>  <p>  We in Ireland are endeavouring to do our part, having already received 1022 asylum seekers (including six unaccompanied minors) from Greece under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. </p>  <p>  In the context of the very difficult situation now arising from the destruction of the Moria refugee camp, the Government has decided that Ireland will welcome refugee families from Greece under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP). Up to 50 people in family groups will be resettled following displacement due to the fire.  This is in addition to the four unaccompanied minors, to be taken as part of our overall commitment to take 36 unaccompanied minors from Greece.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality are liaising with the European Commission on the detail of this commitment, and along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will travel to Greece in the coming weeks to make the arrangements.</p></reply>

There is also a clear need for the Stormont House Agreement to be implemented as a comprehensive framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as well as a need for progress on the all-party motions of the D&aacute;il on the Dublin Monaghan bombings and related cases. </p>  <p>  The implementation of the Stormont House Agreement forms part of the Programme for Government.  The Government also continues to actively pursue the implementation of the all-Party D&aacute;il motions which call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow. </p>  <p>  The Government welcomed the announcement by the PSNI on 30 November 2019 that former Chief Constable Jon Boutcher will head an Independent Police Team to conduct an analytical report on collusion in what has become known as the Glenanne Gang series of cases. We are conscious that this work by Chief Constable Boutcher is very relevant to a number of cases of the utmost concern for victims&rsquo; families and survivors, both North and South, who suffered in the murderous attacks by the so-called &lsquo;Glenanne Gang&rsquo;. It is to be hoped that the report being conducted by Chief Constable Boutcher will contribute to the process of justice, truth and acknowledgement of what happened in these awful cases, where collusion is a feature. </p>  <p>  The Government will be supportive of facilitating this investigation, subject to the requirements of the law, as we have other investigative processes in Northern Ireland, in relation to the attacks conducted by the Glenanne Gang and of course other cases from the Troubles. </p>  <p>  In any scenario, we will continue to engage with the British Government, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on these issues, consistent with the all-party D&aacute;il motions, until a satisfactory resolution is found. </p>  <p>  In relation to the request for a meeting to discuss these cases, I have asked my officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs who lead on legacy issues to meet with representatives of the victims and survivors as soon as possible, and as current circumstances and restrictions allow, for a full discussion of their concerns.</p></reply>

This means any business that moves goods from, to or through Great Britain will be subject to a range of new customs formalities,  checks and other regulatory requirements, that do not apply in any form today to such trade.  </p>  <p>   However, it is important to note that due to the provisions in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland no new checks or controls will apply to goods moving between Ireland and Northern Ireland in either direction.</p>  <p>  From 1 January 2021 UK customs preparations are a matter for the UK Government. On 13 July 2020, the UK Government published its Border Operating Model, outlining plans for the introduction of border controls on exports to Great Britain from the EU.  These plans indicate that UK controls will be implemented in three phases, from 1 January 2021 and with full controls implemented by July 2021. I understand an update of the Border Operations Model will issue shortly.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to monitor the progress of the UK's customs preparations for the end of the transition period. Our Embassy in London maintains ongoing contact at various levels with officials from the UK Government on customs matters, including in relation to goods moving in transit via the UK landbridge. This includes ongoing engagement with officials from the Border Protocol and Delivery Group at the Cabinet Office, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).  In addition, Embassy officials have visited a number of points of entry and exit to the UK to review UK preparations on the ground.</p>  <p>  It is important that businesses trading with Great Britain, or using the landbridge across Great Britain, make themselves aware of their responsibilities in relation to UK customs and regulatory checks and controls.</p></reply>

This is based on official public health advice and is in place to protect people's well-being, which is our first priority. In the case of election observation missions in particular, the risks posed by overseas travel at this time are compounded by factors such as extensive in-country travel and interactions with observers from a significant number of other countries, potentially exposing not only election monitors but those with whom they come into contact in the host country to COVID-19. </p>  <p>  In light of this, in our role as facilitators of the volunteer roster participation in the EU and ODHIR election observation missions, we have taken the decision not to nominate volunteers for election observation missions at this time. My officials are keeping the situation under ongoing review in accordance with Government policy 'Living with Covid', as well as keeping abreast of developments with EU and OSCE focal points for election observation missions. As mission requests arise, we will evaluate (taking into account our overall health and travel advice as well as Covid-19 measures implemented by mission organisers as well as host countries) whether participation would be safe for Irish observers, as well as for the host country and other participants, and will decide on nominating volunteers accordingly.</p>  <p>  We look forward to Ireland&rsquo;s return to full participation in election observation missions, under conditions that balance this invaluable contribution to safeguarding democracy with the exigencies of the pandemic. Ireland remains as committed as ever to upholding democratic values, the rule of law, and human rights, and will continue to promote these through all other diplomatic means available.</p></reply>

While some progress was made, there is still some distance to go on key issues including fisheries, a level playing field for open and fair competition and governance. Unlocking these issues is key to moving towards a more intensified phase of the talks. President von der Leyen spoke to PM Johnson on 3 October to take stock of the negotiations. Contacts between the EU and UK will continue in the period ahead with a view to making further progress.</p>  <p>  Given the limited progress we have seen in the EU-UK negotiations to date, the Government decided on 29 May that we should plan our readiness work on the basis of two scenarios: (i) a limited trade deal (including fisheries), or, (ii) a hard Brexit with the UK and the EU trading on WTO terms from 1 January 2021.  </p>  <p>  While Ireland continues to support the closest possible future relationship between the EU and the UK, prudence dictates that we now plan on this basis. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness Action Plan was published on 9 September which sets out in detail preparations and mitigation measures across a wide range of sectors.  A key focus of the Action Plan is to assist business in preparing for the significant changes that will arise on 1 January 2021.  </p>  <p>  The July Jobs Stimulus includes a &euro;20 million &ldquo;Ready for Customs&rdquo; package which allows business to claim grants of up to &euro;9,000 per employee hired or redeployed to a dedicated customs role. Further support for new customs requirements is available from Clear Customs Online 2020 - Skillnet&rsquo;s free customs training programme, which was also launched on 9 September.  Both these customs-focussed programmes were put in place in response to a need highlighted by the business sector.</p>  <p>  The Brexit Readiness Action Plan sets out the range of measures business will need to take to prepare for the new trading arrangements with Great Britain from 1 January 2021, regardless of the outcome of the future relationship negotiations. Subsequently, the Revenue Commissioners have written to over 90,000 businesses that have traded with the UK since 2019, enclosing a Brexit Readiness Checklist. These letters provide a checklist of issues that need to be addressed including customs procedures, supply chains, import duties, cashflow, logistics, accreditations and certifications and, where relevant, information from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on exporting animals, plants and products of animal and plant origin.  Since then, Revenue has contacted 2,500 businesses by phone and will continue its direct phone contact with up to 14,000 businesses over the coming weeks.  Agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and the Local Enterprise Offices continue to provide upskilling and advisory supports, while Departments and agencies are organising a range of briefings on an ongoing basis for specific sectors, including agriculture and food, construction, retail, transport and logistics.</p>  <p>   Regardless of the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, the end of the transition period will mean substantial and lasting change.  The UK will be outside the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and Customs Union from 1 January 2021.  This means that any business that moves goods to, from or through Great Britain will be subject to a range of customs formalities, SPS checks and other regulatory requirements that do not apply today. </p>  <p>  I would encourages business and citizens to to take steps now to prepare for the end of the transition period.</p></reply>

The European Council stated that there can be no military solution to the conflict, nor any external interference and called on Azerbaijan and Armenia to engage in substantive negotiations without preconditions. Leaders expressed its support for the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs and asked the EU High Representative to examine further EU support for the settlement process.</p>  <p>  The UN Security Council members expressed support for Secretary-General Guterres&rsquo;s call for an immediate halt to the fighting, and for the central role of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs. Ireland will continue to support these efforts, including when we join the United Nations Security Council in January of next year.</p>  <p>  Ireland joins those calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a return to the negotiating table, and we welcome and support the statements of the European Council and the OSCE Minsk Co-Chairs calling for this. I am deeply concerned by the recent clashes in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, in particular along the line of contact, which have regrettably led to the loss of life and severe injury, including civilian casualties. </p>  <p>  Ireland urges both sides to de-escalate tensions by refraining from inflammatory rhetoric and strictly observing the ceasefire. Only through negotiation, can there be a sustainable resolution and eventual reconciliation. The road to a peaceful resolution can be long and complex, as Ireland knows well, but progress grows from dialogue. Ireland fully supports the Minsk Process and we thank both the High Representative and the Co-Chairs Group for their efforts to de-escalate tensions over recent months. </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor this evolving situation closely.</p></reply>

Peer Reviews by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) have consistently found Ireland's development cooperation to be of the highest quality, commending our poverty focus and commitment to Least Developed Countries. </p>  <p>  Ireland works with a variety of partners in order to reach those in greatest need, using a combination of bilateral and multilateral aid channels. The partners we work with are considered and measured on the extent to which they can deliver against this overarching objective and the policy priority areas as set out in A Better World. </p>  <p>  Both bilateral and multilateral aid play an important and complementary role in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s ODA is directed to where it is needed most and has the maximum impact on the lives of those furthest behind.  </p>  <p>  Ireland's multilateral partnerships, including our work through the EU and United Nations, give Ireland a significant global presence and footprint, including in fragile states and conflict-affected contexts. This enables Ireland to direct vital assistance to people living in challenging, insecure and difficult to access environments. </p>  <p>  Our bilateral partnerships, which includes partnerships with Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), focus on our thematic and geographic priorities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

Our Official Development Assistance (ODA) is delivered with, and through, a wide range of bilateral and multilateral partners. </p><p>The OECD Development Assistance Committee's recent peer review (May 2020) found that Ireland 'walks the talk' in allocating ODA to least developed countries and fragile states, priority partners and sectors. Ireland is noted as a constructive and reliable partner to multilateral organisations, with funding that is of high quality. In terms of our bilateral partnerships, Ireland is one of the leading DAC donors in providing support to and through Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), with the OECD peer review finding that these relationships are characterised by mutual trust, quality funding, and an open culture for substantive and regular dialogue.  </p><p>In Our Shared Future, the Programme for Government, the Government committed to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the UN target of spending 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2030. In making this commitment, the Government recognised that reaching 0.7% will require a significant expansion in ODA volumes over the next decade and that, at times, difficult choices would be required between competing priorities. Reaching 0.7% would mean sustained, substantial increases during and beyond the lifetime of the current D&aacute;il. </p><p>Progress is being made toward the 0.7%. target. From 2014 to 2020 Ireland's allocations to ODA grew from &euro;614 million to almost &euro;838 million, the sixth consecutive year allocations to ODA were increased. On Budget day October 2019, it was predicted that the GNI/ODA percentage this year would be in the region of 0.31%. </p><p>Further sustained, managed increments will be required to deliver on the 0.7% commitment by 2030, taking into consideration the range of demands across Government and the capacity of the public finances to meet them.  Growing the ODA programme in a steady, measured and graduated manner will ensure that we protect and nurture the good reputation and quality of Irish Aid's work into the future.</p></reply>

The enhanced methodology also recognises the need for more decisive measures proportionally sanctioning any serious or prolonged stagnation or even backsliding in reform implementation. </p>  <p>  In terms of the progress of individual Western Balkan countries, Serbia and Montenegro are both currently negotiating Chapters of the Acquis with the EU. Serbia has opened negotiations on 18 Chapters, with two provisionally closed. Montenegro has opened all Chapters and provisionally closed three. The European Commission is expected to publish its Annual Enlargement Package and country reports on 6th October 2020. The country reports for 2019 assessed both Serbia and Montenegro as having both made progress, but there remain areas for improvement. Serbia needs to make significant progress in alignment with the EU&rsquo;s Common Foreign and Security Policy and the normalisation of relations with Kosovo, while Montenegro must address shortcomings in the areas of media freedom, fight against corruption and trafficking, and turn its attention to the closing of Chapters.</p>  <p>  Kosovo is a potential candidate for Membership of the EU. The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo in 2019 noted that the political situation in Kosovo remains challenging. Rule of law, judicial reform, public administration reform, organised crime and normalisation of the relationship with Serbia are just some of the areas that must be comprehensively addressed in order for Kosovo to advance on its European path. It will be some time before Kosovo can qualify as a candidate country.</p>  <p>  Regarding North Macedonia and Albania. It was agreed by the European Council in March 2020 to open negotiations with both countries. The draft negotiating frameworks are currently being discussed by Member States. Once these are agreed, we can proceed to the first Intergovernmental Conference. Ireland warmly welcomes the opening of accession negotiations with both countries and looks forward to the first Intergovernmental Conferences taking place at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  In relation to Bosnia-Herzegovina, we await the annual report due to be published on 6th October. In 2019, the Commission set out 14 recommendations in the areas of democracy, rule of law, fundamental rights, and public administration reform that need to be implemented before the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina can be considered. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support all of the six Western Balkans countries on their path towards Europe.</p></reply>

Ireland supports the EU, UN and other international efforts to reduce the influence of Boko Haram and Al Shabaab in the region and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians. </p><p>The UN is active in working to undermine the influence and impact of Al Shabaab and Boko Haram. The UN continues to monitor the situation in areas affected by Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin, through its Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), as well as at its Peacebuilding Commission, in which Ireland actively participates. The UN-mandated African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia (AMISOM) supports the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts to combat Al Shabaab. </p><p>The EU is one of the main financial contributors to AMISOM and it has also pledged &euro;50 million in funding to the Multinational Joint Taskforce to improve security in West African territories affected by Boko Haram. More broadly, the EU supports the strengthening of government institutions and provides significant development funding in Somalia, and in the countries affected by Boko Haram's terrorist activities, notably through its Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. Ireland is a long-term donor to the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa and has committed over &euro;15 million to the Fund.</p><p>The Council Conclusions of June 2020 reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s commitment to tackling terrorism across Africa, particularly in the Sahel and Horn of Africa.  The EU has three Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to EUCAP Somalia, including the current Head of Mission. In the Sahel,<i></i>13 Defence Forces personnel participate in EUTM Mali, and Ireland also deploys one expert to the Civilian CSDP mission in Niger. <i></i>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows us to contribute to international peace and security, protect human rights, and support conditions for sustainable development in the region.</p><p>Ireland also works bilaterally to promote peace and security in areas affected by armed groups. Ireland places a strong emphasis on tackling the poverty, hunger and exclusion which can contribute to radicalisation. We are members of the International Support Group of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin (ISG), and observer members of the Sahel Alliance. Both groups offer international partners a forum to coordinate support in addressing the challenges in Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin. </p><p>In addition, Ireland works with partners to respond to humanitarian need in regions affected by conflict. Ireland has provided &euro;27 million in humanitarian funding to the Lake Chad region since 2015. Ireland has also been a consistent supporter of the humanitarian response in Somalia, providing over &euro;50 million in humanitarian assistance since 2012, including to communities displaced by conflict in Al Shabaab-held areas. With humanitarian needs in these regions likely to remain acute, Irish funding will continue to target those most in need.</p><p>The Embassies of Ireland in Nairobi, Addis Ababa and Abuja will continue to actively monitor the situation on the ground, advise on humanitarian response and guide Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in EU and UN fora, particularly as we take up our Security Council seat in 2021.</p></reply>

These aim to persuade governments and organisations around the world to fully respect international humanitarian law and human rights law that protects children from armed conflict. The Guidelines commit the EU to address the impact of armed conflict on children and fight against impunity for those who are involved in the recruitment of child soldiers.</p>  <p>  In 1999, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1261 on the impact of armed conflict on children. Since then, the Security Council has established tools to strengthen child protection and to support international standards, including a systematic and comprehensive monitoring and reporting mechanism. </p>  <p>  In December 1996, the UN General Assembly created the mandate of the UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict to advocate for the protection and well-being of children affected by armed conflict and develop best practices to address the recruitment and use of child soldiers.

I have made four working visits to Israel and Palestine, most recently in December 2019.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government states that the Government will &ldquo;Maintain and build our relationships with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority and remain active on the Middle East Peace Process. Ireland&rsquo;s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will remain an integral aspect of our foreign policy and we will continue to build consensus at EU level to take a more proactive approach in supporting a negotiated two-state solution and lasting peace process&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Ireland has long worked to keep attention on Gaza. In my last visit to Gaza in December 2019, I saw for myself the impact of the blockade. Ireland contributes humanitarian assistance to alleviate the worst of this suffering, including through our support for UNRWA, which is a key provider of public services, health and education in Gaza. I have initiated an Irish-funded solar power project in Gaza, which will help improve water quality in the area. More recently, my Department allocated additional funding to support the medical response to COVID 19 in the Gaza Strip.</p>  <p>  I welcome the agreement announced on 31 August to de-escalate the situation in and around Gaza. This should now be fully respected by all parties, including the reopening of the Kerem Shalom border crossing, allowing fuel deliveries to Gaza&rsquo;s electricity plant, and the restoration of Gaza&rsquo;s fishing zone.</p>  <p>  The roots of the problem in Gaza are political and cannot be solved by funding alone. I have consistently called for the lifting of the blockade, so that normal life and normal economic activity can resume, and I will continue to make every effort to ensure that the situation in Gaza remains high on the international agenda.</p></reply>

Their dedication has been unwavering on what has been a long and difficult road, and our thoughts are with all of the families of those who were killed or injured on that day. Officials in my Department are remaining in contact with the families at this time.</p>  <p>  The NI Public Prosecution Service has confirmed that, while Soldier F is among the 15 individuals to which these new decisions relate, the prosecution that commenced against him in 2019 continues. It is important that nothing is said or done that could be seen to prejudice ongoing due legal process.</p>  <p>  All victims&rsquo; families must have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice in accordance with the law and regardless of the perpetrator. </p>  <p>  The Stormont House Agreement sets out a framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, agreed by all parties and by both the Irish and British Governments.  It must be implemented, and that commitment to implementation forms part of the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  In March, the British Government proposed significant changes to the Stormont House Agreement framework. I have engaged  with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and others to set out the  Government&rsquo;s position and serious concerns in relation to those changes. Only through a collective approach can we hope to deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly, and in a way that responds to the needs of victims and survivors, and society as a whole.</p></reply>

[Today, Ireland is supporting a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee which reiterates our grave concern regarding the situation in Xinjiang, and recalls the exceptional letter of concern issued by 50 UN Special Procedures mandate holders which called on China to respect human rights and to allow immediate, meaningful and unfettered access to Xinjiang for independent observers.] In our national statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 25 September, Ireland also urged China to allow unrestricted access to the region for the High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>  <p>  At EU level, the deterioration of the human rights situation, including the treatment of minorities in Xinjiang, was raised by EU leaders with China on 14 September, and it was agreed to discuss these issues further at an EU-China Human Rights Dialogue later this year. The matter was also raised during the EU-China Summit on the 22 June. </p>  <p>  Prior to this, Ireland was also one of 28 States to sign up to a Joint Statement at the UN Human Rights Council on 30 June 2020, which also called on the High Commissioner to provide regular information about the situation in the region, in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed under international law.</p>  <p>  Ireland has previously supported a Joint Statement at the UN Third Committee in October 2019, and a Joint Letter at the UN Human Rights Council in July 2019, which called for the Chinese Government to urgently implement eight recommendations made by the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination related to Xinjiang, and to uphold its international obligations and respect human rights in Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The protection and promotion of human rights is a core pillar of Ireland's foreign policy, and Ireland will continue to monitor and assess the situation and, along with our EU partners, engage with Chinese authorities bilaterally and in multilateral fora as appropriate.</p></reply>

When the transition period ends on 31 December 2020, operators will still be able to move goods via the landbridge but the way they use the landbridge will change.  Each movement will involve new procedures and require a financial guarantee to be in place.</p><p>The UK&rsquo;s accession to the Common Transit Convention (CTC) is welcome. The CTC allows EU goods to transit through the UK without undergoing full customs import and export formalities on entry and exit from the UK. We continue to work positively with our EU partners on addressing challenges in EU ports for traffic in transit via the landbridge.  However, the Government has pointed out for some time now including in our 2019 and 2020 readiness plans that there will likely be delays at ports immediately after the end of the transition period, with Dover-Calais identified as a particular likely bottleneck. This is outside of our control.</p><p>  By contrast, goods moving directly between Ireland and elsewhere in the EU will not be subject to any new procedures.  The Government has been engaging extensively with the shipping sector to assess the capacity available on direct routes to continental ports and I am working closely with my colleague Eamonn Ryan, the Minister for Transport. There is ongoing extensive engagement with the shipping sector who have indicated that sufficient capacity shipping is available on direct routes to continental ports.  This is also the view of the Department of Transport and the assessment of the Irish Maritime Development Office who carried out a study of the UK landbridge in 2018, and who are currently updating that assessment based on developments since then.</p><p>A number of new direct services have already been launched in the last year, including; Cork &ndash; Zeebrugge, Dublin &ndash; Santander, Waterford &ndash; Rotterdam, Rosslare &ndash; Bilbao and Rosslare &ndash; Roscoff.  Extra sailings are also planned in 2021, including Rosslare &ndash; Cherbourg, Cork &ndash; Roscoff.</p><p>  Ferry operators have indicated they are capable of responding to any further increase in demand.  I encourage engagement between traders, hauliers and ferry companies to align capacity with needs.  I would also  encourage traders, where it is feasible to do so, to avoid the risk of disruption by moving to direct services now and not wait until after 1 January 2021.</p></reply>

The very sudden displacement of thousands of people has caused great suffering to those in the camp, as well as posing a huge logistical challenge for the Greek authorities in the midst of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, spoke with his Greek counterpart immediately after the fire to offer Ireland's full solidarity and support. The Greek authorities requested assistance from EU Partners in dealing with the immediate humanitarian needs arising from the fire. My Department, through our Embassy in Athens, is in contact with the Greek Ministry of Migration Policy and has confirmed Ireland&rsquo;s readiness to provide assistance from emergency stocks which we have in place at the UN Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy.  The Greek authorities have thanked us for this offer of assistance, and we stand ready to work with them regarding the deployment of the emergency supplies.</p>  <p>  In terms of the situation within the camp, Greek authorities have started to transfer refugees and migrants to the Greek mainland in order to reduce overcrowding. In addition, the European Commission has now established a dedicated Taskforce with the aim of resolving the emergency situation on Lesbos effectively and humanely. The Taskforce will work closely with the Greek authorities to build new reception facilities in the coming months, which will be of a European standard and will provide access to healthcare and adequate sanitation.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have repeatedly urged the need for greater solidarity and burden-sharing among Member States in dealing with the wider issue of migration. The migration crisis continues to be one of the major challenges confronting the European Union and it needs to be urgently addressed. We must find more sustainable solutions involving consensus among Member States based on solidarity and responsibility. I am committed to continuing to work with our EU partners to resolve these issues and to ensure that humanitarian and legal obligations continue to be met.</p>  <p>  On 23 September 2020, the Commission published a major new proposal on reforming the EU migration and asylum system - a &ldquo;New Pact on Migration and Asylum&rdquo;. I welcome this initiative by the Commission. The publication of the Migration Pact proposals represents an opportunity to renew and intensify efforts to agree a common approach and put in place more effective and humane arrangements to manage the considerable migratory pressures that Europe continues to face.</p>  <p>  We in Ireland are endeavouring to do our part, having already received 1022 asylum seekers (including six unaccompanied minors) from Greece under the first phase of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. </p>  <p>  In the context of the very difficult situation now arising from the destruction of the Moria refugee camp, the Government has decided that Ireland will welcome refugee families from Greece under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP). Up to 50 people in family groups will be resettled following displacement due to the fire.  This is in addition to the four unaccompanied minors, to be taken as part of our overall commitment to take 36 unaccompanied minors from Greece.</p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Justice and Equality are liaising with the European Commission on the detail of this commitment, and along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will travel to Greece in the coming weeks to make the arrangements.</p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was addressed in 1962 and 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented. The board did not award any medals whose citations mention Jadotville. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: </p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006.</p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. </p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Custume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. </p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company was issued. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.</p>  <p>  I would like to thank the Deputy for the correspondence  submitted with this Parliamentary Question. This correspondence quite rightly outlines the courage and bravery of "A" Company. Over the past number of years similar representations have been received and all have been considered and responded to acknowledging the valiant actions of "A" Company while under siege in Jadotville.   </p>  <p>  With regard to enquiries about any additional medals, it has been previously indicated that any additional documentation, information or evidence to support the request to award such medals will be considered.  At this juncture, no new information has come to light.</p></reply>

The Report was accepted in full by the Government at that time and, to facilitate implementation, an extensive High Level Plan titled ""Strengthening our Defence Forces &ndash; Phase One&rdquo; was also agreed and published on the same date. </p>  <p>  The High Level Plan provides for actions or projects to be undertaken to deliver on the PSPC recommendations. It also proposes a timeframe for actions or projects to commence and identifies the lead actor to implement the action or project. The timeframe for commencement of actions is split into four distinct timelines i.e. immediate, short-term, medium-term and long-term. The Plan defines the timeframes as follows:</p>  <p>  - Immediate (i.e. action to commence and be completed within 1 month of approval of this Plan);</p>  <p>  - Short-term (i.e. action to commence (and in some cases be completed) within 3 months of approval of this Plan);</p>  <p>  - Medium-term (i.e. action to commence (and in some cases to completed within 3 &ndash;6 months of approval of this Plan); and</p>  <p>  - Long-term (i.e. action to commence within 6 &ndash;12 months of approval of this Plan).</p>  <p>  The review of pay structures was set out as a medium term project being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in anticipation that such a review would take place in the context of discussions on a new Public Sector Pay Agreement and that these would commence in that time-frame. However, these discussions did not take place within that anticipated timeframe.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government, which was published in June 2020,, contains a commitment to establish an independent Commission on the Defence Forces which will consider, amongst other matters, pay and allowances and composition of the Defence Forces. The Programme for Government also states that upon completion of the Commissions work, a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces will be established.</p></reply>

To this end, it is vital the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised in any way.</p>  <p>  The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was an issue of serious concern during the 1990's and was the subject of severe criticism in a series of external reports. One of the key areas identified for urgent action was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. </p>  <p>  As a result, new terms and conditions were introduced for personnel enlisting after 1 January 1994 and new contracts for enlisted personnel were for a period of five years&rsquo; service. Since that time, the maximum period of service has been extended out to twenty-one years for line Privates and Corporals. </p>  <p>  In 2015, following an adjudication in the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for PDF members, it was agreed that all Privates and Corporals in receipt of Tech Pay Group 3 or higher could be extended to age 50 subject to meeting certain criteria for continuance in service. A review of contracts of service for Line Corporals and Privates and Corporals in receipt of Technical Pay 1 and 2 was also recommended. </p>  <p>  An agreement was subsequently reached with PDFORRA in 2019 that all Privates and Corporals recruited post 1994, be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022 (or until they reach the age of 50), provided these personnel met certain criteria during the interim period, including medical grades and fitness tests. This agreement was subsequently extended to include post 1994 Sergeants, who also could continue in service to the same date, subject to their meeting agreed criteria in the interim period. </p>  <p>  A review of service limits for enlisted personnel is currently being progressed in the context of a broader review provided for in the High Level Implementation Plan - "Strengthening Our Defence Forces". As this review which will encompass upper age limits for Privates, Corporals and Sergeants as well as senior NCOs is currently underway, it would be inappropriate to pre-empt any recommendations that may arise.</p></reply>

In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over &euro;219m in 2019. </p><p>Based on the public health advice published in early July, and the updated advice received from the HPSC on 7<sup>th</sup>August and from NPHET on the 18<sup>th</sup>August, the Department has been planning for School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year to fully operate, but with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place and with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50 per cent of passenger capacity.  The planning to date is in accordance with the Government decision of 18th August, which set out that arrangements for school transport would proceed as planned for re-opening but the Minster for Education and Skills and the Minister for Health and other relevant Ministers will review measures, including any additional resources, to ensure the safe operation of school transport for secondary school children.</p><p>School Transport Scheme services commenced operation on the 26<sup>th</sup>August 2020. All children who are eligible for school transport and who completed the application and payment process on time have been accommodated on transport services for the 2020/2021 school year where such services are in operation.</p><p>My Department has issued detailed information and guidance to parents and children on the operation of school transport services for the 2020/2021 school year.  All children using school transport scheme services are asked to comply with a number of guidelines including that all children on post-primary transport services are required to wear facemasks while waiting for and on-board transport services (with the exception of children who for medical or special educational needs reasons are not in a position to wear a facemask or face covering).</p><p>The Department has been engaging intensively with Bus &Eacute;ireann in regard to the logistics for the safe operation of School Transport Scheme services for the 2020/2021 school year. The Department has also been engaging with Bus &Eacute;ireann on the logistics involved with the rolling implementation of measures on post-primary services as required to provide physical distancing, in line with those required on public transport, which is using 50 per cent of passenger capacity.  An assessment of the resources required to implement physical distancing on all post-primary services has been undertaken and, in line with the Government decision of 18<sup>th</sup>August, the Department has reviewed this information in consultation with other relevant Departments.</p><p>I am pleased to announce that, following a Government Decision on the 29th of September, Government has agreed to provide the necessary funding to ensure full implementation of the measures required for the operation of school transport for post-primary children that is aligned to updated health advice received from NPHET on the 18<sup>th</sup>of August, for which the estimated full year cost to operate all services at 50% capacity is between &euro;87m and &euro;135m with an estimated requirement for an additional 1,600 drivers and vehicles and 650 additional School Bus Escorts.</p><p>If there are individual concerns about a particular service, parents/guardians are advised to contact School Transport Section of my Department or their local Bus &Eacute;ireann office.</p></reply>

Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available for children with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p><p>The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and special school places nationally, including Wicklow, to meet identified need for this school-year and beyond. This process is ongoing.</p><p>It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p><p>The NCSE's local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs.

The process of national standardisation was then applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard.</p><p>The integrity, validity and reliability of the process of national standardisation was overseen by the National Standardisation Group whose role was to oversee the application of the statistical model to the school data.  </p><p>In order to make sure that the standardisation process was doing what it was supposed to do, a separate additional process was carried out called validation.</p><p>Validation is an inherent element of any statistical system, and in the Calculated Grades model the purpose of validation is to ensure that the statistical model is behaving as expected, and is achieving its objectives. The validation process has been part of the design from the beginning.</p><p>The workings of the statistical model were reviewed and validated in a number of ways. There was a review of the distributions of results for each subject and level. There was also a review of the demographic characteristics of the outcomes, which included gender and socioeconomic status of the school.</p><p>The purpose of the review of the outcomes of the statistical model was to check whether the Calculated Grades model was resulting in any particular group being advantaged or disadvantaged relative to previous years&rsquo; outcomes. It is important to note that this assessment was being made relative to previous years. For example, the validation checked whether or not disadvantage effects, or gender effects are being exacerbated under the model. This was to ensure that the model presented outcomes that were as fair and equitable as possible given its constraints, and were in line with previous outcomes as much as is possible.</p><p>The purpose of the Calculated Grades system is to arrive at the grade that each student would have achieved if the examinations had taken place as normal. The validation process checked whether the interactions between these characteristics and the calculated results were similar to the interactions in the historical data between these characteristics and examination results.</p><p>The system of Calculated Grades is a complex and sophisticated system which had to be developed from scratch within an extremely tight timeframe in order for students to get their Calculated Grades results in time.  The statistical model itself was developed specifically for the Irish Leaving Certificate.  The Department had checks at a number of stages to ensure that data was collected correctly from schools and transferred correctly between the various stages of the standardisation process, the validation process and the grading processes.</p></reply>

The work of this group is at an advanced stage and a consultation process with education stakeholder representatives on the technical aspect of this model has commenced. It is envisaged that this will then provide the basis for development of a DEIS resource allocation system to match resources to identified need and will be applied on the same basis across the country.</p><p>The culmination of this work will facilitate the ultimate aim of matching resources to identified need and will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need. It is not proposed to extend or to make any changes to the DEIS Programme until this work is complete. </p><p>Regardless of whether or not schools are in the DEIS programme, all schools receive allocations of additional special education teacher support, to provide extra teaching support to pupils who have additional learning needs.</p><p>DES Circular 007/2019 for primary schools and 008/2019 for post primary schools set out the details of the model for allocating special education teachers to schools.</p><p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.  </p><p>The Special Education Teacher allocation, allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who require such support in their schools and for schools to deploy resources based on each pupil&rsquo;s individual learning needs.</p><p>It gives greater flexibility to schools as to how they can deploy their resources, to take account of the actual learning needs pupils have, as opposed to being guided by a particular diagnosis of disability, and schools are guided as to how they should make such allocation decisions.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has published guidelines for schools as to how they should utilise and deploy their resources under the new allocation model, which are available at </p><p>All schools are therefore resourced to provide additional teaching support for pupils who may require extra support based on the profiled needs of schools.</p></reply>

Currently, almost 20% of the total Education Vote or &euro;1.9bn is invested in supporting children with special needs.  </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country, including South Dublin, where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. NCSE is continuing its engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others across South Dublin to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on stream. While progress has been achieved, the NCSE has identified the need for additional special class and special school places in South Dublin for the current school-year. </p>  <p>  Normally, special class and special school places are established with the full cooperation of the schools in areas where they are required.  However there are some parts of the country where the NCSE has faced challenges in getting schools and their patrons to provide new special class or special school places.  </p>  <p>  As Minister, I have a power under Section 37A of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), to direct a school to provide additional provision where all reasonable efforts have failed.  The legislation contains a procedure through which the capacity of schools in an area can be tested and through which ultimately a Ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. </p>  <p>  The legislation was used for the first time in 2019, in respect of the Dublin 15 area. Significant progress has been made in that area on foot of action taken under Section 37. A new Special School was established and six schools have agreed to open special classes thereby meeting the need for additional places in the area. The experience of Dublin 15 shows that real and practical challenges can be addressed by working together to provide additional special class and special school places.</p>  <p>  A Report from the NCSE, prepared in accordance with Section 37A (2) of the Education Act 1998 (as inserted by Section 8 of the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act 2018), confirming the need for additional special education places in South Dublin was submitted to the then Minister in April last. This Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. </p>  <p>  Statutory notices under the Act were subsequently issued on 26 June, 2020 to 39 schools identified by the NCSE. The issue of the notices is but the first step in a very transparent multi-step process, the purpose of which is to establish if the school has capacity to provide new places. At each stage of the process, schools are given the opportunity to make representations and there is also an option for arbitration at a later point. Statutory notices issued under the Act together with the representations received from the schools and their patrons are published on my Department&rsquo;s website. The representations received to date have all been published and are a matter of public record.</p>  <p>  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage on the legislative process which is currently underway.</p></reply>

Significant resources are allocated each year to ensure that appropriate supports are available for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Children with special educational needs are supported through placement in mainstream classes, special classes and special schools. At school, they receive a range of supports provided by teachers and SNAs.  Other professional supports, including training for teachers, are provided by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to enable each school provide a holistic educational experience for each child.  The HSE is responsible for the delivery of therapeutic supports.</p>  <p>  NCSE has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide; has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents; and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  The NCSE is planning a further expansion of special class and school places nationally to meet identified need. This process is ongoing</p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. School transport is also available. My Department works closely with the NCSE in this regard.</p>  <p>The school to which the Deputy refers opened as a 24 classroom school in September, 2019. While specific special class accommodation was not provided in the school, 8 Special Education Teaching (SET) rooms and 1 Resource Room were provided. Due to site constraints, it is not possible to construct additional accommodation on the site.</p></reply>

Given that this is an uncontended service; the school should have 100Mbp/s connectivity. HEAnet is currently conducting an extensive upgrade programme for post primary schools that has already seen some 47% of schools upgraded to speeds greater that 200Mbp/s. A further 380 post-primary schools are now due a further upgrade. That will see over 80% of post-primary schools with connections of 200 Mbp/s or higher. This school has already been identified as part of the cohort to be upgraded in the current school year, with work underway to procure that upgraded service.</p>  <p>  This upgrade programme is based on demonstrated requirements, and in the current circumstances the system is being closely monitored to prioritise those most in need of the higher speed connectivity, in line with contractual and procurement regulations.</p>  <p>  The delivery of high quality internet connectivity for all schools is a key objective of my Department, to support the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning.

My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations. Accordingly, the question has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  </p>  <p>  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p>  <p>  Schools were notified of the arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for the current school year.  The arrangements include the following provisions:</p>  <p>  - 2019/20 mainstream class SNA allocations were frozen, from the date of issue of Circular 0030/2020, and have automatically rolled over into the current school year. This means that no school will receive an allocation less than that which they have on the date of issue of this Circular and existing SNAs currently in standard SNA posts were allowed to continue in these posts for the current school year in the normal way.</p>  <p>  - A diagnosis of a disability, or a psychological or other professional report, is not be necessary for this process.</p>  <p>  - The role of the SNA to support the care needs of students in mainstream classes, as set out in Circular 0030/2014, remains unchanged.</p>  <p>  It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support. Providing access to SNA support continues to be based on primary care needs as outlined in DES Circular 0030/2014.</p>  <p>  Schools may apply to the NCSE for additionality where they can demonstrate that the current allocation does not meet additional care needs within the mainstream classes in the school. Applications for additionality arising from significant new or emerging additional care needs, which cannot be catered within existing allocations, are dealt with by way of the exceptional review process.  </p>  <p>  In relation to Clonbonny National School, he NCSE have confirmed that the school submitted a request for an exceptional review of their SNA allocation for 2020/21 school year as they were of the view that their allocation was insufficient to meet the needs of their students for the year. The school was given an increase in SNA resources of 0.34 posts under the review process. However, the school appealed the outcome of this review. The appeal was not upheld and the school was advised of this in writing on Friday 21st August 2020. </p></reply>

If this pupil wishes to travel on this service the family should contact their local Bus &Eacute;ireann office.  </p>  <p>  The service which the pupil wishes to travel on is a road passenger service which school transport tickets cannot be used on. The pupil can use this public service on a pay as you go basis but will need to purchase a weekly ticket.

Alot of work has been undertaken to facilitate the safe reopening of schools in line with public health advice. The experience to date supports the current international position that schools are low risk environments for Covid-19.</p>  <p>  My Department has published a suite of helpful guidance for the safe and sustainable reopening of schools. Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with public health advice. This guidance is focused on the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection.</p>  <p>  Increasing separation and decreasing interaction is the basis of which physical distancing is achieved in schools in so far as is practicable. My Department has published helpful templates for schools on classroom layout to increase separation to the greatest degree possible. </p>  <p>  The objective is to limit contact between children in different class bubbles and pods as much as possible rather than to avoid all contact between pods as this will not always be possible.  In this regard pupils in special classes should continue to interact, or integrate, with mainstream classes to ensure their integration needs for educational purposes are addressed. </p>  <p>  However, the number of mainstream classes with which each special class pupil integrates should be minimised, in order to maintain pod grouping to the greatest extent possible, and to assist contact and tracing mechanisms, should this become necessary. </p>  <p>  At primary school level this may mean each special class pupil integrating with one mainstream class only. At post-primary school level, this may mean special class pupils attending only those mainstream classes necessary for their subject participation. </p>  <p>  I would encourage the school in question to contact my Department&rsquo;s helpline if they have particular queries in relation to my Department&rsquo;s guidance for the safe and sustainable reopening of schools.</p></reply>

The process of national standardisation was applied to the school information in order to ensure comparability between the standards applied by individual schools and the national standard. We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.  Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.  But to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.  </p><p>These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.  </p><p>A standardising process happens every year and would have happened in 2020 had the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types.  The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.  This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.  </p><p>Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.  </p><p>Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.  Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).  </p><p>The overall data on school estimated marks showed that there was a very significant rise in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally. This level of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been unrealistic. For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%. Even with the standardisation process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.</p><p>In terms of the grades awarded, 83% (almost 340,000) of all Leaving Certificate subject grades are either the same or higher than the school estimates while 17% (under 70,000) grades are lower. </p><p>In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.  This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.</p><p>On 30 September, I announced that two errors had been found in the Leaving Certificate 2020 Calculated Grades process. These errors related to the way in which the coding for the process utilised Junior Cycle data. </p><p>On 03 October, following a further review of the coding by an independent third party, I announced that a further error had been identified. </p><p>These errors were rectified, and following this, a total of 6,100 students have received higher grades. These students were able to access their improved results from 6pm on 03 October. </p><p>Technical details of the Calculated Grades model and standardisation process were published on the date of issue of the results and are available here: .</p></reply>

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring. </p></reply>

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p>  <p>  My Department contracted a Canadian company, Polymetrika International Inc. to assist with the development of the model.</p>  <p>  On 30 September, I made a statement that advising that two errors had been identified in the Calculated Grades process. These meant that incorrect grades were issued to some students when they received their results on 7 September. </p>  <p>  The first error was identified by Polymetrika as having taken place when processing students&rsquo; data. The error, in one out of 50,000 lines of code, was in relation to the processing of Junior Cycle data. The system was meant to draw on the core Junior Cycle subjects of English, Irish and Maths, and combine them with the students&rsquo; 2 best non-core subjects for all of the students in each class in each school. The coding error instead combined them with the students&rsquo; 2 weakest non-core subjects.</p>  <p>  The error meant that, in some subjects, some students received Calculated Grades that were lower than they should have been, while some students received grades that were higher than they should have been. </p>  <p>  In the course of the complete review which the Department undertook, Departmental staff found a further error in the section of the code dealing with Junior Cycle results. The Junior Cycle subject Civil, Social and Political Education (CPSE) was meant to be disregarded as part of the model but was not. This second error, however, had a negligible impact on results.</p>  <p>  I provided a further update on 03 October, announcing that improved Calculated Grades would issue to impacted students that day. This announcement was made following a review of essential aspects of the coding by Educational Testing Services, ETS, a non-profit organisation based in the United States. </p>  <p>  ETS completed their review and provided it to my Department on 3 October.  The review identified one further error, relating to how the code handled cases where students did not sit all three core subjects (Irish, English and Maths) at Junior Cycle level.  </p>  <p>  As a result of rectification of the errors, a total of 6,100 students have received higher grades. This breaks down as follows:</p>  <p>  - 5,408 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in one subject,</p>  <p>  - 621 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in two subjects,</p>  <p>  - 71 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in three or more subjects. </p>  <p>  National policy in relation to examination outcomes, as given effect in Section 53 of the Education Act 1998 (as amended), is focussed on guarding against the release of information which would enable the compilation of information (that is not otherwise available to the general public) in relation to the comparative performance of schools in respect of the academic achievement of students. This means that generally examinations performance data analysis will only be presented and/or published on an aggregated, national basis and not at any more granular level, including by school but also by school type, geographic location, regional location, etc.</p>  <p>  In addition to the students who received a lower grade than they should have in this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate, some students received a higher grade than they should have.  However, these students grades are not being amended. </p>  <p>  ETS also identified an issue concerning how the algorithm used in the standardisation process treated students&rsquo; marks at the extreme ends of the marks scale (99% and over, 1% and below). However, ETS also stated that this had no material impact on the results and no student could receive a lower grade as a result of it. </p>  <p>  Impacted students were sent a text message advising them to log onto the Calculated Grades Student Portal to access their revised results from 6.00pm on Saturday 03 October. </p>  <p>  The Department has sent a corrected file of student results to the CAO. The CAO will now establish how many students are eligible to receive a new CAO offer.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will work with the CAO and the higher education institutions to see how these students can be facilitated to commence the course that they would, in other circumstances, have been offered in an earlier round. </p>  <p>  Any student who would have been entitled to a different offer in previous CAO rounds if they received the correct grade on 7 September will receive this offer or a deferred offer as soon as practicable after the updating of results.</p>  <p>  This is in line with the practice that occurs in the appeals process every year.</p></reply>

Development of the new Literacy and Numeracy Strategy has commenced with digital literacy remaining a key area of focus. Further the implementation of the Digital Strategy for Schools 2015-2020 will continue to improve engagement with digital literacy across the education continuum. </p>  <p>  Considerable work has been done in the development of curricula on digital literacy.  At both primary and post-primary levels considerable scope for building the capacity of students in the area of digital literacy is provided for through the emphasis on dispositions, competencies and skills as foundational elements of the curriculum.  Specifically, in the newly introduced Framework for Junior Cycle digital literacy skills are promoted through the eight Key Skills (all skills have an ICT/digital component) and through the Statements of Learning. In addition, in the ongoing reviews of the Primary Curriculum and of the Senior Cycle the skills of, or skills closely related to, digital literacy, have featured strongly in all discussions on future provision.  </p>  <p>  Currently at post-primary level, there are several programmes and courses in ICT and Digital Literacy already in place, particularly the Junior Cycle Short Course in Digital Literacy and the IT courses in the Leaving Certificate Applied programme. To a lesser extent, the recently-introduced Leaving Certificate subject in Computer Science also looks at aspects of digital literacy. </p>  <p>  In studying the Junior Cycle Short Course in Digital Media Literacy, students learn to use digital technology, communication tools and the internet creatively, critically and safely, in support of their development, learning and capacity to participate effectively in social and community life.</p>  <p>  The Information and Communication Technology module forms part of the core curriculum for all Leaving Certificate Applied students. It is intended to develop the students&rsquo; skills, knowledge, attitudes and understanding of Information and Communication Technology to enable them to use digital technology in both their current and future lives. </p>  <p>  In addition, areas such as Wellbeing and its constituent programmes in Social, Personal and Health Education, Relationships and Sexuality Education and Civic, Social and Political Education also underpin skills of digital literacy in engaging with the subject material in these courses.</p>  <p>  The Digital Learning Framework is currently being disseminated to all schools. The Framework promotes student engagement in the teaching and learning process and will help towards the development of digital literacy skills. The development and adaption of this Framework is a key objective of the Digital Strategy for Schools which is currently being implemented.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area. In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development. </p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:</p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,</p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, since April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 45 new schools over the 4 year period 2019 to 2022. </p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons. Parental preferences from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.  The Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to parents and guardians which will allow them to make an informed choice in expressing a preference for their preferred model of patronage and language of instruction i.e. Irish or English for their child&rsquo;s education.</p>  <p>  In September 2019, I announced that five of the new primary schools being established from 2020-2022 are being pre-designated for Irish-medium education. The five new schools will serve areas of growing populations where there is no existing Irish-medium primary school or where there is more than one new school to be established between 2019 and 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process provides an opportunity to increase the number of Gaelscoileanna nationwide.  The process, which involves the live transfer of existing schools, is designed to provide additional multi-/non-denominational schools in Irish or English and an opportunity is available to English-medium schools seeking to make a transition to Irish-medium provision in that context, in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community. Any school which is seeking a transfer of patronage, including transitioning to Irish-medium provision, should contact their school patron directly.</p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard to the impact of the increased roll out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.  My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools, including gaelscoileanna, may need to be expanded in order to meet the needs of the local population.</p>  <p>  Details of schools that provide education through the medium of Irish are available on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p></reply>

The purpose of this process was to allow as many students as possible to progress to employment, further education and training, or higher education. </p><p>My Department contracted a Canadian company, Polymetrika International Inc. to assist with the development of the model.</p><p>On 30 September, I made a statement that advising that two errors had been identified in the Calculated Grades process. These meant that incorrect grades were issued to some students when they received their results on 7 September. </p><p>The first error was identified by Polymetrika as having taken place when processing students&rsquo; data. The error, in one out of 50,000 lines of code, was in relation to the processing of Junior Cycle data. The system was meant to draw on the core Junior Cycle subjects of English, Irish and Maths, and combine them with the students&rsquo; 2 best non-core subjects for all of the students in each class in each school. The coding error instead combined them with the students&rsquo; 2 weakest non-core subjects.</p><p>The error meant that, in some subjects, some students received Calculated Grades that were lower than they should have been, while some students received grades that were higher than they should have been. </p><p>In the course of the complete review which the Department undertook, Departmental staff found a further error in the section of the code dealing with Junior Cycle results. The Junior Cycle subject Civil, Social and Political Education (CPSE) was meant to be disregarded as part of the model but was not. This second error, however, had a negligible impact on results.</p><p>I provided a further update on 03 October, announcing that improved Calculated Grades would issue to impacted students that day. This announcement was made following a review of essential aspects of the coding by Educational Testing Services, ETS, a non-profit organisation based in the United States. </p><p>ETS completed their review and provided it to my Department on 3 October.  The review identified one further error, relating to how the code handled cases where students did not sit all three core subjects (Irish, English and Maths) at Junior Cycle level.  </p><p>As a result of rectification of the errors, a total of 6,100 students have received higher grades. This breaks down as follows:</p><p>- 5,408 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in one subject,</p><p>- 621 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in two subjects,</p><p>- 71 students have received a higher grade, by one grade band, in three or more subjects. </p><p>National policy in relation to examination outcomes, as given effect in Section 53 of the Education Act 1998 (as amended), is focussed on guarding against the release of information which would enable the compilation of information (that is not otherwise available to the general public) in relation to the comparative performance of schools in respect of the academic achievement of students. This means that generally examinations performance data analysis will only be presented and/or published on an aggregated, national basis and not at any more granular level, including by school but also by school type, geographic location, regional location, etc.</p><p>In addition to the students who received a lower grade than they should have in this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate, some students received a higher grade than they should have.  However, these students grades are not being amended. </p><p>ETS also identified an issue concerning how the algorithm used in the standardisation process treated students&rsquo; marks at the extreme ends of the marks scale (99% and over, 1% and below). However, ETS also stated that this had no material impact on the results and no student could receive a lower grade as a result of it. </p><p>Impacted students were sent a text message advising them to log onto the Calculated Grades Student Portal to access their revised results from 6.00pm on Saturday 03 October. </p><p>The Department has sent a corrected file of student results to the CAO. The CAO will now establish how many students are eligible to receive a new CAO offer.  </p><p>The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science will work with the CAO and the higher education institutions to see how these students can be facilitated to commence the course that they would, in other circumstances, have been offered in an earlier round. </p><p>Any student who would have been entitled to a different offer in previous CAO rounds if they received the correct grade on 7 September will receive this offer or a deferred offer as soon as practicable after the updating of results.</p><p>This is in line with the practice that occurs in the appeals process every year.</p></reply>

Any additional days are to be charged at &euro;1,100 per day.</p><p>Polymetrika played an integral part of the development and running of the Calculated Grades model, and as such the contract for Polymetrika was extended to implement the Calculated Grades model under the pre-agreed terms of the contract. This was done following the decision of Government on 8 May 2020 to postpone the Leaving Certificate Examinations.</p><p>Due to the time constraints the Department availed of the procurement process known as the Negotiated Procedure without Prior Publication. This is used in circumstances where it is a case of extreme urgency.</p><p>To date, the total gross cost of services provided by Polymetrika under contract has been approximately &euro;193,000 which reflects services provided to end September.</p><p>This expenditure reflects their work in both the contingency planning and the development and statistical work around the operation of the model.</p><p>As was announced on 30 September, the Department has also engaged the services of ETS, Educational Testing Service, a US-based non-profit organisation which specialises in educational measurement, to review essential aspects of the coding.

Currently, the obligation to register a death rests with the relatives of the deceased, or in their absence, other persons specified in the Act.  A death must be registered within three months of the date of death.  Other than the obligation to register a death, there are no other legal obligations to report a death to the Civil Registration Service.  Specific arrangements are in place for the notification of certain deaths to a Coroner under the Coroners Acts.</p>  <p>  Some four in every five deaths that are not referred to Coroners are registered within the three month timeframe.  The manner and operation of the death registration process has been identified as an area requiring reform to ensure it meets with domestic and international public health and reporting requirements for life events.  The General Register Office (GRO), which comes under aegis of my Department,  is leading an inter-agency working group to modernise the way deaths are notified and subsequently registered.   This work is timely as it coincides with recommendations made by the National Public Health Emergency Team to reduce the length of time between the date of death and registration.</p>  <p>  The working group is finalising proposals which, following public and stakeholder engagement, will form the basis for legislative changes to the Civil Registration Act to be considered by the Government. </p>  <p>  I have been informed by the GRO that the proposals emerging from the Working Group will focus on reducing the current timeframe for death registration and on introducing new mechanisms for the early notification and registration of deaths, including technological and process changes. </p>  <p>   I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The main focus of the allowance is to assist qualifying applicants to improve their educational qualifications and their prospects of gaining employment.  </p><p>The BTEA has been extended as part of the July Stimulus in response to Covid-19.  Ordinarily a person must be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a minimum period before being eligible to apply for the BTEA when pursuing training or education, including SpringBoard.  The qualifying period has been waived for people on coming from the PUP.  This ensures that those who have lost their employment during the pandemic have immediate access to a range of educational options.  </p><p>In order to avail of continued financial support while pursuing a full-time course, a person in receipt of the PUP should apply for a jobseeker payment and continue payment on the BTEA to the end of their course.  The BTEA is payable at the jobseekers rate. </p><p>Where someone in receipt of PUP wishes to pursue part-time study, including part-time SpringBoard, they can continue to receive PUP while they continue to satisfy the conditions of that payment.  </p><p>Any person seeking to return to education should engage with their local Intreo Centre to assess their options.</p><p>I trust this clarifies the issues for the Deputies.</p></reply>

The measures were designed to ensure that where a registered medical practitioner or a HSE medical officer diagnoses a person with COVID-19 or identifies him or her as a probable source of infection of COVID-19, the person concerned can comply with medical advice to isolate, while having their income protected.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus, to keep the number of people affected to a minimum, and to reduce a peak of cases which would cause extreme pressure on the health system.</p><p>The enhanced rate of Illness Benefit was brought in as a short-term public health measure and is not a long-term income support payment.  It is payable for 2 weeks where a person is isolating as a probable source of infection of Covid-19 and for up to 10 weeks where a person has been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Certification by a registered medical professional is required to support any claim for the special Covid 19 Illness payment.  There are no waiting days in respect of the enhanced illness benefit payment.  Only one contribution is required in the four weeks before the claim, thereby making the payment more accessible.</p><p>Where a medical practitioner advises a person to remain away from work because an underlying medical condition means they are unable to work safely, then the standard Illness Benefit payment may be made, subject to the conditions of the scheme being satisfied. </p><p>The purpose of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of COVID-19 is to encourage people to not go to work due to financial constraint when they should be in isolation. </p><p>When the enhanced payment was introduced, it was intended for people who were self-isolating or in a medical facility.  Subsequently the HSE and the Department of Health introduced another category - for people who were advised to restrict their movements.  </p><p>According to the HSE, people will need to self-isolate:</p><p>- if they have symptoms of COVID-19</p><p>- while they wait for a test appointment and test results, if they have symptoms of COVID-19</p><p>- if they have had a positive test result for COVID-19</p><p>People are advised by the HSE to restrict their movements for 14 days if they:</p><p>- are a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID-19</p><p>- live with someone who has symptoms of COVID-19, but feel well</p><p>- are being tested as a close contact of a confirmed case of COVID-19 and don&rsquo;t have any symptoms</p><p>- arrive into Ireland from a country that is not on the COVID-19 green list - this list is reviewed regularly based on advice from officials including public health experts and will be updated if needed</p><p>Employers are asked to facilitate remote working where possible &ndash; in this situation people should remain on full pay from the employer.  </p><p>From the outset of COVID-19, many employers will have taken the initiative, in line with subsequent requests from the Government, to be as flexible as possible in allowing staff time off where required. Employers have a general duty of care towards their workers and that care is often expressed in the form of negotiation, compromise and flexibility.  Some of the options to be considered for workers with responsibilities that preclude them from working their normal hours in the normal, pre-COVID-19, may include:</p><p>- offering paid compassionate leave</p><p>- allowing employees to work from home</p><p>- altering shifts, so that employees can co-ordinate caring between themselves and partners, or another person</p><p>- allowing employees to take or rearrange annual leave</p><p>- allowing employees to rearrange parental leave</p><p>- allowing employees to take paid time off that can be worked back at a later time etc.</p><p>- allowing employees to take unpaid leave until they can return to work full or part-time.</p><p>In the event of an employee being told by their employer to go home or stay at home for a period of time without pay they may be entitled to claim the Pandemic Unemployment Payment or Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance.  If they are not eligible for those payments, then they may apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance.</p></reply>

It is the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to pay statutory redundancy payments to all eligible employees. In the event that an employer is unable to pay due to financial difficulties, an application for payment from the Social Insurance Fund may be submitted to the Department. </p>  <p>  When such a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund, a debt is raised against the employer. The Department is obliged to make every effort to recover the debt owed, in accordance with Section 32 of the Act. The Department will engage with employers to establish their financial situation and seeks to recover the debt on a mutually agreed basis, including repayments by instalment, where appropriate.</p>  <p>  In the case of sole traders, they do not have the protection of limited liability.  In such instances the full liability remains with them or their estate. Since the start of the pandemic the Department has been very mindful of the difficulties that sole traders are facing. For a time, debt reminder letters did not issue. In some circumstances debt repayments were suspended until the business is in a better financial position. If a closure situation arises, the existing mechanisms are flexible enough to make statutory redundancy payments on behalf of employers and to adjust the repayment arrangements, thus easing the pressures on sole traders. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s policy is kept under review but any change to the policy must ensure that employer debt is recovered in full wherever possible. </p></reply>

While the model assumes that pensioners have the Free Travel pass and the Household Benefits package, it does not assume this for working age people.  Certain working age recipients of welfare payments qualify for Free Travel &ndash; recipients of Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, for example. </p>  <p>  Bringing weekly working age social welfare rates in line with the MESL would entail increasing the maximum personal rate to &euro;250 and the Qualified Child Increase to &euro;48.20 for children under 12 and &euro;94.70 for children aged 12 and over.  There would be no proportionate increase in the current rate for Qualified Adults in order to meet the MESL.</p>  <p>  Bringing pension rates in line with the MESL would require an increase of &euro;51.40 for pensioners living alone in rural areas. There would be no increase to the rate of payment for pensioner couples, or pensioners living alone in urban areas. While it is not possible at this time to provide an estimate for those living in rural areas only, the estimated cost of an increase for all pensioners in receipt of the Living Alone Allowance is included in the figure below.</p>  <p>The estimated cost of bringing working age and pension welfare payments to meet the Minimum Essential Standard of Living (MESL), as outlined above, is &euro;2.9 billion.  This costing is subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients.</p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on Carer&rsquo;s Allowance in 2020 is approximately &euro;916 million.  Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion.   </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means tested payment made to people whose income falls below certain limits, and who are looking after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. </p>  <p>  This allowance is part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on an income need.  The means test plays a critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency &ndash; such as disability, unemployment or caring.  This ensures that the recipient has a verifiable income need and that resources are targeted to those who need them most.  </p>  <p>  Current disregards for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple, making the means test for carers the least onerous within the social protection system.  </p>  <p>  In the case of a couple, a carer may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 per week while having an annual income of &euro;37,500 from employment, retain a payment of (just under half-rate) &euro;109.00 per week while having an annual income from employment of &euro;49,750, and retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;61,000. </p>  <p>  In the case of a single carer a similar scenario illustrates that a carer may retain a full-rate payment of &euro;219.00 while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, retain a payment of &euro;109.00 per week (just under half-rate) while having an annual income of &euro;25,400, or retain the minimum payment of &euro;4 per week while having an annual income of &euro;31,100. </p>  <p>  The Department has made an estimate of the cost of increasing the weekly income disregards for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance to &euro;450 for a single person and to &euro;900 for a couple using the ESRI SWITCH model.  This analysis suggests that it would cost in the region of an additional &euro;73 million per annum with net expenditure estimated in the order of &euro;55 million per annum. </p>  <p>  Changes to schemes are considered in an overall budgetary and policy context and from an evidence based perspective.  Some 92% of the current recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;7.60 per week and would not benefit by an increase in the disregard.  </p>  <p>  My Department also offers other, non-means-tested, supports to carers.  The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is not mean-tested and is available to all carers who meet the eligibility criteria.  The payment is not dependent on a person receiving a weekly carer&rsquo;s payment.  This non-taxable grant of &euro;1,700  is payable annually in June.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the key role that family carers play in our society and I will continue to keep the range of supports available to carers under review.  Any changes to scheme criteria, however, would have implications for overall spending and would need to be addressed in an overall budgetary context.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy. </p>  <p>  My Department provides income supports to carers such as Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.  Combined spending on all these payments to family carers in 2020 is expected to exceed &euro;1.3 billion. </p>  <p>  Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment for carers who, on a full-time basis, look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention, where the carer's income falls below certain limits.  At the end of August 2020, there were 87,733 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  The estimated expenditure in 2020 is approximately &euro;916 million.</p>  <p>  The means test conditionality for Carer's Allowance is consistent with the overall rules that apply to social assistance payments.  The system of social assistance supports provides payments based on an income need, with the means test playing the critical role in determining whether or not an income need arises as a consequence of a particular contingency - be that illness, disability, unemployment or caring.  The application of a means-test not only ensures that the recipient has an income need but also that scarce resources are targeted to those with the greatest need. </p>  <p>  The deduction of further expenses from reckonable income in the means test for Carer's Allowance would effectively increase the current income disregards applied.  It should be noted that the means test for Carer's Allowance is the most generous in the social welfare system, especially with regard to earnings disregards.  In the case of a single person, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is not taken into account (i.e. is disregarded).  In the case of a person who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, the first &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income is disregarded.  PRSI, travel costs, superannuation and union contributions from the weekly income from employment are deducted before the disregard is applied.  This is in line with most social assistance payments.  For a couple, the combined gross weekly balance is then halved to give the carer's weekly means.  </p>  <p>  A couple earning up to &euro;37,500 per year can qualify for the maximum rate while a couple earning &euro;49,750 can, due to the tapered withdrawal approach, retain a payment of just under half-rate.  A single person may keep a full-rate payment while having an annual income of just under &euro;19,000, and keep a payment of just under half-rate while having an annual income of &euro;25,400. </p>  <p>  The exclusion of other costs, as suggested by the Deputy, in the calculation of income could have significant budgetary implications and would give rise to inconsistencies in how means tests are applied across schemes. It would also significantly increase the complexity of the means assessment process. </p>  <p>Any changes to the means conditions for any of the schemes operated by the Department, including the Carer's Allowance, would need to be addressed in a budgetary context.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the means test takes account of the income and assets of the person (and spouse/partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme.  Income and assets include income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments as well as property owned (other than the family home) and capital such as savings, shares and other investments.  </p>  <p>  The assessment of capital reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that capital, or to realise the value of property, to support themselves without having to rely solely on a means-tested welfare payment. </p>  <p>  In this regard, for Carer's Allowance, the first &euro;20,000 of capital is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.   </p>  <p>  In relation to Carer's Allowance, as the first &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income for single people and the first &euro;665 for couples is fully disregarded, and combined with a general disregard of &euro;7.60 per week, 92% of the approximately 87,000 Carer's Allowance recipients have no means assessed.</p>  <p>  Any proposals to change the capital means assessment for means-tested social assistance schemes would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context.</p></reply>

The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is payable on the first Thursday in June each year.  This is not available for any other group and nor is there an equivalent payment for carers in any other country in Europe.  The Grant is paid automatically to people in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full time care and attention are also eligible and can apply for a &lsquo;standalone&rsquo; grant. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the substantial extra financial demands due to the COVID-19 crisis, I confirmed, on 4 June, that the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant would continue to be paid to carers this year at an estimated cost of over &euro;237 million.  At the end of June 2020, almost 127,000 grants were paid to carers receiving the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance and to other full-time carers who are not receiving any of these payments.

Such  contributors are currently covered for a wide range of social insurance benefits including State pension (contributory), widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity, adoptive and paternity benefits, treatment benefits, invalidity pension, partial capacity benefit if in receipt of invalidity pension, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit (self-employed) and parent&rsquo;s benefit. </p>  <p>  The issue of extending additional social insurance benefits to self-employed persons paying class S social insurance contributions was considered in the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, conducted by independent consultants, which was published in October 2017.  </p>  <p>  The Review indicates that if access to certain additional benefits, including carer's benefit, was extended to self-employed contributors, the class S rate of social insurance contribution would have to increase by 94% in order to ensure that the additional benefits are delivered in a revenue neutral manner.  This rate of increase would bring the current class S contribution rate of 4% to 7.8% to cover access to the additional benefits only and does not take account of the value of the existing benefits to such contributors.</p>  <p>  Any proposal to extend social insurance entitlements to self-employed contributors would have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the current economic circumstances and with a view to the sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-06a.1303.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100600099#WRFF04200"><p>The Programme for Government &ldquo;Our Shared Future&rdquo; includes a commitment to examine options for a pension solution for carers, the majority of whom are women, particularly those of incapacitated children, in recognition of the enormous value of the work carried out by them.  This Government acknowledges the important role that carers play and is fully committed to supporting them in that role. Officials in my Department will be examining the policy options for reforming the state pension system both in this area and,more generally, in relation to considerations around a Total Contributions Approach.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the public policy and social issues in relation to funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex.  As a consequence, the Programme for Government commits to establishing a Commission on Pensions to examine a range of issues including sustainability, eligibility, contributions and calculation methods.   The Terms of Reference for the Commission on Pensions are currently being developed and options for its membership are being considered.  Proposals will be brought to Government in that regard as soon as possible.  Once it has concluded its deliberations, the Commission will report to Government by June of next year.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the current situation is that through the award of credited contributions, normally known as credits, the social insurance system gives significant recognition to time spent caring in terms of qualifying for the State Pension (Contributory).  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.  Credits are awarded to recipients of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance (and Carer&rsquo;s Benefit) where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid Carer&rsquo;s Leave from work.  </p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the Homemaker scheme.  The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1994, is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for State Pension (Contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the State Pension (Contributory) rate of payment when the rate of pension is calculated using the Yearly Average method. </p>  <p>  When the Interim Total Contributions Approach (also known as T12) was introduced in 2018, it included provision for the HomeCaring Periods Scheme which fundamentally changed the entitlement of many who spent time out of the workforce caring for others.  It acknowledged, for the first time, home caring periods prior to 1994 and provides for up to 20 years of home caring periods to be considered.  Those who have a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits / homecaring periods, qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.  Arising from this initiative, the Department reviewed over 94,000 cases resulting in over 38,000 receiving an increased pension payment.  </p>  <p>  Since April 2019 all new State (Contributory) Pension applications are assessed under all possible rate calculation methods, including the Yearly Average and Interim Total Contributions Approach, with the most beneficial rate paid to the pensioner.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that if a person does not satisfy those conditions, they may qualify for the means-tested State Pension (Non-Contributory), the maximum rate of which is over 95% that of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse is a State pensioner and they have significant household means, their most beneficial payment may be an Increase for a Qualified Adult, based on their personal means, and amounting to up to 90% of a full contributory pension.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A number of new conditions were introduced to the CE Scheme in July 2017 to further support progression to employment, broaden CE access to a wider range of people and to standardise the conditions relating to the length of time a CE participant can remain on a CE scheme.  In general CE placements for new entrants aged between 21 and 55 years are for one year.  CE participants who are working towards a Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) major award can seek to extend their participation on CE by up to two years to enable them to reach the required standard of qualification. CE participants aged 55 years or older can remain on CE for three years and do not have to work towards a QQI major award. In either scenario, a maximum of three consecutive year&rsquo;s participation is permissible.  A person may re-qualify for CE after a 12 month break once they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  An overall lifetime limit of six years applies to all CE participants (seven years for those on a disability payment).   Prior to 2017, there were two available options for participating on CE.  Both options commenced with one year of participation with the possibility of either one or two more years, depending on the option taken.  Both options were subject to qualification criteria and neither required the CE participant to undertake any training resulting in the achievement of a major award.</p>  <p>   In 2017 the new conditions and qualifying criteria were introduced and a saver clause was provided for the existing clients:  &lsquo;Participants who commenced on CE prior to 3rd July 2017 will be entitled to remain under their existing CE eligibility rules, where this is to their advantage. If it is more advantageous to the person, the current criteria can be applied.&rsquo;</p>  <p>  In response to the query relating to the Part Time Job option, the saver clause that was introduced allowed participants who commenced under that option to continue on CE for a maximum of 3 consecutive years with or without working towards a QQI major award, whichever was more advantageous.</p>  <p>  The 2017 saver clause does not allow those affected to continue to participate on CE for six years consecutively.  The same continuous limitation of three years continues to apply to all CE participants both pre and post 2017.  Participation on CE was never intended to be long-term and the maximum continued participation on CE is three years.</p>  <p>  In response to the query on the statement on the Citizens Information website which relates to the saver clause, the saver clause allowed existing CE participants to remain on CE for up to a maximum of three consecutive years subject to certain conditions.  In response to the query relating to the 2016 Community Employment Procedures Manual, which states that an overall lifetime limit of six years applies to CE participants between 55 and up to the State Pension age, this was the position in 2016 and it remains the position today.  However, since 2017 the six year life time limit has been extended to all CE participants.</p></reply>

A number of Departments, including my own Department, were represented on this group, as were the unions and Pobal. </p>  <p>  As part of this process a detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  This exercise estimated a potential cost to the State of between &euro;188 million and &euro;347 million per annum depending on the numbers involved.  This excluded any provision for an immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  In its findings, the High-level Group stated that while CE supervisors and assistant supervisors represented only a very small part of the wider community and voluntary sector, any explicit provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of CE Supervisors could potentially give rise to claims for funding for employees of similar schemes in the broader sector.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that it had to have regard to the full potential Exchequer exposure associated with setting such a precedent.</p>  <p>  At this point, I wish to acknowledge the valuable and dedicated service that CE supervisors provide in running CE schemes delivering local based community services while  providing a valuable training and development opportunity to the long-term unemployed and to those often furthest removed from the labour market.</p>  <p>The current position is that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Unions are in ongoing discussions on the matter. The funding of any potential pension provision for CE supervisors will ultimately be a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will need to be considered in the wider economic and budgetary context in which any such scheme will need to operate.</p></reply>

Under the provisions of the legislation a person claiming CARB must be in remunerative full time employment (for a minimum of 16 hours in the week or 32 hours in the fortnight) for eight weeks out of the previous 26 week period immediately prior to the first day on which a claim is made.  There is no provision in legislation to waive this requirement.</p>  <p>  The evidence submitted in support of this application was examined and the deciding officer decided that this evidence did not indicate that this requirement was satisfied. The person concerned was notified of this decision on 1st September 2020 and of her right of review and appeal.</p>  <p>  The person concerned requested a review of this decision. The outcome of the review is that the original decision is confirmed. On 17 September 2020 the person concerned was notified of this outcome and of their right of appeal directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p>  <p>  Due to a clerical error, this review letter did indicate the incorrect caree name.  I can confirm that an amended letter has now issued to the person concerned. </p>  <p>  The  letter from the employer, referred to by the Deputy, suggests that the person concerned actually works 24 hours per week.   It is important to understand that there is a distinction between &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; and &ldquo;remunerative hours of employment&rdquo;.  The employer has confirmed that the hours of remunerative employment of the person concerned are 11 hours per week and she is being paid in respect of those hours only.  The legislation does not make provision for other unpaid hours that may be worked.</p>  <p>  The person concerned has been advised to apply for Carer's Allowance which is not a contribution based scheme.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Following the award of pension, a reporting obligation continues to apply whereby the pension recipient (and, where relevant, their qualified adult dependant, personal representative or agent) must notify the Department in a timely manner of any change in their circumstances that may impact on their pension entitlement.  </p>  <p>  The person concerned had been in receipt of state pension non-contributory since 30 March 2012. Following notification to the Department that their spouse had commenced employment, the person&rsquo;s pension entitlement was reviewed in June 2020 on the basis of the couple&rsquo;s changed financial circumstances. The Deciding Officer stopped the person&rsquo;s state pension non-contributory entitlement with effect from 16 July 2020 for the reason that their (individualised) increased means exceeded the applicable weekly statutory limit of &euro;262.50. </p>  <p>  The person concerned was notified of this revised decision on 22 June 2020, together with the reason for the decision and their right, if dissatisfied with the decision, to request a review, or to appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.   </p>  <p>  To date, there is no record of an appeal being received from the person concerned. This Parliamentary Question will be taken as a request for review. A Deciding Office will review the person&rsquo;s entitlement to state pension non-contributory and they will be notified of the outcome in writing. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Consequently, there are over 1 million applications to be examined to determine if arrears are due. </p>  <p>  During the month of March, my Department received and processed jobseeker claims equivalent in number to a three year claim-load. These applications were processed as quickly as possible, with almost 59,000 people paid in the first week of the scheme, 283,000 people paid in the following week, and over 507,000 people in the third week of the scheme.  </p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware that many people are due some arrears and that every case will be different. In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department is currently developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history. The work involved is complex as the Pandemic Unemployment Payment system itself evolved from a manual applications system to one where applications were submitted online and paid over two different payment platforms (one from March to July and the second from July to date).</p>  <p>  Given the complexity attached to the project, it will take some time yet to complete the necessary development work to review all cases and to determine to what extent, if any, arrears are due to individuals. I can assure the Deputy that this is a priority for the Department and it is hoped to make payments before end of the year . </p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Pension increases are entirely a matter for the scheme trustees and the sponsoring employer.  Matters directly related to former Eircom, Telecom &Eacute;ireann, and P&amp;T groups come under the remit of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  Trustees of occupational pension schemes have duties and responsibilities under the Pensions Act 1990, as amended, under trust law and under other relevant legislation.  The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering a scheme in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and rules as well as ensuring compliance with the requirements that apply to these schemes.  Trustees must act in the best financial interests of the scheme members, whether active, deferred or retired, and must serve all beneficiaries of the scheme impartially.  If there is a conflict of interest then a person&rsquo;s duty as a trustee must take precedence over other interests.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

They are required to investigate and report on customer&rsquo;s claims and confirm that scheme conditionality is in order. The powers outline the requirement for a claimant to give an inspector information and any documents that s/he may require for the purposes of an investigation.</p>  <p>  As part of their investigations, an inspector's remit also includes the combating of fraud and abuse of the Department's schemes. Inspectors may need to make notified or un-notified home visits.  The approach taken in each investigation is determined by the inspector and if home visits, be they un-notified or notified, are deemed to be necessary  to determine a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a particular social welfare scheme, they form part of the overall investigation. Such visits to a customer&rsquo;s home are an operational control measure and a decision as to whether a home visit is necessary, and whether the customer is notified in advance, will depend on the nature of the case.  </p>  <p>  Social Welfare Inspectors only enter a private home if invited. There is no statutory power of entry unlike a workplace.  If an inspector is refused entry to a private home they may request that the person make themselves available for interview at an alternative agreed location.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Ireland has committed to bringing four children from Moria in the coming weeks. </p><p>The state&rsquo;s capacity to bring unaccompanied children to Ireland is determined by the available care placements, and the commitments the state has made to unaccompanied children who are already here. </p><p>Due to the level of need among refugees since the destruction of the Moria camp, I am seeking to expand Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to care for unaccompanied children. My Department and Tusla officials are examining the immediate requirements to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s existing commitments, including expansion of care placements and working with Department of Justice officials to identify unaccompanied children who wish to come to Ireland.  </p><p>Ireland provides care for two groups of unaccompanied children- children who arrive as part of refugee relocation programmes, and children who arrive without parents or guardians to ports of entry and seek asylum. All children who are unaccompanied are received into care under the Child Care Act 1991. </p><p>Both categories of child are sometimes referred to as unaccompanied minors or UAMs and are cared for by the same Tusla specialist team called the Separated Children Seeking Asylum Team.  The young people are, in the main, young boys aged between 15 and 17 years on arrival. </p><p>Separated Children Seeking Asylum (SCSA). </p><p>This is the largest cohort of unaccompanied children who come into Tusla care when they present to the immigration authorities at our sea and air ports. The service provided to these children is demand-led, and accurately estimating future demand is challenging, particularly as the effects of Brexit are yet to be seen.  The children are received into care at are placed in residential and foster care. </p><p>Tusla's Separated Children Seeking Asylum team received 167 referrals in 2019. These referrals include children who arrive unaccompanied at a port of entry but who have an adult relative or friend who lives in Ireland and is willing to care for them. The SCSA team carries out preliminary enquiries to ensure that the person has a genuine relationship with the child, and does agree to care for them before placing the child in their care. </p><p>The children who do not have adult relatives or guardians are received into care, and there were 46 of these children in 2019. </p><p>Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) </p><p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme is administered by the Department of Justice and Equality. Since 2017, Tusla has participated in the European Union Relief Projects (EURP) which include IRPP, Calais Special Project (CSP), Malta Relief, Greece Relief.  The following is a breakdown of the programmes to date: </p><p>41 from France under CSP </p><p>6 from Greece Relief under IRPP[1] </p><p>8 from Malta Relief under IRPP </p><p>8 from Greece under the IRPP in June 2020 </p><p>I hope I can rely on the Deputy's support in my efforts to receive more unaccompanied young people from Greece under the IRPP programme.</p></reply>

As this process is ongoing, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this stage. </p>  <p>  In recent years, funding for the provision of youth services has increased on an annual basis. Between 2016 and 2020 the annual current youth funding available to my Department has increased from &euro;51.9m to &euro;61.79. </p>  <p>  It is now more critical than ever that our young people are supported as they experience the social, economic, physical and mental health impacts of the pandemic. In recognition of the vital role played by youth work in providing such support to young people, funding levels have been maintained throughout the current challenging period.  This has enabled the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.  </p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting this important sector, which has enormous value both to the many young people involved and from a broader social and economic viewpoint.</p></reply>

SOLAS, in partnership with the HEA and with the support of the Apprenticeship Council, intends to continue developing access pathways with all providers, including TU Dublin, during 2020 and into the 2020-2021 academic year.</p><p>Technological University Dublin has developed an Access to Apprenticeship programme. This innovative pilot programme supports the transition of young people (16-24 years old) from areas of socio-economic disadvantage into craft apprenticeships. To date over 118 young men and women have progressed into apprenticeships through this program.</p><p>In addition to pre-apprenticeship programmes, initiatives underway to boost apprenticeship across tertiary education include:-</p><p>-  The apprenticeship &ldquo;jobs market&rdquo; platform (www.apprenticejobs.ie) is designed to increase visibility of opportunities for all potential apprentices. It is free to use by employers who are approved by SOLAS to train apprentices and potential apprentices. To date 963 Employers have registered with theplatform.</p><p>-  A new online facility for approving new apprenticeship employers went live in October 2019 to streamline the application process for employers wishing to take on apprentices.</p><p>-  The Generation Apprenticeship competition was rolled out at second level for the first time in 2020 with 156 second level schools, Youthreach Centres and Community Training Centres taking part (see www.gacomp.ie). </p><p>-  Broader approaches to widening access to apprenticeships also include developing links between Youthreach and Community Training Centre (CTC) provision.</p></reply>

I am aware of the challenges that are being encountered in the ELE sector and the substantial impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on its students, teachers and providers. </p><p>As part of the response to the pandemic, my Department established a specific Working Group for this sector. This group is comprised of representatives of relevant Government Departments and representatives of both students and English language education providers.  </p><p>As part of this process, the representative bodies for ELE providers have engaged with the Working Group surrounding their proposals for supports to aid the recovery of this sector.  In this forum, the providers have been advised of the measures introduced by Government to support businesses at this time as part of the wider Covid-19 response. These measures initially included the temporary wages subsidy scheme (TWSS) to facilitate employers to keep employees on the payroll during the initial period of the Covid-19 pandemic in order to retain this link for when business increases after the crisis. This temporary scheme has now been superseded by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS). The EWSS will continue to provide payroll support to businesses, including eligible ELE providers, until 31 March 2021 and also provides for a reduction in Employers PRSI.  </p><p>Further to the above, the ELE provider representatives have been advised of the eligibility of businesses in this sector to apply, where appropriate, for further business supports made available by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation via Enterprise Ireland and through its network of Local Enterprise Offices.  A full list of these supports and related information is available for providers here: . </p><p>My Department will continue to engage with ELE provider representatives as this sector moves towards its full re-opening and continues on a path to recovery.</p></reply>

Throughout the last number of months my Department has been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector to address the challenges faced by students in this difficult time. My Department, in consultation with these key stakeholders will continue to monitor the situation relating to student accommodation closely.</p>  <p>  Refund or cancellation policies in student accommodation should be set out in the license agreement signed at the beginning of the academic year. In the first instance students should engage with their accommodation provider to see if an arrangement can be reached in regard to a refund.</p>  <p>  If this is not possible, under the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 students have access to the Dispute Resolution Services of the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). While I would wish for private providers to show flexibility to students in this matter, it is not within my remit to issue instruction in relation to the private rental market.</p></reply>

To qualify for grant support, a student has to meet various criteria such as means, residency, nationality and progression.</p>  <p>  As part of the package of COVID supports for the higher and further education sector approved by Government on 22 July 2020, my Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has allocated &euro;15 million of capital funding for a once-off Covid-19 Grant to support disadvantaged students in accessing ICT devices. This grant is being made available to further and higher education institutions. The institutions are using the grant funding to purchase devices to support disadvantaged students, including students who belong to a National Access Plan target group, who are encountering challenges in accessing devices for online and blended learning.  The distribution of the devices will be via appropriate lending schemes, the associated terms and conditions, will be a matter for each individual further or higher education provider. </p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists full-time and part-time students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.  Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the higher education institution (HEI) attended. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to support students during the Covid 19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  The package of Covid 19 supports referred to above also includes a further &euro;10m in access supports for students.  I have approved the allocation of &euro;8.1m of this funding to top up the Student Assistance Fund (SAF) with remaining funding used to support students via the access services in the higher education institutions.</p>  <p>   Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from a student's local Tax office or from the Revenue Commissioners website www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

In July I announced a &euro;168 million funding package to support the sector and students, including a &euro;15 million fund for technology supports and <s></s>an additional &euro;10m for access supports. </p><p>As part of this package of COVID-19 supports for the higher and further education sectors, my Department has allocated &euro;15 million to higher and further education providers for a once-off COVID-19 Grant to support disadvantaged students in accessing ICT devices.  This initiative addresses concerns regarding the digital divide in the context of the shift to online and blended models of learning as a result of COVID-19 and the importance of supporting disadvantaged students to adapt to these new models.</p><p>Devices procured using the grant are being distributed by higher education institutions and Education and Training Boards to disadvantaged students via appropriate lending schemes. Approximately 16,700 laptops have already been ordered as part of a bulk purchase organised by HEAnet, Ireland&rsquo;s National Education and Research Network, while additional devices are being procured by some providers directly.</p><p>In addition, many HEIs already operate more than one campus and are considering all relevant approaches to a return to college where appropriate, or for the most appropriate provision of blended or online programmes. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck a number of higher education projects were already receiving funding from the HEA under the Innovation and Transformation Fund to assist students to access courses virtually. For example, Letterkenny IT runs the iNote project building digital capacity for flexible learning delivery in the West/ North West,; Dundalk IT provides a virtual hub to support all learners under its &lsquo;Gateway to Success&rsquo; project and IT Sligo provides online and blended degree programmes for students unable to be on campus due to location, disability etc.</p><p>In relation to connectivity which can be an issue for some students, bringing connectivity to remote rural locations is a key Government policy under the National Broadband Plan network which will offer users a high speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 150Mbps from the outset. To support remote working and connected communities, approximately 300 Broadband Connection Points were identified by Local Authorities to be connected to high speed broadband this year. Provision of these connection points will assist communities in gaining free public access to high speed broadband in advance of the main deployment under the National Broadband Plan. This work is being carried out by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in conjunction with the Department of Rural and Community Development. The connection points will be in public places such as library hubs and community centres and a map of the sites is available on the website of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p><p>In this context I would also refer the Deputy to my responses to Deputy Cairns in the D&aacute;il on 9 September in relation to issues around connectivity and online access when I said that I had met with representatives of HEAnet, the organisation that is involved in rolling out technological solutions for students.  HEAnet delivers high-speed internet connectivity and IT shared services to all levels of the education sector. While the broadband experience for students can differ across the country, the eduroam facility that HEAnet provides is a WiFi solution designed by and for the higher education community, and operates across the education locations nationally. Eduroam allows a student to access WiFi wherever eduroam is broadcast, enabling a student to seamlessly roam from one eduroam location to another. </p><p>HEAnet is in the process of developing proposals to see how this eduroam Wi-Fi system can be made available off campus as well as on campus.  To help address the increased demand for broadband access as a result of increased remote learning arising during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is recognised that expanding the coverage footprint of eduroam can help to ameliorate broadband access issues for students. In this regard, HEAnet has launched <i>&lsquo;</i>eduroam<i></i>Everywhere&rsquo;, a pilot initiative with the support of my Department. The objective of this initiative is to explore opportunities to expand the eduroam service across other public sector infrastructures, private sector infrastructures, as well as new infrastructures so as achieve a wider range of targeted locations that are conducive to student access and remote learning. In addition, the expanded HEAnet Store (www.heanet.ie/store) provides discounted devices and mobile broadband offers to support remote learning across higher education.</p></reply>

There are 64 single people and 24 family units accommodated in this centre.

This became necessary from September 2018, when our accommodation portfolio reached full capacity due to large increases in applications for protection, in order to ensure that Ireland could continue to meet our legal obligations to provide accommodation and other services to people seeking international protection. The premises was offered to my Department following a public advertisement for such hotel and guest house accommodation on short-term contracts.</p><p>The contracts for such accommodation premises are on a rolling short term basis (3 or 6 months).  The current contract for the premises in Bray is due to run until December, 2020. Before the expiry of the contract, an evaluation will be carried out of the requirement for accommodation in order to determine usage going forward.</p><p>My Department aims to move people from temporary accommodation to fully serviced centres  as soon as possible as and when vacancies arise or new accommodation comes on stream.  Our priority is to move families with children first.</p></reply>

One family will be accommodated in each unit, and there is a maximum capacity of 139 people in total.</p>  <p>  An initial two-year contract has been agreed between my Department and Keldesso Limited (the service provider).

They will facilitate independent living for residents, in line with the National Standards for accommodation centres published last year. This means that all residents will have cooking facilities and an in-house food hall where they can get their groceries using a cashless system. The residents will not pay for utilities, bins or heating. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a communal area on the ground floor of the apartments with a reception office and multi-functional meeting rooms for residents. This will include an indoor children&rsquo;s play facility, a library and a games room for teenagers. </p>  <p>  The children of international protection applicants are educated within the mainstream education system and can access free primary and post-primary education in the same way as other children in Ireland.

Commencement of section 30 raises serious matters, including the risk of infringement proceedings and the potential for significant penalties against the State.</p>  <p>  The processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under the so-called &ldquo;legitimate interests&rdquo; ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR, with the case law of the Court of Justice underlining the importance of free movement of personal data and establishing that Member States are not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. </p>  <p>  The Office of the Attorney General has also advised my Department that section 30 of the Act appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1)(f), read alongside Recital (47). Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6.1(f).  The commencement of section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has also confirmed that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest and that Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR does not make the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing unlawful. </p>  <p>  The Commission also indicated that subject to Article 22 (automated decision-making), processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of profiling is not generally prohibited, albeit the processing must take into account that children merit specific protection as clarified in recital (38). </p>  <p>  Moreover, the Commission have indicated that the term "micro-targeting", as referenced in Section 30 of the Act, is not mentioned in the GDPR, and its scope remains uncertain and undefined.</p>  <p>  Apart from this apparent conflict with the GDPR, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that section 30 gives rise to difficulties under Article 38.1 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 38.1 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In order for a domestic offence provision to comply with Article 38.1, it must be clear, precise and foreseeable in its application.  It is not clear under section 30 what might constitute the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes micro-targeting.  It is also a requirement under Article 7 of the Convention that offence provisions must be sufficiently clear and precise so as to enable individuals to ascertain which conduct constitutes a criminal offence and to foresee the consequences of engaging in such conduct.</p></reply>

While that regional competition has now ended, my Department is currently finalising the results of a similar process for the Borders Region. Upon completion of that process, all regions of the state will have been covered by tender competitions within the last two years.</p><p>All properties selected under the tender process must be able to meet the requirements of the National Standards for accommodation centres.  The Standards were published in August 2019 and developed through an Advisory Group including representatives from UNHCR Ireland and the NGO sector.  The Standards will come into force in January 2021 and address a range of themes including accommodation; food and catering; individual, community and family life; health and wellbeing; governance; and meeting the special reception needs of applicants.  The Standards will ensure that all new accommodation coming on stream must be able to meet the requirements for independent living by the provision of self-catering facilities for residents including a food hall and the availability of separate family spaces outside of bedrooms. </p><p>Last year, Dr. Catherine Day was asked to bring together an expert group with representation from asylum seekers and NGOs to examine best practice in the provision of services to international protection applicants, to examine likely longer term trends and to set out recommendations and solutions. Any new system for the provision of accommodation and additional supports to international protection applicants will be informed by the Report of this Expert Group, which was presented to me and Minister Roderic O'Gorman T.D, on 23 September 2020.  The report will be presented to Government very shortly and I expect that it will be published thereafter.</p><p>It is the Government's intention to publish a White Paper by the end of this year, informed by the recommendations of the Expert Group, which will set out how a replacement to the Direct Provision system will be structured and the steps to achieving it. It will be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration, to progress the matter following the transfer of this function to his Department.</p></reply>

For other offences, this is possible because the offence type has a specific code on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's PULSE system, which the Courts Service use for populating their own records.</p><p>I understand that there is no specific code on PULSE for theft of animals. The same code is used for all types of theft and it would require the checking of individual records within the Courts Service to separate out theft of animals from other types of theft.  Given the numbers of offences of theft every year, this is too onerous a task to narrow down over the period the Deputy has requested.</p></reply>

I very much appreciate the devastation which is caused to every family impacted upon by such tragic situations. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there are protocols in place for Garda members to respond to reports of a potential suicide.  HQ Directive 75/2014, the Hostage/Barricade/Suicide Incident Command Policy, sets out An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policy on the use of force and Garda negotiation/response/tactics in both planned and incidents that require a spontaneous response by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to manage hostage, barricade, and suicide incidents.</p>  <p>  The response by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to reports of potential suicide incidents are in line with this policy of containment and negotiation for a safe resolution. </p>  <p>  This policy sets out the process for declaring a &lsquo;Hostage/Barricade/Suicide&rsquo; incident.  When such an incident is declared, a trained &lsquo;Operational Commander&rsquo; is deployed to take command of the incident.  The Operational Commander will use all Garda resources available to him/her to assist the person whose life is in imminent danger.  </p>  <p>  The National Negotiation Unit and the Armed Support Unit (ASU) are routinely deployed to resolve incidents involving persons with suicidal intentions.  All members of the National Negotiation Unit have undertaken a Suicide Assist Course and some members attached to Special Tactics Operations Command (STOC) have undergone a two day mental health first aid course to assist with understanding and dealing with such situations.</p></reply>

To assist in addressing this demand, a new online system for the renewal of Registrations in the Dublin area was developed and launched on 20 July, enabling applicants to safely engage with the Registration Office without the need to attend in person at Burgh Quay.</p><p>All renewals in the Dublin area are being processed online only since 20 July 2020, at: .  Renewals outside of the Dublin area are processed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau through the Garda Station network.  Information is available at: </p><p>Since the launch of the new online renewal system, my Department has received over 30,000 applications.  The volume of applications, together with the reduced capacity of the Registration Office due to social distancing requirements, has resulted in longer than anticipated processing times.  The current expected processing time is 6 to 7 weeks from the date of receipt.  However, my officials have already completed approximately 14,000 of these cases.  </p><p>The Registration Office has also processed over 5,000 in-person first time registrations since reopening the Public Office in August 2020.  First time registrations require the taking of biometric information (fingerprints) so it is not possible to do these registrations online.  </p><p>My Department recognises the difficulties that delays may cause for applicants and it is providing additional resources to the Registration Office to increase its capacity to handle current demand.  Where an applicant urgently needs their passport for travel or other such reasons, they should email the Registration Office at and set out the circumstances involved.</p><p>On 18 September 2020, I announced a further temporary extension of immigration and international protection permissions to 20 January 2021.  This applies to permissions that are due to expire between 20 September 2020 and 20 January 2021.  Renewal is on the same basis as the existing permission and the same conditions will continue to apply.  The extension provides applicants with the necessary time to make arrangements with the Immigration Service in Dublin or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outside Dublin to ensure that registrations are renewed in the normal way by that date.  I encourage people to do so at the earliest opportunity and not to wait until January 2021.</p></reply>

Those details are comprised of the applicant&rsquo;s full name, their date of birth, their gender and their country of nationality.  The person will also be associated with the relevant immigration application they are applying under.  An applicant&rsquo;s place of birth will not generally be relevant to the consideration of their case.  Their country of nationality is the more relevant detail as regards their country of origin. </p>  <p>  As I previously said in response to Parliamentary Question 718 of 29 September 2020, the issue of whether or not a child was born in the State will be identifiable and can be duly considered when the individual immigration case is being substantively considered at decision-making stage.  At that point, any issues around a child&rsquo;s birth in the State, the degree to which they have integrated in the State, etc. will be given appropriate consideration before a final decision is made.</p>  <p>  My Department does hold records for minors who have been issued with a Deportation Order where that Order has been effected and the minor has left the State.  In all such cases, the minor would have left the State in the care of their parent/s or a legal guardian.</p></reply>

However, the Government recognises that some may find themselves in an undocumented position through no fault of their own. </p>  <p>  A policy paper on the matter is being drafted by my Department at the present time. This will include an assessment of international best practices. Previous regularisation schemes, like the 2018 Student Scheme, will also be considered in any future policy.

Section 3(3) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 provides that the Board shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions. </p>  <p>  However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and I am informed that the Board has recently found it necessary to vacate its existing premises in Finglas, Dublin 11, due to various health and safety issues.  The staff of the office have been temporarily re-located to a Board office in Dublin City Centre.  I am also informed that the Finglas Law Centre remains intact as an office within the Legal Aid Board management structure.  The Board is contacting all clients of Finglas Law Centre in writing to advise that there is no change to the solicitor dealing with their particular case, and providing new contact details for the Law Centre.</p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Legal Aid Board that it is committed to maintaining an office in the area of north Dublin city.  The Legal Aid Board has, for some time, sought an alternative premises in the vicinity of Finglas and nearby areas that is suited to the needs of its clients and its staff.  These efforts are continuing and I am assured by the Board that the law centre, and its staff, will return to north Dublin at the earliest possible opportunity when an appropriate premises has been obtained and fitted out. </p>  <p>  The Board is currently engaged with another public body with offices in north Dublin with a view to Legal Aid Board staff providing a temporary clinic from those offices at specific times, until the new law centre office is opened.  The Board hopes to finalise these arrangements shortly.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no responsibility for these matters.  I understand however that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, to ensure their optimum use. </p><p>The allocation and transfer of Garda Personnel is determined by a number of factors, including crime and non-crime workload, minimum establishment, population, area, policing arrangements, operational strategies and transfers applications, including welfare issues.  When allocations are taking place, comprehensive consultation is carried out with Local Management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.</p><p>The resources provided by Government to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have reached unprecedented levels, with an allocation for 2020 of &euro;1.88 billion. This level of investment is enabling sustained, ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff and as a result, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a growing organisation. There are now over 14,600 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 3,000 Garda staff.  Taken together, this increase in the number of Garda members and staff is delivering a significant growth in operational policing hours nationwide.  </p><p>I am advised by the Garda authorities that the resourcing of each Garda region and division is fully considered within the overall context of the needs and requirements of Garda regions throughout the country.  Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategies, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda Resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. </p><p>The following table, furnished to me by the Garda authorities, shows the ratio of total Garda&iacute; per population in all Divisions.  <table>    <tr>       <th><b> -</b></th>       <th><b>Garda Strength 31/08/2020</b></th>       <th><b>Ratio - 1 member per</b></th>       <th><b>Population CSO 2016 figures</b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>CAVAN/ MONAGHAN</b></td>       <td>389</td>       <td>354</td>       <td>137,562</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>CLARE</b></td>       <td>312</td>       <td>381</td>       <td>118,817</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>CORK  TOTAL (City, North, West)</b></td>       <td>1384</td>       <td>392</td>       <td>542,868</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>DMR Total (North, N   Central, South, S Central, East, West)</b></td>       <td>4059</td>       <td>332</td>       <td>1,347,359</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>DONEGAL</b></td>       <td>464</td>       <td>343</td>       <td>159,192</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>GALWAY </b></td>       <td>625</td>       <td>413</td>       <td>258,058</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>KERRY</b></td>       <td>351</td>       <td>421</td>       <td>147,707</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>KILDARE</b></td>       <td>418</td>       <td>532</td>       <td>222,504</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>KILKENNY/ CARLOW</b></td>       <td>344</td>       <td>454</td>       <td>156,164</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>LAOIS/ OFFALY</b></td>       <td>387</td>       <td>420</td>       <td>162,658</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>LIMERICK</b></td>       <td>599</td>       <td>325</td>       <td>194,899</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>LOUTH</b></td>       <td>389</td>       <td>331</td>       <td>128,884</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>MAYO</b></td>       <td>342</td>       <td>382</td>       <td>130,507</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>MEATH</b></td>       <td>336</td>       <td>580</td>       <td>195,044</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>ROSCOMMON/ LONGFORD</b></td>       <td>319</td>       <td>330</td>       <td>105,417</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>SLIGO/ LEITRIM</b></td>       <td>309</td>       <td>316</td>       <td>97,579</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>TIPPERARY</b></td>       <td>406</td>       <td>393</td>       <td>159,553</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>WATERFORD</b></td>       <td>373</td>       <td>311</td>       <td>116,176</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>WESTMEATH</b></td>       <td>275</td>       <td>323</td>       <td>88,770</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>WEXFORD</b></td>       <td>335</td>       <td>447</td>       <td>149,722</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>WICKLOW</b></td>       <td>315</td>       <td>452</td>       <td>142,425</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Total Operational   Divisions Strength</b></td>       <td><b>12731</b></td>       <td>374</td>       <td>4,761,865</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Headquarters, College &amp;amp;   National/Specialist units</b></td>       <td><b>1897</b></td>       <td>2510</td>       <td>4,761,865</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>TOTAL STRENGTH</b></td>       <td><b>14628</b></td>       <td>326</td>       <td>4,761,865</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Preventing children getting involved in criminality and diverting children away from it when they have already become involved is a key priority for me as Minister for Justice and the Programme for Government contains a number of commitments with regard to tackling anti-social behaviour.</p><p>I am informed that currently there are 105 Garda Youth Diversion Projects. The intention is to further develop this service so that it is available to every child in the State who could benefit from it, through an ongoing expansion of existing services and the foundation of new projects where necessary.</p><p>I am further informed that the projects are being developed to provide family support to the parents of young people participating in the projects, and are undertaking early intervention and preventative work. The role of the projects in relation to harder-to-engage young people is being enhanced and extended as part of the evolving Youth Justice system.  </p><p>The Department is supporting the ongoing development of practice in Garda Youth Diversion Projects through the Action Research Project led by the University of Limerick. The Action Research Project works directly with front-line Youth Justice Workers from local projects to develop interventions and best practice. Based on initial outcomes from the Action Research Project, and evaluations of a number of pilot projects, it is intended to develop proposals to expand the existing services. This would ensure national coverage and a stronger focus on difficult issues such as the hard-to-reach cohort. </p><p>These issues are addressed in the draft Youth Justice Strategy 2020-2026, which is due to be published in Q4 2020. </p><p>Details of the funding allocations sought for the Garda Youth Diversion Projects are set out in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Garda   Youth

This was conditional on the student completing their course online if this service was provided by their college and represented a short term and temporary measure, which has now ended. </p><p>From 1 October 2020, the standard criteria applies again. Students holding a valid immigration Stamp 2 permission are permitted work up to 40 hours per week only during the holiday months of June, July, August and September and from 15 December to 15 January inclusive. At all other times, students holding Stamp 2 permission are permitted to work up to 20 hours per week. There are no current plans to revise this policy<s>.</s></p><p>The extension of permissions I announced on 18 September 2020 applies to this group. It will ensure they will be able to remain lawfully in the State and be able to work up to 20 hours per week while awaiting their results.As soon as colleges issue examination results (which is understood to be later this month in most cases) this will enable graduate students to make an application for a 1G Stamp.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These services contribute to positive ageing and better overall health.  However, the introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work closely with providers and community staff to identify where service is most required and has been undertaking risk assessments of local services.  This is to ensure, insofar as possible, that Day Care services and respite services can resume in the context of COVID-19 and having regard for Public Health advice. </p>  <p>  Services will resume when it is safe to do so; when all infection prevention and control measures and the requirements of physical distancing can be maintained, so as to protect service users and staff and prevent any further spread of the virus. Some Day Centres may not be suitable for reopening due to the constraints of their physical environment and it will be necessary to continue or expand alternative service delivery models developed during recent months.  Some of the issues identified the HSE include;</p>  <p>  -  Day Care Centres operated in shared public facilities where other groups are also accessing the building and the risk of infection spread.</p>  <p>  -  A number of HSE Day Care Centres are attached to HSE Residential Care Units and the clients of both the Day Care Centres and the residents from the Residential Care Unit are in the same location and use shared facilities.</p>  <p>  -  Transport of clients to the Day Care Centres where family cannot assist. </p>  <p>  -  Availability of isolation areas, should a client or a member of staff become unwell.</p>  <p>  I understand the impact that the continued delay in the re-opening of day centres and the restoration of respite services is having on older people and the important role this service can play in their lives. I have asked the HSE to ensure that it continues to assess the risks and benefits of re-opening, as well as continuing to expand and explore alternative ways of delivering services to this vulnerable group. I am also continuing to meet with groups that work with and on behalf of older people to see how they can best be supported during this challenging time.</p></reply>

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission, and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The plan is framed to account for periods which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied.</p><p>Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. The Framework was informed by expert advice and recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET).</p><p><i>Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19</i>specifically deals with the events and exhibition sector and the government will continue to work with the sector to progress the development of agreed protocols to enable the hosting of trade events in the near future.  The Deputy may wish to note that my colleague Minister of State Robert Troy TD in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has met with sector representatives. </p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that the number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the plan is based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. It is not possible to say what circumstances will apply in the future due to the nature of the virus that has caused this global pandemic and the concerns that remain about the very serious threats to health that can be caused by Covid-19. The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These services contribute to positive ageing and better overall health.  However, the introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work closely with providers and community staff to identify where service is most required and has been undertaking risk assessments of local services.  This is to ensure, insofar as possible, that Day Care services and respite services can resume in the context of COVID-19 and having regard for Public Health advice. </p>  <p>  Services will resume when it is safe to do so; when all infection prevention and control measures and the requirements of physical distancing can be maintained, so as to protect service users and staff and prevent any further spread of the virus. Some Day Centres may not be suitable for reopening due to the constraints of their physical environment and it will be necessary to continue or expand alternative service delivery models developed during recent months. However, I am aware of examples where respite can be provided in exceptional circumstances, according to clinical need.</p>  <p>  I understand the impact that the continued delay in the re-opening of day centres and the restoration of respite services is having on older people and the important role this service can play in their lives. I have asked the HSE to ensure that it continues to assess the risks and benefits of re-opening, as well as continuing to expand and explore alternative ways of delivering services to this vulnerable group. I am also continuing to meet with groups that work with and on behalf of older people to see how they can best be supported during this challenging time.</p></reply>

It will build on the HSE's continual enhancement of existing service-provision and on emerging good practice across the current system of health and social care delivery as well as supporting family and unpaid carers.</p>  <p>  The national roll-out of interRAI as the single assessment tool will be integral to the new scheme, underpinning the provision of one streamlined process for responding to the evolving care-needs of the individual, from entry-level home-support through to intensive care in a residential setting.

This Plan provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. </p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical. It acknowledges that sports, arts and other social activities are central to our well-being and that sports and arts are also the world of work for our many in our communities.  </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-10-06a.1745.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020100600110#WRRR01600"><p>I understand that complications from a mesh implant are very distressing and painful for those involved. Ensuring that all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, multi-disciplinary and patient-centred care is a priority for me and my Department. I would assure the Deputy that considerable work has been done to date in this country and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants as set out below. </p><p>I am aware that in response to concerns raised in Ireland regarding complications associated with the use of mesh devices in late 2017, the then Minister for Health requested the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) to prepare a report on the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures. The report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery. </p><p>In July 2018, in advance of publication of the full report, the CMO requested the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This pause was instigated pending implementation of initial recommendations regarding (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals. </p><p>The CMO report, published in November 2018, made a number of recommendations, the implementation of which will provide significant assurance that both women presenting for treatment and who develop mesh-related complications, receive high quality, multi-disciplinary patient centred care in accordance with the evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms.The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019. The HSE&rsquo;s National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) is progressing treatment pathways and referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications.  The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information regarding the pathways for women suffering complications. This can be found on the HSE website. </p><p>A multidisciplinary National Specialist Centre is being developed over 2 sites at Cork University Maternity Hospital (CUMH) and the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) Dublin.  In addition, two translabial scanners, were procured by the HSE in late 2019, and are now onsite in both hospitals.  However, the first scanning clinic, which was due to take place last March had to be postponed, due to the pandemic.  </p><p>The pathways for women experiencing mesh complications, established by the HSE, have been in place for over a year.  All appointments offered to women through these pathways have been to the public system.  I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.  </p><p>To address the question of medical cards, under the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is primarily based on residence and means.  The Act does not provide for an automatic entitlement to a medical card based on having a particular disease or illness.  The HSE's Expert Group on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility previously examined the issue of awarding medical cards and concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.  </p><p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines. The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. Furthermore, if the HSE is made aware that persons have particular requirements, assistance will be afforded to help that person to complete their application. This assistance can be availed of through a person's local health office.</p></reply>

These services contribute to positive ageing and better overall health.  However, the introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work closely with providers and community staff to identify where service is most required and has been undertaking risk assessments of local services.  This is to ensure, insofar as possible, that Day Care services and respite services can resume in the context of COVID-19 and having regard for Public Health advice. </p>  <p>  Services will resume when it is safe to do so; when all infection prevention and control measures and the requirements of physical distancing can be maintained, so as to protect service users and staff and prevent any further spread of the virus. Some day centres may not be suitable for reopening due to the constraints of their physical environment and it will be necessary to continue or expand alternative service delivery models developed during recent months.  Issues identified by the HSE include</p>  <p>  -  Day Care Centres operated in shared public facilities where other groups are also accessing the building and the risk of infection spread.</p>  <p>  -  A number of HSE Day Care Centres are attached to HSE Residential Care Units and the clients of both the Day Care Centres and the residents from the Residential Care Unit are in the same location and use shared facilities.</p>  <p>  -  Transport of clients to the Day Care Centres where family cannot assist. </p>  <p>  -  Availability of isolation areas, should a client or a member of staff become unwell.</p>  <p>  I understand the impact that the continued delay in the re-opening of day centres and the restoration of respite services is having on older people and the important role this service can play in their lives. I have asked the HSE to ensure that it continues to assess the risks and benefits of re-opening, as well as continuing to expand and explore alternative ways of delivering services to this vulnerable group. I am also continuing to meet with groups that work with and on behalf of older people to see how they can best be supported during this challenging time.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The HSE has also ordered 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine, which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and will be made available to children aged from 2 to 12 years.</p>  <p>  The HSE is confident that the number of doses procured is sufficient to meet demand in the at-risk groups and this element of the vaccination programme has commenced.  The vaccination programme for children is expected to commence from mid-October. </p>  <p>  Those not covered by the publicly funded influenza vaccination programme can avail of influenza vaccination from GPs and pharmacists on a private basis.

While the nature and scale of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented, the collection of timely and comprehensive data has been instrumental in developing the health service response to Covid-19 and to the advice provided by NPHET and the Department of Health to assist Government decision-making in the wider response to the disease in Ireland. </p><p>It should be noted that in Ireland, data are collected on COVID-19 related mortality for both lab confirmed and probable cases, in line with recommendations from the World Health Organisation and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in both hospitals and the community. It should also be noted that collection of COVID-19 related mortality data in Ireland exceeds that of many other countries in the world  <i>.</i></p><p>The Deputy should note that comprehensive national statistics, information, and data about Covid-19 is published on a daily basis on the Department of Health website at www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-health/ and on the Covid-19 Data Hub and Dashboards available at .

Ireland has the highest acute bed occupancy in Europe at 93% and one of the lowest levels of critical care beds per 1,000 of the population in Europe at 3.3. </p><p>Given these capacity constraints in the acute hospital system a major focus from the onset of Covid-19 has been on increasing capacity to cope with the surge in demand that could arise from Covid-19 outbreaks. The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country. </p><p>In the context of the current COVID-19 Pandemic response since March:</p><p>-  The number of critical care beds has increased by 42 since the start of the year to 297  </p><p>-  Noncritical care bed capacity has increased by 324 to 11,597.</p><p>In addition as part of the initial emergency response Increased bed capacity provided by the private hospital sector amounted to 1,900 inpatient beds, 600-day beds as well as 47 ICU and 54 HDU beds. </p><p>To date the Government&rsquo;s measures have been successful in flattening the curve and the additional capacity put in place has allowed the system to cope within the current response requirements.</p></reply>

Registered providers must provide appropriate medical and health care, including a high standard of evidence-based nursing care in accordance with professional guidelines.  In addition all nursing homes are required to have an accessible and effective complaints procedure, including an appeals process. They must investigate all complaints promptly, and following investigation put in place any measures required for improvement.  </p>  <p>  Since 2009 the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the statutory independent regulator in place for the nursing home sector, whether a HSE managed or a private nursing home. The Authority, established under the Health Act 2007, has significant and wide-ranging powers up to and including withdrawing the registration of a nursing home facility, which means that it can no longer operate as a service provider. This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising of Registration Regulations, Care and Welfare Regulations and National Quality Standards. </p>  <p>  During the response to COVID-19 nursing homes continue to be regulated by HIQA. HIQA, in discharging its duties determines, through examination of all information available to it, including site inspections, whether a nursing home meets the regulations in order to achieve and maintain its registration status.  Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.  HIQA welcomes information about designated centres for dependent persons, reviews all information about services received and evaluates it against the regulations and standards.  As a regulator HIQA has no formal legal role in examining individual complaints, however, the Authority does take into account all information it receives, including complaints from the public, when carrying out inspections.  If a concern is raised about a nursing home, HIQA reviews all information received to inform its on-going risk-based regulation activities.</p>  <p>  On 19 August 2020, both Minister Donnelly and I launched the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel Report.  This is a significant piece of work which provides a range of recommendations in line with lessons learned to date and international best practice, aimed to safeguard the residents in nursing homes over the next 12-18 months and into the longer term. The report is also informative in identifying areas of older persons&rsquo; service and care delivery requiring consideration for further reform. Many of these themes are reflected in the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  Implementing the Report&rsquo;s short-term recommendations will ensure the ongoing protection of nursing home residents, the preparedness of the nursing homes sector and the health system in response to COVID-19 and the winter ahead. This will involve building on emerging good practice.</p>  <p>  In relation to the payment aspect of the request I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments.

Scheduled care activity was significantly impacted by the necessary decision to defer most elective care appointments and procedures in March, April, and May. The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, and the National Treatment Purchase Fund has recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The monitoring of scheduled care activity and waiting list figures is a key function of the Department of Health. Weekly meetings between Departmental officials, the NTPF and HSE ensure that governance and performance issues are continually monitored. This includes weekly analysis of commissioning activity undertaken by the NTPF, associated HSE insourcing activity, and the review of any issues raised by either the HSE and NTPF in respect of waiting list management and scheduled care activity.</p>  <p>  As part of the governance arrangements for the management of NTPF funded outsourced patient treatment, public patients remain on the waiting list of the referring hospital until treatment is completed through the NTPF and the patient is discharged. As a result, in relation to the particular query raised, I have asked the Health Service Executive to raise the issue and respond to the Deputy directly.</p>  <p>  In terms of accessing treatment under the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the NTPF works with public hospitals to offer and provide the funding for treatment to clinically suitable long waiting patients who are on an inpatient/day case waiting list for surgery, having been referred on to such a list following clinical assessment by a consultant/specialist at an outpatient clinic. The key criteria of the NTPF is the prioritisation of the longest waiting patients first. While the NTPF identifies patients eligible for NTPF treatment, it is solely on the basis of their time spent on the Inpatient/Daycase Waiting List. The clinical suitability of the patient to avail of NTPF funded treatment is determined by the public hospital. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The HSE is actively engaged in implementing effective policy levers across a number of domains and under several initiatives, including programmes under the Acute Hospitals Drugs Management Programme (AHDMP), the Medicines Management Programme (MMP), and within the Primary Care Eligibility &amp;amp; Reimbursement Service (PCERS).</p><p>  Our commitment to generic medicines was demonstrated in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 whereby the Act provided for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. The Act permits pharmacists to substitute medicines prescribed, provided they have been designated as safely interchangeable by the Health Products Regulatory Authority. Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in this group, regardless of the individual medicines&rsquo; price.</p><p>In terms of biosimilar medicines, the HSE's Acute Hospitals Drugs Management Programme (AHDMP) has a biosimilar strategy in place since 2017. This is making considerable progress using a collaborative to bring about changes in prescribing practice.</p><p>  In addition, the HSE Medicines Management Programme completed an evaluation process in 2019 for the identification of the best-value biological (BVB) medicines for TNF-α inhibitors under the High-Tech Drug arrangements.</p><p>  In June 2019, the HSE introduced a system of gain-share to encourage the prescribing of the BVB medicines which has been largely successful in increasing uptake of these medicines. As of September 2020, at least &euro;42.5m of biosimilar savings are expected to be delivered in 2020.</p><p>In relation to your specific data requests, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly as they have responsibility for this area.</p></reply>

In drafting our national guidance, Irish stakeholders including Government Departments and the HSE Health Protection Surveillance Centre, are informed by the international scientific evidence, and guidance produced by international bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). WHO and ECDC guidance is formulated in the context of considered appraisal of the international experience and accumulating scientific evidence in relation to COVID-19. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reviews international developments as a component of its overall examination of the evolving epidemiology of the disease. </p>  <p>  The aim of face coverings is to reduce the spread of infection by acting as a source control to stop the spread of infection by the person wearing the mask (including those who do not know they are infected, such as those with no symptoms) or to protect the wearer from droplet splashes or inhaling airborne contaminants including small (aerosol) and large particle droplets. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of face coverings by persons in various community settings has been recommended by an increasing number of countries. In Ireland, cloth face coverings are currently mandatory on public transport and in a range of indoor settings, including shops and other retail outlets. Additionally, cloth face coverings are recommended in situations where physical distancing may not be possible. In both the primary and post-primary setting, it is a requirement that staff wear a face covering when a physical distance of 2m from other staff or students cannot be maintained. Children in the post-primary setting should also wear a face covering when a physical distance of 2m from other staff or students cannot be maintained. It is not recommended that children attending primary school wear face-coverings. The requirements in relation to use of face coverings in schools are clearly outlined in the sectoral guidance available on the &lsquo;Back to School&rsquo; webpage at gov.ie. </p>  <p>  The WHO in their Guidance on the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 advise that the general public should be encouraged to use medical and non-medical masks in public settings, including schools. This advice can be found at  www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak</p>  <p>  The ECDC advise that &ldquo;in secondary schools, the use of face masks is recommended for both students and adults&rdquo; and that &ldquo;The use of masks should be seen as a complementary measure, rather than a single measure to prevent transmission within schools&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has also issued Interim Guidance on Use of Face-coverings in childcare and educational settings to provide advice for childcare and educational facilities regarding the use of face-coverings for staff and children in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This Guidance can be found at www.gov.ie/en/publication/532b6-health-advice-provided-by-the-health-protection-surveillance-centre-hpsc-for-the-safe-reopening-of-schools-and-educational-facilities/.</p></reply>

A key objective in the strategy is to attain better health and social outcomes for people who experience harm from substance misuse and meet their recovery and rehabilitation needs. </p><p>The HSE has developed a four tier person-centre model of rehabilitation based on the principle of a continuum of care, that allow the individual to access the range of supports they need to achieve their personal recovery goals. This integrated care pathway is the shared responsibility of a range of service providers.</p><p>Improving access to drug and alcohol services and extending the range of options available is integrate to achieving better outcomes. The strategy contains 15 actions which aim to reduce waiting times, provide more equity of access to services around the country and remove potential barriers to accessing treatment by those with complex needs. </p><p>The Department of Health provides over &euro;130 million in funding to support the provision of drug and alcohol services by the HSE, voluntary drug and alcohol services and drug and alcohol task forces.</p><p>In 2019, there were 10,664 cases treated for problem drug use, of which a third were new cases, and a further 7,546 cases treated for problem alcohol use, of which 44 per cent were new cases. </p><p>Additional funding of &euro;800,000 was provided to expand drug and alcohol services in 2020.  This funding supports the expansion of addiction services for pregnant and post-natal women,  the development of a community alcohol service in Galway and the provision of a residential treatment service for women and children in the mid-west region, among other measures. The full year costs for these additional services is over &euro;2.1 million. </p><p>Covid-19 posed a major threat for people with drug addiction, especially for those who were homeless and those not in treatment. To address this risk, the HSE significantly improved access to opioid substitution treatment (OST) since January 2020. As a result, an additional 755 people were brought into treatment, an increase of 7 per cent.</p><p>In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I want to ensure that improved access to OST is mainstreamed within the health services.  The allocation of additional resources for this and other drug and alcohol treatment services will be considered as part of the Estimates process.</p></reply>

Minister Butler (with responsibility for mental health and older people) recently met with Traveller and Roma representatives.  Further discussions have also taken place between officials at the Department of Health and Traveller representatives regarding how the specific needs of the Traveller community will be met during the implementation of Sharing the Vision.  It is envisaged that Traveller and Roma representation will engage in a significant way with Sharing the Vision&rsquo;s National Implementation and Monitoring Committee to ensure that the implementation of &lsquo;Sharing the Vision&rsquo; will maximise beneficial outcomes for Travellers and Roma.</p><p>Government policy strategy for improving the lives of Traveller and Roma communities is outlined in the <i>National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy</i>. The strategy is a cross-departmental initiative and contains a set of specific actions aimed at improving the situation for Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland. The Strategy includes 10 actions relating to mental health and suicide among Travellers. There is also an action under NTRIS to implement a detailed action plan to address the specific health needs of Travellers, using a social determinants approach.</p><p>It is envisaged that the mental health actions in NTRIS will be incorporated in the Traveller health action plan and will be aligned with the overall approach in Sharing the Vision. This will allow for an integrated and coordinated response to the specific health needs of Travellers, as outlined in NTRIS.</p><p>Minister Butler is fully committed to providing the leadership and resources to improving mental health outcomes for Travellers and Roma, as part of an holistic response to the health needs of these social excluded groups.</p></reply>

The reporting of performance and outcome indicators is designed to enable policy makers and service providers to improve the quality of health service provision. Indicators are presented to allow for comparisons between regions, nationally, internationally and over time.</p>  <p>  The NHRQS annual report is published by the Department of Health. Five reports have been published to date and the reports have evolved over time, including additional indicators as datasets within the Irish health service mature and become available.  </p>  <p>  The NHQRS and its governance structure is based in the National Patient Safety Office (NPSO) in the Department for Health. In 2016, a multi-agency committee was re-established to provide oversight and advice on the strategic direction of the NHQRS; to agree the selected indicators in line with international trends and health policy in Ireland; to agree definitions and metadata for the indicators; and to prepare and present an annual report to the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  To safeguard the integrity and validity of the NHQRS, the committee agreed a procedure for the selection of new indicators for inclusion in the report. In addition, a transparent annual screening exercise facilitates consideration of those indicators to be retained or de-selected in future editions of the NHQRS. This exercise is designed to ensure the validity, timeliness and accuracy of indicator data and allow for the identification of gaps to ensure that the NHQRS reflects developments in our health system over time. In addition, each year all indicators are evaluated for the quality of the data available. This evaluation process is informed by HIQA's Guidance on a data quality framework for health and social care.</p>  <p>  NHQRS indicators are generally high-level measurements relating to healthcare system performance, which can provide information on population health overall rather than on specific outcomes for individual patients. The NHQRS does not currently, as the Deputy noted, report on adverse outcomes specific to medication used in the provision of termination of pregnancy services. The inclusion of any new indicator is considered by the multi-agency committee using a standardised process which examines the evidence regarding international trends, health policy in Ireland and availability of robust data.</p></reply>

Subsequently, the HSE engaged in commercial negotiations concerning axicabtagene ciloleucel with the applicant.  </p>  <p>  The Drugs Group is the national committee which the HSE has in place to make recommendations on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines. The membership of the HSE Drugs Group includes public interest members. In October 2020, these three indications are expected to be included on the agenda of the next HSE Drugs Group meeting.</p>  <p>  The decision-making authority in the HSE is the HSE Executive Management Team (EMT). These three indications remain under consideration with the HSE, in line with the 2013 Health Act.</p>  <p>  CAR-T is a novel treatment for patients with cancer. It is a patient-specific, individualised cell therapy that consists of genetically modifying the patient&rsquo;s own T lymphocytes. Both CAR-T therapies described above were licensed as medicines by the EU in 2018. Although licensed as medicines by the EMA, there are technical processes required to support the use of CAR-T therapy which are more multifaceted than standard drug administration. These involve a complex supply chain, laboratory accreditation and other specific supports to be in place in addition to the drug reimbursement approval. As a result, CAR-T can only be carried out at designated, accredited centres which have been assessed and accredited from a quality control and a process management perspective. The designated site would not manufacture the CAR-T, which is a separate process that occurs off-site.</p>  <p>  The NCCP have designated the National Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT) unit at St James&rsquo;s Hospital (SJH) and the Haemopoetic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) unit at Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland (CHI) Crumlin as the initial sites to develop/deliver this service for adult and paediatric patients on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The companies providing the licensed CAR-T products require hospitals to be technically ready to provide these products through an established CAR-T service. Each of the designated hospitals has completed a gap analysis, considering these technical readiness requirements and the service requirements and have identified areas where investment is required.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

These services contribute to positive ageing and better overall health.  However, the introduction of physical distancing, isolation and restricted contact with family and loved ones has changed the usual dynamic of social interaction. </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to work closely with providers and community staff to identify where service is most required and has been undertaking risk assessments of local services.  This is to ensure, insofar as possible, that Day Care services and respite services can resume in the context of COVID-19 and having regard for Public Health advice. </p>  <p>  Services will resume when it is safe to do so; when all infection prevention and control measures and the requirements of physical distancing can be maintained, so as to protect service users and staff and prevent any further spread of the virus. Some Day Centres may not be suitable for reopening due to the constraints of their physical environment and it will be necessary to continue or expand alternative service delivery models developed during recent months.  Some of the issues identified by the HSE include;</p>  <p>  -  Day Care Centres operated in shared public facilities where other groups are also accessing the building and the risk of infection spread.</p>  <p>  -  A number of HSE Day Care Centres are attached to HSE Residential Care Units and the clients of both the Day Care Centres and the residents from the Residential Care Unit are in the same location and use shared facilities.</p>  <p>  -  Transport of clients to the Day Care Centres where family cannot assist. </p>  <p>  -  Availability of isolation areas, should a client or a member of staff become unwell.</p>  <p>  I understand the impact that the continued delay in the re-opening of day centres and the restoration of respite services is having on older people and the important role this service can play in their lives. I have asked the HSE to ensure that it continues to assess the risks and benefits of re-opening, as well as continuing to expand and explore alternative ways of delivering services to this vulnerable group. I am also continuing to meet with groups that work with and on behalf of older people to see how they can best be supported during this challenging time.</p></reply>

Under the General Medical Services (GMS) contract, GPs are reimbursed for a range of services they provide to medical card and GP visit card holders. GPs are remunerated for these services primarily on a capitation basis, with a range of additional support payments and fees for specific items of service.  Capitation payments provide certainty for GPs and for the state in relation to funding, and present a less burdensome administrative load on GPs and on the HSE than systems requiring claims for each individual service provided.</p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to change how GPs are remunerated. However, the 2019 GP Agreement on GP contractual reform and service developments includes a commitment to undertake a strategic review of GP services within the lifetime of the Agreement; to examine how best to ensure the provision of GP services in Ireland for the future. The outcome of this review will inform future contractual changes, including the possibility of changes to the method of GP remuneration. Preparatory work for the review is beginning this year.</p></reply>

I am particularly conscious of the enormous impact of recent Level 3 measures on the hospitality sector, including in relation to potential losses relating to perishable goods when the measures come into effect. In making its decisions, Government is conscious of the need to balance advice from NPHET with broader societal and economic considerations.</p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy is aware, the NPHET makes recommendations to Government on the basis of the prevailing epidemiological situation and this has been shown to change rapidly. The very nature of this virus does mean that quick and decisive action can need to be taken to break chains of transmission and to prevent the situation deteriorating further. These actions are taken to reduce the risk to public health and to protect the most vulnerable. We have seen during the first wave and again more recently that the growth rate of this disease, if mitigating actions aren't taken, is exponential so it important that actions are taken when needed in a timely manner.</p></reply>

This Regulation is binding in full and has direct effect on all Member States. </p><p>Two issues have now arisen</p><p>1. The new requirement under EU Law for a veterinary prescription to be issued before antiparasitic products can be dispensed and</p><p>2. The question as to whether Ireland can avail of a derogation in the Regulation which permits professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions </p><p>In relation to the first issue, since 2004 European legislation established a requirement that all veterinary medicinal products that are intended for use in food-producing animals should be subject to a veterinary prescription.  However, a 2006 EU Directive allowed for the maintenance of non-prescription status for certain veterinary medicinal products which did not present a risk to human or animal health or to the environment. Ireland availed of the exemption in Directive 2006/130/EC at the time and antiparasitics were allowed to continue to be available without prescription.</p><p>There is a similar exemption available under the new EU Regulation 2019/6. However, since that time, our knowledge regarding the impact of extensive use of antiparasitics has changed. In 2019, the Health Product Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s (HPRA) Advisory Committee for Veterinary Medicines (ACVM) established a Task Force to review the method of supply of antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products that are intended for food-producing animals against the criteria set out in Regulation 2019/6.  A copy of the Report is available on the HPRA&rsquo;s website .</p><p>The Report states that the available scientific evidence shows that antiparasitic veterinary medicines that are intended for use in food-producing species do not comply with the criteria for derogation from veterinary prescription specified in EU Regulation 2019/6. Therefore, antiparasitic veterinary medicines must require a veterinary prescription before they can be dispensed from January 2022. Ireland has no national discretion on this issue.</p><p>On the second issue, there is a separate derogation in the Regulation, which allows professionals other than veterinarians to issue veterinary prescriptions, in limited circumstances, but only if this was provided for in a Member State's national legislation prior to Regulation 2019/6 coming into force in January 2019.</p><p>Ireland's national legislation has never permitted anyone other than a veterinarian to issue a veterinary prescription. Therefore, Ireland has no national discretion to now provide for a regime which would permit Responsible Persons in Licensed Merchants or pharmacists to dispense antiparasitic veterinary medicines without a veterinary prescription issued by a veterinarian.</p><p>Prior to January 2019, UK national legislation did provide for persons other than veterinarians (known as Suitably Qualified Persons) to issue veterinary prescriptions. Therefore Suitably Qualified Persons (SQPs) in Northern Ireland will be permitted under EU law to continue issuing veterinary prescriptions for antiparasitic veterinary medicinal products after January 2022. SQPs in Northern Ireland are not permitted to issue prescriptions to anyone from outside Northern Ireland.</p><p>In Ireland it is only legal to buy and use veterinary medicinal products obtained from suppliers who are licensed in accordance with national legislation. To do otherwise and to use unauthorised medicines in Ireland is a contravention to EU and Irish legislation and offending parties are subject to prosecution.</p><p>Across every economic activity, there are different laws and regulations that apply in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Authorities on both side of the border work in a cooperative manner to ensure national laws are respected.</p><p>I recognise these legislative changes will result in challenges for all impacted stakeholders. In recognition of this, my Department has established an Antiparasitic Resistance Stakeholder Group chaired by the Chief Veterinary Officer. Two meetings have been held to date and a programme of work containing over 30 antiparasitic related projects is currently underway. This group will examine all the issues related to the changed route of supply with two principal objectives:</p><p>- Protecting the efficacy of antiparasitics which are critical to the Irish pasture-based production model.</p><p>- Establishing a regulatory system that is pragmatic, retains a substantive role for existing stakeholders and delivers value for money for farmers</p><p>My Department is fully committed to working with all stakeholders in considering how best to implement the new EU Regulations on veterinary medicinal products. There is a dedicated email address allowing communications on the new Regulation: .</p></reply>

In the past 12 months, 20,993 cattle have been slaughtered as reactors under the TB eradication programme, as they are deemed to be infected with the TB disease agent. The test specificity is estimated at 99.98%, meaning the number of false positives to the skin test is estimated at 1 animal in 5,000 tested.</p><p>Visual inspection of reactor carcases at post-mortem finds that, on average, approximately 30% of such reactors have visible lesions of tuberculosis, meaning the infection has progressed to a stage where the disease process has caused such significant tissue damage that it can be seen with the naked eye. If a reactor does not have visible disease lesions, it does not mean it is not infected; visual inspection cannot detect the presence of microscopic lesions and bacteria within the tissues of such animals. </p><p>Separately from the slaughter of TB reactors, all non-Tb reactor cattle routinely slaughtered in Ireland are subjected to a post-mortem veterinary inspection which includes surveillance for lesions suspected to be caused by TB. Each year, approximately 3,600 such suspect lesions are identified and of these, approximately 45% are subsequently found by laboratory testing to have been caused by TB. The herds from which those animals came are then subjected to follow-up testing to identify any other undetected infected cattle.  </p><p>At Post Mortem following slaughter, the handling of any bovine found to have TB is prescribed in EU and is followed in all Food Businesses. The procedure is that all meat from animals in which post-mortem inspection has revealed localised lesions, similar to tuberculoid lesions, in a number of organs or a number of areas of the carcase, are declared unfit for human consumption.  However, where a tuberculoid lesion has been found in the lymph nodes of only one organ or part of the carcase, only the affected organ or part of the carcase and the associated lymph nodes are declared unfit for human consumption.</p></reply>

Forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services which include carbon sequestration and storage. Irish forests are a net sink for CO2 and make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions each year.</p>  <p>  Approximately every 5 years, my Department carry out a detailed national forest inventory which collects a wide range of data which is used to estimate and model the carbon stocks in Irish forests. It is estimated based on data collected that these forests removed on average 3.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year from the atmosphere over the period 2007 to 2016. DAFM also estimate that the total carbon stock in Irish forests is approximately 312 million tonnes which includes the carbon stored in trees, soils, leaf litter, deadwood and roots. It is important to note that carbon stocks are dynamic and change as the forests matures, when new forests are planted and when trees are harvested. DAFM are currently carrying out the 4th national forest inventory and data collection will be completed in 2021. These national forest inventories are important as it provides data on a wide range of parameters which includes species composition, carbon stocks, including information on the health and vitality of the forest estate.</p>  <p>  Forests are excellent at sequestering carbon dioxide however depending on the species some trees will remove carbon at different rates. Broadleaves and conifers sequester roughly the same carbon dioxide; the maximum value is approximately 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare but this is achieved in 75 years for spruce, compared to 180 years for oak.  However, carbon sequestration does vary from year to year depending on  management and soil type.</p></reply>

The Harbour was last dredged in the early 1980&rsquo;s.  A number of investigative and preparatory works and initiatives have been undertaken over the last few years in respect of a potential dredging project in Howth FHC. </p>  <p>  A final site investigation report was received in October 2016 and has been assessed by my Department's Engineers. This report included vital information on the nature and amount of the material to be dredged. The Department also appointed Consulting Engineers in 2016 to advise on a number of possible developments in Howth, including a dredging project. A final report was issued from the Consulting Engineers in late October 2017 which confirmed that the concentrations of contaminants in the sediment to be dredged are such that while the material cannot be considered inert, it can be classified as non-hazardous. This means that dumping at sea will not be permitted, which in turn has a significant effect on the project cost. </p>  <p>  Department Engineers subsequently met with Fingal County Council, to review possible operational and permitting requirements. Engagement with the Council is ongoing in regard to exploring disposal options for the dredged material. It is my Department&rsquo;s view that an option to re-use the dredged material to the west of the West Pier as part of the methodology for the project is the most effective and efficient option. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that circa 225,000 cubic metres of silt will need to be removed from the harbour in the event that a full harbour dredge is undertaken and, for illustration purposes, this is equated to an estimated 20,000-30,000 possible truck movements. It is also the position that if the option to re-use the material is not possible, the potential costs of the project increase significantly and the overall scope of the project would have to be re-examined.</p>  <p>  The project itself will require Planning Permission, an Environmental Impact Statement and a Waste License which are being progressed. The permitting process is likely to take up to 24 months. A variety of factors will impact on the cost of a potential dredging project, including the disposal options, overall scale of the project, and market factors. </p>  <p>The Department went to tender on the 3rd of October 2018 for a Consulting Engineering practice to bring the project through the planning, environmental permitting and design phase, and should a decision be made to progress the project, this consultant will also be responsible for the supervision of onsite works. The successful tender was commissioned for these works on the 19th of December 2018.</p>  <p>  Site investigation works are being undertaken, as are technical and environmental impact assessments; however the COVID19 pandemic has had a significant effect on the ability to complete the research and investigation works. These works are required as part of an overall planning application submission.</p>  <p>  Overall our Capital Programme in 2020 has been affected by both the COVID19 pandemic and other contractual issues and I am now taking time to assess the implications of these issues going forward before making further commitments.</p>  <p>  As is the case with all developments in the six Fishery Harbour Centres, any future decision with regard to initiating a full dredging project in Howth FHC will only be considered on the basis of available exchequer funding and competing national priorities.</p></reply>

The Scheme is targeted towards businesses which have experienced an adverse impact of minimum 15% in actual or projected turnover or profit due to the impact of COVID 19 and have difficulties in accessing credit.</p>  <p>  The CCGS will provide an 80% State-backed guarantee on bank lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years, i.e. the State will take 80% of the losses incurred on defaults. The CGS will be administered for the State by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) and SMEs will be able to go directly to the banks, and the guarantee can be used for a wide range of lending products between &euro;10,000 and &euro;1 million, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. It will be available to all SME sectors, including companies operating in the forest sector.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, as part of the Government&rsquo;s response to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Brexit Loan Scheme was repurposed as the &euro;250million Covid-19 Working Capital Loan Scheme, which is open to SMEs and mid-caps (i.e. up to 500 employees). An additional &euro;125 million (bringing the total to &euro;375 million) has been announced and is currently being put in place by SBCI.</p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Business Loan from Microfinance Ireland supports small businesses through the current challenges and protect job creation and sustainment in Ireland. Businesses that have experienced a reduction of 15% or more in turnover or profit, and is unable to secure finance from banks and commercial lending providers can access the MFI COVID-19 Business Loan. Loans can be used for working capital or changes required by the business to manage COVID19. Loans of between &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000 can be secured at an interest rate of 0% interest and zero repayments for the first six months.</p>  <p>  These supports are, of course, in additon to the employment subsidy supports available to all employers in Ireland.</p></reply>

However, landings are also reported by ICES rectangles - these are smaller sub-divisions of the sea area used for statistical analysis.  While reports by ICES rectangles are not official landing declarations, they can be used to provide a reasonable estimate of the EEZ from which these landings were caught.</p><p>Landings data by ICES rectangles are available for Irish vessels for the period 2003 onwards.  For other Member States, this information is not routinely available.  However, the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) has collated and published international landings data by ICES rectangles for the period 2011 to 2016.  A more recent dataset for the period 2015 to 2018 has also been made available however, due to GDPR concerns, the data is aggregated across all Member States, so it is not possible to provide a country-specific breakdown.</p><p>Based on the above data, the attached tables compiled by the Marine Institute set out the estimated weight (in tonnes of live weight) and approximate value (in millions of Euro) of landings from the Irish EEZ by Ireland and other Member States for the period 2011 to 2018.  The figures for 2019 and preliminary figures for 2020 (1 January to 4 October 2020) for Ireland are also included.</p><p><b>Table 1.

The Fund was intended to provide a targeted, once-off, cash injection for organisations and groups currently delivering critical front-line services to the most at need in our society and in danger of imminent closure due to lost fund-raised or traded income as a direct result of restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19. The criteria of the scheme stated that any grants awarded would be dependent on the need identified and organisations approved for funding were prioritised on that basis.</p><p>My Department received 1,060 applications during the application periods. To date, four tranches of successful applications have been announced, allocating funding of &euro;30,073,923 to 568 organisations. This funding is now supporting the delivery of many critical front line services in every part of the country. Though the fund is now closed to new applications, additional checks are continuing on a small number of applications and remaining outcomes will be communicated on an individual basis. </p><p>Lists of successful applicants are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie/en/publication/3957e-covid-19-stability-fund-successful-applicants/.</p><p>A full list of all allocations in tabular form is attached with the information requested by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The current programming period concludes in December 2020.  </p>  <p>  Proposals for new regulations for the CAP 2021-2027 were launched in June 2018 by the European Commission.  However, given the nature of the discussions on the CAP and on the wider EU Budget post-2020, there has been a delay in adopting these proposals.  This means that the next LEADER programme will not now commence until January 2022 at the earliest.</p>  <p>  Once there is agreement at European level regarding the regulations for the next CAP period, decisions will be taken in relation to the delivery of the next LEADER Programme having regard to, inter alia, the provisions of the EU Regulations governing the structure of future Local Action Groups and the outcome of consultations with all relevant stakeholder groups.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme.  My Department is currently examining the best approach to deliver on this commitment and I hope to be in a positon to make a decision on this matter shortly.</p></reply>

The first objective, as set out in the Programme for Government, is to prioritise a new State-led LEADER programme to bridge the gap between the current EU programme which finishes at the end of this year, and the commencement of a new EU-funded programme.  The commencement of the new EU programme has been impacted by the delay in finalising the EU budget for the period 2021-2027.</p>  <p>  Decisions on the delivery of the new LEADER programme will be have regard, inter alia, to the provisions of the EU Regulations governing the structure of future Local Action Groups and the outcome of consultations with all relevant stakeholder groups.</p></reply>
