The LFS is a sample survey and due to sample size limitations, it is not possible to produce reliable employment estimates at county level.

The number of new jobs created will, in general, be larger than this but they are offset in part by the number of jobs lost year-on-year. The LFS does not record whether a job is newly created.</p><p><b>Table 1 Number of employed persons (ILO) aged 15 years and over classified by NUTS 3 region, Q3 2017 and Q3 2018 - Annual change</b><table><tr><th>NUTS 3 region</th><th>Q3 2017</th><th>Q3 2018</th><th>Annual Change</th><th>Annual Change </th></tr><tr><td></td><td>'000</td><td>'000</td><td>'000</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Border</td><td>180.4</td><td>178.3</td><td>-2.2</td><td>-1.2</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>203.6</td><td>208.7</td><td>5.1</td><td>2.5</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>215.3</td><td>215.3</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>185.9</td><td>186.5</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.3</td></tr><tr><td>South-West</td><td>318.8</td><td>333.9</td><td>15.1</td><td>4.7</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>663.3</td><td>696.2</td><td>32.8</td><td>4.9</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>319.8</td><td>327.1</td><td>7.3</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>Midland</td><td>119.3</td><td>127.2</td><td>7.9</td><td>6.6</td></tr><tr><td>State</td><td>2,206.5</td><td>2,273.2</td><td>66.7</td><td>3.0</td></tr></table></p><p>Source: Labour Force Survey (LFS), Central Statistics Office, Ireland.</p><p>Data may be subject to future revision.</p><p>Data may be subject to sampling or other survey errors, which are greater in respect of smaller values or estimates of change.</p><p>Reference period: Q3 Jul-Sep.</p></reply>

This approach, which I approved, will allow a number of Local Authorities to develop and test different models which they feel are appropriate to a small number of selected towns of different sizes and in different locations.  The learnings from this approach will help to provide an indication as to what might work well for similar types of town on a wider scale.</p><p>Six rural towns were invited to participate in the initial pilot scheme.  They are:</p><p>1. Boyle, Co Roscommon</p><p>2. Callan, Co Kilkenny</p><p>3. Ballinrobe, Co Mayo</p><p>4. Banagher, Co Offaly</p><p>5. Castleblayney, Co Monaghan</p><p>6. Cappoquin, Co Waterford.</p><p>Each of these towns will receive funding of up to &euro;100,000 to engage with their communities and local businesses, and arrive at practical solutions that can be delivered to achieve the objective of increasing the number of people living in our rural towns.</p><p>Representatives from each of the six Local Authorities involved in the pilot recently met with my Department to begin the process of developing the detailed schemes.  It is envisaged that the solutions identified through the six pilot towns will lead to the development of more proposals for funding from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund in due course.</p></reply>

The CLAR measure has provided &euro;1.4 million in funding for organisations that provide:</p><p>- Wheelchair accessible transport to assist those attending medical appointments or respite services.</p><p>- Transport to and from designated cancer treatment hospitals and centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.</p><p>This CLAR measure has provided funding for 2 groups based in Galway. FORUM Connemara received almost &euro;54,000 in funding for a 15 seater wheelchair accessible vehicle and Cancer Care West received &euro;100,000 in funding for a 25 seater accessible bus. </p><p>Addressing this need through the CLAR measure has allowed me to use the voted Dormant Accounts moneys within the Department to address emerging needs elsewhere. In particular it has facilitated increased funding for the Senior Alerts programme so that demand can be meet right across the country.</p></reply>

Charitable status was granted to the company by the Revenue Commissioners on the 20th November 1996.  In 2005 ADM was re-named Pobal.  In accordance with Section 40 of the Charities Act, 2009, Pobal was entered onto the Register of Charitable Organisations on 16 October 2014.</p>  <p>  The basis for Pobal having charitable status is tied to the objects of the Company, which are specified in its Memorandum and Articles of Association.  I am satisfied that Pobal is fully compliant with the relevant legislative requirements including those of the Charities Act, 2009.</p>  <p>  Pobal is undertaking a review of its charitable status and in that regard has sought independent legal advice on the matter from Philip Lees and Associates.  The review is at an advanced stage and a report will be presented to the Board of Pobal at their January meeting.  The cost of the legal advice on the matter was approximately &euro;10,500.</p>  <p>  My Department has been kept informed by Pobal of progress on the review through our standing corporate governance and oversight arrangements. I expect that Pobal will also be sharing the outcome of the review with my Department once it has been considered by its Board.</p></reply>

As is the case with many EU-funded programmes, certain procedures must be followed to ensure transparency and accountability.  However, I am committed to making the application process for LEADER in Ireland as efficient as possible for community groups. </p>  <p>  My Department engages regularly with the Local Action Groups (LAGs) that deliver LEADER to identify potential areas for programme improvement.</p>  <p>  Following a Forum held with the LAGs in May of last year, I have implemented 31 improvements to streamline the LEADER programme.</p>  <p>  The impact of these improvements is clear to be seen in the level of applications and funding being approved under the LEADER programme this year.</p>  <p>  Overall, since the programme commenced, a total of 1,525 projects have now been approved for funding of over &euro;50 million under LEADER.  This compares with 592 projects approved at the end of 2017.  A further 370 project applications, requesting an additional &euro;23.4 million, are at various stages in the approval process.</p>  <p>  Project payments have also increased significantly in recent months as approved works are completed and claims are submitted. Over &euro;10 million of project expenditure has been incurred in 2018, compared to just under &euro;700,000 in 2017.</p>  <p>  I expect that the progress now being made on the LEADER programme will continue as further projects are approved and payment claims are made.  However, I will continue to examine ways to further improve the application and delivery process under LEADER, in consultation with stakeholders.</p></reply>

An Implementation Group was established in 2017 to oversee the delivery of the actions in the Taskforce&rsquo;s report. Progress reports on the delivery of these actions are published on my Department's website on a quarterly basis.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific issue of mobile phone blackspots, my officials, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, are actively engaged with Local Authorities and mobile phone operators to identify priority blackspots and take action to address this issue. </p>  <p>  During 2017, officials of both Departments worked with a group of Local Authorities to identify the issues associated with mapping local blackspots.  Building on this exercise, a call was issued to all Local Authorities in 2018 to map local blackspots and identify infrastructure that could potentially be used to improve telecommunications services. </p>  <p>  To date, 17 Local Authorities have provided data on more than 200 blackspots, although it should be borne in mind that the number of blackspots is constantly changing as new telecommunications infrastructure is rolled out and upgraded.  The blackspot information that the Department has received so far is providing data regarding poor coverage in specific rural areas and along national and regional roads. The Department is continuing to work with the telecommunications providers to ensure that new infrastructure is targeted at the areas most in need. </p>  <p>  It is not envisaged that the data gathered through this exercise will be published due to the constantly changing nature of the information.  However, through another action in the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce report, ComReg intends to publish a composite national coverage map by the end of the year. This will allow consumers to check which mobile phone operator can provide the best coverage in their area.</p></reply>

Based on positive feedback from communities around the country I recently allocated an additional &euro;8 million to the programme. </p>  <p>  Under the original RAPID programme (which closed in 2011), specific geographical areas - known as RAPID areas - were designated to receive funding.   Under the Community Enhancement Programme which has replaced it,  funding is not ring-fenced for specific areas but is allocated to each Local Authority area taking account of its population and its relative deprivation level, using the Pobal Hasse deprivation index.   </p>  <p>  The Local Community Development Committee in each area then allocates funding locally to community groups, in order to address disadvantage as identified in the Local Economic and Community Plan.   This means that up-to-date data and local knowledge is used to direct funding to those most who need it most.  It is a more effective, flexible and locally responsive approach to addressing disadvantage than ring-fencing geographical areas as under the original RAPID programme.</p>  <p>  The new approach was put in place following a review of the Communities Facilities Scheme and the re-cast RAPID programme that operated in 2017, and also takes into account a value-for-money review of the original RAPID programme.</p>  <p>  My Department also provides other funding streams to support disadvantaged communities, including  the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP).</p></reply>

The scheme involves private land-holders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on sections of National Waymarked Ways and other priority walks that cross their lands. Participant land-holders receive modest payments for maintenance work undertaken, in line with agreed work plans.</p>  <p>  The scheme currently covers 39 trails, with payments made to approximately 1,900 private land-holders to maintain those trails.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to increase the number of walks covered by the scheme.  In line with this commitment, funding for the scheme was doubled in Budget 2019 - from &euro;2 million to 4 million - to allow this expansion to proceed next year. </p>  <p>  I will shortly be initiating a review of the operation of Walks Scheme which will inform decisions regarding the expansion of the scheme. In order to be in a position to bring new trails on to the scheme as soon as possible, I will also be inviting Local Development Companies and Local Authorities to submit expressions of interest in respect of trails that meet specific qualifying criteria, for consideration for inclusion in the scheme. </p>  <p>  I hope that this process will enable my Department to identify, in the coming weeks, the initial trails for inclusion in the expanded scheme, with additional walks to join the Scheme on an incremental basis.  </p></reply>

My Department is continuously seeking to make improvements to the effectiveness of SICAP to enable us to do this.  Along with Pobal, we have commenced the development of a Distance Travelled Tool, to measure personal progression of individuals availing of supports under SICAP as they move closer to employment or education.</p></reply>

It includes a detailed capital investment plan for the next ten years, the National Development Plan 2018-2027, and the National Planning Framework which outlines the broader policy principles and priorities in planning for future population and economic growth to 2040. </p>  <p>  As part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government has provided an additional &euro;1 billion for the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund over the period 2019 to 2027.  The Fund will provide investment to support suitable projects in towns and villages with a population of less than 10,000, and outlying areas which will deliver on the aims of Project Ireland 2040 and achieve sustainable economic and social development in these areas. </p>  <p>  The Fund's key criteria, which proposals for funding must demonstrate in order to receive support, are specifically designed to deliver on the strategic outcomes of Project Ireland 2040 - most notably strengthened rural economies and communities.  The applications received under the first call from the Fund, which closed in September, are being assessed in accordance with the aforementioned strategic outcomes and key criteria and the first 18 successful projects which I announced last month will, I believe, deliver fully on the objectives of Project Ireland 2040.  Further successful projects will be announced early in the New Year with a second call for applications under the Fund to follow later in 2019.</p>  <p>  In terms of the other capital funding schemes administered by my Department, such as the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, the Community Enhancement Programme and CL&Aacute;R, the criteria underpinning funding decisions are tailored to the objectives of the relevant scheme, all of which are consistent with the strategic outcomes set out in Project Ireland 2040.  </p>  <p>  While the LEADER Programme 2014-2020 is governed by regulations established by the European Union, the themes of the programme - Economic Development, Enterprise Development and Job Creation; Social Inclusion; and Rural Environment - are also in harmony with Project Ireland 2040 and will contribute to the achievement of the National Strategic Outcomes.</p></reply>

A public tender competition for the replacement of the CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft is under way in my Department at present, following the publication of a  Request for Proposals on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) in May.  The cost of the aircraft will only be known once the tender competition is concluded.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the White Paper  also provides for the replacement of the current Air Corps Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft which will be equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR).  Following an open tender competition, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd in December 2017 at a cost of some &euro;32 million for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna fleet.  It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million.  The NDP provides for a total of &euro;541 million over the period 2018 to 2022.  This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.  The replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft and the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are among the projects included.</p></reply>

The underlying objective of section 13(2) is to take into consideration awards (compensation, pension, gratuity or allowance) made &lsquo;on the double&rsquo; from any source for the same disablement and not the recovery of injury awards as such.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s comments that the annual reduction in the disability pension now exceeds the amount of compensation awarded as a result of civil proceedings, the position is that the adjustment under section 13(2) was decided by the then Minister for Defence following consideration of all of the circumstances of the case, including the annuity value of the compensation awarded.  The annuity value was obtained from an actuarial assessment and was based on various assumptions including the date the money was received and the life expectancy of the individual.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the decision in this case was in line with the relevant statutory provisions.</p></reply>

While the vote does not give rise to fundamental strategic issues for Defence Forces operations or for Ireland&rsquo;s continuing engagement within the EU in the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), it is expected that Brexit will have an impact on future developments in the Defence sphere.</p>  <p>  Brexit is a priority issue for this Government, and the Taoiseach, my cabinet colleagues and I have taken every opportunity to engage with EU partners and the UK to advance Ireland&rsquo;s priorities.</p>  <p>  I have continually engaged with my EU counterparts to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in relation to Brexit and to ensure that these concerns are fully reflected in the EU position during negotiations.  My activities are reinforced by extensive engagement at diplomatic and official level.  At Ministerial level I have ongoing contact with my EU colleagues, both in the context of European Defence and Security, and other matters, including Brexit.</p>  <p>  Over the course of the year, my UK Ministerial counterpart has continued to be party to the relevant CSDP discussions at both formal and informal Ministerial meetings.  On a bi-lateral basis, while in London last month I paid a courtesy call on the UK Minister of State for the Armed Forces, the Rt. Hon. Mark Lancaster TD MP, where areas of mutual interest covered by the UK-IRL MoU on aspects of defence co-operation were the main focus of our discussion.  I also regularly meet with my UK Colleague en marge of EU Ministerial meetings.</p></reply>

As I have previously informed the Dail, a Government Decision dated 18 November 2016 approved the drafting of the Heads of Bill to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  This will remove the blanket exclusions contained in Section 3 of the Act.  Implementing the Working Time Directive is a complex process.  To that end, work is under way in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in conjunction with the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice and Equality towards the progression of this decision.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have undertaken significant work in examining the nature of the duties of the Defence Forces and how the Working Time Directive can be applied to the members of the Defence Forces.  An audit of Defence Forces' activities was conducted and this audit encompassed the work of EOD personnel.  Further consideration of implementation issues is ongoing.</p>  <p>  For reasons of operational security, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the disposition and specifics relating to hours worked on Explosive Ordnance Disposal duties. Furthermore, as these duties are currently the subject of litigation in connection with the Working Time Directive I am similarly not in a position to comment on same.</p>  <p>  The Defence Vote contains sufficient funding to accommodate a strength of 9,500 personnel.  As work on the implementation of the Working Time Directive is ongoing, costings on implementation are not yet available.</p></reply>

The Commission has provided a paper on the values-related infringement procedures that it has taken to address concerns with the situation in Hungary.</p>  <p>  At the General Affairs Council meeting on 11 December, Ministers will have an exchange of views on these documents and the next steps forward. Ireland has previously made its concerns known in relation to issues surrounding the rule of law and recent legislation targeting non-governmental actors in Hungary.</p>  <p>  I note the announcement on 3 December by the Central European University that it will be relocating to Vienna from Budapest from next January.

The UPR is the mechanism through which the United Nations Human Rights Council examines and addresses the human rights performance of its member states. In its input, Ireland called for China to respect freedom of religion and belief, with particular regard to the situation in Xinjiang, and called for China to grant access to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to all regions of the country, again with particular regard to the situation in Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The EU has also raised its concerns regarding freedom of religion and belief on several occasions at bilateral and multilateral levels. During the 36th round of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Beijing on 9-10 July 2018, the restrictions on Christians, Uighurs and Tibetans were discussed, and more broadly, the promotion of freedom of religion and belief, and the rights of persons belonging to minorities.</p>  <p>  In June and September 2018, the EU delivered statements at the UN Human Rights Council raising the Union&rsquo;s concerns regarding the deterioration of the human rights situation in China and calling for China to respect freedom of religion or belief and expression, as well as the rights of persons belonging to ethnic minorities.</p>  <p>  The EU High Representative/ Vice-President mentioned this issue in a speech delivered at the European Parliament on 11 September 2018 and called on China to respect freedom of religion and belief in a speech to the European Parliament on 4 October 2018. The Spokesperson of the High Representative reiterated this concern in a statement on 26 October. Ireland fully supports the EU position, and actively contributes to its actions and statements.</p>  <p>  Through our ongoing contacts with the Chinese Embassy in Dublin and through our Embassy in Beijing, Ireland will continue to raise the issue of human rights with China, along with our EU partners and other like-minded Member States.</p></reply>

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.</p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most. It is estimated that almost 400,000 people have died, and 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition. While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay. Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.</p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan. On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.</p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis. The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation. Her most recent visit took place in November.</p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peace building. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.  </p>  <p>  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan. Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.</p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.</p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.</p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.</p></reply>

As part of this expansion, a passport card is also now available for children.  The passport card is valid for travel within the EU/EEA (European Economic Area) and Switzerland. In the interest of child protection and in order to ensure the highest level of integrity for the passport renewal process, the online renewal of a child&rsquo;s passport will continue to require that a child&rsquo;s identity is verified and that the consent of each of the child&rsquo;s legal guardians is received before a passport is issued.</p><p>The Online Passport Application Service is fast, secure and the most convenient way to apply for a passport. It can be used by Irish citizens living anywhere in the world, and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The average processing time is less than 10 working days (plus postage time). </p><p>I would urge applicants wishing to renew their passports, whether residing in Ireland or overseas, to avail of this service where possible.</p></reply>

As part of these efforts, the Government has organised &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; public information events around Ireland to inform and advise about Brexit preparedness, and the range of support measures and resources that the Government has put in place.  </p><p>These events brought together over a dozen Agencies and their parent Departments &ndash; the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - under one roof to inform and advise both citizens and businesses.</p><p>The Workshops also attracted significant domestic and international (in particular UK) media coverage which afforded an opportunity to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s overall approach and specific concerns in relation to Brexit. </p><p>Six Getting Ireland Brexit Ready workshop events have so far taken place in Cork on 5 October, Galway on 12 October, Monaghan on 19 October, Dublin on 25 October, Limerick on 23 November, and Letterkenny on 30 November.

For example, Enterprise Ireland has recorded a 92% increase in Brexit Scorecard completions from September to October, as well as a 62% increase in interactions on its website. Similarly, F&aacute;ilte Ireland noted a 24% increase in views to their Brexit webpages subsequent to the October events, as well as an uptrend averaging 83% in the number of interactions on their Get Brexit Ready diagnostic tool.</p><p>Other Brexit preparedness-related public information activities and events continue to be organised by State Agencies and Departments across Ireland and relevant details on these can be found at the new dedicated Brexit events page on the <i>dfa.ie/brexit</i>website.</p></reply>

Various contingency measures, such as the rapid recruitment and redeployment of staff, and the use of temporary  facilities, are  under active planning for a disorderly Brexit scenario.</p>  <p>  Given that in a number of key areas for Ireland, the appropriate response and mitigation will be at the EU level, we are continuing to engage actively with the Commission on areas of priority for Ireland, including through a series of expert level meetings with the Commission and the EU27 on key issues on a weekly basis until mid-January.  </p>  <p>  The EU Commission acknowledged the particular impact of Brexit on Ireland and Irish business in its contingency planning communication of 13 November. This communication also outlined some of the EU&rsquo;s plans for a no deal scenario, including in the areas of financial services, citizens&rsquo; rights, air transport, road transport, and customs / SPS requirements. This has further informed our own domestic planning.</p>  <p>  Ireland is also working closely with the EU and fellow Member States to discuss and progress areas of key concern, including facilitating the use of the UK as a landbridge post Brexit.</p></reply>

It has subsequently been renewed on two occasions. A Protocol implementing the fisheries agreement was also renewed on two occasions, and expired in July this year.  </p>  <p>  Following a legal challenge, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment in Court case C-266/16 of 27 February 2018, where the Court determined that the existing fisheries agreement and protocol were not applicable to the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara.  </p>  <p>  In April 2018, the Council of the European Union authorised the European Commission to begin negotiations with Morocco to amend the fisheries agreement and associated protocol in order to implement the Court&rsquo;s judgment. Following those negotiations, a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement, and a new Implementation Protocol were initialled in July 2018, and, last month, the Council of the European Union agreed to sign the Agreement and Protocol. For the proposed new agreement to enter into force and replace the current agreement, approval by the European Parliament will now be required. </p>  <p>  Ireland has carefully assessed the final negotiated outcome, and has received assurances that it fully respects both international law and the Court of Justice of the European Union&rsquo;s judgment of 27 February 2018 in Case C-266/16.</p>  <p>  I must stress that the proposed new agreement, if adopted, would be without prejudice to the position of the EU on Western Sahara. In other words, there is nothing in the terms of the proposed agreement or its protocol which would imply EU recognition of Morocco&rsquo;s sovereignty or sovereign rights over Western Sahara and the adjacent waters.</p></reply>

Concerns were expressed, including by Ireland, regarding backsliding on the rule of law and fundamental rights, and regarding measures targeting journalists, academics, members of political parties, parliamentarians, human rights defenders, social media users, and others exercising their fundamental rights and freedoms. Both the EU and the Government have repeatedly called on Turkey to address any failings in this area.  </p>  <p>  In March this year, EU leaders met with President Erdoğan and reiterated the importance of upholding the highest standards of democracy, while expressing concern that some of the methods used to restore order following the failed coup in 2016 had undermined fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in Turkey.  </p>  <p>  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have frequent contact with officials in the Turkish Embassy, and have raised issues relating to the human rights situation in Turkey, and the large-scale arrests and detentions of individuals in the country, on a number of occasions throughout the year.</p>  <p>  In August this year, I issued a statement welcoming the decision taken by the Turkish courts to release Mr. Taner K&yacute;l&yacute;&ccedil;, the Chair of Amnesty International Turkey. I expressed my concerns relating to this arrest and to the continued detention of other human-rights defenders, journalists and political activists since the attempted coup in July 2016. In the same statement, I called on the Turkish authorities to ensure that full due process is respected in the judicial system and that each detainee is granted a fair trial.</p>  <p>  Together with our European partners, we will continue to monitor government actions that undermine freedom of expression, democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights in Turkey, and to consider the implications of these actions for relations with Turkey.</p></reply>

Before receiving an asset to which a person is entitled, the person may disclaim or refuse the asset. However, a disclaiming beneficiary cannot choose who will then get the disclaimed asset which becomes part of the residue of the deceased person&rsquo;s estate and is distributed accordingly. A recipient of the disclaimed and re-distributed asset is then treated as having received a taxable inheritance from the deceased person.  </p>  <p>  In contrast, a re-distribution of assets received by family members under a deed of family arrangement gives rise to two potential charges to capital acquisitions tax; i.e. </p>  <p>  1. a potential inheritance tax charge for the original beneficiary on his or her inheritance from the deceased person, and</p>  <p>  2. a potential gift tax charge for the beneficiary receiving the asset under the deed of family arrangement from the original beneficiary.</p>  <p>  As far as capital gains tax is concerned, deeds of family arrangements do not give rise to a charge to tax if certain conditions are met. Section 573 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that any variation made by deed of family arrangement in respect of the deceased person&rsquo;s assets between family members within 2 years after the date of death (or such longer period as the Revenue Commissioners may allow) is to be regarded as made by that person at the time of his or her death. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the tax treatment of gifts and inheritances in this State and in the U.K. is not directly comparable. The U.K. tax authorities apply a different basis of taxation whereby it is the value of the estate of the deceased person that is taxed and not the recipients of the assets as happens in this State. A further difference between the tax treatment in both jurisdictions is that the receipt of gifts is not generally taxable in the U.K. </p>  <p>  I have therefore no plans to make any changes to the current tax treatment for CAT or CGT in this regard.</p></reply>

We were also directed to develop a term sheet for our ongoing work on reform of the European Stability Mechanism, which is the euro area&rsquo;s crisis lending body. </p>  <p>  In addition to these issues, the Eurogroup has also been discussing possible new budgetary instruments aimed at strengthening the euro area. This has included proposals put forward by the European Commission and by France and Germany for the establishment of instruments for competitiveness, convergence and stabilisation. A proposal was put forward by France and Germany in the joint Meseberg Declaration released in June. This was followed by an outline of the proposal for a euro zone budget, to be part of the EU budget, which was released in November. </p>  <p>  At the Eurogroup meeting on the 3 December, my colleagues and I were able to agree a comprehensive package of measures to be put forward to Leaders at the 14 December Euro Summit.

In addition, Leaders are asked for guidance on the way forward on the French-German proposals, which are at a very early stage of discussions between Finance Ministers, relative to our work on completing Banking Union and ESM reform. </p></reply>

For example, the Revenue Statement of Strategy for the period 2017-2019 indicates that Revenue will continue to ensure its structure accommodates and reflects changes in the customer base, the evolving national and international tax and customs environment, and the impact of significant changes for tax administration such as the PAYE Modernisation programme.</p>  <p>  In the last three years Revenue has reorganised its legislation divisions to set up an International Division, established  a stand-alone Customs Division, reorganised its Investigation and Prosecutions Division and established teams in Planning, ICT and the Revenue Solicitor&rsquo;s Divisions outside Dublin.  </p>  <p>  The current phase of structural realignment involves moving from what was previously a single Large Cases Division and four geographically based Regions (Border Midland West Region, Dublin Region, East South-East Region and South West Region) to a new structure comprising of five new Divisions based on a nationally segmented customer base. </p>  <p>  The new national Divisions are Large Corporates Division, High Wealth Individuals Division, Medium Enterprises Division, Business Division and Personal Division. As part of Revenue&rsquo;s workforce planning framework, the realignment includes additional resources being assigned to manage the risks in larger cases, including high wealth individuals. </p>  <p>  Revenue also advises me that it will continue to maximise the benefit of its geographic spread across the country and provide opportunities for diversity of roles, responsibilities and opportunities across the organisation. The realignment project will, over time, involve changes in roles and responsibilities for staff and I understand that Revenue continue to engage in a comprehensive programme of employee engagement to embed the changes throughout the organisation.</p>  <p>  I would like to commend Revenue for its proactive approach in aligning its resources in order to continue to meet the myriad of challenges it faces on both the national and international fronts.</p></reply>

NARPS operates by purchasing properties from its debtors and receivers, at full market value, and making them available to Local Authorities or Approved Housing Bodies by way of a standardised long term lease. Since its establishment, NARPS has completed the purchase of 587 units located in Co. Dublin from NAMA debtors and receivers.

The number of new residential units delivered through NAMA funding since 2014 in the whole of Ireland is set out in Table 2.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Table 2:</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Units</th><th>Houses</th><th>Apartments </th></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1,502</td><td>514</td><td>988</td></tr><tr><td>2015</td><td>1,029</td><td>825</td><td>204</td></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>2,117</td><td>1405</td><td>712</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2,503</td><td>1,764</td><td>739</td></tr><tr><td>2018   (Q1-Q3)</td><td>862</td><td>640</td><td>222</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>8,013</td><td>5,148</td><td>2,865</td></tr></table></p><p>I am advised that 9% (306) of all units which have been launched for sale are currently unsold.

The Deputies will also be aware that, in accordance with the provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 as regards the confidentiality of a taxpayer&rsquo;s affairs, Revenue does not comment on the tax affairs of individual taxpayers.</p>  <p>  The position in tax law is that where an employer provides free access to medical services to employees or provides refunds to employees in relation to medical services paid for by the employees, the employees are subject to tax on the services or refunds received. However, Revenue does not seek to apply benefit-in-kind where employees have free access to a general practitioner employed or retained by their employer. In addition, one medical check-up per year, and check-ups that are mandatory for work purposes, may also be provided. These exceptions are set out in published Revenue guidelines, and they apply as appropriate to all employers.</p>  <p>  Where free access to medical services is provided to retired employees by their former employer, these services are not taxable. If retired employees are reimbursed by their former employer for medical services, the amounts reimbursed are taxable.</p>  <p>  The relevant tax legislation applies to all employers equally and there are no exceptions to the aforementioned rules for particular employers, employees or retired employees.  The manner in which any company provides services to its employees or retired employees is entirely a matter for that company to agree with their employees and retired employees.</p></reply>

The Central Bank has also informed me that Alpha Insurance A/S was selling non-life insurance policies, including structural warranty insurance, in Ireland through the broker network on a freedom of services basis and that it also operated in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom and Spain. </p><p>The Central Bank has been informed by the Danish insolvency administrators that Alpha Insurance A/S had just under 12,000 customers in Ireland (11,931):</p><p><table><tr><th>Insurance line</th><th>No. of policies</th></tr><tr><td>Pet insurance </td><td>9,316</td></tr><tr><td>Latent defect/structural warranty insurance</td><td>1,595</td></tr><tr><td>GAP insurance</td><td>509</td></tr><tr><td>Mortgage protection</td><td>357</td></tr><tr><td>Income protection</td><td>148</td></tr><tr><td>Loan protection</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>11,931</td></tr></table></p><p>Alpha Insurance a/s has published country specific information for policyholders, including Ireland, on their website www.alphagroup.dk/ireland.

The website gives information on how to claim premium refunds and other claims.  The Danish Guarantee Fund may also cover premium refunds for some private insurances depending on the specifics of each case. </p><p>In terms of structural warranty/latent defects insurance, in many cases this would have been initially purchased by the developer of a property or properties. Therefore, the owners of any impacted properties may wish to get in contact with the developer in the first instance to see if alternative cover can be arranged.</p><p>Ultimately, should there be a claim on a policy, there may be assistance available from the Danish Insurance Guarantee Fund in the first instance. If such an application were unsuccessful, there may then be recourse to the Irish Insurance Compensation Fund to recover 65% of the cost of a claim, up to a ceiling of &euro;825,000 per claim subject to the particular circumstances of the claim and the relevant provisions of the Insurance Act 1964.</p></reply>

One of the amendments to which the Deputy refers was an amendment to section 135 TCA. This amendment nullified a cash extraction scheme whereby shareholders extracted distributable reserves from their corporate entities but avoided an income tax charge on the receipt of these funds. In essence, the scheme sought to substitute a capital gains tax charge for an income tax charge and where those individuals could also avail of retirement relief under the capital gains tax provisions in many instances no tax was paid on the receipt of these funds.</p>  <p>  The amendment passed by the Oireachtas only applies where an arrangement was entered into by a shareholder disposing of shares or securities in a company and the consideration is to be met directly or indirectly from the assets of that company.

I have engaged regularly with Chancellor Hammond during the 2018 Ecofin meetings. I also met directly with Chancellor Hammond in London on 5 March 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government has already taken a number of key decisions on measures to support East &ndash; West Trade. These include staffing, ICT and infrastructure measures to implement necessary checks and controls at our ports and airports.  To support businesses, the Government provided dedicated Brexit support measures in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. Ireland is working closely with the EU and fellow Member States to discuss and to facilitate the use of the UK as a landbridge post Brexit.</p></reply>

Qudos is authorised and regulated by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, and therefore the Central Bank had no role in this decision. It is understood that Qudos operated in Ireland on a freedom of services basis and that its products in this country were sold through Patrona Underwriting Ltd.</p>  <p>  On 4 December, Qudos published further information that it is no longer paying insurance claims. The Central Bank then issued a statement strongly recommending, based on the uncertainty around the payment of claims, that affected customers should contact their insurance broker to arrange alternative insurance cover. The Central Bank is actively monitoring developments and is liaising regularly with its Danish counterparts, the supervisory authorities of other affected member states and EIOPA.</p>  <p>  It is understood that there are approximately 50,000 policyholders in Ireland that have been impacted by the developments with Qudos. Patrona Underwriting has issued a statement saying that policies remain valid and in force until their natural expiry date, however given the current Qudos position and in line with Central Bank recommendations they have provided brokers with options to replace all insurance covers with other providers at no extra cost to consumers. </p>  <p>  Early indications suggest that there are  in the region of 1,400 claims outstanding in relation to Irish policyholders, but this is subject to confirmation. </p>  <p>  I understand that the Danish liquidators are currently continuing their review of the company with a view to determining its underlying financial position. Once this exercise is concluded they will be in a better position to determine whether the company can pay existing claims.  It is expected that more information regarding this matter should be available within the next two weeks.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that my officials have been in contact with the Danish Finance Ministry, who  advise on the basis of information they have received from the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, that as the company is in solvent liquidation, claims will be met.  However, the Ministry also indicated that if ultimately Qudos is placed into bankruptcy, and this happens after 1 January 2019,  that the Danish Insurance Guarantee Scheme will not be liable to meet these claims due to a legislative change in May 2018. In such a situation claimants may  instead be eligible for cover from the Irish Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF), subject to its terms and conditions and the particular circumstances of the case. </p>  <p>  Regarding informing customers who are impacted by the failure of an insurance undertaking,  if winding-up proceedings are initiated, in accordance Article 281 with Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EC) &ldquo;the competent authorities of the home Member State, the liquidator or any person appointed for that purpose by the competent authorities shall without delay individually inform by written notice each known creditor whose habitual residence, domicile or head office is situated in another Member State."  I understand that this has happened and that the Central Bank has also instructed the Managing General Agent, Patrona underwriting to inform brokers and policyholders of the temporary stoppage in paying claims.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised my Department that all relevant brokers have been contacted and the process of contacting policyholders is ongoing. It has also published information for policyholders on its website and this will be updated as more information becomes available.

Implementation of OPS2020, including Action 3, is the responsibility of each public service organisation.</p>  <p>  My Department has published a number of user guides that promote the use of plain English. In cooperation with NALA, my Department developed and circulated a guide for public servants on the use of plain language- Using Plain English to Improve Effectiveness in the Public Service.</p>  <p>A Customer Communications Toolkit for the Public Service was published July 2017.  The toolkit is specifically designed for public servants as a guide to developing content (written, verbal and digital), keeping Plain English and access guidelines to the fore in order to communicate effectively with citizens. </p>  <p>  I consider these supports delivered by my Department to be very important and they have proven to be very helpful in supporting a wide range of customer service officers to deliver better services. </p></reply>

Some flood events may have occurred where data has not been collated and / or reported to the OPW, and hence would not be available. Similarly, only the data providing details on the floods can be published, which does not always include the degree of impact, such as the number of properties affected or the damages incurred.</p>  <p>  The OPW is currently processing data on past floods that have occurred in recent years and these data will be uploaded to www.floodinfo.ie.</p></reply>

While Ireland currently has a relatively young demographic profile in comparison with other countries, as our population gets larger and older in the coming years there will be increased pressure on expenditure and the public finances. The size and structure of the population influences the demand for public services, particularly in the front-line areas mentioned above. </p>  <p>  Demographic projections are subject to consideration and updating in light of emerging data. Some demographic allocations were re-examined and updated as part of Spending Review 2018, for example in the area of Primary and Second Level Education.  Work is currently ongoing in selecting topics for Spending Review 2019. While the list of topics has not been finalised, it is likely that demographics will be an element of the Spending Review process.</p></reply>

Officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will act as secretariat to the Group. Topics which the Expert Group wish to be examined will be discussed with the secretariat and arrangements will be made for appropriate departments and agencies to attend meetings.</p>  <p>  The Group, which is chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, includes representation from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice and Equality. In addition to the representatives from these Government Departments, the Group includes: Helen Johnston, National Economic and Social Council; Jennifer McCarthy Flynn, National Women's Council of Ireland; Helen Russell, the Economic and Social Research Institute; Seamus Taylor, Maynooth University; and representatives from the Central Statistics Office and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.</p></reply>

There are currently 4 special schools and 75 special classes in mainstream schools in Co. Kildare, including 6 Early Intervention classes, 46 ASD special classes at primary level and 15 ASD special classes at post primary level.  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need. This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally. From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional provision is required. In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. </p>  <p>  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when commenced will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act, which commenced Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the Board of Management and the Patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  I have arranged for the Deputy's question on emerging need in the Kildare area to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.

Many of the issues identified were complex and the Council commissioned the ESRI (Economic and Social Research Institute) to carry out research to inform its deliberations. </p><p>The changes also had regard to the Department&rsquo;s policy &ldquo;Supporting a Better Transition from Second Level to Higher Education &ndash; Implementation and Next Steps&rdquo; (2015).</p><p>Having relatively high minimum entry requirements in core subject areas of Irish, English and Mathematics is one of the key policy levers that help ensure quality teaching and learning in primary schools.  The 2011 Literacy and Numeracy Strategy and subsequent review identified the need to raise standards of achievement and included plans to raise the entry requirements in the core subjects over time.</p><p>In recognition of the fact that not all applicants will meet the minimum entry requirements in Irish, English and Maths at the first attempt, there is no requirement that these minimum grades be achieved in one sitting of the Leaving Cert. Furthermore, there are a number of alternative qualifications that can take the place of the relevant Leaving Cert grade.  The list of alternative qualifications in the subject(s) concerned are outlined in the published Entry Requirements and Procedures for 2018 and available on my Department's website  (see www.education.ie). </p><p>The Department has received a number of submissions regarding the changes which were introduced, which are currently under consideration.</p></reply>

My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advises parents, to seek to enrol their child, by applying in writing, to the school/s of their choice as early as possible.  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school for the 2018/19 school year, they should update their local SENO (Special Educational Needs Organiser) to inform the planning process.</p>  <p>  Since 2011, the NCSE has increased the number of special classes from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 across the country now, of which 1,196 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.</p>  <p>  There are 37 special schools and 237 special classes attached to mainstream schools in Co. Dublin. Of these, 17 are ASD early intervention classes, 139 are primary ASD classes and 41 are post primary ASD classes.  The number of ASD special classes in Co. Dublin have increased from 66 in 2011/2012 to 197 in 2018/2019.  Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs are available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year, and where special provision, including special class provision, is required, it is planned and established to meet that need.  This process is ongoing.</p>  <p>  While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child&rsquo;s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally.  From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional provision is required.  In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved. </p>  <p>  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process. </p>  <p>  My Department is aware that the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities can be challenging.</p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 when commenced will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  Section 8 of the Act, which commenced Monday 3rd December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the Board of Management and the Patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.</p></reply>

The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I would advise if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student that these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

It is also the Board of Management of the school that is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate health and safety measures are in place.</p>  <p>  In relation to child protection matters, the organisation with primary statutory responsibility for child protection is the Child and Family Agency.  The role of the Department of Education and Skills is to provide guidance to all recognised schools in implementing their child protection obligations.  The Department has issued child protection procedures for primary and post-primary schools which set out very clear procedures for reporting allegations or suspicions of child abuse and which make clear the lead role of Tusla in the investigation of child protection concerns.  In December 2017, the Department of Education and Skills, following consultation with the relevant education stakeholders, published updated Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools 2017 which take account of the new statutory requirements of the Children First Act 2015 which is now fully operational.  Responsibility for ensuring that child protection requirements are complied with rests with the school board, the principal and the staff of each school.</p>  <p>  The Department has recently received correspondence regarding a school from the person referred to by the Deputy.  The Department has brought the matters raised in this correspondence to the attention of the board of management of the school in question and has sought its clarification as to the position regarding same.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.

The Deputy will note however that the selection process procedures and enrolment policy are the responsibility of the individual school authorities.</p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed by the President on 18 July 2018, is an important piece of legislation which will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that my Department announced that a new post-primary school will be established for the Drogheda &amp;amp; Laytown area in Co Louth, to open in September 2019.</p><p>I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department's capital investment programme provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for existing schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified.</p></reply>

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years (2019 to 2022).  The 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p>  <p>  In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future.  Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools.  Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools.</p>  <p>  The requirement for new schools will be kept under on-going review and in particular would have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a new 1,000-place post-primary school was established in September 2017 to serve the Carpenterstown_D15 and Castleknock_D15 school planning areas as a regional solution. </p>  <p>  All new schools established since 2011 to meet demographic demand are required to prioritise pupil applications from within the designated school planning area(s) which the school was established to serve.  This does not preclude schools from enrolling pupils from outside of the designated school planning area, rather it reflects the need to accommodate in the first instance the demographic for which the school was established.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to prioritise enrolment of children from particular areas or particular age groups or on the basis of some other criterion.  For example, some schools give priority to applicants who have attended a particular primary school (known as a feeder school).  The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, it may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice.</p></reply>

This school, which was a private English language school, is a member of MEI (Marketing English in Ireland), an association of English language schools.  I understand that MEI representatives met with the school&rsquo;s management and affected students on 3rd December 2018 and are continuing to liaise with all relevant parties.  MEI are putting the necessary arrangements in place to ensure that students affected by the school's closure will be able to complete the course for which they have enrolled, or a similar course, at another MEI member school.  My colleague Minister Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor and I have also separately met with some of the affected teachers. </p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that legislation is currently being progressed through the Oireachtas which is intended to substantially strengthen regulation in the English language education sector.  Committee Stage of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill was initiated on 5th December 2018.</p>  <p>  This new Bill will establish the International Education Mark (IEM) and a Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL) Fund.  The IEM is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector and will provide a full quality framework for the provision of education to international learners in the future.  Only those providers who meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) will be allowed to carry the Mark. </p>  <p>  Once fully implemented, providers must gain authorisation from QQI to use the IEM in order to be eligible to recruit international students.  The IEM is a tool to further enhance and sustain the quality of our education system.  It also provides learners, or potential learners, with the necessary confidence that providers with the IEM have been quality assured by QQI.  </p>  <p>  The Bill also contains provisions to provide QQI with additional statutory powers to examine a provider&rsquo;s financial sustainability and to evaluate a provider&rsquo;s corporate fitness.  These provisions will enable QQI to examine the bona fides of a provider in addition to assessing that the provider has the capacity and capability to implement the quality assurance processes and provide programmes of education and training consistent with the requirements of the Act.  All providers, including English language providers, will have to satisfy QQI in relation to issues such as the legal personality, ownership and corporate governance arrangements in addition to examining that adequate financial resources are in place to ensure the viability of these businesses.  </p>  <p>  Upon enactment, the Bill will also empower QQI to establish a fund for the protection of enrolled learners (PEL).

This development was to address the lack of capacity in the prison system and substantial operational challenges in the Mountjoy complex.  On 11 February 2004 advertisements looking for suitable sites were published.  In May 2004, a site selection committee was established to review potential sites.  This selection committee, which included an OPW nominee, recommended the purchase of the site at Thornton Hall.  The minutes of the committee's deliberations were subsequently published on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  There is already extensive background information in the public domain on the Thornton Hall purchase - how it arose, the related prison accommodation issues and other relevant factors.  In particular, the Deputy may recall the Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General Annual Report 2005 which addressed this issue as well as the subsequent examination by the Public Accounts Committee in October 2006.  The Comptroller &amp;amp; Auditor General also addressed this issue as part of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services in 2014 (No. 9 Development of Prison Accommodation in Dublin) and the Public Accounts Committee subsequently examined this issue in November 2015. </p>  <p>  It is worth recalling, in summary, that due to the downturn in the economy, the scale of the project could not be accommodated within the capital allocation available.  In light of the decision not to proceed with Thornton Hall, significant capital investment has been made at the Mountjoy campus over recent years.</p></reply>

Vetting checks are conducted by the Vetting Bureau for each new application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account.  This is because once there has been any significant lapse of time between one employment and another, the original vetting disclosure must be reviewed to take account of any changes in information, such as more recent criminal convictions. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Data Protection Acts require that any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Importantly, the general non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the current process also helps to protect against the risk of fraud or forgery in the process.</p>  <p>  Each relevant organisation develops its own policy in relation to the assessment of disclosures received from the Garda National Vetting Bureau.   Policies can vary between different organisations and in that regard, what is acceptable to one organisation may not be acceptable to another.  </p>  <p>  However, the Deputy will wish to know that the Act provides for the sharing of vetting disclosures in certain circumstances by registered organisations; a facility which is of assistance in the health and education sectors, for example, in reducing the need for multiple vetting applications.</p>  <p>  Section 12(3)(A) of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that two or more relevant organisations can enter into a joint written agreement in relation to the employment, contracting, permitting or placement of a person to undertake relevant work or activities, thereby providing for only one of the organisations being required to conduct vetting in respect of that person.</p>  <p>  In general, the vetting process is working well and I understand that there are no backlogs or delays in Garda Vetting at present.  This efficiency has been achieved by the deployment of the e-vetting system which facilitates the on-line processing of applications for vetting from registered organisations.  The e-Vetting system is available to all registered organisations and the Garda Authorities are ready to assist those organisations who are not yet using the e-Vetting system to do so.  </p>  <p>  The current turnaround time for vetting applications submitted by organisations utilising the eVetting system is 5 working days for over 85% of applications received.  Individual applicants can track the process of their application online using the eVetting Tracking System, details of which are contained in the email received by applicants when completing their application online.</p></reply>

This pressure has increased further in the last number of months with an increase in the numbers of persons claiming international protection and a growth in the percentage of protection applicants who require assistance with accommodation.</p><p>In order to ensure that the State can continue to provide accommodation for all protection applicants and continue to comply with the EU Reception Directive which was transposed into Irish law in June of this year, RIA has, since September, arranged for the provision of emergency beds where the mainstream accommodation centres were at capacity.  RIA is also increasing the capacity of the mainstream system by opening new centres in Kenmare, and Wicklow and in the very near future in Moville and Roosky.</p><p>As a result of this increased demand, my Department has had to use  emergency beds on a temporary basis. Given that the accommodation is utilised on a temporary basis there is no set contract in place with each provider.</p><p>As of Sunday 9th December, there were three separate hotels being used in this manner and the following table shows the name and utilisation of each hotel.</p><p><table><tr><th>Name </th><th>Occupancy </th></tr><tr><td>D&uacute;n na R&iacute;, Kingscourt</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Lisanisk House, Monaghan</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Treacy's Hotel, Monaghan</td><td>116</td></tr></table></p><p>Persons accommodated there are provided with full board accommodation. SafetyNet, on behalf of the HSE, have offered medical screening to all residents and RIA are liaising with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to assist in the process of linking residents with local Social Welfare officers. Staff from RIA have also arranged to meet with residents in these accommodation settings to address any concerns they may have.</p><p>It is our intention that persons will be accommodated here for as short a time as possible prior to being transferred to a contracted accommodation centre and hence the opening of new accommodation centres mentioned above.</p></reply>

I have ensured that a full Tribunal membership has been maintained in order to continue to address claims as promptly as possible within the funds available.</p>  <p>  The length of time taken to process an application can vary widely from case to case.  Each case is addressed on the individual application. While applications are processed with the minimum of formality compared to court proceedings where compensation is being claimed, in making their decisions Tribunal Members must be satisfied that all supporting documentation submitted is in order.  In some cases there can be delays pending the availability of all the required documentation and some cases are complex in terms of medical conditions.  For example, in the cases of serious injury to the victim, it can take considerable amount of time before the treating consultant is in a position to give a final prognosis.  It is also often necessary to await Garda reports arising from the related criminal investigation before a final decision can be made in a case.  By their nature, such investigations can be lengthy and complex.</p>  <p>  Insofar as average processing times are concerned, I can inform the Deputy that I have requested an assessment of the caseload of the Tribunal and have asked my officials to examine this assessment and seek the views of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal in this regard.  As previously advised, I will contact the Deputy with further information in due course.</p>  <p>  I can also advise the Deputy that, in view of the length of time since the Scheme was last revised, my Department has submitted a request for a review of the Scheme to the Law Reform Commission (LRC) for consideration in the context of its Programme of Law Reform.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in view of a number of large value awards in the current year, I can inform the Deputy that I have obtained approval for an increased allocation of &euro;2.4 m, for 2018, as part of a Supplementary Estimate for the Vote which will bring the total compensation allocation to &euro;6.416 m for the year.</p></reply>

The Act is the vehicle for the relevant reforms recommended by the Competition Authority in 2006 as undertaken by the Government under the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Programme.  These include the introduction of a new and more consumer-friendly legal costs transparency regime, the setting out of Legal Costs Principles and the modernising transition of the Office of the Taxing-Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicators who will maintain a public register of their legal costs determinations.</p><p>They also include the introduction of an independent complaints and professional conduct regime for both solicitors and barristers including the establishment and appointment of an independent Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal. Members of the public will no longer make their complaints through the legal professional bodies as they do at present but directly to the new Authority. Both the legal costs and the public complaints regimes, for which extensive preparations are ongoing, are due to come into operation during Quarter 2 of 2019. The regulated introduction of new legal services models in the guise of Legal Partnerships and Limited Liability Partnerships is also due in Quarter 1 of 2019.</p><p>The key driver for much of this programme of structural reform is the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which was established, along the lines recommended by the Competition Authority, on 1 October 2016 and held its first meeting on 26 October 2016. The Authority has eleven members including a lay majority and a lay Chair, Dr. Don Thornhill, and continues to roll out its functions under its first full-time Chief Executive, Dr. Brian Doherty. Members of the Authority are nominated by ten prescribed nominating bodies who represent a balance of interests between the legal professions and those consumers, both private and enterprise, who avail of their services. The Authority is, under the 2015 Act, independent in the performance of its functions and appointments to it have to be approved by a motion of each House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>In its first year of operations to the end of 2017, the Authority produced five mandatory reports on new legal services options which included public consultations within deadlines set under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. It has also submitted its Annual Report for 2017 and recently produced a review of legal professional education. The Deputy will wish to be aware that I have laid these, along with the other reports to which I have referred, before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the required manner.  The Authority will also soon be submitting its first statutory review of the operation of the 2015 Act directly to each House.</p><p>The Authority's forthcoming actions have been set out in its first Strategic Plan for 2018-2020 which I laid before the Houses on 1 May 2018. The Plan sets out indicative timelines for the roll-out of the Authority's functions during that period. This will be supported in each instance with the commencement, by me as Minister, of the relevant provisions concerned. The Authority has its own website on <i>www.lsra.ie</i>where its reports, minutes of meetings, Strategic Plan and other useful information are also publicly available.</p></reply>

Due to the downturn in the economy, the scale of the project could not be accommodated within the capital allocation available and the project did not proceed.  In the decade since the original plan, international research has tended towards smaller prisons within reach of support communities as the best option for rehabilitation.  In addition, in light of the decision not to proceed with Thornton Hall, significant capital investment has been made at the Mountjoy campus over recent years to upgrade accommodation and eliminate the practice of slopping out.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Thornton Hall site which is fully serviced and adjacent to Dublin airport remains in my Department&rsquo;s ownership and in recent years a working group, which included representatives from the OPW, considered future use options for the site. This included discussions with Fingal County Council.  More recently, the site has also been flagged to the Department of Housing and Local Government, and to the Land Development Agency. As such, the site will be considered both in the context of broader State requirements for land assets and future requirements in relation to detention of prisoners.</p></reply>

This includes a focus on the use of motorways by criminal gangs so as to disrupt and arrest those involved.</p>  <p>  The scale of Garda activity against burglary and property-related crime &ndash; under Operation Thor - has led to (as of 2 November 2018) over 168,636 targeted checkpoints and 243,277 crime prevention patrols nationwide. This has produced in the region of 8,837 arrests and 10,143 charges covering a range of offences, which, in addition to burglary, include handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; continue to pursue a range of measures to support elderly and more vulnerable people in the community, working closely with Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch and other community groups.</p>  <p>  At the Ploughing Championships in September, I announced details of the 2018 Text Alert Rebate Scheme which will be available to over 1,000 local groups registered under the Garda Text Alert Scheme. My Department will be making in the region of &euro;150,000 available to local communities who wish to apply for a rebate towards the costs associated with running their local Text Alert Scheme.</p>  <p>  Other policing initiatives include Theft Stop, which was launched by the Garda&iacute; and the Irish Farmers Association (IFA).  Theft Stop is designed to deter criminals from taking and selling farm equipment by ensuring it is clearly marked with a unique ID and then registered on a nationwide database. The clearly visible serial number should act as a deterrent to criminals. A further impediment for criminals is that the details and serial numbers of stolen equipment can be viewed by would-be buyers on-line at www.theftstop.ie.</p>  <p>  Other partnership initiatives with the IFA and Crimestoppers have included a reward fund to encourage reports to assist Garda&iacute; in identifying those involved in livestock theft. Anyone with information about livestock theft may use the Crimestoppers confidential number 1800 25 00 25 to make a report if they so wish, or contact Garda&iacute; directly.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, new legislation has been put in place to target repeat burglary offenders and the Government is determined that there will be no let-up on the pressure which the Garda&iacute; are bringing to bear on the organised gangs engaged in burglary, including the mobile gangs who have targeted rural communities in various parts of the country.</p>  <p>  Underpinning the strong policing action now being taken against burglars and criminal gangs is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme. I am pleased that Budget 2019 provides for the continuation of this increase in resources with an increase of over &euro;100 million on the 2018 allocation.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, rural communities will benefit from the significant injection of policing resources provided by the Government.</p></reply>

This issue was the subject of comments submitted as part of the public consultation process. Upon review of those comments, the technical experts and regulators considered that this specific matter required separate consideration and assessment.</p>  <p>  As a result, the NSAI Gas Technical Standards Committee, at its recent meeting in November 2018, agreed to exclude this recommendation from I.S. 820. It also agreed that the establishment of a new working group, dedicated to this topic, would be more appropriate.</p>  <p>  This group will be formed early in 2019 and will aim to have stakeholder participation from other sectors of fuel types, such as gas, oil and solid fuels. One of the group&rsquo;s initial tasks will be to seek NSAI Board approval for the work and set timelines for output delivery.</p></reply>

The relevant law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles.  Receivers are appointed under a relevant security e.g. a mortgage or a charge which contains the contractual terms in relation to their appointment and their powers under the instrument.  Depending on the circumstances of the case, courts may also, on application from a secured creditor, exercise their discretionary powers to appoint a receiver.  Receivers can also be appointed under the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 in the case of mortgages created after 1 December 2009, and the Conveyancing Act 1881 for mortgages created prior to that date.</p>  <p>  Section 437 of the Companies Act 2014 confers statutory powers on the receiver of the property of a company and is intended to alleviate many of the problems which may arise from poorly drafted debentures.  However, section 437(4) makes clear that these powers are limited by any provision in the instrument under which the receiver was appointed, again underlying the essentially contractual nature of receivership.</p>  <p>  A receiver will have the right to secure and sell the property the subject of the debenture so that the debt to the lender can be repaid.  However, section 437(5) of the Act provides that the conferral of powers in relation to the property of a company does not affect any rights in relation to that property of any other person.</p>  <p>  When selling the property, a receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 of the Companies Act 2014 which provides that:</p>  <p>(i) receivers must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and</p>  <p>(ii) the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of a company to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days&rsquo; notice of his or her intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or her or who have been intimated to him or her.</p>  <p>  These statutory duties make it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property, consistent with the duty &ldquo;to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable&rdquo;. Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that receivers of the property of a company also have a duty under Part 8 of the Companies Act 2014 to provide certain information to the Registrar of Companies and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p></reply>

This included a Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market (hereinafter the &ldquo;Copyright Directive&rdquo;). </p>  <p>  The intention of the Directive is to craft modern copyright legislation suitable for all European citizens. Among the Directive&rsquo;s many proposals are provisions aimed at ensuring greater rights for press publishers seeking to protect their content online (Article 11), and intended to address the &ldquo;value gap&rdquo;, whereby rightsholders are receiving less remuneration despite the increased usage of their works (Article 13).</p>  <p>  Officials of my Department have actively engaged in negotiations since publication of this proposal. On 25 May 2018, the Copyright Directive was discussed by Ambassadors at Coreper and the Presidency gained approval for a mandate from the Council to commence negotiations with the European Parliament. The Parliament voted to endorse its approach at its plenary session on 12 September 2018. </p>  <p>  Trilogue negotiations between the European Council, the European Parliament, and the European Commission commenced in October and good progress has been made in towards crafting a compromise suitable for all three institutions of the European Union. </p>  <p>  Negotiations on the Copyright Directive have been exhaustive and the Irish position has been developed on the basis of detailed examination but also significant engagement with the wide range of stakeholders affected across the various issues in Ireland, Brussels, and with other EU Member States, including at Ministerial level. I fully support this proposal which is vitally important to both the digital economy and to rightholders seeking greater protection of their works in the digital age. Our focus has always been on achieving the best balance for the competing interests of all stakeholders, including digital economy actors, rightsholders, and citizens. </p>  <p>  Once a compromise approach has been agreed at trilogues it will be put to the European Parliament for a vote. If this final vote is successful, Ireland will then have two years to transpose the Copyright Directive into its national legislation. This transposition process will include extensive consultation with our stakeholders to ensure that Ireland has the most appropriate and suitable legislation that meets the needs of our citizens in the modern digital age.</p></reply>

These include lands at the Business &amp;amp; Technology Parks in Navan and at Donore Road on the Meath side of Drogheda.  I am hopeful that more investors can be encouraged to locate in Meath and thereby contribute even more to job creation in the County.</p><p>Meath is already home to a number of overseas companies who have shown a significant level of commitment the County, with companies such as International Fund Services (IFS) Limited, Arcroyal and Alltech continuing to perform well.  In April of this year, PCI Pharma Services announced the launch of its new facility in Stamullen which will create 50 new jobs over the next five years.</p><p>The following table sets out the number of IDA Ireland site visits to each County in Quarter 1, Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 of 2018.</p><p><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Q1 2018</th><th>Q2 2018</th><th>Q3 2018</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>69</td><td>72</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>10</td><td>14</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>135</td><td>172</td><td>154</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The overall aim of the REDF is to support every region to build on its unique strengths and ultimately create sustainable jobs. Collaboration is at its core &ndash; among the public and private sectors, within and across regions.</p><p>The REDF support the development of initiatives that help to strengthen the ability of the regions in achieving high impact on economic development, job creation and enterprise development at a regional level. </p><p>The Fund has four streams:</p><p>- Stream Oneto support major regional, multi-regional or national sectorial initiative grants of &euro;2m up to &euro;5m per project in funding towards capital and current costs. These initiatives should be focussed on achieving defined enterprise development outputs and impacts.</p><p>- Stream Twoto support significant county, regional or multi-regional sectorial and or enterprise initiative grants of &euro;250k up to &euro;2m per project in funding towards capital and current costs. These projects should be focussed on delivery of defined enterprise development outputs and impacts.</p><p>- Stream Threefor local and community enterprise initiative grants of &euro;50k up to &euro;250k per project in funding towards capital and current costs. These projects should be focussed at a local, county or regional initiative that have defined metrics for enterprise development in the area.</p><p>- Stream Fourto support significant Industry Clustering initiatives with grants of &euro;50k up to &euro;250k per project in funding towards current costs.  These projects should support industry-led groups to maximise the benefits of collaborative opportunities where the results of the activity will have some identifiable and measurable impact on their business.</p><p>Stream four in particular seeks to support Industry Clusters either already established or newly formed and designed to stimulate innovative activity through mutual interests such as promotional activities, sharing of facilities and exchange of knowledge and expertise and by contributing effectively to knowledge transfer, networking, information dissemination and collaboration among the undertakings and other organisations and relevant stakeholders in the cluster. This allows for smaller industry-connected enterprises to join such consortia in the application for funding through the REDF scheme.</p></reply>

The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, my cabinet colleagues and I have taken every opportunity to engage with EU partners and the UK to advance Ireland&rsquo;s priorities. </p><p>Of course negotiations on both the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement and political declaration on the framework for the EU-UK future relationship, both of which were endorsed by the European Council on 25 November, were conducted on behalf of the EU27 by the EU's Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and the Commission's Article 50 Taskforce. </p><p>Since taking up office as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in November 2017 I have met with various UK ministers to discuss matters of mutual interest, including in relation to trade.  The impact of Brexit on the Irish-UK trading relationship provided an important context for these discussions. </p><p>In January 2018 I met with Hilary Benn MP and a group of UK Parliamentarians to discuss issues around the UK exiting the EU. </p><p>In February 2018 I met with Minister of State at the Department for International Trade, Mr Greg Hands MP.</p><p>In April 2018 during an EI trade mission to Manchester I met with the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Mr Andy Burnham at which Brexit, among other issues, was discussed.</p><p>In June 2018, on a visit to London I met with the Secretary of State for International Trade, Mr Liam Fox MP and with the Minister of State in the Department for International Trade, Mr Greg Hands MP. This meeting agenda focused on Ireland-UK trade, EU trade policy and global trade challenges. </p><p>During my visit to London in June I also met with the Minister of State at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Ms Claire Perry MP to discuss industrial strategy and innovation. </p><p>In September 2018 in the course of a trade mission to Scotland, I met with the Scottish Minister for Trade, Investment and Innovation, Mr Ivan McKee.</p><p>At various EU Council meetings this year I have met with various EU counterparts, including UK colleagues, both formally and informally. This included meetings with the UK Minister of State for Trade and Investment, Mr Greg Hands MP and, on two occasions with the U.K. Minister of State for Trade Policy, Mr George Hollingbery MP. Maintaining the strength of the Irish-UK trading relationship was a key focus of these discussions. </p><p>My Ministerial colleagues, Ministers of State Pat Breen and John Halligan have also, at various times, met with their UK counterparts.</p><p>Minister Breen met with the following UK counterparts:</p><p>- Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Business, Energy &amp;amp; Industrial Strategy, Lord Henley in March 2018 and in May 2018; </p><p>- Scottish Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, Keith Brown MSP in March 2018; </p><p>- Minister for State for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, Margot James in April 2018; </p><p>- Scottish Minister for Trade, Investment and Innovation, Ivan McKee in August 2018;</p><p>- Minister of State for Trade Policy, Mr George Hollingbery in November 2018.</p><p>Minister Halligan met in February and May 2018 with the UK Minister for Higher Education and for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation, Sam Gyimah. </p><p>Minister Halligan also met Minister Joseph Johnson, then Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation in Tallinn, Estonia on 24th July 2017 on the margins of the Informal meeting of Research Ministers. The purpose of the meeting was to enhance the existing bilateral research and innovation cooperation and identify new areas of opportunity for UK and Irish researchers and innovators to collaborate further.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has already taken a number of key decisions on measures to support continued trade in the context of Brexit in areas of staffing, ICT and in terms of infrastructure that could be needed at our ports and airports. </p><p>In order to best support businesses, Government has also provided dedicated Brexit support measures in Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019. </p><p>Government officials are also working closely with the EU and fellow Member States to discuss and to facilitate the use of the UK as a landbridge to enable transit of goods to and from Ireland post Brexit.</p></reply>

The Strategy is to be implemented on a cost neutral basis. Each relevant Department is responsible for the implementation of their actions and the Department of Health co-ordinates a progress report on overall implementation which is produced on a periodic basis over the lifetime of the Strategy and presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. The Strategy contains actions to implement four national goals encompassing a recognition of the value and contribution made by family carers, a need to support carers to manage their own health and well-being, providing adequate information, training, supports and services, and the empowering of carers to participate as fully as possible in economic and social life.</p>  <p>  As part of the National Carers' Strategy, the Department of Health is committed to the periodic publication of progress reports, highlighting work carried out by relevant Government departments and agencies. The fifth progress report, capturing actions which took place in 2017, was published on the Department of Health's website in August 2018.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is engaging with other Departments at present with a view to the development of a revised Action Plan for the further implementation of the Strategy. Meetings have been held between the Department of Health and a number of other departments and agencies to identify additional actions which can be carried out. A stakeholder consultation on the draft Department of Health/HSE health-related proposals was undertaken at the Annual Carers Forum organised by the Department of Employment and Social Protection in November. Family Carers Ireland, the main carer representative organisation, has submitted a revised set of proposed actions for various Government Departments which will be considered in consultation with other Government Departments and the Department of the Taoiseach over the next few months with a view to agreeing a revised action plan in 2019.</p></reply>

This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

Delayed discharges result in longer lengths of stay for patients, impact on patient flow and contribute to congestion within the hospital system, including in our Emergency Departments. The purpose of the review was to identify the factors which result in delayed discharges and to identify short to medium term changes to reduce the overall number of delayed discharges in the acute hospital system.  I received the Working Group's report in November. </p>  <p>  The report made nine recommendations, including the development of a national policy to provide for a more consistent approach to recording delayed discharges, strengthening data collection, standardising definitions and ensuring consistent discharge guidelines. It also recommended a more integrated care approach between hospitals and community services, early discharge pathways to prevent admissions and enable assessment of care needs in the patient&rsquo;s home or alternative care settings and a public health campaign to raise awareness that patients who are discharged without delay have better outcomes. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to advance the recommendations of the review in 2019.</p></reply>

The Bill provides the legislative framework for a number of important patient safety issues, including providing in legislation for mandatory open disclosure of &ldquo;serious patient safety incidents&rdquo; and the notification of such incidents to the appropriate regulatory body and the State Claims Agency. The Bill also empowers the Minister for Health to issue guidance with respect to the undertaking of clinical audit against explicit clinical standards on a national basis, as well as the extension of the Health Information and Quality Authority&rsquo;s remit to private hospitals. </p>  <p>  With respect to the mandatory open disclosure of &ldquo;serious patient safety incidents&rdquo;, it is intended that the Bill will provide assurance with regard to transparency of reporting to patients and/or their families, and act as a platform for the dissemination of learning across the whole health system through the requirement for mandatory external reporting by health service providers to the appropriate authority. </p>  <p>  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the Patient Safety Bill on 26 September 2018, while the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to Government is working with my officials in drafting of the Patient Safety Bill. In parallel to the drafting process, my officials also continue to engage in wide consultation with key stakeholders. It is expected that the final draft of the Bill will be brought to Government for approval early next year.</p></reply>

Furthermore, Pembrolizumab is being assessed by the HSE using the criteria in the 2013 Act for a number of other indications for which it has received marketing authorisation. </p>  <p>  However, Pembrolizumab has not been granted a marketing authorisation by either the EMA or by HPRA for the treatment of cervical cancer and accordingly, in accordance with the 2013 Act, it cannot be assessed by HSE for reimbursement for cervical cancer, using the standard criteria.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a Government decision of 11 May 2018 put in place a package of support measures for the women and families affected by the issues related to CervicalCheck.  As part of this package, all out of pocket medical costs incurred by the women affected will be met to the extent that they are not already covered either under existing public schemes or any private health insurance policy that an individual might hold. This commitment included medicines which might not be approved for reimbursement, once they are prescribed by the treating clinician. Although not specifically referenced, Pembrolizumab would be encompassed under this aspect of the support package. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns raised by the Deputy and other public representatives regarding the question of providing Pembrolizumab to other cervical cancer patients on the same basis as encompassed by the Government decision of 11 May 2018.  In the light of these concerns, I have requested the HSE to examine ways in which other women with cervical cancer could be afforded access to Pembrolizumab if prescribed by their treating clinician. </p>  <p>  This is not a straightforward matter and there is a range of issues to be addressed in pursing such an approach.  These include the question of supply of the product and any terms (including financial ones) under which it might be supplied, the cooperation of the clinical community and the development of appropriate governance and management arrangements, the method of selection of patients suitable to commence treatment and the criteria that would govern clinical decisions in respect of continuation or discontinuation of treatment.  Any proposals must place patient safety as a priority, given that this is not a licensed medicine for the treatment of cervical cancer.</p>  <p>  I too am anxious to see early progress in this matter and I have asked the HSE to revert to me as a matter of urgency.</p></reply>

I am informed that a work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications including access to specialist diagnostic facilities such as translabial scanning is being progressed.  The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. The HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.</p>  <p>  The Department has written to the HSE to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, working in conjunction with other stakeholders.</p></reply>

As such, they are not subject to the same rigorous safety, quality and efficacy standards that are in place for medicines, nor are the producers subject to the same responsibilities as the marketing authorisation holders for authorised medicines. Whilst efficacy and safety data are not available for these products, it is crucially important to be assured, as far as possible, of the quality of these products, as advised by the HPRA.  However, the barrier to full operation is the availability of suitable product.</p>  <p>  Availability of cannabis products that are of an appropriate quality standard and are affordable to patients is clearly critical in establishing the access programme.  Department of Health officials are working intensively on this issue to ensure a supply of appropriate medical cannabis products to meet the needs of Irish patients.  However, the Department of Health has no control in relation to business decisions taken by commercial product manufacturers and has no powers to compel such companies to supply their products to Irish market.</p>  <p>  An Expert Group has drawn up clinical guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme. These guidelines are available on the Department&rsquo;s website. The guidelines contain detailed information on medical cannabis, including clinical guidance on the use of medical cannabis and guidance on which cannabis products are appropriate for medical use.</p>  <p>  Three Statutory Instruments (S.I.) made under the Misuse of Drugs Acts are required to underpin the establishment of the Access Programme.  Department officials are working on this legislation, which will be finalised when medical cannabis products become available.</p>  <p>  Pending full operation of the Access Programme, doctors may continue to utilise the Ministerial licensing route to prescribe medical cannabis for their patients.  Licences have now been granted in respect of thirteen individual patients.  Until suitable medical cannabis products are made available in Ireland, prescribers and their patients are sourcing the prescribed product from a pharmacy in The Netherlands, on foot of their medical prescription.</p></reply>

These options may include retirement villages, housing with supports projects or other initiatives. </p>  <p>  However, it is envisaged that there will always be a cohort of people for whom residential nursing home care is the most appropriate option. The main issue is the significant gap in alternative or intermediary options. This is the issue that Minister Daly wishes to address. Ultimately the model of care with regard to older people must evolve and reform, including in relation to nursing homes. This is the vision set out in Sl&aacute;intecare. </p>  <p>  In terms of my own responsibilities as Minister for Disabilities, the Deputy will be aware that the Report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo; proposes a new model of support in the community, moving people from Congregated settings to the community in line with Government policy. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>  <p>  By the end of this year, it is expected that under 2,200 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time. </p>  <p>  In the context of residents in St Mary of the Angels, any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families.

These options may include retirement villages, housing with supports projects or other initiatives. </p>  <p>  However, it is envisaged that there will always be a cohort of people for whom residential nursing home care is the most appropriate option. The main issue is the significant gap in alternative or intermediary options. This is the issue that Minister Daly wishes to address. Ultimately the model of care with regard to older people must evolve and reform, including in relation to nursing homes. This is the vision set out in Sl&aacute;intecare. </p>  <p>  In terms of my own responsibilities as Minister for Disabilities, the Deputy will be aware that the Report &ldquo;Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo; proposes a new model of support in the community, moving people from Congregated settings to the community in line with Government policy. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.</p>  <p>  By the end of this year, it is expected that under 2,200 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual&rsquo;s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time. </p>  <p>  In the context of residents in St Mary of the Angels, any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families. It will be on the basis that it will enhance their life, and anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require. </p>  <p>  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations on "Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion", I have arranged for the Deputy's question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Patients in Ireland can seek to be referred to another EU/EEA country for medical treatment that is available in the public health service in Ireland. The patient may access the overseas service in either the public or private health sector of the country they choose to receive the service in. </p>  <p>  The patient pays for the treatment and claims reimbursement from the HSE at the cost of that treatment in Ireland or the cost of it abroad, whichever is the lesser. </p>  <p>  The HSE's target for reimbursing patients for healthcare accessed abroad under the CBD is a maximum of 20 working days from receiving all the completed documents. However, the HSE have confirmed it currently takes approximately 64 days to process reimbursements. The HSE have confirmed the increase in processing times is due to a significant increase in the amount of applications received for the CBD and they are currently reviewing the appropriate resourcing requirements. </p></reply>

No. 652/2006 Health Act (Complaints Regulations 2006 with a view to enhancement of the statutory provisions for management of complaints within the health services.</p><p>- Establishment of a patient advocacy service.</p><p>Public Consultation for the Patient Safety Complaints and Advocacy Policy took place between June and November of 2017 and a report of its findings was published in July 2018.</p><p>The consultation findings were analysed and key issues emerged from the consultation, grouped under four key themes to consider in the development of effective policy.  </p><p>These themes are:</p><p>- patient centeredness,</p><p>- efficiency and responsiveness,</p><p>- capacity and capability, and</p><p>- learning for better outcomes.</p><p>Following on from that work, a tender process has recently been undertaken for the establishment of a new Patient Safety Advocacy Service.  </p><p>The Patient Safety Advocacy Service will provide free and independent advocacy in support of anyone wishing to make a formal complaint about the care or treatment they received in the health service and for anyone who has been involved in a patient safety incident.  The service will initially be focused on the public acute hospital sector.  </p><p>Work has also been undertaken to develop a competency framework, and a recognised training programme, that will be undertaken in 2019 by the advocates engaged by the new service. </p><p>My department also plans to commission the development of a code of practice and standards against which the service will be monitored, while an independent evaluation of the service will take place within three years of its establishment.  </p><p>In addition, my Department is continuing to review Statutory Instrument No. 652/2006 - Health Act 2004 (Complaints) Regulations 2006 with a view to enhancement of the statutory provisions for management of complaints within the health services and to consider the inclusion of clinical judgment in healthcare complaints. This review process will also encompass inputs from the Health Service Executive, the Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is expected that this process will conclude in 2019.</p></reply>

To this end I introduced a number of targeted measures  including:</p>  <p>  - a &euro;2.75 million Fodder Production Incentive for Tillage Farmers to encourage tillage growers to actively engage in the fodder market and there has been positive engagement with this measure</p>  <p>  - a &euro;4.25 million Fodder Import Support Measure for Autumn 2018. The measure seeks to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage. The measure operates through the Co-operatives/registered importers and will cover forage imported from 12th August 2018 to 31st December 2018. </p>  <p>  In July I secured agreement from EU Commissioner Hogan to pay higher advance Pillar 1 and 2 payments, increased to 70% and 85% respectively. In excess of &euro;1.5 billion has been paid to farmers to date under Pillar 1 and 2 since mid September. </p>  <p>  Following consultation with the EU Commission, my Department made some temporary adjustments to the GLAS scheme for this year which have the potential to add to the quantities of winter fodder available by bringing over 260,000 additional hectares into production. In addition, in consultation with my ministerial colleague Mr. Eoghan Murphy T.D., a two week extension of the closed period for the spreading of chemical and organic fertilisers was implemented that allowed farmers capitalise on autumn grass growth for fodder production. </p>  <p>  The most recent national fodder survey conducted on my behalf by Teagasc last October indicated that the national fodder shortfall has been reduced to 1% nationally.  It is clear that the various support interventions I have introduced have worked and continue to help alleviate what was a very serious fodder conservation issue on many farms during the dry summer period</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that while the deficit nationally has been reduced significantly there still remains a  fodder deficit on some farms and there is a need for farmers to remain vigilant and avoid complacency. I have urged Teagasc and the other Stakeholders to continue their individual efforts in support of those farmers worst affected and in need of help. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to closely monitor the fodder situation during the coming period.</p></reply>

From an Irish perspective we have been very consistent in urging caution in the approach to these negotiations. </p>  <p>  Apart from beef, I understand that there are issues in relation to access to the Mercosur market with respect to cars and rules of origin, geographical indications, maritime services and market access for dairy. </p>  <p>  Our position has been reiterated many times, for example by myself and by my colleague, Minister Andrew Doyle, at Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings, and by other Ministers in the relevant EU Trade policy fora. It has also been done through direct contacts with Commissioners Hogan and Malmstroem, and by the Taoiseach at European Council and through his own direct contacts, including with Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and French President Emmanuel Macron. I have also been working closely with Member State colleagues in this regard, and have remained in close contact with Commissioner Hogan on the matter.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there is a meeting of Chief Negotiators for a further round of talks from 10-13 December 2018, in Montevideo. I will continue to remain in close contact with European Commission counterparts and with Member State colleagues, to reinforce Ireland's concerns. </p>  <p>  In an overall sense there is undoubtedly a need for continued vigilance in relation to the conduct of these trade negotiations, and I will continue to insist that they are handled appropriately, and in a manner that safeguards the interests of the Irish and European beef sector. I also continue to stress that full account must be taken of the findings of the Commission&rsquo;s own assessment of the cumulative impact of trade deals on the agri food sector, and the potentially very damaging impact of Brexit on an already delicately balanced EU beef market.</p></reply>

Investment in further renewable generation will be incentivised.    The Renewable Electricity Support Scheme, approved by government in July 2018, will provide for a renewable electricity ambition of 55% by 2030, subject to determining the cost effective level which will be set out in the National Energy and Climate Plan. Currently, 30% of our electricity is generated from renewable. </p>  <p>  I have secured Government approval to develop an all of Government plan which will set out the actions which must be taken  to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. This Plan will include the steps which we must take in order to reach this target. I will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport and heat, as well as a range of other sectors.</p>  <p>  In all projected transitions to a low carbon economy by 2050, gas will continue to play a role. It plays an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the power generation, industrial and commercial, residential and transport sectors by replacing more Co2-intensive fossil fuels. In Ireland gas powered generation also provides an important back-up for intermittent renewable wind generation. </p>  <p>  So while gas usage will reduce significantly in the years ahead, Ireland will still need secure sources of gas. At present this is provided by both gas piped on shore from Irish gas fields and imports through gas pipelines from the UK. </p>  <p>  The development of an LNG facility could further enhance Ireland&rsquo;s gas security of supply by increasing import route diversity and would be compatible with the State&rsquo;s commitments to tackle climate change.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s energy policy is fully aligned with the EU&rsquo;s climate and energy objectives on the transition to decarbonisation, which includes continuous and on-going review of policies to reduce harmful emissions, improve energy efficiency, incentivise efficient and sustainable infrastructure investment, integrate markets, and promote research and innovation while ensuring our energy security of supply is maintained and enhanced.</p>  <p>  The project to which the Deputy refers is a private commercial project. Final investment decisions for the project and compliance with any legal and regulatory requirements in relation to consents or permits are the responsibility of the project promoter.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the production, sourcing, buying and selling of natural gas produced outside this jurisdiction, this is an operational matter for the undertakings involved.  Any undertaking would be required to comply with EU law in this area.</p></reply>

I will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and other relevant sectors. The new plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. The new plan will also be informed by successful approaches in other countries, where such approaches could be adapted for implementation in Ireland. </p><p>This Plan will build on the previous actions taken by Government, including in the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan, and is to be completed by early new year.</p><p>Building on the National Mitigation Plan, the publication in February of the National Development Plan reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate action and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030.</p><p>The Climate Action High Level Steering Group, which I chair and which includes representation from all relevant Government Departments and Agencies, meets at least quarterly to drive progress by sectors and agencies on the implementation of the National Mitigation Plan as well as the National Adaptation Framework. This group, in turn, reports to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, chaired by An Taoiseach.</p><p>In accordance with the framework provided by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Government must prepare and submit to the Oireachtas an Annual Transition Statement. In support of this written Statement I, along with other relevant Ministers, provided oral reports to both Houses last week. This process ensures that responsible Ministers are directly accountable to the Oireachtas to ensure real progress is made in reducing emissions in their respective sectors. </p><p>The 2018 Annual Transition Statement and accompanying update reports on the implementation of the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework are available to download on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i>www.dccae.gov.ie.</i></p></reply>

Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. A further &euro;8.6bn will be made available for investments in sustainable transport measures.   This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. Initial estimates of the potential emissions reduction contribution from full delivery of the relevant commitments in the NDP are set out in the 2018 Annual Transition Statement, published by my Department and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 3 December last. These estimates suggest a cumulative total savings in greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 22 million tonnes of CO2 over the period 2021 to 2030, when compared to the most recent emissions projections published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May 2018. Work to further refine this initial estimate is continuing in the context of the draft National Energy and Climate Plan and the EPA's 2019 emissions projections.</p>  <p>  Where the proposed commitment in the NDP is directly relevant to the achievement of Ireland&rsquo;s climate targets and specific policy assumptions can be made about the delivery of a given commitment, the cumulative effect of such commitments will be incorporated into projections included the draft National Energy and Climate Plan and in the annual emissions projections report prepared by the EPA.</p></reply>

In the context of Ireland's transition to a low carbon energy future, it is accepted that Ireland will continue to need oil and particularly gas for quite some time, though their use must significantly reduce. Ending all future oil and gas exploration in Irish waters and placing a full moratorium on exploration activity would not impact the amount of emissions Ireland creates by burning fossil fuels; rather it will commit Ireland to source all of its oil and gas from abroad. </p>  <p>  The Government's approach to tackle emissions from fossil fuels is to focus efforts on energy efficiency and renewable energy which make essential contributions to all of the major objectives of climate and energy policies, including improved competitiveness, security of supply, sustainability, and the transition to a low carbon economy.</p>  <p>  Minister Bruton has secured Government approval to develop an all of Government plan which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding occasional speculative comment as to the potential of the Irish offshore in terms of oil and gas, it is only through active exploration that such potential will be proven. Ireland&rsquo;s offshore remains underexplored with only a fraction of the exploration experience of Norway and the UK.</p>  <p>  Early exploration efforts viewed the petroleum geology of the Irish offshore as being comparable to that of the North Sea. However, lack of success from drilling efforts in the 1970s and 1980s led to a decline in interest. However, industry perspectives have been transformed in recent years. While the North Sea comparison retains potential, two new possibilities have also emerged. Successful exploration off the Atlantic coasts of Africa and South America has stimulated new interest in the prospectivity of the Atlantic margins, with new data, analysis and targets. Research on the Newfoundland-Ireland conjugate margins has demonstrated the potential for Ireland to replicate the oil and gas success of Newfoundland-Labrador exploration.</p>  <p>  Marine industrial activities, such as oil and gas exploration and production, require careful assessment, management and regulation in order to protect the marine environment.</p>  <p>  In advance of the 2015 Atlantic Margin Licencing Round, my Department undertook the Irish Offshore Strategic Environmental Assessment (IOSEA) 5 Environmental Report in respect of oil and gas exploration activities in the Irish offshore. Policy in respect of exploration activities carried out under a petroleum authorisation is informed by IOSEA5.</p>  <p>  Proposals to carry out exploration or production activities on a petroleum authorisation in the Irish offshore, for example the acquisition of seismic or the drilling of a well, are subject to assessment of compliance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive. In addition, the observations of the National Parks and Wildlife Service regarding potential impacts on Annex IV Protected Species and sites protected under the Birds and Habitats legislation are sought. </p>  <p>  The recent completion of the ObSERVE Programme led by my Department has highlighted the rich diversity of cetaceans and seabirds in the Irish offshore. The findings of the Programme are already informing the environmental aspects of decision making in respect of applications for exploration activities. </p>  <p>  Scientific research regarding the potential for exploration activities to have an adverse impact on plankton and fish with trophic links to cetaceans is limited and not settled. My Department is mindful of the need to keep abreast of current international research projects in this regard. </p></reply>

The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) 406/2009/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020 for these non-ETS sectors. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their levels in 2005. </p><p>For the period to 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sets out binding annual emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will require a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. In addition to the specific target for 2030, the ESR also imposes annual emissions ceilings for each Member State over the period 2021-2030. These annual ceilings therefore determine the Member State's carbon budget for the period. </p><p>I have recently received a mandate from Government to begin the preparation of a new All of Government Plan to bring about a step change in our climate ambition over the next decade, and beyond. My vision is that this new Plan will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. It will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. </p><p>I am currently working with my officials to develop proposals for the new plan, and I will shortly be engaging with my colleagues across Government in this regard. These actions will cover: </p><p>- Regulatory framework</p><p>- Adoption of known technologies</p><p>- Addressing market failure</p><p>- Driving change in business models</p><p>- The public sector leading by example, and</p><p>- Engaging with citizens and communities</p><p>In developing this Plan, each of the recommendations of the Citizens Assembly and the Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action, will be considered.</p></reply>

The publication on 8 October of the Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the impacts of global warming of 1.5⁰  C confirms the absolute urgency of achieving deep cuts in our greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades. </p>  <p>  Ireland has fully supported the level of ambition in recent negotiations to reform the EU ETS and to put in place Member State targets for non-ETS sectors under the EU Effort Sharing Regulation. Ireland also continues to support high ambition in on-going negotiations at EU level in relation to emissions standards for both Light- and Heavy-Duty Vehicles. I consider it essential that the EU seeks high ambition in all of its sectorial policies and targets for 2030, which will be essential in supporting individual Member States to achieve their respective targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation and may enable the EU as a whole to achieve emissions reductions by 2030 in excess of the 40% reduction on 1990 levels already committed to by the European Council.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports strong EU ambition in order to contribute to the Paris Agreement objectives. It is vital that the EU long-term strategy to be adopted on foot of the European Commission&rsquo;s recent proposals can be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with all Member States participating in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness, cost-effectiveness and solidarity. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, any revision to interim targets for 2030 would also need to take into account our specific socio-economic circumstances, including our large agriculture sector, light industrial base, small ETS sector, and dispersed settlement patterns.  </p>  <p>  I have recently secured Government approval to prepare an All of Government Plan which will set out the actions which must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. I will work with colleagues across Government to develop new initiatives across electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and other relevant sectors. The new plan will have a strong focus on implementation, including actions with clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each action, assigning clear lines of responsibility for delivery. The new plan will also be informed by successful approaches in other countries, where such approaches could be adapted for implementation in Ireland. This Plan will build on the previous actions taken by Government, including in the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan, and is to be completed by the end of February 2019.</p></reply>

Ireland has a national safety regime for such fishing vessels which is based on the Torremolinos Convention and EU Directive 97/70, as amended. </p>  <p>  The registration process of another State does not come under the remit of this Department. However to ensure compliance with the relevant maritime safety regime, Ireland raised a safety alert in 2013 with the Committee on Safe Seas (COSS) which  deals with EU maritime matters  and also brought it to the attention of the European Commission. The net point of that alert was that there was likely a number of other similar sister vessels across the EU which would pose similar safety based risks.  I am aware that the European Commission communicated this risk to other relevant Member States and also attempted to secure some clarification with parties involved with the initial testing of the vessel.</p></reply>

I met him, again at my request, on the margins of Transport Council in Brussels on 5 December 2017, and most recently, at the Secretary of State&rsquo;s request, I met him in Dublin on 8 November 2018. </p>  <p>  In relation to the most recent meeting, the parameters of the discussion were clearly communicated to the Secretary of State in advance, in particular the need to  fully respect the mandate of the EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator in negotiating for the MS27 and that the discussion could not stray into the area of negotiations. </p>  <p>  At that meeting of 8 November, the Secretary of State Grayling outlined the key areas of concern for the UK in relation to transport.  For my part, I set out the importance of continued transport connectivity between Ireland and the UK, including in relation to ports, aviation, road transport, and cross-border rail.  I stressed the importance of finalising the Withdrawal Agreement, highlighted the importance of the UK landbridge for Ireland as a route to European markets, and the need for Irish trade to move efficiently through ports.    </p>  <p>  I stressed that as regards the future EU-UK relationship, Ireland wants to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK, across a range of areas including transport. At the same time, I re-iterated the importance of preserving the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market and that the EU&rsquo;s regulatory autonomy is respected.</p></reply>

In particular it is a challenge to mothers returning to work and single parent families.  Due to decades of underinvestment, we have inherited one of the most expensive models of early learning and care in Europe.  But this is changing. </p><p>Record numbers of families availed of Government subsidies to reduce this cost for families; including more than 40,000 children registered for the universal, non means tested subsidy of up to &euro;1,040 per year whilst tens of thousands of families that needed it most received subsidies of up to &euro;145 per week deducted from their childcare fees. This year the rise in cost charged for childcare was 2%, half of what was experienced the previous year. </p><p>In addition the number of children participating in the ECCE (free pre-school) scheme has doubled; whilst the scheme itself has lengthened to 76 weeks per child. </p><p>Earlier this year the Oireachtas signed the Childcare Support Act; putting the entitlement to financial support for childcare on a legislative footing for the first time. </p><p>In 2019, we will launch the Affordable Childcare Scheme, a radical new approach to how families access financial support towards quality early learning and care. </p><p>It will take time to deliver the world class system of early learning and care that families deserve but I am confident that we are moving swiftly in the right direction to achieve this goal. </p><p>Table: Cost charged for childcare - County by County</p><p><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Full day care</th><th>Part-time care</th><th>Sessional</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown</td><td>&euro;233.26</td><td>&euro;127.45</td><td>&euro;86.26</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>&euro;206.67</td><td>&euro;104.27</td><td>&euro;68.68</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; Fingal</td><td>&euro;206.25</td><td>&euro;115.23</td><td>&euro;71.44</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; South Dublin</td><td>&euro;202.25</td><td>&euro;116.92</td><td>&euro;72.17</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>&euro;200.21</td><td>&euro;102.47</td><td>&euro;71.77</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin &ndash; Dublin City</td><td>&euro;195.79</td><td>&euro;115.71</td><td>&euro;71.90</td></tr><tr><td>Cork County</td><td>&euro;192.37</td><td>&euro;108.57</td><td>&euro;71.06</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>&euro;183.52</td><td>&euro;100.68</td><td>&euro;68.80</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>&euro;181.39</td><td>&euro;113.42</td><td>&euro;73.59</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>&euro;172.17</td><td>&euro;90.24</td><td>&euro;62.01</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>&euro;172.12</td><td>&euro;101.05</td><td>&euro;68.69</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>&euro;167.97</td><td>&euro;90.50</td><td>&euro;69.45</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>&euro;167.22</td><td>&euro;100.98</td><td>&euro;59.92</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>&euro;166.34</td><td>&euro;97.30</td><td>&euro;67.69</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>&euro;164.46</td><td>&euro;103.04</td><td>&euro;66.85</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>&euro;162.00</td><td>&euro;102.33</td><td>&euro;68.01</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>&euro;159.87</td><td>&euro;88.61</td><td>&euro;66.46</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>&euro;159.44</td><td>&euro;96.29</td><td>&euro;67.33</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>&euro;159.00</td><td>&euro;90.12</td><td>&euro;67.98</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>&euro;157.72</td><td>&euro;90.54</td><td>&euro;67.50</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>&euro;157.24</td><td>&euro;88.94</td><td>&euro;61.55</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>&euro;156.94</td><td>&euro;91.13</td><td>&euro;63.21</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>&euro;156.54</td><td>&euro;75.00</td><td>&euro;62.14</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>&euro;156.40</td><td>&euro;85.04</td><td>&euro;64.26</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>&euro;155.08</td><td>&euro;92.02</td><td>&euro;67.33</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>&euro;153.48</td><td>&euro;98.47</td><td>&euro;74.11</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>&euro;151.00</td><td>&euro;85.55</td><td>&euro;63.69</td></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>&euro;149.53</td><td>&euro;84.29</td><td>&euro;70.02</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>&euro;147.97</td><td>&euro;80.12</td><td>&euro;64.35</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>&euro;146.56</td><td>&euro;88.68</td><td>&euro;63.31</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;177.92</td><td>&euro;101.82</td><td>&euro;68.95</td></tr></table></p></reply>

AIM is a child-centred model, involving seven levels of progressive support, moving from the universal to the targeted, based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting the child is attending. AIM is administered by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. </p>  <p>  AIM Level 4 support is a targeted support that provides expert advice and mentoring for pre-school practitioners from a team of dedicated AIM Early Years Specialists. These staff are based in Better Start, the National Early Years Quality Development Service. </p>  <p>  AIM Level 7 provides additional assistance in the pre-school room where this is critical to ensuring a child&rsquo;s participation in the ECCE Programme. In line with emerging best practice to support the integration and independence of children with a disability, AIM does not fund Special Needs Assistants (SNAs). Rather, it provides financial support to the pre-school provider, which can be used either to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room or to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. Accordingly, Level 7 assistance is a shared resource for the pre-school setting. </p>  <p>  The pre-school service referred to in the question has been granted AIM Level 4 and AIM Level 7 support in respect of children attending the service in the 2018/2019 ECCE year.</p>  <p>  The pre-school service submitted a review request to Pobal in relation to the level of AIM support granted to a number of children attending the service on 29th November 2018. This review request was acknowledged on 3rd December 2018. Pobal has advised the applicant that a decision will be made within 25 working days of receipt of the review request.</p></reply>

Therefore the provision of aftercare services should not be seen as an event, but something that builds on the skills and capacity that young people have learned and developed during their time in care.</p><p>Tusla has undertaken an extensive review of policy as it relates to Aftercare Service Provision and developed a suite of policies and guidance documents to support the delivery of aftercare services.</p><p>Legislative provision for aftercare has been strengthened by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015, which imposed a statutory duty on Tusla to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person, following an assessment of need. The Act created an explicit statement of Tusla&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports. An eligible child for the purpose of this statutory entitlement is any child who has spent 12 months in the care of the State in the 5 years between the ages of 13 and 18 years  old, while an eligible adult is any young person aged 18, 19 or 20 who has spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and 18 years. Specific legislative provision is in place for aftercare to continue until a young person is 23 years of age where they are finishing a course of education. </p><p>Aftercare encompasses a range of services, which can include direct financial support in the form of the aftercare allowance. The purpose of the allowance is to cover the day to day costs associated in supporting a young person as they progress in education or accredited training.</p><p>To qualify for an aftercare allowance at 18 years of age an eligible adult must be attending an accredited education course or training programme as outlined in their aftercare plan, and agree to engage with aftercare service requirements and provide updates on their progress.</p><p>Tusla does not collect the number of young people who seek or receive an aftercare allowance for the purpose of supporting them in education/accredited training.Tusla does however maintain records of those who are in education/accredited training.  All young adults who are in accredited training/education are entitled to financial support for this purpose  <b>.</b></p><p>At the end of September 2018, there were 1,257 young persons in aftercare in education/accredited training.</p><p>It should be noted that aftercare is a service for adults, and their engagement with Tusla in relation to aftercare is purely on a voluntary basis. Tusla has no power to oblige a young person to avail of the support offered.</p><p>The number of young people who have left the care of Tusla upon reaching 18 years of age in each of the years 2015 to 2017 is set out in tabular form.</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>2015 </th><th>2016 </th><th>2017 (provisional data awaiting validation) </th></tr><tr><td>Young persons who left State care (i.e., those discharged on reaching 18 years) </td><td>470 </td><td>490 </td><td>503* </td></tr></table></p></reply>

It is clear that if we are to successfully encourage people to return to living in town centres, an integrated solution involving all aspects of town living and supporting infrastructure, needs to be considered.</p><p>The Steering Group therefore agreed that a pilot scheme, which takes a holistic approach to town centre living, should be developed in a small number of towns initially, with a view to a wider roll-out over time.  This approach, which I approved, will allow a number of Local Authorities to develop and test different models which they feel are appropriate to a small number of selected towns of different sizes and in different locations.  The learnings from this approach will help to provide an indication as to what might work well for similar types of town on a wider scale.</p><p>Six rural towns were invited to participate in the initial pilot scheme.  They are: </p><p>1. Boyle, Co Roscommon</p><p>2. Callan, Co Kilkenny</p><p>3. Ballinrobe, Co Mayo</p><p>4. Banagher, Co Offaly</p><p>5. Castleblayney, Co Monaghan</p><p>6. Cappoquin, Co Waterford.</p><p>Each of these towns will receive funding of up to &euro;100,000 to engage with their communities and local businesses, and arrive at practical solutions that can be delivered to achieve the objective of increasing the number of people living in our rural towns.</p><p>Representatives from each of the six Local Authorities involved in the pilot recently met with my Department to begin the process of developing the detailed schemes.  It is envisaged that the solutions identified through the six pilot towns will lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund in due course.</p></reply>

The work done by these committees is of great value to local communities and we should all be grateful for the effort they make in our towns and villages.</p>  <p>  Voluntary and community groups may also be able to access funding under the CL&Aacute;R Programme and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.</p>  <p>  Funding may also be available under the LEADER Programme to support community and voluntary groups in rural Ireland. The Kildare Local Action Group (LAG) have been allocated &euro;5,261,600 over the 2014-2020 programming period and applications for funding can be made to the LAG.</p>  <p>  The Seniors Alert Scheme provides personal monitored alarms to enable older people, of limited means, to continue to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind. The Scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by Pobal, with applicants applying via community organisations operating in their local area. Since Pobal took over the administration of the Scheme in September 2015, 16 community organisations have been approved to operate the Scheme in Co. Kildare.</p>  <p>  Further information on all funding programmes and schemes is available on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Volunteering plays a critical in empowering individuals to become more involved in their communities and is proven to assist with the development of mental health well-being.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development and Framework Policy for Local and Community Development include a range of measures which will contribute significantly to addressing isolation and social inclusion in both rural and urban areas and as Minister for Rural and Community Development I will continue to advocate for a cross government approach to ensuring the rural and community voice is heard in relation to matters of policy.</p><p>Specific examples of actions being delivered by my Department which are helping those who feel isolated or vulnerable in communities include:</p><p>- Significant investment in the Seniors Alert Scheme, which facilitates valuable community-basedsupport for vulnerable older people living alone. To the end of October, spend on the Scheme amounted to &euro;5.5 million, with over 16,000 applications for personal alarms approved so far this year. This is an important programme which enables older persons of limited means to continue to live in their own homes at the heart of their communities with confidence, independence and peace of mind.</p><p>- The new five-year Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme, or SICAP, which commenced at the start of 2018, is our country&rsquo;s primary social inclusion intervention. This is a national programme that will be delivered locally with funding of &euro;190 million over a five-year period to help those in the greatest need.</p><p>- Support for approximately 350 Men&rsquo;s Sheds across Ireland which provide a safe space where men can gather and participate in their communities, develop social networks and potentially gain new skills and access information. In July I provided funding of &euro;500,000 to support the work of Men&rsquo;s Sheds throughout Ireland.</p><p>In addition, other actions in the Action Plan for Rural Development being delivered by Departments across government that will help those who feel isolated or vulnerable include:</p><p>- Investment of &euro;46 million in Garda fleet to ensure that Garda&iacute; are mobile, visible and responsive to prevent and tackle crime.</p><p>- Maintaining the network of senior helplines in operation throughout the country, which offer a listening service for older people to help address issues such as loneliness and isolation in rural areas.</p><p>- Continued support and prioritisation of community crime prevention through schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Text Alert.</p><p>- Continued improvements in the Rural Transport Programme, including the provision of new routes.</p></reply>

Achieving this goal requires a mix of policy initiatives and funding schemes to improve both economic development and to address gaps in meeting the social needs in rural areas, including isolated rural areas. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Rural Development, published in January 2017, represents a significant whole-of-Government approach to addressing identified challenges facing rural Ireland. The Action Plan is fully aligned with the strategic objective set out in the National Planning Framework focused on strengthening our rural economies and communities, and enabling all areas of the country to reach their full potential. </p>  <p>  My own Department delivers a range of programmes which promote and support sustainable communities throughout Ireland.  For example:</p>  <p>  - The Town and Village Renewal Scheme supports the revitalisation of rural towns and villages, with particular focus on projects which have a clear positive economic impact on local communities. In total, almost &euro;53 million has been approved for more than 670 projects across the country under the Town and Village Renewal Scheme since it was introduced in the second half of 2016.</p>  <p>  - The CL&Aacute;R programme is a targeted investment programme for rural areas which provides funding for small infrastructural projects and other initiatives in areas that have experienced significant levels of population decline. More than 1,250 projects have been approved for total funding of &euro;26.9 million since I relaunched the programme in 2016.</p>  <p>  - The &euro;250 million LEADER rural development programme includes a specific pillar focused on social inclusion.</p>  <p>  - The Seniors Alert Scheme provides grant assistance towards the purchase and installation of personal monitored alarms for older people to enable them to live securely in their own homes. This is particularly valuable for older people living alone in isolated rural communities.</p>  <p>  My Department maintains ongoing contact with stakeholders to identify issues that affect both urban and rural communities.  </p>  <p>  My Department is also co-hosting a series of seminars on rural issues with the Royal Irish Academy, focusing on the themes of economic development, social inclusion and sustainable rural communities.  These seminars will culminate in the publication of a research report on issues impacting rural communities.  The first of these seminars took place in Galway in November and will be followed by two further events early in 2019.</p></reply>

The Taskforce published its final report in December 2016, which set out 40 actions aimed at addressing the issues associated with mobile phone and broadband connectivity, particularly in rural areas.</p>  <p>  An Implementation Group, co-ordinated by my Department was established in early 2017 to ensure that the actions identified by the Taskforce are implemented in a timely manner. That Group published its first progress review in February of this year, highlighting a number of significant achievements which have been made. The review can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website, www.drcd.gov.ie.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the actions directly under my Department's remit, the appointment of Broadband Officers in each Local Authority, which my Department co-finances, is impacting positively on increased levels of communications with the telecoms industry and in identifying and addressing barriers to the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure.  This has seen a tangible increase in broadband connections and the resolution of a number of mobile phone blackspots in rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  Regular meetings of the Regional Action Group are held across the country, bringing together Local Authority Broadband Officers and providing opportunities to share knowledge and experiences and to investigate issues that will impact on the provision of rural telecommunications services.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department, in cooperation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, are exploring the feasibility of developing a standardised policy for accessing and utilising State assets for the deployment of telecoms infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Outside of the work of the Implementation Group, my Department has provided funding to support the establishment of a mobile phone mast in Malin Beg, Co. Donegal. The residents of Malin Beg have never had a reliable mobile phone signal, leaving them at a distinct disadvantage. Thanks to the efforts of local community and the local authority, they will soon have coverage.</p>  <p>  My Department also co-ordinated and supported Local Authority applications for the European Commission's WiFi4EU initiative. This programme will see EU funds made available for the provision of free, publically accessible WiFi.  In the inaugural round of funding announced last week, 21 Irish Local Authorities secured funding for 59 projects under the scheme, worth &euro;885,000 in total.  My Department will make matching funds of up to &euro;15,000 available for each of these projects, to support Local Authorities as they make free internet connectivity available to the public. </p></reply>

The current position is that these sections need to be amended, to correct technical errors, and have yet to be commenced. My intention is to correct these technical errors by means of Committee Stage amendments to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, which I hope to see taken early in the new year.</p>  <p>  Commencement of these provisions is also dependent on commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health. In this regard, the Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Bill 2018 was enacted on 24 July 2018. It was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015, which will facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act. There are important administrative and operational arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the implementation of Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3, including the establishment of the National Donor-Conceived Person Register and the appointment of authorised persons under the Act. I know that it is Minister for Health's intention that Parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 of the Act will be commenced as soon as possible.   </p>  <p>  In order to progress this, officials from the General Register Office, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Department of Health are working together to ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory, and operational, mechanisms are in place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all of the relevant legislation that will allow for birth registrations of donor-conceived children.  </p></reply>

If, subsequent to the death of a customer, it comes to light that not all of the deceased&rsquo;s means were properly disclosed, the Department will seek to recover any monies overpaid from the estate of the deceased.</p>  <p>  Under s.339 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended, the personal representative of a deceased person who was at any time in receipt of a means-tested payment is obliged to give notice to the Department of their intention to distribute the assets of the estate and to provide a schedule of the assets of the  estate.</p>  <p>  The Department issues a notification to the deceased's personal representative advising them of their obligations under law.  If there is an estate to be distributed, a schedule of assets must be provided to the Department.  The personal representative is instructed not to distribute the estate without formal clearance from the Department.</p>  <p>  The statement of assets is examined to see if there are assets which were previously not declared to the Department by the deceased.  In the event that there are none, the personal representative will be informed and can proceed to distribute the estate.  A social welfare inspector may be tasked with making enquiries and to provide a report to support the assessment process.</p>  <p>  If assets were previously not declared, the Department will calculate the value of any monies paid in excess of entitlements and seek the recovery of same before the estate is distributed.  Any decisions made that the personal representative is dissatisfied with may be reviewed at their request.  The personal representative has a right to appeal any decision made to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </p>  <p>  In seeking to recover an overpayment from the estate, the value of the estate is reduced by the (reasonable) funeral expenses for which the estate is liable and full recovery of the debt is sought from the remaining assets.  In cases of insolvent estates, full recovery may not be possible.</p>  <p>  When all monies have been recovered, a letter of clearance allowing the distribution of the estate will issue to the personal representative. In the event of failure to comply with the provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended, or to make efforts to pay back the sums overpaid, the Department reserves a right to prosecute under the Act and/or to seek civil recovery through the Courts.  Given the costs and time involved, the parties generally agree a negotiated resolution. Where there are no remaining assets in an estate, the outstanding balance that cannot be recovered may be written-off.</p>  <p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is based on a claimant's social insurance contributions and is not means tested. To qualify for award of Invalidity Pension a claimant must satisfy both PRSI contribution and medical conditions. </p>  <p>  Invalidity Pension is for people who are permanently incapable of work and is generally paid to pension age. To qualify for Invalidity Pension a person must have an incapacity for work of such a nature that the likelihood is that the claimant will be incapable of work for life, or an incapacity which has existed for 12 months prior to the date of claim, and where the Deciding Officer or an Appeals Officer is satisfied that the claimant is likely to be unable to work for 1 year from the date of claim.</p>  <p>  Where a person with a disability wishes to return to work they may apply for Partial Capacity Benefit (PCB).   PCB allows people to continue to receive a percentage of their Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment while working. Participation on the PCB scheme is voluntary. A person who participates on the PCB scheme may return to an Illness Benefit or Invalidity Pension payment if, for example, the employment ceases or if the person cannot continue to work.</p>  <p>  It is not intended to change the Invalidity Pension payment to remove the requirement to apply for Partial Capacity Benefit where persons wish to take up paid employment.</p></reply>

As of end October 2018, 24,185 clients who are working part-time have engaged with the service. </p>  <p>  At present, a full econometric evaluation of the service is being conducted in conjunction with the OECD.  The results of this econometric evaluation, which will provide detailed and robust statistics, will inform my Department's consideration of any future developments in this area. </p></reply>

The LES have been engaged to deliver services to two client groups: unemployed jobseekers referred for activation by the Department and &lsquo;other&rsquo; client groups, who attend the service voluntarily.  The &lsquo;other&rsquo; client  group include people who have a disability, lone parents, early school leavers, qualified adults, non-Live Register returners (previously women returners), ex-offenders, members of the travelling community, long term unemployed (LTU) refugees and low income small holders.  </p><p>In 2016, LES providers were asked to increase the frequency with which they engage with activation jobseekers to enhance the quality of the services they provide. To facilitate this more intensive engagement, the Department began to reduce the number of people referred to the LES so as to achieve and maintain a maximum caseload 120:1 per case officer.</p><p>The LES were also requested to increase the time they allocate to work with each individual jobseeker and in 2017  set engagement patterns were introduced so that a LES case officer with 101-120 clients would be expected to have monthly meetings with the clients, 81-100 clients every three weeks and 80 or fewer client every two weeks.</p><p>The following table below shows the number of activation clients and &lsquo;other&rsquo; clients notified as commencing employment of 30+ hours per week in 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018.</p><p><table><tr><th></th><th>Number of Activation Clients notified as being in employment of 30+   hours per week.</th><th>Number of Activation &lsquo;other&rsquo; clients notified as being in employment   of 30+ hours per week</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>7,458*</td><td>1,153</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>4,923*</td><td>991</td></tr><tr><td>To date 2018</td><td>4,800*</td><td>973</td></tr></table></p><p>*Unlike JobPath there is no requirement for the client to be 'off benefit' in order to qualify as a placement.</p></reply>

The economy is recovering strongly and will underpin employment growth and the availability of productive work for those on the Live Register. The Action Plan for Jobs sets out Ireland&rsquo;s policies in support of enterprise and employment growth. The most recent Pathways to Work<b><i></i></b>strategy, for the period 2016-2020, continues to focus on addressing long-term and youth unemployment by introducing new measures to ensure that the long-term and young unemployed take up a substantial share of the jobs being created by economic recovery. The strategy includes some additional actions, which are ongoing or have been completed, in relation to addressing long-term and youth unemployment:</p><p>- the roll out of JobPath  to engage more systematically with this group; the JobPath service  has provided activation support to over 180,000 long term jobseekers since  its inception in 2015. Jobseekers have benefitted from intensive engagement with a personal advisor to assist their return to employment.</p><p>- targeted wage subsidies  under JobsPlus, including JobsPlus Youth; </p><p>- reserved places for the  long term unemployed on employment and training programmes. (Latest available data indicates that approximately 55,000 people are availing of a range of activation programmes targeted primarily at the long term  unemployed);  </p><p>- the continued provision of activation services to the long term unemployed by Local Employment Services and Jobclubs. In 2018, 26,000 customers have engaged with these services; and</p><p>-  the launch of the Youth Employment Support  Scheme (YESS) targeted specifically at young jobseekers who are long-term unemployed or who face significant barriers to gaining employment.  YESS provides young jobseekers with the opportunity to learn basic work  and social skills in a supportive environment while on a work placement,  helping them to increase their employment prospects. </p><p>Latest available data from the CSO Labour Force Survey shows that the number of persons recorded as working part-time, but underemployed, was 115,800 in the third quarter of 2018, representing a decrease of 4.5% in year on year terms  from the third quarter of 2017. This cohort currently represent approximately 4.8% of the total labour force (2.417m).</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Public Employment Service (PES) is managed by my Department and delivered directly by the Intreo service to provide a range of activation and employment support services to those who wish to avail of its services, on a walk-in basis. It is a priority of my Department  to deliver the necessary supports and innovations to facilitate a fair chance to gain work, particularly full-time work,  as more and more jobs become available.</p><p>November 2018 saw a continued trend downwards in the number of people on the Live Register to 196,261 &ndash; representing a year on year decrease of 15.8% since November 2017, and a  decrease of almost 30% over a two year period.  </p><p>On a seasonally adjusted basis, the Live Register total recorded a monthly decrease of 3,100 people (-1.5%) in November 2018, bringing the seasonally adjusted total to 207,200. The number on the seasonally adjusted Live Register in November 2018 is also the lowest number recorded since May 2008 (when it was 201,756).</p><p>The Live Register trend for young people is similar, with the number of claimants aged 18-24 declining from 80,000 in 2011 to approximately 20,000 in November 2018. Since 2011, the month-on-month decline in Live Register numbers has been more rapid for the under 25 year cohort than for those over 25.</p><p>Three out of five people on the Live Register are now classified as short term claimants.

They are not employees of my Department or public servants, and as such were not subject to pay reductions under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) which only applied to public servants.  My Department funds wages and training costs in respect of CE participants and supervisors &ndash; it does not and has not provided provision for funding for CE supervisor pensions.</p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the issue of CE supervisor pensions is being examined by a Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  A number of Departments, including my own Department, are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal.</p>  <p>  A detailed scoping exercise was carried out with input from the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES) on the potential costs of providing Exchequer support for the establishment of such a pension scheme for employees across the Community and Voluntary sector in Ireland.  The exercise clearly illustrated that this matter presents very significant issues for the Exchequer, with a potential cost to the State of &euro;188 million per annum in respect of funding to enable an employer pension contribution in State funded Community and Voluntary organisations, excluding any provision for immediate ex-gratia lump sum payment of pension as sought, which could, depending on the size of the sector, entail a further Exchequer cost of up to &euro;318 million. </p>  <p>  I am very conscious that any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources.</p></reply>

The Council met on 28 occasions. </p>  <p>  Membership of the Council comprised of industry, trade union and policy experts appointed on the basis of their knowledge of labour market and employment policy.  The Council in particular focused on providing advice regarding the evaluation  of the impact, effectiveness and efficiency of measures implemented as part of the Pathways to Work strategy, and other relevant labour market policies aimed at supporting unemployed individuals to access employment.  It also provided policy advice on all matters concerning the delivery, engagement and awareness of employer supports in relation to the implementation of Pathways to Work, my Department&rsquo;s Employer Engagement Strategy and other relevant labour market policies aimed at supporting unemployed individuals and other priority groups to access employment, while meeting the requirements of employers and the business community. </p>  <p>  Given the fact that unemployment is now at 5.3% the challenge faced by the Department is changing from primarily responding to unemployment to increasing participation. In this regard the Department continues to engage with relevant stakeholders to inform its approach to developing its public employment services, with an emphasis on maintaining a quality service not just to unemployed jobseekers but increasingly to other client groups of the Department, including people with disabilities.  For example, the Department as part of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, established a Make Work Pay Inter-Departmental Group chaired by Professor Frances Ruane comprising representatives from key Departments, agencies and three independent experts. This group reported in 2017 and its recommendations are now being followed up including via a consultative forum of key stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Minister for Education and Skills established the National Skills Council in April 2017. This council is charged with ensuring that Ireland can anticipate and respond to current, future and rapidly changing skills needs across all sectors in the labour market  while developing and retaining workplace talent.  Membership of the National Skills Council is, as was the case with the Labour Market Council, representative of the key stakeholders with interest in labour market developments. The Department is represented on this council.</p>  <p>  Against this background the Department is currently considering what consultative structures would be useful that will add value to its work in developing public employment services.</p></reply>

Together with delivering more affordable and predictable rents, cost rental will make a sustainable impact on national competitiveness and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.  </p>  <p>  As laid out in the National Planning Framework, the Government is planning for an expected population increase of almost one million people by 2040. This growth will necessitate the delivery of some 500,000 new homes over the next 20 years. The State will be proactive in contributing to the delivery of the housing that we need by 2040 and cost rental will need to form a significant part of Ireland's housing system in the future. </p>  <p>  Under the cost rental model, minimising retained earnings, land and other delivery costs, while securing very competitive European Investment Bank (EIB) financing, means that affordable rents can be achieved. The final rents, for any given project, will be set after all associated costs are determined, following on from the competitive construction and management tender processes. Cost rental homes will be targeted at households earning low to moderate incomes up to a maximum of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants. </p>  <p>  Cost rental is new to Ireland and in order to drive delivery, a number of important early mover projects are being advanced, delivering important lessons in terms of cost rental in an Irish setting. There are two pilot cost rental schemes being advanced: one at Enniskerry Road, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and one at Emmet Road in Inchicore. It is expected that 50 cost rental units and 105 social homes will be made available on the Enniskerry Road site. While the final tenure-mix on the Emmet Road site will be decided by Dublin City Council and informed by the detailed site development process, it will likely include 140 social housing homes, with the remaining 330 homes predominantly provided by the City Council under cost rental arrangements.  </p>  <p>  The tenders are currently being assessed for the Enniskerry Road Project, and it is anticipated that construction will commence in the first quarter of 2019. With regard to the Emmet Road site, while this project is at an earlier stage of development, Dublin City Council has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to drive the project forward. In addition to pre-existing consultative arrangements, the Council is also facilitating a special Consultative Forum specifically for this project. </p>  <p>  Cost rental will initially be managed on an administrative basis, and my Department is preparing a draft administrative cost rental framework in collaboration with the Housing Agency and the local authorities involved in the pilot projects. The invaluable learning from these pathfinder projects will inform further cost rental projects to be rolled out across other suitable sites. My Department is also working with the European Investment Bank to leverage its advisory and research capacity so that broader international lessons on the operation of cost rental can inform Ireland's approach.</p>  <p>  With regard to the funding and financing arrangements, I have made it clear that direct Exchequer funding will be provided for any social housing element of these mixed-tenure developments. Indeed, part of the Emmet Road site has been identified as a &ldquo;Housing with Support&rdquo; demonstrator model under Rebuilding Ireland and will deliver 52 homes, due for completion in 2020. This element of the Emmet Road project has been approved for funding of circa &euro;15 million under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme, with a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the HSE/Department of Health towards additional communal facilities for the residents. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Government has made &euro;310m available to local authorities to fund facilitating infrastructure to deliver affordable housing from its sites. The funding is available for cost rental projects and will contribute to reducing costs even further.  The terms of any loan funding arrangements put in place for individual projects will be determined on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaging with the National Development Finance Agency and the new Land Development Agency to examine the optimum funding and delivery options to support cost rental delivery at scale.</p></reply>

Through the continued delivery on the ambitious programme of action set out in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness, the State intends to fully meet its obligations to those who need a home.</p>  <p>  Separately, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, continues to implement a range of measures  to ensure that there will be the required number of construction workers in place to support the delivery of the Rebuilding Ireland programme. These measures include:</p>  <p>  - educational and training programmes, which aim to develop the skills of apprentices in order to meet the needs of industry and the labour market;</p>  <p>  - expanding the range of apprenticeships on  offer to meet the identified skills needs of industry; </p>  <p>  - SOLAS-funded construction related further education and  training programmes provided by Education and Training Boards;  and </p>  <p>  - working with the Construction Industry Federation, as industry lead, to further develop the national apprenticeship programme. </p>  <p>  Following the launch of the National Development Plan under Project Ireland 2040 in February 2018,  a Construction Sector Group (CSG) has been established. The role of the CSG is to ensure regular and open dialogue between Government and the construction sector in relation to issues that may impact on the successful delivery of the NDP on a value-for-money basis for the State.  The CSG is chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department will continue to participate actively in it.</p></reply>

Since the enactment of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 1989, and underpinned by subsequent legislation, each fire authority, as an employer, has a statutory duty to avoid placing employees at risk.</p>  <p>  A full time firefighter is statutorily required to retire at age 55 under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004. This retirement age is set at 55 due to the physically demanding nature of the fire-fighter role. The retirement age for retained fire fighters is 55 with an extended period to age 58 subject to a formal application process including a compulsory medical assessment. </p>  <p>  A collective agreement was reached between the Local Government Management Services Board and the trade unions involved (SIPTU and ATGWU) in November 2002.  This collective agreement provided, inter alia, for the appointment of an Expert Group which in turn would advise as to the retirement age for retained firefighters. The Expert Group's Report on Retirement Age recommended that the retirement age for retained firefighters remain at 55, with provision for an annual extension, subject to medical assessment, up to 58 years of age. Following the report of the Expert Group published in April 2003, a circular was issued by my Department in November 2003 setting out the age requirements in relation to retained firefighters in line with the Expert Report.</p>  <p>  In general, any changes proposed by either management or unions are negotiated using the established Industrial Relations processes. In this regard, the matter of increasing the retirement age for firefighters was included as part of recent discussions on a wide range of issues at the Workplace Relations Commission, between the Local Government Management Agency (representing the employers) and SIPTU.</p>  <p>  I understand that these discussions are at a preliminary stage and therefore I am unable to give an indication as to when these discussions will be completed or the likely outcome.</p></reply>

The project developed an innovative new model to support older homeowners to reconfigure their family-sized homes by creating an independent living area suitable for the older homeowner, eliminating the need to use the stairs; and creating an affordable one-bedroom rental home upstairs.  I understand that the promoters of the project are currently involved in two projects to bring the project to different house-types, one in Clondalkin and a second in Castleknock, and I will be interested to learn how these projects progress.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, is currently exploring policy options including supporting housing/housing with care so that older people have a wider range of housing options and choices available to them.  There are a number of key principles underpinning Government policy on housing for older people and on which the policy framework will be constructed. These involve putting in place measures to ensure that sustainable housing is provided in the right location to enable people to age in the community; to design housing and the built environment in accordance with the principles of sustainable lifetime housing; to promote the use of assistive technology to support people to live independently; to give adequate consideration to the need for social connectedness in devising policy; and to work collaboratively with all stakeholders to achieve the policy objectives.</p>  <p>  At an Expert Conference on Housing for Older People in Farmleigh on 20 November, 2018, a number of experts in the field, including the Abhaile Project, explained how these principles can be brought to fruition in imaginative and practical ways, which bring about tangible benefits for the older person. I will ensure that this invaluable knowledge is integrated into the development of policy in this area.</p>  <p>  The final policy framework will be published early next year and this will be a further step in the broader process of seeking to ensure that older people are provided with appropriate accommodation options that are suited to their needs. The policy statement will set out a framework by which the Government can facilitate housing, including housing with care, for older people having regard to current demographics and looking at best practice models. The aim is to ensure that people can grow old and live in a community of their choosing, with dignity and independence.</p></reply>

In addition, an annual cap of 90 days will apply for the renting out on a short-term basis of a person's entire home where it is their primary residence, with such short-term lets being restricted to periods of 14 days or less at a time.  Under these arrangements, people who wish to avail of the new planning exemptions to use their own home for home-sharing or</p>  <p>  limited short-term letting purposes will be required to register this with their local planning authority.</p>  <p>  Where a person owns a second property and intends to let it for short-term letting purposes, they will require planning permission to do so unless it already has planning permission to be used for tourism or short-term letting purposes. Planning permission for a change of use to short-term letting can be sought and it will be up to each local planning authority to consider such applications, based on guidance that will issue from my Department, taking account of housing demand pressures in the area and other relevant factors such as cumulative impacts.</p>  <p>  These proposed changes will not affect the operation of holiday homes as typically understood, or longer-term flexible lettings which are provided for those coming to Ireland under employment contracts. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the proposed new planning changes will come into effect on 1 June 2019, to allow property owners sufficient lead-in time to prepare for and adapt to the proposed new laws. In addition to the making of revised draft exempted development planning regulations, which are being progressed, amendments to primary legislation will also be introduced which will underpin and strengthen the new proposals.  This element of the changes proposed is currently being developed and details will be published in due course.</p></reply>

While the sale is a matter for the OPW, and I have no function as Minister, I do understand and appreciate the value such a building would have, particularly to those for whom it has an historic association.</p>  <p>  The Planning and Development Acts give primary responsibility to local authorities to identify and protect our architectural heritage by including particular structures on their Record of Protected Structures (RPS).  Inclusion on the RPS places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  As the Deputy may be aware, the building mentioned is not on the RPS. Ultimately, the decision as to inclusion of a building or structure on the RPS remains a reserved function of the planning authority, in this case Dublin City Council. </p>  <p>  The primary function of the National Monuments Acts is to record and protect ancient sites and features.  The focus of the Acts is on archaeological remains and traces and does not generally extend to more modern buildings and structures. Accordingly, while the Model School is undoubtedly of local interest and importance, it is not included in, nor would it be appropriate for inclusion in, the statutory Record of Monuments and Places maintained by my Department.</p></reply>
