My Department is also continuing to work with stakeholders to further develop policy in this regard at post-primary level.</p>  <p>  Following the April 2018 announcement of the establishment of 42 new schools from 2019 to 2022, my Department has developed a new Online Patronage Process System, which provides objective information and allows parents to express their preferences in relation to the patronage and language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English, of these new schools.   Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area (including Irish-medium provision), are key to the decision-making process.</p>  <p>  This has resulted in patronage of three of the 13 primary schools to be established in 2019 being awarded to An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta as Irish-medium Gaelscoileanna in the Booterstown_Blackrock; Drumcondra_Marino_Dublin 1; and Maynooth school planning areas.</p>  <p>  The scope for expansion of existing Irish-medium schools that are located near to the other 10 areas will also be assessed and my Department will be engaging with An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta in respect of same.</p>  <p>  Separately, a new post-primary Gaelchol&aacute;iste will be established in Maynooth in September 2019.</p>  <p>  The Department has been in communication with Gaeloideachas and other stakeholders in relation to the development of Aonaid, most recently at a meeting on December 13th 2018.</p>  <p>  The 20 year Strategy also includes a commitment to assessing the demand for increased provision for Irish-medium schools as part of the Schools Reconfiguration for Diversity Process.  In this regard, an opportunity is available to English-medium schools seeking to make a transition to Irish-medium provision, in line with the expressed wishes of parents and the local school community.</p></reply>

All statutory approvals have been secured.</p>  <p>  The pre-qualification process to select a short-list of contractors for tender stage is currently on-going.  In parallel with this process the Design Team is currently working on a submission to the Department outlining the steps required to achieve compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations 2017 (NZEB - "Near Zero Energy Building"). This is a new requirement arising from the introduction of Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations to ensure compliance with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). Part L of the Building Regulations 2017 applies to buildings other than dwellings and came into effect on 22 December 2017.</p>  <p>  When pre-qualification is complete and the design team's NZEB submission has been considered and any consequential amendments to Stage 2(b) design and tender documents have been implemented this project will then be progressed to tender stage.</p>  <p>  A tender stage normally takes between 7 and 8 months to complete. Upon completion of tender stage this project will then progress to construction stage.</p>  <p>  As a T.D. for Donegal, I welcome this Governments investment in a number of education projects across the County. This school, when opened, will be a benefit to generations of Donegal school children for decades to come. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Education and Skills I will continue to work to make sure this school is opened as quickly as possible.</p></reply>

The most recent figures from the OECD on adult literacy dates from 2010-2012.  Ireland did not score significantly differently from the OECD average, although the country comparisons are based on varying response rates and are associated with sizeable standard errors.</p>  <p>  When levels of education are taken into account the proportion of adults at or below level 1 drops from 15.5% for students with post-secondary, non-tertiary qualifications to 2.3% of graduates with a masters-research degree.  </p>  <p>  A particular issue with surveys of this type has been the common misconception that those at the lowest levels of literacy proficiency, typically Level 1 or below, have little or no literacy skills or are &lsquo;functionally illiterate&rsquo;. In fact the reading component tests administered under the PIAAC survey show that even at the lowest levels of literacy proficiency there are significant levels of reading skill.</p>  <p>  Structures supporting access to higher education for students with additional needs have evolved immensely over the past 15 to 20 years. It is unclear if the OCED figures take into account those students who may have had access to additional supports such as scribes for exam purposes. </p>  <p>  In terms of graduate outcomes and employer satisfaction 78% of all graduates are working, or due to start work, 9 months after graduation, with 14% in further study or training.  The latest national employer survey also indicates that the majority of employers are very satisfied with graduates across a range of workplace and personal attributes. </p>  <p>In terms of the role of the broader education system literacy, along with numeracy, are among the most important life skills that our schools teach and it is a fundamental priority that no child should leave school without have mastered these skills to the best of their abilities.</p></reply>

In this regard, I have issued a direction to KWETB in relation to  facilitating and co-operating with my Department in relation to the master planning process.  </p>  <p>  The master planning process is an opportunity to address concerns by providing greater clarity to all parties on how the accommodation needs of both the school referred to by the Deputy and a Further Education College could be met on site. It provides an opportunity to identify how modern fit for purpose accommodation could be provided, which will be mutually beneficial for both parties.</p></reply>

I welcome the Government&rsquo;s proposals in Project Ireland 2040 to invest in this area.</p>  <p>  All post-primary schools are currently required to deliver Physical Education under the Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools. The new specification for Leaving Certificate Physical Education and the Senior Cycle Physical Education Framework have been designed on the basis that facilities in schools may vary.</p>  <p>  In relation to a survey of PE facilities across all schools, my Department's approach is to do so as part of a national sports facilities audit that is due to be undertaken as part of the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 that was published by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (DTTS) in July 2018. </p>  <p>  This audit will enable a town approach and a cross-Government approach to be taken in relation to PE facilities. It may be the case that a particular school may not have a PE facility but there might be a facility adjoining the school or in that town, as part of the sports capital programme or otherwise, that is accessible and can be maximised to make the best use of an asset which has been provided with State funds.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently engaging with DTTS on this and is represented on the Sports Leadership Group established by DTTS to oversee the implementation of the National Sports Policy.</p>  <p>  The National Sports Policy document envisages the audit being undertaken by local authorities and it being completed by July 2020.   Once completed the audit will feed into the work of my Department in relation to the PE build and modernisation programme that is outlined for delivery during the second half of the National Development Plan 2018 to 2027.  In the meantime, the provision of modern PE facilities is incorporated into large-scale building projects under my Department's school building programme.  Large-scale projects under construction in 2018 and 2019 involve the provision of 48 PE Halls at post-primary level and 82 GP Rooms at primary level.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA)  is currently carrying out a review of RSE on foot of a request from my predecessor. I have asked the NCCA to consider the Committee's report as part of that review. </p><p>The NCCA review involves an examination of the curriculum at both primary and post-primary level, including:</p><p>- An examination of the experience and reality of RSE as delivered in schools,</p><p>- How the RSE curriculum is planned</p><p>- How it is taught and how parents are involved</p><p>- The role of the classroom teacher in teaching the curriculum</p><p>- The appropriate level of supports which are currently being provided by external providers, and</p><p>- The effectiveness of the continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities which are currently provided by the Department and other bodies to RSE teachers. A number of these issues have been raised in the report of the Oireachtas committee.</p><p>The NCCA Review compromises three dimensions:</p><p>1. A desktop review of recently published research/studies which was published last November.</p><p>2. Consultation with individuals and organisations working in this area and an online survey to gauge the view of students, parents, teachers, etc.</p><p>3. Working directly with schools to examine the experience of RSE in the classroom.</p><p>It is very appropriate that the time is now being taken to carry out a major review of how we educate our young people about relationships and sexuality.  Issues such as consent, contraception and sexuality need to be taught in a way that not only acknowledges our changing society but also addresses issues that arise in society which indicate a lack of understanding of these areas.  </p><p>It is vitally important that our Education system preparers our your people for life in an Irish society that values each individual&rsquo;s sexual orientation, respects decisions regarding contraception and understands consent.</p><p>I expect the NCCA to complete its review in the second quarter of this year.</p></reply>

My Department has published policy guidelines to support schools in developing their RSE policy. The guidelines, drafted in consultation with the education partners, provide a framework for Boards of Management to ensure that the policy development process allows for issues of concern to each of the participating groups &ndash; board, teachers, parents and students, as appropriate &ndash; to be raised, discussed and decided upon. Spiritual, moral and ethical issues may arise when teaching RSE. The school&rsquo;s RSE policy should guide teachers in the treatment of such issues, in accordance with the ethos of the school. It is important to note that all schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme. Elements of the programme cannot be omitted on the grounds of school ethos. </p>  <p>  At my request the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is currently carrying out a review of relationships and sexuality education in schools.  In undertaking its review, the NCCA will examine how the RSE curriculum is delivered in different school types. This involves consideration of a range of RSE policies and how they impact on the manner in which the RSE curriculum is delivered in different schools.  I expect to receive the report from the NCCA around mid-year. The findings in that report will help inform a decision on any changes that are deemed necessary to the current policy in this area, including the precise mechanism or mechanisms to be used to put these changes into effect.</p></reply>

The Department and the National Council for Special Education provide a range of supports and professional development programmes for teachers to promote inclusion in the classroom.</p>  <p>  Students with special educational needs can have very complex learning needs and should be taught by qualified and experienced teachers who are equipped with the necessary skills to meet the needs of these students. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually. Schools have the autonomy and flexibility to manage their allocation of SNA support in order to utilise this support to the best possible effect.</p>  <p>  When a pupil with significant and complex care needs has access to support from a SNA the classroom teacher will work closely with the SNA. However the class teacher continues to have primary responsibility for teaching and learning and for the social and emotional development and progress of the pupil. </p>  <p>  Many children with significant special educational needs require additional teaching support in schools. In such circumstances, the classroom teacher will be supported by Special Education teachers, who are fully qualified teachers who will have access to additional training in the area of special education, and who will work closely with the class teacher to provide additional teaching support for children with special educational needs (SEN). </p>  <p>  There are established procedures in place for dealing with complaints from parents.  These should be addressed to the individual teacher or principal in the first instance as appropriate and thereafter to the Board of Management if not resolved.  </p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints relating to the administrative actions of a school recognised by my Department, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school&rsquo;s complaints procedures. The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the administrative actions of a school has, or may have, adversely affected the child.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-06a.72.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030600044#WRC01100"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 have been commenced. The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. </p><p>Section 1 &ndash; InterpretationSection 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational NeedsSection 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schoolsSections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health BoardsSections 40 to 53 - amending the Education ActSchedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the CouncilSchedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. </p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to - </p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. </p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).</p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.</p><p>- an independent appeals process.</p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its implementation Plan which was developed in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of the Department of Education and Skills was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice provided to that Department also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act have not recently been conducted. The level of additional expenditure required would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who might currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2018 my Department invested over &euro;1.75 Billion in this area - 1/5 of my Department's budget and up 42% since 2011, at which point &euro;1.24 Billion was invested. This increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of:</p><p>SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,000 at present.</p><p>Special classes by 160% to over 1,450 at present, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p><p>Special education teachers by 37%, from 9,740 in 2011, to over 13,400 at present.</p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the Act on a non-statutory basis. </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of the new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report.</p><p>Consultations also took place in relation to providing power to the National Council for Special Educational need to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p><p>I can also advise that, whereas there is not currently a statutory requirement to provide individual education plans for children with special needs, at present, all schools are encouraged to use Education Plans. The Department of Education and Skills Inspectorate's advice is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs. The Guidelines for schools on implementing the new special education teacher allocation model advise schools as to the importance of ensuring that student support plans or educational plans are in place.</p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice. Full consultation will also take place with stakeholders before adjustments are made. </p><p>I can assure you that this Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support and I am confident that ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p></reply>

They are based on solid energy research projects. The Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme with forty eight research projects at various stages, including its joint SEAI partnership energy website project www.energyineducation.ie.</p>  <p>  One of the newer research strands focuses on working to meet climate change responsibilities. My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are involved in an energy efficient retrofit pilot scheme for schools since 2017. The pilot programme will focus initially for three years on medium to deep retrofit measures to improve the energy efficiency of existing schools which present a variety of challenges including different building ages, archetypes, and retrofit requirements. </p>  <p>  The energy efficiency upgrade measures undertaken in the pilot are considered medium to deep, and include fabric, electrical and mechanical upgrades. The longer-term outcome of the pilot will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland.  In the National Development Plan (2018-2027) &euro;2.5bn is identified for the refurbishment and construction of schools. Part of this is an intention to undertake &ldquo;deep energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008&rdquo;. Therefore, this pilot scheme is now paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools energy retrofit programme based on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested during the pilot. </p>  <p>  In 2017, ten schools received energy retrofits, followed by six schools in 2018. For 2019 a provisional list of schools is currently being progressed to design phase. Energy Conservation Measures delivered to date include fabric (roofs, walls, glazing and doors), heating (boilers, controls, Building Management systems), and electrical (LED lighting and solar PV).</p>  <p>  Tariffs for micro-generated renewable energy in schools is under review by both the Departments to which the Deputy refers.</p></reply>

This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes as there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development, including additional residential developments arising from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF). </p>  <p>  It was decided to open a school as a regional solution as the projected growth in each school planning area did not warrant provision of a new school, but the combined demographic increases across both school planning areas indicate sufficient demand for a viable school.</p>  <p>  A patronage process is run after it has been decided, based on demographic analysis, that a new school is required.  This patronage process is open to all patron bodies and prospective patrons.  Parental preferences for each patron, from parents of children who reside in the school planning areas concerned, together with the extent of diversity currently available in these areas, are key to decisions in relation to the outcome of this process.</p>  <p>  The patronage process for new schools is overseen by an external independent advisory group, the New Schools Establishment Group (NSEG).  Following their consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment reports, the NSEG submits a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  The assessment reports and the NSEG recommendations for all such patronage processes are made available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  An Online Patronage Process System (OPPS) has been developed by my Department to provide objective information to all parents which will allow them to make an informed choice about their preferred model of patronage for their child&rsquo;s education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. </p>  <p>  The patronage process for primary and post-primary schools to be established in 2020 will commence in 2019, significantly ahead of their due opening. Updates in relation to further patronage processes will be announced on the OPPS website and my Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie).</p>  <p>  I can confirm that a site acquisition process is currently underway and my Department is examining potential solutions for the new post primary school in question. The location for the school will be determined as part of this site selection process. A decision has yet to be finalised, however, it is expected that a preferred option will be identified in the near future in relation to an appropriate site and announced shortly thereafter. Due to commercial sensitivities with site acquisitions in general, it is not possible to comment further at this point but assurances can be given that my Department is working to ensure that the site acquisition process concludes at the earliest possible date.</p></reply>

The new Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills - to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living. It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, well-being and mental health. </p><p>Prior to the introduction of the new Framework for Junior Cycle the status of History and Geography in junior cycle varied by school type. History and Geography were only core subjects in voluntary secondary schools (52% of schools).</p><p>The new Framework for Junior Cycle, currently being rolled out, focusses on active and collaborative learning. It gives greater flexibility and autonomy to schools in terms of subject selection, and new short courses, to tailor a student&rsquo;s learning to achieve better outcomes for that student. Students are able to study up to 10 subjects for certification through the new Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement.</p><p>It is important to note that currently some 90% of students across all schools choose to study History at Junior Cycle, although it is not compulsory in all schools. Some 92% of Junior Cycle students study Geography.</p><p>This is a clear indication that in respect of subjects like history and geography, schools make curricular decisions in the absence of directives and we expect this to continue.  </p><p>We have a dedicated cohort of history and geography teachers in our post-primary schools, who will be promoting the inclusion of their subject within programmes provided to students by their schools.<i></i>There is every reason to be confident that through the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015 the curricular significance of history and Geography will be retained and given a new impetus across the junior cycle curriculum.  </p><p>The direction of Junior Cycle reform is consistent with practice in other high-performing education systems such as New Zealand, Queensland, Estonia and Finland, where schools have been given greater autonomy and flexibility in developing the programmes they offer.</p><p>Since arriving in the Department I have spoken publicly of how vital it is that our young people learn from the past so that they can plan for the future.

It  is concerned with promoting personal growth and facilitating the spiritual development of students. Religious education is well placed to provide students with opportunities for reflection on human experience, as well as for understanding and interpretation of that experience. Such opportunities encourage the students&rsquo; participation in their own conscious and critical development. As part of their studies, students are exposed to a broad range of religious traditions and to the non-religious interpretation of life.</p>  <p>  The NCCA Religious Education (RE) Syllabus is an optional examinable subject at Leaving Certificate.  Students opt for the RE syllabus as one of their subjects for the Leaving Certificate and the question of opting out on grounds of conscience should not therefore arise.</p></reply>

"A" Company, 35th Infantry Battalion took responsibility for the UN post at Jadotville on 3rd September 1961. On the 9th September, a large force of Katangese Gendarmerie surrounded them and early on the morning of the 13th September "A" Company came under attack. From the 13th to the 17th September they endured almost continuous attack. They were taken into captivity on the 17th September and remained in captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961.</p>  <p>  In accordance with Defence Forces regulations the award of medals for bravery is time bound. These may not be awarded in any case unless a recommendation is made through the usual channels to the Chief of Staff, not later than two years in the case of the Military Medal for Gallantry, and not later than four years in the case of the Distinguished Service Medal, after the performance of the act in respect of which the recommendation is made. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.  </p>  <p>  The issue of the award of medals to the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion was comprehensively addressed in 1965. A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded. The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings. Subsequently at that time, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff. He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision. The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  </p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of "A" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.   </p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.</p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: </p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to "A" Company in 2006. </p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. </p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. </p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. </p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognise the brave actions of these men.  </p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and full and due recognition has been afforded to them in their honour.</p></reply>

I remain concerned at reports of mining activities having a negative impact on local populations or on the environment, as well as of reported abuse of workers. </p>  <p>  Ireland has just opened its first resident Embassy in Bogot&aacute;, with Ambassador Alison Milton presenting her credentials late last month. This significant step demonstrates our Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Colombia and in particular our commitment to supporting Colombia&rsquo;s transition to a peaceful post-conflict society, including the vindication and protection of human and social rights. </p>  <p>  Having a presence on the ground in Colombia will greatly enhance Ireland's ability to engage on and monitor important issues, among them those raised by human rights, environmental and indigenous rights defenders, including the impact of the Cerrej&oacute;n mine on the local community and the environment. This is something that the EU Delegation in Bogot&aacute; has been monitoring for some time, having met with representatives of the mine as well as of trade unions, civil society and environmental organisations. We will continue to liaise closely with our EU partners on this issue. </p>  <p>  Historic strides have been made in Colombia in recent years in the transition to a post-conflict society and addressing social and environmental issues is part of that process. Significant challenges remain, but Ireland remains committed to supporting the full implementation of the peace agreement, which will ensure a more peaceful, stable and prosperous future for all Colombians. </p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor developments in the country and the particular issue raised by the Deputy as closely as possible.

Specific activities included advertisements on social media platforms, print ads, press releases and attendance at relevant promotional events, as well as participation by the Director of the Passport Service in over 25 interviews on regional radio stations. </p><p>- In Q4 2018 the service was expanded to include online renewal of children&rsquo;s passports, a passport card for children and a wider cohort of adults eligible to renew online.  This expanded service means that all Irish citizens can now renew their passports online 24/7 from anywhere in the world. My Department ran a three week public information campaign including advertisements on social media platforms, print ads and radio ads. The success of this campaign has led to a significant increase in online renewal applications in Q1 2019.  </p><p>- The direct costs of online and social media advertising to raise public awareness in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.  </p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s Campaign for Election to the UN Security Council </p><p>- On July 2nd2018, the Taoiseach and I publicly launched Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s campaign is premised on three themes: Empathy, Partnership and Independence. To coincide with this launch, my Department used social media platforms to promote public awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s campaign online and the direct costs incurred in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.</p><p>Government Brexit Update and &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rsquo; </p><p>-The Government Brexit Update email service and the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready public information campaign have formed part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to keep citizens fully informed and up-to date on the implications and challenges of Brexit. </p><p>- The Update is issuing on a regular basis via a commercial provider (MailChimp) and provides information on latest developments in the ongoing Brexit negotiations, on the latest available research publications and on engagement at Government level. It also highlights the range of business supports that are available through the various Government Departments and State agencies. </p><p>- My Department also coordinated a Government-wide &lsquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready Campaign&rsquo; which I and Ministers Humphreys and Creed launched together on 20 September.  This campaign updated citizens, communities and businesses about Brexit preparedness and support measures that are available as well as on public workshop events that were held over successive weeks throughout October and the last two weeks in November. A programme of awareness raising via online and social media platforms also took place.  Costs incurred in this regard are set out in Table 1 below. </p><p>Other Projects </p><p>-My Department has also engaged in social media promotion of certain other initiatives and projects that relate to Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy activities. During 2018 and to date in 2019 these have comprised: </p><p>- Commissioning, in conjunction with the Royal Irish Academy, and first public performance at the UN General Assembly of a new work of poetry by Evan Boland (&ldquo;Our Future Will Become The Past of Other Women&rdquo;) to mark the centenary of women&rsquo;s suffrage in December 2018; </p><p>- Ireland&rsquo;s participation (by video) in the 2 December 2018 'Global Citizen Mandela 100' concert; and </p><p>- The launch of Ireland&rsquo;s new policy for international development, &lsquo;A Better World&rsquo;, on 28 February.</p><p><b>Table 1: Online Advertising and Public Awareness Campaigns Expenditure 2018 &ndash; to date</b><table><tr><th>Campaign/Theme</th><th>Supplier</th><th>Cost to date</th></tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals (March 2018-June 2018)</td><td>Twitter</td><td>&euro;473.55</td></tr><tr><td>UN Security Council Campaign July 2018</td><td>Twitter and Facebook</td><td>&euro;461</td></tr><tr><td>Government Brexit Update (Jan 2018 &ndash; to date)</td><td>Twitter and MailChimp</td><td>&euro;1,396.69</td></tr><tr><td>Online Passport Renewals (December 2018-January 2019)</td><td>PHD Media (Online, Twitter, Facebook &amp;amp; Linkedin)</td><td>&euro;38,118.21</td></tr><tr><td>A Better World, Evan Boland and Mandela 100</td><td>Twitter</td><td>&euro;516.61</td></tr></table></p></reply>

They also agreed that in the context of the work on the future relationship their teams should look at  the role alternative arrangements could play in replacing the backstop, and whether additions or changes to the Political Declaration could be made, consistent with EU and UK Government positions, that increased confidence in the focus and ambition of both sides in delivering the future partnership envisaged as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Discussions between the European Commission and the UK Government are continuing.</p></reply>

This has been reflected in a number of concrete measures and commitments to date, such as the EIB&rsquo;s support for the Government&rsquo;s Brexit Loan Scheme.  In its Contingency Action Plan of 13 November 2018, the European Commission confirmed that it would support Ireland in finding solutions addressing the specific challenges of Irish businesses.</p>  <p>  In November 2017, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation met with EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager  to discuss, amongst other issues, the impact of Brexit on Irish businesses. Since November 2017, the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation has been working closely with the Commission and DG Competition since November 2017 through the Irish/EU Technical Working Group on State Aid. The objective of the Group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with State Aid rules. </p>  <p>  On 24 January 2019, Minister Humphreys met with Commissioner Vestager. The meeting focused on the severe challenges that Irish businesses will face when the UK leaves the EU and the need for appropriate and timely State supports. It was agreed that Irish officials will continue to work closely with the Commissioner's team in addressing any State Aid issues that may arise to ensure a rapid and appropriate response as the ultimate shape of Brexit and its firm-level implications become known. Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing rules, this will be raised as part of the Group discussions. The Commissioner emphasised that the Commission stands ready to act urgently in mitigation against the impacts of Brexit on Irish firms.</p>  <p>  In addition, Minister Creed held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan (DG Agriculture and Rural Development) on 28 January to discuss the potential impact of a no deal Brexit on the Irish agrifood and fisheries sectors. Minister Creed stressed the need to deploy market response measures, including exceptional aid, under the CAP to provide necessary supports to Ireland's agrifood sectors. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland and in particular, challenges facing Irish farmers and the agrifood sector, given our specific exposure to the UK market. Commissioner Hogan and Minister Creed agreed to remain in close contact as the situation develops and more clarity emerges about the nature of the UK&rsquo;s departure.</p>  <p>  This is an ongoing process, and the Government will continue to carefully examine what supports can be provided to assist businesses, particularly in a no deal scenario.</p></reply>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na informed my Department that owing to the elapse of time and file archiving practices, reconfirmation of the sanction was required.</p><p>As can be seen from the schedule attached to this reply that reflecting the administrative structures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, these public bank accounts are held at individual Garda Districts across the country in order for the relevant Superintendents to discharge their functions as District Officers reflecting the administrative structures.</p><p>As with all other features of financial management the relevant Accounting Officer for a Vote is ultimately responsible for the effective oversight of his or her Department&rsquo;s or Office&rsquo;s public bank accounts.</p><p>The requested tabular information is contained in the following link.</p></reply>

This inspection is particularly relevant in the case of any proposed modifications to vehicles. Both of these legal requirements are verified by Bus &Eacute;ireann before any vehicle is permitted to be added to the nominated fleet of any contractor seeking to provide services under the School Transport Scheme.   In addition to the statutory requirements, Bus &Eacute;ireann arranges for additional examinations of vehicles operating under the School Transport Scheme &ndash; which are both targeted and random. These additional quality assurance checks are carried out by an independent agency on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann. </p>  <p>  All operators successfully awarded contracts to operate School Transport Scheme services by Bus &Eacute;ireann must meet their contractual obligations set out in respect of vehicle safety, safety inspections and maintenance systems.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-06a.245.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030600047#WRF01300"><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that all schools are encouraged to plan effectively for the delivery of additional teaching or care supports for children with special educational needs, including for children with Down syndrome. </p><p>Effective planning ensures that the school&rsquo;s resources are deployed efficiently and that they achieve the desired outcomes. </p><p>Under the Education Act 1998, schools are under statutory obligations to &ldquo;provide education to students which is appropriate to their abilities and needs&rdquo; and to &ldquo;ensure that the educational needs of all students, including those with a disability or other special educational needs, are identified and provided for&rdquo;.  </p><p>Planning is a normal part of a teacher&rsquo;s work and planning tools, like the student support file, have been created as a resource to help schools provide for their students.</p><p>Circulars 0013 and 0014 2017, which introduced the model for allocating special education teachers to schools, noted the importance of educational planning. This is in the context of ensuring that the children with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.</p><p>The Circulars note that educational planning is an essential element of a whole-school approach to meeting pupils&rsquo; needs. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on educational planning and monitoring of outcomes through the Student Support File, are contained in the Guidelines for Primary and Post primary Schools: Supporting Children and Young People with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Schools.</p><p>All schools are therefore encouraged to use Education Plans or Student Support plans for children who are receiving additional teaching or care in schools. </p><p>Whereas there is not currently a statutory requirement for schools to provide a particular form of Individual Education Plan, it is evident that the majority of schools do use some form of education planning to plan and record the support that they provide for pupils with special educational needs. This is considered to be both beneficial for schools and children and is regarded as best practice.  </p><p>The ongoing provision of planning will represent a continuation of the good practice that is occurring in the majority of schools.</p><p>With regard to the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004, I can advise that a number of sections of the  EPSEN) Act have been commenced. The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.</p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  </p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its implementation Plan which was developed in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. </p><p>The view of the Department of Education and Skills was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice provided to that Department also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.</p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. </p><p>In 2018 my Department invested over &euro;1.75 Billion in this area - 1/5 of my Department's budget and up 42% since 2011, at which point &euro;1.24 Billion was invested. This increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of:</p><p>SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,000 at present.</p><p>Special classes by 160% to over 1,450 at present, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p><p>Special education teachers by 37%, from 9,740 in 2011, to over 13,400 at present.</p><p>Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, I have committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the Act on a non-statutory basis. </p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of the new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. </p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report.</p><p>Consultations also took place in relation to providing power to the National Council for Special Educational need to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.</p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.</p><p>It is therefore intended to bring into effect many of the good ideas contained in the EPSEN Act, on a non-statutory basis initially, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice. Full consultation will also take place with stakeholders before adjustments are made. </p><p>I can assure you that this Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support and I am confident that ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.</p></reply>

Full and complete comprehension of each individual word and/or grammatical element within the text(s) is not necessary in order to extract meaning from the text. In the third section i.e. the Written Section students are asked to perform a number of communicative tasks from the syllabus. Students are free to express these communicative tasks in a more complex manner using, for example, more complex and elaborate grammatical structures which <i>may</i>require an active knowledge of genitive and dative cases and genitive and accusative prepositions. Equally, they are free to use shorter, simpler sentences. </p><p>It is important to state, however, that certain grammatical structures in the German language simply demand the use of genitive and dative (or indeed nominative and accusative) cases or genitive and accusative (or indeed nominative or dative) prepositions in order to express particular communicative tasks.</p><p>While knowledge of the future and conditional tenses is included in the syllabus for junior Certificate, they are not directly targeted for assessment in the listening and reading comprehensions.</p><p>However, in order to carry short communicative tasks in the written section of the examination paper, a knowledge of the future and conditional tenses may be required.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2019-03-06a.277.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1290" speakername="Joe McHugh" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019030600047#WRF04700"><p>By way of background I might inform you that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides guidelines and resource materials for schools to enable them to deal with certain traumatic events which can adversely affect pupils and school staff. This publication 'Responding to Critical Incidents: NEPS Guidelines and Resource Materials for Schools' also outlines how schools can plan for crises. The guidelines refer to preventive approaches that schools can adopt in creating a safe and supportive environment. </p>  <p>  The publication provides practical step-by-step guidelines for teachers and principals on how to respond when a tragedy occurs. It offers support to schools at a potentially overwhelming time. </p>  <p>  The guidelines focus upon alerting schools to planning processes, structures and actions which will better allow them to cope with a traumatic incidents such as suicide or suspected suicide, murder, accidental death including road traffic accidents and drowning, and death through illness of members of the school community. In relation to suicide, advice is also given on prevention and positive mental health stratagems and approaches. </p>  <p>  The Guidelines are kept under constant review and a third edition was circulated by NEPS to schools in 2016. Training in critical incident planning is part of the service provided by NEPS to schools and is a focus of my Department&rsquo;s Action Plan for Education 2016-19 for post-primary schools.</p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists will also, at the specific invitation of school authorities, attend at schools immediately following such incidents to offer direct advice and assistance to school staff in managing the situation. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's specific questions in this regard, critical incidents are by their nature situations so named by schools themselves &ndash; traumatic events which have the potential to overwhelm the normal operation of the school.  Depending upon the nature, severity or context of an event, schools may telephone NEPS for advice and support as to how they should proceed in relation to a particular event.  In many situations this advice and support is adequate to equip schools to respond appropriately, without further support required from NEPS.  In other situations, as is set out above, school authorities may request the attendance of NEPS psychologists on-site to provide support, advice and assistance in the delivery of the response. Therefore, in answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific quest, all critical incidents notified to NEPS are acted upon as appropriate to the context and the wishes of school authorities.</p>  <p>  For data purposes NEPS records critical incidents at three response levels:</p>  <p>Level 1   - an incident which involves a telephone response to the school but where no on-site presence of NEPS staff is requested,</p>  <p>Level 2   &ndash; where the school, in their contact with NEPS, request the presence of NEPS personnel on-site to advise and assist,</p>  <p>Level 3   &ndash; events which have NEPS personnel on-site but are of a magnitude that involves a broader community response from other support services such as the HSE.</p>  <p>  Until NEPS gathered data on the number and extent of critical incidents from its eight regions which while including an incident count and level did not include element which allowed disaggregation by school and county. </p>  <p>In the academic year 2017/18 however NEPS changed its data gathering methodology and the data the Deputy requested is therefore available for this academic year only and I can inform the Deputy that some 66   critical incidents were recorded for counties Tipperary, Cork, Laois and Offaly in the period, 40 at level 1,  22 at level 2 and four at level 3.</p>  <p>  I hope this is of assistance to the Deputy in this regard.</p></reply>

My Department is also continuing to work with stakeholders to further develop policy in this regard at post-primary level and met recently with Gaeloideachas and other stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Following the April 2018 announcement of the establishment of 42 new schools from 2019 to 2022, my Department has developed a new Online Patronage Process System, which provides objective information and allows parents to express their preferences in relation to the patronage and language of instruction, i.e. Irish or English, of these new schools.   Parental preferences, as well as other considerations such as the extent of diversity of provision in an area (including Irish-medium provision), are key to the decision-making process.   </p>  <p>  This has resulted in patronage of three of the 13 primary schools to be established in 2019 being awarded to An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta as Irish-medium Gaelscoileanna in the Booterstown_Blackrock; Drumcondra_Marino_Dublin 1; and Maynooth school planning areas.  </p>  <p>  Separately, a new post-primary Gaelchol&aacute;iste will be established in Maynooth in September 2019.</p>  <p>  Details of schools that provide education through the medium of Irish are available on my Department's website www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  While the recent new schools announcement did not include a new post-primary school for Tullamore, the requirement for new schools is being kept under on-going review and in particular will have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. </p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  </p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a Secretary or Caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration will, from 1 January 2019, be paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. </p>  <p>  Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff was improved in order to enable schools to implement the arbitration outcome.</p>  <p>  The F&Oacute;RSA trade union have requested a meeting with the Department to discuss pay arrangements for grant-funded Secretaries and Caretakers from 2020 onwards.

Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  1,000 additional Special Education Teachers have been provided for schools since 2017, while the total number of Special Education Teachers has increased by 37% since 2011, from 9,740 in 2011,</p>  <p>  to over 13,400 at present. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the very significant levels of additional provision we have made in recent years, to provide Special Education Teachers, means that all schools, including schools in County Kildare, are sufficiently resourced to provide for the special educational needs and care needs of children in their schools.</p></reply>

Typically, expenditure levels of between 70% and 80% of the capital allocation available to schools annually is in respect of large scale projects and the Additional Accommodation Scheme. The balance available in 2019 will be expended on site acquisitions, the Summer Works Scheme, the Emergency Works Scheme, furniture and equipment provision and other smaller programmes. </p>  <p>  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed through the architectural planning process. The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Details of schools listed on this programme can be found on my Department's website www.education.ie and this information is updated regularly.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of my announcement in April 2018 regarding the establishment of 42 new schools, over the next four years (2019 to 2022). This announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by the Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the 4-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure.</p></reply>

As the largest private sector employer in the country (90% Irish-owned) that supports jobs in every city, town and village in the country I understand the importance of the retail sector. </p>  <p>  It is clear the retail sector is undergoing an exciting but also challenging transformation as the digital economy provides a different retail experience for consumers across Ireland and beyond. Digitalisation has increased the scope for competition in the retail sector, as reflected in the growth in online shopping and changing consumer preferences in terms of how people are shopping in town centres.  Sustaining physical retail outlets requires adaptation: many retailers now offer multiple sales channels to sell their goods, from physical stores, to social media, mobile apps and websites. </p>  <p>  Towns are places not only to live in, but to work in, do business in and invest in. The Retail Consultation Forum and my Department produced 'A Framework for Town Centre Renewal' in 2017 to help towns and villages across Ireland with a step by step plan for town centre renewal, which brings together all the key stakeholders in the town to work collaboratively to enhance their local town or village. At a collaborative level, Town groups can work together to improve footfall and customer experience in town centres through various measures such as enhancing accessibility, public spaces, and tackling vacant property. For detailed advice, Town groups can engage with recommendations set out in the Framework. </p>  <p>  The Framework also serves as a support document for towns and villages applying for funding streams under Project 2040 including; the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund and the &euro;1 billion Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which can be leveraged to support the regeneration and viability of town centres. </p>  <p>  All businesses, regardless of size or sector, in today&rsquo;s competitive environment must ensure to build their online capability in order for them to expand their market reach nationally and internationally and enhance their competitiveness. Retailers are now operating through an omni-channel approach where their physical and online stores complement each other.  </p>  <p>  Last September, I introduced a new pilot Online Retail Scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland, with a total fund of &euro;1.25m. I announced eleven successful applicants from Call 1 on the 1st March 2019 in Skibbereen, Co.Cork. A second call will issue later this year. The pilot Online Retail Scheme supports retail businesses of 20 employees or more who are ready to strategically grow their online capability. Eligible expenditure under the Scheme includes activities such as research, strategy development, implementation and training. In recognition of the strong role the retail sector plays in supporting regional development and vibrant communities, at least 50% of the total number of grants awarded under the Scheme will be prioritised for retail SMEs with their headquarters outside of county Dublin, subject to applications meeting the minimum standards required. </p>  <p>  Retailers can also engage with the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) as the first-stop-shop front line service assisting in delivering business growth and jobs for the small &amp;amp; micro-enterprise sector. The LEOs are the first port of call for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business, in terms of advice, training, sign posting to other support providers and, in certain circumstances, grant support. </p>  <p>  The LEOs nationwide actively promote the Trading Online Voucher Scheme (TOVS) on behalf of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The TOVS offers matched financial assistance of up to &euro;2,500, along with training and advice, to micro companies (10 or less employees) who want to establish an online presence for the first time, or who wish to expand a basic existing website to incorporate a more substantive online trading capacity.</p>  <p>  Since the start of the scheme in July 2014 to date over 5,000 micro companies have availed of the TOVS including 1,103 LEO client companies. </p>  <p>  The LEOs also offer a wide range of short training programmes to support their clients in building their online presence and to compete in the online marketplace. These programmes are focused on different elements which aim at maximising outputs from investment in online trading such as: </p>  <p>  - Marketing, focused mainly on development of an online/mobile marketing strategy</p>  <p>  - Social Media, with the majority of programmes focused on educating the client base on how to use the different social media platforms to support their business</p>  <p>  - eCommerce Sales Strategy, including how to convert website  visits into sales</p>  <p>  - Search Engine Optimisation, including web analytics and video optimization for web.</p>  <p>  As Chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I will continue to engage with the retail sector in relation to opportunities and challenges arising in relation to digitalisation in the sector.</p></reply>

While many Irish businesses already have plans in place to mitigate the impacts of Brexit, I am conscious that a proportion of businesses have delayed their Brexit planning due to the degree of uncertainty in the UK surrounding the Brexit negotiations and the withdrawal process. As we approach the withdrawal date, I am urging all businesses to prepare, make all necessary decisions, and complete all required administrative actions. </p><p>My Department and its agencies have been consistently advising businesses and their representative bodies that it is crucial that they check their supply chains for vulnerabilities to Brexit impacts, contact their UK suppliers, service providers, logistics companies, wholesalers or distributors, to seek assurances about the continuity of the goods and services they rely on to do business, and assess whether it makes business sense to find an alternative supplier in the EU. </p><p>Extensive work has been ongoing in my Department and across Government to help businesses prepare for all Brexit eventualities and to raise awareness about supply chain implications as well as all of the other potential Brexit impacts.  It is important that businesses understand that there are supports and advice available to help them prepare for Brexit. </p><p>My Department and its agencies are fully engaged in preparing Irish businesses for Brexit and have participated in the Government of Ireland&rsquo;s series of Getting Ireland Brexit Ready events in Cork, Galway, Monaghan, Dublin, Limerick and Donegal. As part of awareness-raising activities, EI continues to roll out regional Brexit Advisory clinics. To date, these clinics have been held in Letterkenny, Tralee, Portlaoise, Claremorris, Cootehill, Charleville, Dublin, Galway, Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick. Further events are planned in Galway, Cork, Letterkenny and Dublin ahead of the withdrawal date. </p><p>EI has also been running a PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the Brexit SME Scorecard and the PrepareforBrexit.ie website, which offers information on the likely impacts of Brexit on Irish businesses and how these impacts might be mitigated. The Brexit SME Scorecard is an interactive online platform that can be used by all Irish businesses to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. EI has also made available a Be Prepared Grant which offers up to &euro;5,000 for exporting client companies to conduct further research and use external expertise to develop a Brexit Action Plan. </p><p>Funding to the Local Enterprise Offices has been increased by 22% and they, along with InterTradeIreland, are offering a range of Brexit focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland. InterTradeIreland continues to offer its Brexit: Planning Voucher, which makes available financial support of up to &euro;2,250 towards professional advisory services to address Brexit-related challenges. This week, I launched the Brexit: Implementation Voucher, which offers up to &euro;5,625 to businesses to implement critical changes identified in their Brexit planning phase.</p><p>The LEOs offer Brexit supports to micro and small businesses through the 31 LEOs nationwide. These include a &ldquo;Technical Assistance for Micro-enterprises&rdquo; grant, designed to support qualifying businesses to diversify into new markets, enabling companies to explore and develop new market opportunities. This is accompanied by tailored mentoring to address Brexit-related business challenges, and targeted training on specific Brexit challenges.</p><p>After the withdrawal date, businesses that continue to buy goods from the UK will be classed as importers. This has the potential to cause further disruption to supply chains. Businesses are encouraged to contact Revenue to understand the changes that may affect them once the UK leaves the EU. Businesses are also urged to contact their suppliers and service providers to seek assurances about the continuity of the supply of their goods and services post Brexit.</p><p>Where standards and conformity assessment are areas of potential concern, businesses are encouraged to contact the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), which provides support and guidance to Irish businesses and industry to mitigate Brexit effects on standards and certification. For businesses importing chemicals from the UK, the Health and Safety Authority's (HSA) Chemicals Helpdesk is available to help prepare for Brexit. </p><p>For further information, as well as more detail on the supports available, businesses should consult my Department's Getting Business Brexit Ready page at <i>dbei.gov.ie/BrexitReady</i>.</p></reply>

Export diversification is a strong defence against Brexit challenges. </p>  <p>  While the UK is and will continue to be our number one market the Government&rsquo;s ambition through Enterprise Ireland is to drive the exports of Irish companies beyond the UK, by 50 per cent by 2020.  Last year, the Government launched the Global Footprint Initiative and my Department is funding Enterprise Ireland to strengthen its presence in 14 locations in 2019.  This increased presence abroad will build on Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s work in 2018 when it helped Irish companies win 1,504 new contracts, open 402 new offices overseas and brought 1,023 international buyers to Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Within the Eurozone region, currency stability, free trade agreements negotiated by the EU and export growth potential are just some of the key opportunities available to Irish exporters.</p>  <p>  In addition, membership of the Single Market and Customs Union is a core element of our economic strategy.  The Single Market is based on harmonised standards which have been good for Irish business.  Regulatory certainty and standards provided by EU frameworks contribute to competitiveness and growth in Irish industry, as they facilitate trade and help businesses to sell into a wide range of markets. </p>  <p>  In addition to access to the important EU markets, the EU is the world&rsquo;s largest trading block and has preferential trading agreements with over 50 countries, with more under negotiation. The International Trade Mission and Events Schedule for 2019, which was launched recently, covers a total of 207 events within Ireland and international locations to include 73 ministerial led trade missions and events.</p>  <p>  Of this, 31 trade events are planned to Northern Europe to include 14 trade missions which include Germany and France, the Mobile World Congress Digital Technologies event in Spain, the Money 2020 Fintech Event in Amsterdam and the Paris Air Show aviation trade event.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for 2017-2020 is to support more start-ups with global ambition to build scale and expand their reach.  The ambitious target set under this strategy of creating 60,000 new jobs by the end of 2020 is fully attainable.</p></reply>

Figures show that overall, employment continues to grow strongly with 50,500 jobs created in the year from Q4 2017 to Q4 2018. This brings total employment to 2,281,300, the highest number at work ever recorded. </p>  <p>  The Border region has shown excellent progress in employment levels since the launch of the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017.  From Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q4 2018, a total of 8,200 more people are now in employment. However, from Q4 2017 to Q4 2018 there has been a reduction in the number of people in employment in the Border region of 2,400, representing a reduction in the total number of people in the labour force during the period.</p>  <p>  From Q1 2015 (baseline year) to Q4 2018, unemployment has more than halved in the Border region falling from 8.6 percent to 3.8 percent, the lowest level in any region in the State</p>  <p>  We remain committed to achieving an overall jobs uplift of between 10 and 15 per cent in each region by 2020 and to bring and/or maintain unemployment levels in each region to within at least one percentage point of the State average.</p>  <p>  To that end, in April 2018, I asked all the Regional Action Plan for Jobs Implementation Committees, including the North-West and the North-East regions, to start a process to refresh and refocus all Regional Plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020, so that they continue to deliver jobs across the country, in every region, and are robust enough to address the challenges we face, including Brexit.</p>  <p>  The outcome of this refresh process is nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020, which build on the very strong progress made on employment creation under the Regional Action Plan for Jobs 2015-2017. I am currently in the process of launching the new Plans, with eight Plans launched to date, including for the North-West and the North-East.</p>  <p>  Shaped from the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; by regional stakeholders, and overseen by my Department, the new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 complement national level policies and programmes emanating from the &lsquo;top-down&rsquo; and, there is strong alignment with Ireland&rsquo;s national enterprise policy, Enterprise 2025 Renewed and the forthcoming Future Jobs Ireland initiative. </p>  <p>  The principle behind the Regional Enterprise Plans is collaboration between regional stakeholders on initiatives that can help to realise the region&rsquo;s enterprise development potential so that all regions can meet and exceed the regional job creation targets set to 2020. These stakeholders include: the Local Authorities, the LEOs, the enterprise agencies, the Regional Skills Forum, tourism bodies, private sector &lsquo;enterprise champions&rsquo;, and others.</p>  <p>  It is also important to note that as well as meeting the numerical targets, it is also about creating jobs that are of good quality and sustainable over the longer term.</p>  <p>  The Government is focused on this agenda at the national level through the Future Jobs Ireland initiative, and we are focused on this agenda through these new Regional Enterprise Plans.</p></reply>

This enhanced direct and rapid access will improve clinical outcomes for the sickest children and young people.</p>  <p>  The helipad at the new children's hospital has been designed in close consultation with the National Ambulance Service Aeromedical Liaison Service who are responsible for providing helicopter services to hospitals. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) also consulted with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Corps who are the primary provider of paediatric helicopter services to the National Ambulance Service.  At the time of application the Air Corps confirmed to the NPHDB that they are capable of providing night time landings. </p>  <p>  The NPHDB has also advised that, when reviewing the alternatives with the Irish Aviation Authority and the Air Corps, they recommended against a ground helipad due to the constrained flight paths and obstacle clearance. Use of elevated landing sites on the roof of hospitals is widespread in the UK and Europe and many of the recently completed paediatric hospitals have elevated helipads. </p>  <p>  The Air Corps is the primary provider of paediatric helicopter services to the National Ambulance Service. Air Corps helicopters comprising Augusta Westland AW139 can land on a raised landing site or the roof of a building which is designed and certified for such operations.  The Irish Coast Guard provides reserve support to the National Ambulance Service, when required, through its Sikorsky S92 search and rescue fleet primarily for search and rescue missions. The Sikorsky S92 helicopters are not licensed to land on helipads and, for access to the St. James's Campus, will land in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham from which patients will be transferred in an ambulance by road, as is current practice. </p>  <p>  The majority of patient transfers to the three Dublin children&rsquo;s hospitals are completed by road. In any major emergency rescue in a rural area, a Sikorsky Helicopter will bring the patient to the nearest regional hospital for stabilisation resulting in an appropriately planned transfer to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.</p></reply>

Our current call taking arrangements represents an unacceptably high patient safety risk and can give rise to delays in the allocation of ambulance resources to patients, including in potentially life-threatening situations. </p>  <p>  Since the 1990s several reports have raised concerns about the existence of two separate ambulance call and dispatch centres in Dublin.  In line with recommendations set out in these reports, Dublin City Council and the HSE have proposed the transfer of all DFB ambulance call taking and dispatch functions to the National Emergency Operations Centre, such that all such services across the state are consolidated in one centre.  This issue is currently the subject of a mediation process between Dublin City Council and DFB staff associations.</p></reply>

The functions of the PSI are carried out on its behalf by the Council of the Society.  </p>  <p>  Section 30 of the Pharmacy Act 2007 provides for an exception to the general provision in the Act which requires the sale and supply of medicines at a pharmacy to be conducted under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, and specifies that no offence is committed where a registered pharmaceutical assistant &ldquo;acts on behalf of a registered pharmacist during the temporary absence of the registered pharmacist&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Section 30 also permits the Council to make rules as to:</p>  <p>  1. That may or may not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist; and</p>  <p>  2. What constitutes the temporary absence of a registered pharmacist.</p>  <p>  Following a period of public consultation, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting of 20 September 2018, where the Council approved the draft rules without amendment.  Following this, the PSI undertook to redraft the Rules in relation to what may or not be done by a registered pharmaceutical assistant when acting on behalf of a registered pharmacist. </p>  <p>  On 6 December, the Council of the PSI approved a revised draft of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 for issuance for public consultation. This public consultation commenced on 13 December 2018 and ran until 11 January 2019, affording any interested party the opportunity to make representations on the matter directly to the PSI.</p>  <p>  Following completion of the public consultation phase, the Council of the PSI considered the proposed draft Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Temporary Absence of Pharmacist from Pharmacy) Rules 2018 at its meeting on 14 February 2019. </p>  <p>  In April 2017, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Pharmaceutical Assistants' Association (PAA) to discuss the association&rsquo;s concerns regarding the PSI&rsquo;s development of draft Rules governing the practice of registered pharmaceutical assistants during the temporary absence of a pharmacist. </p>  <p>  Correspondence outlining the concerns of registered pharmaceutical assistants has been received by my Department. My role in relation to this process is limited to the consideration of the draft Rules once submitted for my approval and, as I&rsquo;m sure you will appreciate, I must consider any Rules presented to me from a fair and impartial perspective, without prejudice or prejudgement. This includes consideration of concerns raised by, or on behalf of, registered pharmaceutical assistants.</p>  <p>  I await the receipt of the Rules for my consideration from the PSI and, until that time, I am unfortunately not in a position to comment any further on the matter raised.</p></reply>

The number of patients attending Emergency Departments continues to increase year on year, with approximately 1.3 million attendances in 2018, up 3.5% on 2017. This reflects increasing demand for unscheduled care, especially by patients in the 75 years and over age group. Patients in this age group are the highest users of most health and social care services, have more complex needs and longer stays in our acute hospitals.</p>  <p>  However, the National Service Plan 2019 includes an expected activity target that 99% of patients aged 75 and over are discharged or admitted within 24 hours of registration.  Therefore, any breach of this target in respect of patients in this age cohort is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  With regard to the specific question the Deputy has asked, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly.</p></reply>

In 2018, beef exports to the UK were valued at &euro;1,206m, 49% of the total value of beef exports.</p>  <p>  I and my officials have been working very hard for quite some time to sensitise other Member States and the European Commission to the potentially very severe impacts of Brexit on the Irish agrifood and fisheries sectors, in particular beef, and to the likelihood of specific supports being required in order to deal with these impacts. The institutions of the European Union are very well aware of the likelihood of a significant impact of a disorderly Brexit on Ireland&rsquo;s economy because this has been part of the discussion from the beginning, and indeed this is explicitly recognised in the Commission&rsquo;s own communication on contingency planning.</p>  <p>  Most recently, I held a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Hogan to discuss the potential impact of a disorderly Brexit on the Irish agrifood and fisheries sectors. We discussed the unique exposure of these sectors to the threat of a disorderly Brexit, and the challenges that it could present. I stressed the need to be ready to deploy a range of measures to mitigate the potential impacts on farmers and processors, including through traditional market supports and exceptional aid under the CAP's Single Common Market Organisation regulation, and increased flexibility under State Aid regulations. Commissioner Hogan reiterated the EU&rsquo;s readiness to respond and support Ireland, and we will remain in contact on these issues as the situation evolves.</p></reply>

Moreover, since the transposition of the EU Network and Information Security Directive, last year, the NCSC has a series of formal powers around securing a range of critical infrastructure, including internet infrastructure. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there is also an existing statutory mechanism to deal with the security of telecommunications networks. ComReg has a series of statutory powers flowing from the Electronic Communications Networks and Services Regulations 2011 (S.I.

The details of this work are obviously not for public release.</p>  <p>  My Department is leading in the development of a new National Cyber Security Strategy. Stakeholder Consultations have begun, and a public consultation process will launch shortly. It is envisaged that this Strategy will set out how the State will work and cooperate with key State Agencies, industry partners and international peers in the interests of protecting critical infrastructure, improving situational awareness and incident management, as well as facilitating education, training and public awareness initiatives in respect of cyber security. The public consultation, which will launch shortly, will address these issues in a thematic manner, and will pose a series of questions around how we might better (1) protect critical national Infrastructure and services from Cyber Security related risks, (2) develop our skills base and industrial capacity in this field, and (3) engage nationally and internationally on cyber security matters, both to build awareness and to ensure that our international policy position takes cognisance of developments in cyber security.</p></reply>

Licences are applied for and issued annually.  An annual public licence does not confer property or other rights on the holder and consequently licences are not transferable and cannot be offered for sale.  In that regard also, the issue of compensation does not arise.  The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced following the decision to cease, for conservation reasons, the commercial salmon mixed stock fishery in the sea. In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects. Under the scheme, fishermen active in the fishery could opt to voluntarily cease fishing in the commercial drift net and draft net sectors and undertake not to seek a licence in the future. The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008 and I understand that all funds were expended and there are no plans to revisit such a scheme.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country, and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest. </p><p>Since December 2015, the number of premises with access to high-speed broadband in Kildare has increased by 9,578, a 7% increase. In total, the number of premises in Kildare with access to high speech broadband is 77,589, 84% of the total premises in the County. Another 761 will be served by eir under that company&rsquo;s ongoing rural deployment.</p><p>The remaining 13,885 homes, schools and businesses in Kildare will be connected under the government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan. </p><p>In April 2017 my Department published an updated High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the National Broadband Plan. The Map is colour coded and searchable by address or Eircode. </p><p>The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. I will bring a recommendation to Government in relation to the NBP in the coming weeks.</p><p>Under a Commitment Agreement signed with my Department in April 2017, eir is in the process of passing 300,000 predominantly rural homes with high speed broadband. According to data for Q4 2018 submitted by eir to my Department the company has passed more than 225,000 premises nationwide as part of its ongoing deployment. This information will be available on my Department's website shortly.</p><p>Information on eir's rural deployment is available on that company&rsquo;s website, . A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>.</p><p>For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements. </p></reply>

Furthermore, 74% of managed municipal waste was recovered in 2016 (compared to 59% in 2012). Significantly more residual waste is now used as a fuel (energy recovery) than disposed to landfill. Further information is available at</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>New waste management targets recently agreed by the European Council include a provision that Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2035 the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10% or less of the total amount of municipal waste generated (by weight). </p><p>The continued implementation of European, national and regional waste management policy to manage waste in line with the waste hierarchy will help ensure that Ireland is well placed to meet this new target.</p><p>The potential introduction of economic instruments designed to improve environmental behaviour are being considered in the context of a review of the Environment Fund. </p></reply>

The NBP aims to ensure high speed broadband access to all premises in Ireland, regardless of location. This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p>  <p>  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, less than 700,000, or 30% of all 2.3 million Irish premises had access to high speed broadband. When this Government came into office, this had risen to 52%. Today, 74% of premises can access high speed broadband. </p>  <p>  The procurement process to appoint a bidder for the State intervention network is now at the final stage. I will bring a recommendation to Government in relation to the NBP in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  For those premises currently awaiting access to high speed broadband, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing. These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities. The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements. </p></reply>

Under SI 694 and 695 of 2011, Coast Guard vehicles can be fitted with blue lights and warning devices. Arising from a safety review internally, the Coast Guard issued a clarification to its volunteers in relation to how these blue lights and warning devices (sirens) should be used on public roads. This instruction sets out the existing position as regards their use while driving on public roads.  The issue of training Coast Guard volunteers and full-time staff in the correct and safe use of Blue Lights and sirens is being addressed as part of the Coast Guard&rsquo;s Safety and Risk Work Plan. </p>  <p>  Any legislative changes in relation to the use of blue lights and sirens would require a policy assessment which would have to take account, inter alia, of the need to balance the safety of staff, whether full-time or voluntary, members of the public as well as those to whom the Coast Guard is responding.</p></reply>

Legislating for a stand-alone agency is an inherently complex task and the volunteer dimension of the Coast Guard's activities adds to that complexity. The test for any such designation, given the complexity of the legislation and associated costs, is the added value it would bring. The Coast Guard is functioning very effectively as a Division of my Department and its role is supported through various legislative instruments.  For that reason,  I advised at the time that it was difficult to identify any benefit or added value for legislation of this nature.   </p>  <p>  An Irish Coast Guard Authority Bill was proposed by Deputy Troy during 2018.

This means that, unless action is taken by the European Commission, a Green Card will be required to demonstrate to the authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain that valid motor insurance cover is in place for those vehicles, and vehicles from the UK coming to the State will require a Green Card as proof of insurance.  However, even in the case of a no deal scenario, the EU Commission would be able under the Motor Insurance Directive to declare that vehicles entering the EU from the UK would not require a Green Card.  It would be a matter for the UK authorities to determine whether they required a Green Card for Irish vehicles.  My Department continues to actively liaise with the European Commission on this issue.</p>  <p>  As part of necessary contingency preparations, the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) has advised that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Green Cards will be begin to be issued to affected policyholders in March 2019 and policy holders are advised to contact their insurers a month in advance of their expected travel date.  This is an example of prudent advance planning by the MIBI and the wider insurance sector. </p>  <p>  The Green Card is used as proof of insurance.  The Department understands that the vast majority of Irish motor insurance policies already include cover for travel in the UK. In such cases drivers will continue to be insured to drive in the UK even in a no-deal Brexit. However, they will need to carry the Green Card as proof of insurance if no other agreement is reached with the European Commission in the meantime.  </p>  <p>  Not all policies may include such cover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In that eventuality, drivers who may be travelling to or through Northern Ireland or Great Britain should check their motor insurance policies and, if in doubt, check with their insurers that such travel would be covered.</p></reply>

It has been confirmed to me that there is a legal requirement for a person arriving to the State by sea or air to present to an immigration officer and that this requirement does not apply to persons travelling within the State.  As approved airports, an immigration presence is maintained at Donegal and Kerry Airports, as well as, of course, at Dublin Airport. </p>  <p>  At Donegal and Kerry Airports, domestic passengers are not required to present to an immigration official on arrival. At Dublin Airport, where large numbers of international passengers arrive each day, it would be essential that any domestic passengers to remain completely segregated until after the immigration process has been completed. It is not possible at present for Dublin Airport to provide a separate channel to allow domestic passengers to bypass immigration control. As the deputy is aware, daa holds the statutory responsibility to manage and operate Dublin Airport, including all decisions on airport infrastructure investment. I understand from daa that, given the comparatively small number of passengers availing of domestic services, it would be prohibitively expensive for them to reconfigure the arrivals area of the airport to allow for such a bypass. </p></reply>

This measure, if adopted, will significantly mitigate the risk to our hauliers of accessing the UK market and using the landbridge. </p>  <p>  I am very concerned at the potential for serious disruption at UK ports, in particular Dover, and also in Calais. This may make the use of the landbridge at least in the short term commercially unviable for some operators. </p>  <p>  I  updated cabinet on 15 January 2019 on the capacity on direct shipping routes to EU continental ports as a potential alternative to the landbridge. Based on consultations by my Department with the main shipping companies, I am advised that the market is sufficiently responsive to respond to the demands of Brexit. I have asked the Irish Maritime Development Office and my officials to continue to keep this matter under review. </p>  <p>  The Irish Maritime Development Office (the &ldquo;IMDO&rdquo;) carried out a study for the Department concerning the implications of Brexit on the use of the UK landbridge. The study, published last year, found that 3 million tonnes of merchandise trade with the EU moves between Ireland and the EU continent via the UK landbridge. The IMDO estimates that this equates to approximately 150,000 Heavy Goods Vehicles each year and the total value of our trade using the landbridge was estimated to be &euro;21 billion.  This route is a strategically important route to market for many Irish importers and exporters and certain sectors of the economy may be adversely affected, mainly those that trade in time sensitive goods, e.g. Agrifood and seafood. </p>  <p>  The Landbridge Project Group, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and including officials from my own Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and others has been working closely with the European Commission and other affected Member States (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden) with a view to preparing EU ports to facilitate the transit of EU products through the UK once it becomes a third country through the use of EU rules on internal transit as set out under the Union&rsquo;s Custom Code.  The EU has agreed that the UK may join the Common Transit Convention upon its departure from the EU on 29 March 2019, and a number of formal steps were taken to allow this to happen on 4 December 2018 which will enable the use of the EU&rsquo;s internal transit procedure. The Landbridge Project Group has also visited France and the Netherlands, and will visit Calais on 6 March. </p>  <p>  I have also met my UK counterpart, Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling and have set out the importance of continued transport connectivity between Ireland and the UK, highlighting the importance of the UK landbridge for Ireland as a route to European markets, and the need for Irish trade to move efficiently through ports. I also met France&rsquo;s Transport Minister Borne on Brexit matters including the landbridge, in November, and France&rsquo;s Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean Yves Le Drian on 19 February. </p>  <p>  Businesses must however prepare for Brexit and examine their supply chains. The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys TD, on 4 March urged businesses to make sure that they are ready to avail of the customs transit procedure for moving goods through the UK landbridge post-Brexit. The transit procedure allows goods to pass across customs borders with all duties and other charges suspended until arrival at their destination. In order to avail of the Transit procedure, businesses will need to have a Revenue-approved comprehensive financial guarantee in place. This comprehensive guarantee is required as financial security to cover all potential and actual customs debts such as customs and taxes.</p></reply>

The proposed measures were due to interventions by a number of Member States including Ireland. While these measures are temporary in nature, they will, if adopted, ensure the immediate continued access for our road hauliers to the UK market and also for direct flights to and from the UK, including for air freight. However, significant challenges remain and disruption cannot be fully avoided in all areas.</p>  <p>  In relation to North - South, the Government is not planning for a hard border and the EU is fully supportive of this position.</p>  <p>  In relation to east-west supply chains, the continued use of the landbridge as a key route connecting Ireland with the continent is a crucial concern given the level of imports and exports that are transported via this route, with 16% of the HGV traffic between Ireland and GB estimated to constitute landbridge traffic. The total value of our trade using the landbridge has been estimated to be approximately &euro;21 billion. Goods using the landbridge include many time-sensitive or perishable goods, and are transported by truck on Roll-on / Roll-Off shipping services to and through the UK.  Dublin and Rosslare ports handle almost all of this traffic.</p>  <p>  In a no-deal scenario, the ease with which these movements of goods currently take place will no longer be guaranteed. Additional customs, agriculture and health controls will be required at EU ports that trade with the UK.  In the case of the landbridge route, the ports of Dublin, Rosslare, Holyhead and the Dover-Calais link are of paramount concern.   In Ireland, the OPW, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health and the Revenue Commissioners are already preparing by developing the necessary plans within Dublin and Rosslare Ports to allow for these controls. I am aware that similar preparations are ongoing in Calais.</p>  <p>  Some trade currently using the landbridge route may, depending on the nature of the product, switch to the direct routes to the continent. For others, some delays at UK and other EU ports may not be such as to constitute a significant deterrent to the continued use of the landbridge. However, the use of the landbridge for some other products that are perishable or very time sensitive may become unviable and may also not be viable on the longer direct maritime links.</p>  <p>  I updated cabinet on 15 January 2019 on the capacity on direct shipping routes to EU continental ports.  In doing so, I set out the importance of the UK landbridge as a critical route for Irish trade and the importance of alternative direct shipping routes should traffic on the landbridge become disrupted as a result of Brexit. My view then was that sufficient capacity on the direct shipping routes to continental EU ports was available to meet the demands of Brexit and that the market was sufficiently flexible to cater for any increase in demand.</p>  <p>  This understanding of the likely response of shipping companies to Brexit-related challenges was tested in a series of meetings with senior representatives of shipping companies, including both immediately before and after I briefed Government.   While I remain of this view and I re-iterated it at Cabinet yesterday, I have asked that the IMDO and my Department continue to keep this under review.</p></reply>

Neither the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport nor the Central Bank of Ireland has the power to direct insurance companies on the pricing of insurance products. The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept and adequate provisioning to meet those risks. These are considered by insurance companies on a case by case basis.</p><p>?Insurance Ireland operates a free insurance information service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. All calls regarding refusal to quote, or quotations that are so excessive as to be in effect a refusal, should be directed to Insurance Ireland by phone at (01) 676 1820, by email at<i>declined@insuranceireland</i>.eu or by post at 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1 quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.</p><p>I note that the question refers to persons who have swapped licences, presumably from overseas, for Irish licences. Such circumstances only arise when individuals change residence and presumably therefore the level of risk to which they are exposed while driving would also change in those circumstances, with consequences for insurance premia.</p></reply>

Where a prospective borrower fails to qualify under the local authority MPI scheme, they must source comparable and alternative adequate cover elsewhere and provide evidence of this cover to the local authority.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides an appropriate level of insurance cover to those who wish to avail of the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. It offers a number of additional features over and above the standard MPI products available on the market. Standard MPI schemes are individually priced, based on an applicant&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement, offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme. The scheme also provides other benefits over standard MPI schemes. These include the payment of mortgage repayments if there is a valid claim as a result of disability; an additional payment of &euro;3,000 in the event of a member&rsquo;s death, separate to life cover; and members are also covered for death up to age 75 rather than 65 as is the case under standard MPI cover.  </p>  <p>  To change the conditions of the scheme to allow borrowers to opt out would have a negative impact on it and increase the cost for all remaining borrowers. It would also increase the risk to local authorities and could therefore increase the cost of borrowing in the future. </p></reply>

The funding is available for key facilitating infrastructure, on public lands, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent. I envisage a maximum amount of SSF funding of &euro;50,000 per affordable home and on this basis, at least 6,200 affordable homes could be facilitated. </p><p>On 11 December 2018, I issued approval in principle for ten infrastructure projects across five local authority areas, in Dublin and Cork, under the first call for proposals. The first tranche of funding of &euro;43 million will enable delivery of 1,400 affordable homes on local authority lands. I expect infrastructure works on these projects to begin as soon as possible in 2019 and delivery of affordable homes from 2020 onwards. Details of the projects are set out in Table 1. </p><p>There are five further projects under active consideration by my Department, with the potential to facilitate the delivery of an additional 230 affordable homes. Details of these sites are set out in Table 2. </p><p>All local authorities have been requested to carry out economic assessments of the requirement for affordable housing in their areas and the viability to deliver such affordable housing from their sites. As part of the process my Department hosted a workshop for local authorities on 8th November 2018,  to discuss these issues. A second call for proposals under the SSF will be made shortly. The scope of that call will be influenced by the information received from local authorities, as part of the aforementioned assessments.</p><p>An important factor in the allocation of funding under the SSF is the capacity to translate that funding into a discount on the affordable homes. In addition, local authorities must consider the market price of similar homes on sale locally in the  private market and the level of discount on market price envisaged, which will be required under the Affordable Purchase Scheme terms. The objective is to maximise the benefits from public money by funding the best value for money proposals possible. My Department continues to engage pro-actively with local authorities regarding these issues and meets with local authorities, individually and collectively, in a range of different formations, on a regular basis, in relation to their housing programmes. In the coming weeks, officials from my Department will be meeting with the local authorities who received approval under the first call in relation to the development of these sites.  </p><p>Table 1: List of (ten) proposals that have received approval in principle<table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Project/Location</th><th>Total Provisional Cost of Proposal<br /><br />(100%)<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>Provisional   Exchequer Grant Amount (89%)<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>Provisional Local Authority Contribution<br /><br />(11%)<br /><br />&euro;</th><th>Type of Infrastructure proposed</th><th>Affordable  <br /><br />Housing Potential</th><th>Total (Social &amp;amp;

This arose from a comprehensive citizen engagement programme (curated and implemented by a contracted digital content agency) to showcase the range and depth of Ireland's cultural and creative offering and to encourage participation in arts and creative activities as a means of individual, collective and societal well-being. The vision of the Creative Ireland Programme is that every person in Ireland should have the opportunity to realise their full creative potential. This represents a new approach to creativity and cultural policy and therefore requires a sustained ongoing communications programme.   </p>  <p>  I am also advised that in 2018 the Culture Ireland Unit engaged Mr. Nik Quaife on a 1 year contract for the provision of services including a communications strategy for its GB18 programme, to celebrate and renew Ireland&rsquo;s cultural relationship with Britain.  Expenditure of &euro;51,400 was incurred in respect of these services.</p>  <p>  My Department also engaged D&rsquo;Arcy Marketing and Big O on 2018 at a cost of &euro;17,466 and &euro;6,125 respectively to promote awareness of the 2018 European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) campaign for the recruitment of Irish language translators to the institutions of the European Union.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the above, further expenditure of &euro;5,535 has been incurred to date in 2019 by the Creative Ireland Programme and &euro;2,446 by the Culture Ireland unit in respect of social media costs. </p>  <p>  Value for money is always an important consideration for my Department when assessing expenditure of this nature.</p></reply>

The policy was also reviewed by way of presentation and discussion at two conferences, in July 2017 and March 2018. These conferences reviewed the policy actions with specific emphasis on reuse of urban buildings and places. </p>  <p>  The GPA 2009-2015 was designed to be implemented via three strands: actions led by the Department; an open call for expressions of interest to carry out 20 priority actions; and support to enable stakeholders to carry out other actions in the policy. </p>  <p>  Each year until 2016, calls for applications for direct grant aid were issued and projects, publications and events were supported. The implementation of many actions was adjusted from the initial design in order to address current priorities better, while other actions provided a springboard for initiatives by third parties. The outputs are set out in the three reports on the policy implementation, mentioned above.</p>  <p>  The implementation of Action on Architecture 2002-2005 coincided with the restructuring of departments following the general election of 2002, when the responsibilities of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, which had published the policy, were divided among a number of departments. A number of actions were carried out by key stakeholders and those which were not completed were carried forward into the following policy. </p>  <p>  One of the notable successes of the 2002-2005 policy was the establishment of the Irish Architecture Foundation. This remains a key partner in promoting public engagement with architecture, including by excellent initiatives such as Open House and Architects in Schools. </p></reply>
