This engagement has been in place since the State first invested in the banks and it includes regular meetings where a wide range of topics are discussed.</p>  <p>  With regard to the withdrawal of Ulster Bank from the Irish market, I have had various discussions with its management on this issue. There has been several developments in relation to the Ulster Bank withdrawal in recent months:</p>  <p>  - On 11 June, Ulster Bank announced that a new Colleague Agreement has been reached with the Financial Services Union subject to a ballot of its members.</p>  <p>  - On 28 June, Ulster Bank agreed a legally binding agreement with AIB in respect of a &euro;4.2bn portfolio of performing loan products.</p>  <p>  - On 23 July, Ulster Bank reached a non-binding agreement with PTSB for the proposed sale of &euro;7.6bn performing loans, Ulster Bank&rsquo;s Lombard Asset Finance business, and 25 of 88 Ulster Bank branch locations. I note that if this potential transaction is delivered, it is expected that between 400 and 500 Ulster Bank employees will transfer to PTSB.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Central Bank that it issued an industry letter on 25 June regarding its consumer protection expectations in the changing retail banking landscape. These expectations reflect its assessment of possible risks to consumers during periods of change and reinforce previously communicated expectations, based on its experience of prior events.</p>  <p>  I welcome the agreements which have been put in place by Ulster Bank so far, and I am supportive of an outcome that would see the successful delivery of the potential agreement with PTSB. The agreement with PTSB is subject to further due diligence, negotiation, and the completion of a final binding agreement and obtaining of regulatory approvals.</p>  <p>  Tomorrow, I am due to meet Alison Rose, CEO of NatWest, Sir Howard Davies, Chair of NatWest, Jane Howard, the CEO of Ulster Bank, and Martin Murphy, the Chair of Ulster Bank. While this meeting is intended to be general in nature, I will emphasise the importance of an orderly withdrawal.</p></reply>

Under domestic legislation, professional medical care services recognised as such by the Department of Health are exempt from VAT. Professional medical care services recognised by the Department of Health are generally those medical care services supplied by health professionals who are enrolled, registered, regulated, or designated on the appropriate statutory register provided for under the relevant legislation in force in the State or equivalent legislation applicable in other countries. This includes health professionals registered under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the Nurses Act 1985 and those engaged in a regulated profession designated under Section 4 of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.</p>  <p>  Statutory Instrument No. 170 of 2018 (Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (Regulations 2018) of 2 July 2018 designates psychotherapists and counsellors as a regulated profession and established the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board. Professional counselling and psychotherapy services provided by persons registered by this Board are exempt from VAT from the date of their registration.</p>  <p>  As the deputy may be aware, the then Minister for Health, Simon Harris TD, appointed the thirteen members of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board with effect from 25 February 2019.</p>  <p>  The Board has begun the substantial body of work which must be undertaken before it is in a position to open its registers. Questions on the establishment of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board and their progress in opening their register are a matter for the Minister for Health. </p></reply>

Many submissions contain proposals across a range of taxes and allowances that are of particular relevance to the sector in which the person or representative organisation operates. Some are from individuals describing their personal circumstances to place their proposals in context.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that many representative organisations publish their pre-budget submissions on their websites and see it as part of their communication strategy with their members.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that this year I have received approximately 260 submissions to date. My officials and I consider the contents of these submissions in the context of the forthcoming Budget but do not, as a matter of course, estimate the cost of the proposals contained in each submission.</p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not possible to place a cash value on the individual proposals and requests or an overall value on their sum. I should add that there is a considerable degree of overlap between many pre-Budget submissions. This can arise coincidentally without necessarily pointing to prior consultation between individuals or organisations. However, it would not be unusual to receive multiple copies of the same or very similar submissions. This can arise when the organisation sends copies of the submission to public representatives who then forward it to me.  </p>  <p>  As I have previously said, proposals for changes to taxes that reduce the amounts collected create an additional cost, and that cost must be recovered elsewhere. However, very few submissions provide funding suggestions for their proposals and those that do usually propose tax increases for others. </p>  <p>  The submissions received cover all the main tax heads dealt with in the Finance Bill, Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Excise, VAT, Stamp Duties and Capital Acquisitions Tax. A number also make reference to the various Covid-19 related supports that the Government has put in place. </p></reply>

In relation to borrowing, I am aware of the ESRI analysis but, equally, I am aware of other pieces of analysis - including most recently from the <i>Irish Fiscal Advisory Council</i>- that highlight the risks associated with more-and-more borrowing.  </p><p>In formulating policy, therefore, Government must take all of the advice on board, including that of the civil service.  Government also takes into account the fiscal context in its decision-making.  This fiscal context is one in which our budget deficit last year was close to &euro;19 billion &ndash; the equivalent of 9 per cent of modified national income, with a broadly similar figure anticipated for this year.  Our public debt is approaching a quarter of a trillion euros, one of the highest in the developed world.  Figures of this magnitude cannot simply be ignored.</p><p>But even allowing for this fiscal context, the Government has made substantial commitments to improving housing supply. The recently launched <i>Housing for All </i>strategy commits to increase housing supply and affordability by targeting the delivery of, on average, 33,000 new homes every year to 2030. This includes the provision of over 10,000 social homes per year and an average of 6,000 affordable homes to purchase or rent. </p><p>From a fiscal perspective, this strategy is supported by significant investment of over &euro;4 billion in State funding every year to 2030 - this is the highest level of funding ever for house building.</p><p>So, from an overall perspective, Government is achieving the right balance in its approach: gradually reducing borrowing for day-to-day expenditure, while expanding capital spending, including in housing, to address supply bottlenecks.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-21a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092100062#WRB01200"><p>The Exchequer has benefited from better-than-expected corporation tax receipts this year. As of August, the most recent available data, corporation tax receipts were &euro;859 million, or 14 per cent ahead of target and up by some &euro;524 million, or just over 8 per cent ahead of the same period last year.</p><p>This over-performance is significant, but would have been even higher were it not for the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS). Up to end-August, some &euro;452 million had been deducted from corporation tax receipts and paid to qualifying businesses under the scheme.  The Exchequer at end-August received some &euro;7 billion in corporation tax receipts.</p><p>I have said on many occasions that the strong growth in corporation tax has been welcome during this period: it has meant that we have to borrow less than we otherwise would. However, I have also frequently warned that these receipts are subject to exceptional unpredictability and volatility. Around half of corporation tax receipts come from a relatively small number of large, highly profitable firms. The concentration in the tax base represents a risk to the stability of the public finances.</p><p>The recent level of corporation tax growth will not continue indefinitely. Changes to the international tax environment represent a key risk to the public finances: as a result of ongoing negotiations, Government is planning for a substantial loss to corporation tax revenues: our current estimate is that &euro;2 billion may be lost by 2025. There is still significant uncertainty about the nature of the changes and how the impact will manifest; the actual loss could be even higher. </p><p>As a result, I have regularly warned against funding permanent expenditure increases on the basis of this highly volatile and unreliable revenue stream.  Government has set out a medium-term budgetary framework in the <i>Summer Economic Statement;</i>one of the key objectives of this is to minimise the risk of uncertain corporation tax receipts being used to finance permanent increases in spending.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-21a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092100062#WRB01500"><p>I am very conscious of the pick-up in consumer price inflation in recent months.</p><p>While Covid-19 had a deflationary impact both in Ireland and internationally last year, inflation has picked up since the beginning of this year. In Ireland, the annual rate of HICP inflation rose to 3 per cent in August &ndash; the highest rate since 2008; similar trends have been observed across other advanced economies.</p><p>The increase in inflation since the beginning of this year is largely explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time, including &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the normalisation of oil prices following their collapse last spring. More fundamentally, the easing of restrictions led to a rapid rebound in consumer spending, in particular spending on goods, in the second quarter. As the economy continues to re-open, demand will pivot towards contact-intensive service sectors.  </p><p>Supply by contrast has recovered more slowly than the recovery in demand with, for instance, labour shortages in some service sectors putting upward pressure on prices. Indeed, signs of &lsquo;opening up&rsquo; inflation are already evident, with strong increases in prices in the transport and hospitality sectors recorded in the July and August inflation data from the <i>Central Statistics Office</i>. Shipping bottlenecks and shortages of inputs (e.g. semi-conductors, timber) have also raised production costs, putting further upward pressure on prices. Higher trade costs as a result of Brexit may also have contributed to the recent rise in inflation.</p><p>The emergence of inflationary pressures has prompted a debate regarding the likely persistence of these price dynamics.  Persistently higher inflation could trigger monetary policy changes by the ECB, with implications for the cost of Government borrowing. </p><p>In summary, the most likely scenario is that the current pick-up in inflation - in Ireland and elsewhere - is temporary, and will moderate as one-off factors fade and as demand stabilises and supply pressures ease.  That said, the possibility of a more sustained and persistent rise in inflation cannot be ruled out.  This is another reason why budgetary policy must evolve in line with the improving epidemiological situation; Government adopted a counter-cyclical approach to budgetary policy during the downturn and we will do so in the recovery phase also. </p></reply>

The measure is specifically targeted at the farming sector to address the particular problems faced by family farms.</p><p>My officials met with contractors' representatives in December 2019 and advised that my Department was intending to schedule a review of the scheme (and related aspects) in the context of a wider report on agri-tax reliefs and the Government's Climate policy.</p><p>The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in the intervening period caused the review to be deferred and it has yet to take place. In the meantime, the status quo has remained in relation to the application and scope of section 664A.</p><p>I would note however that, currently, those who incur expenses in relation to farm diesel in the course of their trade of agricultural contracting may claim an income tax or corporation tax deduction for these expenses, including any carbon tax charged in respect of the diesel.</p><p>Having regard to the steady progress that is now being made in reopening the economy and removing the public health restrictions that have curtailed economic activity, my Department is hopeful that the way will be clear for the promised review to be carried out, most likely in the early part of 2022. </p></reply>

Therefore the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>set out 66 actions across a number of policy areas which is aimed at reducing volatility in the market, removing barriers to entry and making Ireland more attractive to insurance companies. The Government recently published the first <i>Action Plan Implementation Report</i>. This shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now complete.</p><p>A key achievement of the Government&rsquo;s reform agenda is the establishment of the <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>, which I chair. The Office has held meetings with a wide range of bodies under the four main pillars of the Office work plan &ndash; Promotion, Transparency, Engagement and Innovation. These are targeted to promote greater market transparency, champion the provision of consumer information, such as switching campaigns, and encourage greater competition in the insurance market, including where appropriate, through the application of new technologies. I also met with CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland earlier this year. I will meet with them again over the coming months to discuss a variety of issues, in particular the need to address customer concerns regarding cost and availability of insurance.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department is also working closely with the IDA to bring new entrants into the insurance market to improve its overall competitiveness. Officials from both are developing a customised proposal and are identifying potential providers who offer insurance in identified &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; segments of the Irish market. This includes those coverage areas impacting businesses, consumers and community and voluntary groups.</p><p>In addition, Department is collaborating with the Central Bank to create an insurance databank, which will assist new providers to enter the Irish insurance market. This Programme for Government commitment was also recommended by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in its Public Liability Market report which was published in 2020.  This is complimented by the National Claims Information Databases (NCID) reports on motor and employers' liability (EL), public liability (PL) and commercial property insurance. These initiatives will provide rich sources of data to both aid transparency and assist in policy formulation.</p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure the timely implementation of the Action Plan, which is key to improving the cost and availability of insurance for all consumers, businesses and community groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

This is how we will ensure that budgetary policy remains on a sustainable path. </p></reply>

HTB is a scheme to assist such buyers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment. The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the HTB scheme. </p>  <p>  For a property to qualify for HTB, it must be new or converted for use as a home, not having been previously been used as a home. In the circumstances where the house was previously used as a dwelling but knocked down and rebuilt, then it is &ldquo;new&rdquo;. First-time buyers may purchase a site containing a house which is derelict and which they plan to demolish, in whole or in part, with the intention of building a new house. First time buyers intending to undertake such purchases should contact Revenue via MyEnquiries outlining the specific circumstances of their case and Revenue will consider them on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  In relation to second-hand properties more generally, the HTB scheme is specifically designed to encourage an increase in demand for new build homes in order to encourage the construction of an additional supply of such properties. A move to include second-hand properties within the scope of the relief might not improve its effectiveness; on the contrary, it could serve to dilute the incentive effect of the measure in terms of encouraging additional supply.</p>  <p>  Proposals for new or amended tax measures are assessed in accordance with my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines. These make clear that it is important that any policy proposal which involves tax expenditures should only occur in limited circumstances, for example where there are demonstrable market failures. In particular, they provide that a tax-based incentive should only be considered where it would be more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p>  <p>  Finally, the introduction of such measures is a matter that would generally fall to be considered in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-21a.63.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092100063#WRC00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 49 and 74 together.</p><p>As committed to in the 2020 <i>Programme for Government</i>, Government is prioritising reform of the insurance sector with particular emphasis on motor, public liability, and employer liability insurance. The whole-of-Government approach being taken through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>therefore sets out 66 actions which aim to improve both the cost and availability of this key financial service, particularly for businesses. As the Deputy may be aware, the Cabinet Committee Insurance Reform Sub-Group earlier this month published the first six-monthly Implementation Report of the <i>Action Plan</i>. This shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now completed. The Sub-Group&rsquo;s focus now is on implementing the outstanding actions on time.</p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year under the <i>Action Plan</i>was the implementation of the <i>Personal Injuries Guidelines</i>, which represents a key achievement of this insurance reform agenda, and was realised several months ahead of schedule. These significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue.  Of note is that a number of common injuries will now move to the jurisdiction of the District rather than the Circuit Court, thus reducing associated legal fees. The Guidelines also provide guidance in relation to injuries previously not included in the Book of Quantum and will be used by both the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) and the judiciary. Therefore, they should help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the PIAB to settle claims. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims, particularly legal fees. I have previously set out my view that these costs, rather than the profit component, tend to represent a bigger factor in the cost of insurance premiums. As such, it is important that they are lowered.  </p><p>As Minister for Finance, my expectation is that insurers will now commence reflecting savings from reduced award levels to customers, in line with past commitments, and both I and Minister of State Fleming are holding them to account on this.  In that regard, Minister of State Fleming met with the CEOs of the main insurers operating in Ireland to set out the Government&rsquo;s expectation in this regard. These engagements were positive, with insurers indicating that they will begin lowering premiums in response to the Guidelines. The Minister of State will meet with CEOs again later this year to review their ongoing response to this and other key reforms.</p><p>Another significant achievement of the reform agenda is the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance. The role of the Office, which is chaired by Minister of State Fleming, is twofold: to assist in reducing insurance costs and to increase the availability of cover, by promoting competition in the Irish insurance market. The Office has held a number of meetings with several key stakeholders, including insurance providers, representative bodies and other civic society groups, to understand gaps in the Irish insurance market. Its aim is to expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance, including specialised cover such as professional indemnity insurance.</p><p>Accordingly, the Department is also working closely with IDA Ireland to bring new entrants into the Irish insurance market and to improve its overall competitiveness. Officials from both are developing a customised proposition for potential market entrants and are identifying target providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market.</p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that work remains ongoing across Government to deliver further elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the PIAB, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care in order to strengthen waivers and notices. It is my hope that the implementation of these key actions in particular should have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.</p></reply>

This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued. The view of the independent Commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.  Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the cost pressure on tenants.</p>  <p>  At the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97m per annum, and it is likely that this figure would be even higher today were a similar scheme to be put in place. The refundable element mentioned by the Deputy would potentially add further to the cost. </p>  <p>  Finally, as the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot comment more specifically on measures that  may or may not be contained in the forthcoming Budget. </p></reply>

In simple terms, the effect of the measure is that Irish tax will only arise where the individual has income other than income from a foreign employment.</p><p>The relief applies subject to certain conditions, which includes the requirement that the duties of a qualifying employment are performed wholly outside the State in a country with which Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement.  There is an exception in respect of merely incidental duties which may be performed in the State. </p><p>I am advised by Revenue that, in light of the unprecedented circumstances arising due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting public health restrictions to limit movement, for the tax years 2020 and 2021, a concessional treatment for such taxpayers would apply, whereby if employees are required to work from home in the State due to Covid-19, such days working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met. The effect of this concessional treatment allows individuals resident in the State and working for a non-resident employer carry out their employment duties in the State and continue to pay tax in another jurisdiction.  </p><p>I am aware that there have been calls to place this concessional treatment on a statutory footing so that individuals who are resident in the State, but work outside the State for a non-resident employer, can continue to avail of the relief if they exercise their duties of employment in the State. </p><p>During the debates on Finance Bill 2020, I undertook that this matter would be examined as part of the work of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) for 2021. The resultant paper was discussed by the TSG as part of its deliberations on 8 September last.  The examination encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax. The review identified a number of significant concerns from a policy perspective when having regard to the interest of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing Irish resident employees and employers. The full TSG paper (TSG Paper 21/04) can be located here  - <i>www.gov.ie/en/collection/d6bc7-budget-2022-tax-strategy-group-papers/ </i>.</p><p>Over the coming weeks between now and Budget 2022, I propose to give this matter further detailed consideration having regard to the comprehensive review carried out under the auspices of the TSG and the fundamental points which the TSG paper raises. </p><p>It should also be noted that Ireland has an extensive network of Double Taxation Agreements which have the effect of eliminating double taxation on the same income source. Relief is generally afforded by way of exemption or granting relief for foreign tax paid in the country of residence of the individual. </p><p>In the event that an individual does not qualify for Trans-Border Workers&rsquo; Relief he/she may be entitled to relief from double taxation under the terms of the relevant Double Taxation Agreement, thus a double taxation charge would not arise in such circumstances.</p></reply>

My Department is currently updating its forecasts - these will underpin <i>Budget 2022</i>- and our assessment is that the economy is recovering strongly as the various public health restrictions are gradually relaxed.  This broad assessement of the economic backdrop is largely consistent with the views of the Council and Bank.</p><p>That said, I am conscious that conditions in the labour market are lagging somewhat - as is normally the case in most advanced economies - and that is why Government is keeping many of the fiscal supports in place for the next few months.  </p><p>In terms of the implications for budgetary policy, a number of key issues are outlined both by the Council and Bank. Firstly is the need to address structural fiscal challenges, while second is the issue of high public debt. </p><p>In relation to the former, the <i>Summer Economic Statement </i>set out a medium-term budgetary strategy that seeks to address this. Government is putting budgetary policy within a medium-term framework, a development that has been welcomed by the Fiscal Council.  This is being operationalised by way of an expenditure rule, through which public expenditure will be tied to the estimated trend growth rate of the economy.  Such an approach enhances fiscal sustainability while allowing investment in key government priorities, particularly capital investment. </p><p>I note, in particular, the Fiscal Council&rsquo;s view that the expenditure plans are at the limit of what is prudent.  I agree with this assessment, and that is why the Government introduced expenditure ceilings that will apply irrespective of revenue performance. </p><p>The second key point is that of public debt, and I share the assessment that this needs to be stabilised and then put on a downward path.  But it is also important to stress that both the Council and Bank are supportive of the view that allowing public debt to rise was the appropriate response to the pandemic.</p><p>Nevertheless, at almost a quarter of a trillion euros, Ireland's public debt is amongst the highest (on a per capita basis) in the developed world.  That is why, by 2023, we will eliminate the need to borrow for day-to-day spending while continuing to invest in the productive capacity of the economy.  This approach - gradually eliminating borrowing for current spending while continuing to invest in our future - is the best way of supporting economic improvements while ensuring fiscal sustainability.</p></reply>

I met with the FSU after the Ulster Bank announcement by NatWest and I have committed to further engagement with the FSU in relation to this issue.</p><p>Whilst the management of staff matters is entirely a matter for the Banks and any counterparty who acquires any of their business, I would expect all stakeholders to be very sensitive in relation to the needs and rights of staff. This includes full compliance with any statutory requirements, and honouring all agreements in place between the bank and staff representative bodies.  In addition, I would expect these entities to engage with staff representative bodies as appropriate.  </p><p><b>Ulster Bank</b></p><p>I note that on 11 June Ulster Bank reached a new Colleague Agreement with the FSU and that this agreement is subject to a ballot of FSU members. </p><p>On 23 July, Ulster Bank reached a non-binding agreement with PTSB for the proposed sale of &euro;7.6bn performing loans, Ulster Bank&rsquo;s Lombard Asset Finance business, and 25 of 88 Ulster Bank branch locations. If this potential transaction is delivered, it is expected that between 400 and 500 Ulster Bank employees will transfer to PTSB.</p><p>Ulster Bank has also committed not to close any branches in 2021 and said that it does not anticipate closing any branches in the first half of 2022. Branches will also continue to play an important role in its business in the second half of 2022.</p><p><b>KBC</b></p><p>On 16 April, when KBC announced the proposed transactions that may result in it is withdrawing from the Irish market, it stated that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Bank of Ireland, expressing the parties&rsquo; intention to explore a route that could potentially lead to a transaction whereby Bank of Ireland commits to acquire substantially all of KBC Bank Ireland&rsquo;s performing loan assets and liabilities.</p><p>I note that Bank of Ireland has commented that it will be working closely with all colleagues at these branches and will be setting out a range of options, including relocating to a different branch, moving to a new role in the bank, or voluntary redundancy for those who choose it.  KBC also made an internal announcement in mid-August regarding job security for employees until 31 December 2021. </p><p>These potential agreements are subject to further due diligence, negotiation, and the completion of a final binding agreement and obtaining of regulatory approvals. While these are commercial negotiations, the Government is supportive of trying to bring about an outcome that is good for the banking sector, as well as for the staff and customers of Ulster Bank and KBC and for the Irish economy generally.</p></reply>

This is a standard time-line for such a process as the legislation must first be enacted (Finance Act 2019 was signed into law on 22 December 2019) and then further work is required to prepare for, and schedule, discussions with Commission officials.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that this period also coincided with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which required the immediate attention of officials both in Ireland and in the Commission to develop and implement measures to support businesses and employees affected by the public health restrictions. </p>  <p>  It has been determined that, as the proposed micro and small company measures are targeted measures, in order to secure State aid approval it may be necessary to introduce some changes to the measures for micro and small companies in order to secure State aid approval. However, as the measures in their current form are enhancements to the existing general R&amp;D credit, this could present a significant administrative challenge to both taxpayers and Revenue if different criteria were to apply to two elements of a claim for the same R&amp;D costs. Adding complexity and administrative burden would be counter productive to the aim of assisting small and micro companies.  My officials are currently working to develop options to progress this position in order to deliver the best outcome for small innovative companies, including options for other methods of support taking into account the significant changes to the wider economy since the measure was announced.  The Deputy's suggestions will be taken into account in this process.</p>  <p>  Over the last 18 months, the immediate priority of this Government has been to support businesses during the Covid pandemic. Revenue advise that the companies using the extensive Covid-19 supports were primarily SME companies, and the supports were primarily aimed at delivering immediate cash supports to enable affected businesses to maintain a level of trade and retain their staff in employment.</p>  <p>  The need to attract early stage funding into new and innovative businesses has also motivated work undertaken by my officials over the last year to review the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme (EIIS), with a view to identifying options to continue to make the EIIS more efficient and effective.

This Plan sets out 66 actions across several departmental policy areas, including that of the Department of Finance, to improve the insurance environment for consumers, businesses and community groups. This cross-Governmental reform agenda has been adopted in recognition of the need for a comprehensive and structured approach in order to deliver real reform in this important area.</p><p>Implementation of the Action Plan is well underway. As the Deputy may be aware, in July the Cabinet Committee Insurance Reform Sub-Group published the first six-monthly Implementation Report of the Action Plan. This shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now completed. There have been a number of achievements made by my Department, including:</p><p>- The creation a new Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, chaired by Minister of State Fleming;</p><p>- The expansion of the National Claims Information Database (NCID) to gather data on employer and public liability insurance &ndash; the first report of which was published in July;</p><p>- The publication of the Final Report and Recommendations of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Review of Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Markets, which is now subject to a public consultation until 22 October;</p><p>- The enactment the majority of provisions under the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019; and</p><p>- The publication of the Oireachtas Post-Enactment Scrutiny Report in relation to this Act.</p><p>Work is continuing across Government to ensure the implementation of the Action Plan, with 97% of actions due to be implemented by the end of the year.  For my Department, this includes an examination of the Central Bank&rsquo;s recommendations in relation to differential pricing, as well as the development of a databank for new entrants to the insurance market.  In addition, to the Action Plan both Minister of State Fleming and I intend to bring draft legislation to Government for approval in the coming weeks.  This will address a number of important insurance issues that have arisen recently. </p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that work remains ongoing across all of Government to deliver further key elements of the Action Plan, including measures to reform the PIAB, reduce fraud, and make changes to the duty of care in order to strengthen waivers and notices. It is my hope that the implementation of these key actions in particular should further help to lower public liability insurance costs for businesses.</p></reply>

That broad approach is what has informed recent action in this area including the Roadmap for Pensions Reform 2018-2023 which, in turn, led to the work of the Interdepartmental Pensions Reform and Taxation Group and the separate work of the Pensions Commission. Indeed, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare has also been charged with considering the output from the Pensions Commission regarding sustainability and eligibility issues in respect of State Pension arrangements. </p>  <p>  In terms of the tax treatment of supplementary pensions, Ireland operates an Exempt, Exempt, Tax (EET) system, like the majority of OECD countries. This means that contributions to pensions are exempted from income tax (subject to age-related percentage and income limitations), pension fund gains are exempted from income tax but income from pension drawdown is taxed. </p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Pension Reform and Taxation Group (IDPRTG) recently reviewed the cost of funded supplementary pensions to the Exchequer. In its report published in November 2020, it noted that in common with most developed countries, fiscal support for private pension saving exists in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  It observed that in providing incentives, States are motivated by the policy objective of increasing aggregate savings or encouraging citizens to provide for their retirement, by deferring a sufficient amount of income and consumption today to provide for their later years. This is based on an assumption that individuals require an incentive to lock-up savings until they retire given that alternative saving vehicles allow on-going access. </p>  <p>  It also noted that the tax treatment of pensions represents one of the largest Exchequer tax expenditures. However, in common with other countries operating an EET system, the exact cost of this is difficult to quantify due to the general nature of tax expenditures and also specific pension-related challenges, such as limited data availability on some features of the pension regime in Ireland. </p></reply>

Similarly the European Central Bank (ECB) conduct an annual stress test, the results of which provide important input to other reviews such as the Supervisory Review and Evaluation (SREP) process.</p><p>On 30 July 2021, The EBA published the outcome for banks that participated in the 2021 EBA EU-wide stress test. Further, and for the first time, the ECB has also published high-level information on the outcome of the parallel Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) stress test of banks directly supervised by the ECB but which were not included in EBA EU wide stress test. The results for the Irish banks included in these assessments are available on the Central Bank's website.</p><p>The stress test is not a pass or fail exercise and no threshold is set to define the failure or success of banks for the purpose of the exercise. Instead, the findings of the stress test will inform the 2021 SREP for banks.</p><p>The EBA stress tests uses theoretical adverse economic scenarios to test the resilience of banks. Overall, the impact of the stress test is more severe than the results from the 2018 exercise, reflecting a more severe scenario used by the EBA. This severe scenario modelled the effect of a severe shock on these banks, to take into account the impact of the pandemic.  Nevertheless, even though uncertainties currently remain high, the benefits of resilience built up in the Irish banking sector in recent years is evident, with banks having sufficient capital to absorb the impact of the severe scenario.</p><p>Interest rates on new lending (mortgages, non-financial corporations and consumer) in Ireland are higher than in most other EU countries.</p><p>However, the trends show that interest rates in Ireland have been falling in recent years, providing benefit to consumers. Interest rates on new mortgages (excluding renegotiations) have fallen from 4.05% in December 2014 to 2.73% in July 2021.  The weighted average interest rate on new fixed rate mortgage agreements stood at 2.62 per cent in July, down from a series high of 4.11 per cent in December 2014. </p><p>We have also seen reductions in interest rates on loans to SMEs from 5.19% to 3.89% over the period Quarter 1 2015 to Quarter 1 2021, as well as reductions in interest rates on consumer loans (for example, from 8.3% to 6.7% on Annual Percentage Rate (APRC) consumer loans from January 2015 to July 2021).</p><p>There are a number of explanations that likely explain the higher level of interest rates in Ireland relative to other countries. In particular Irish retail banks&rsquo; mortgage modelled Risk Weighted Assets are higher than the EU average. This results primarily from the relatively high historic credit risk experience in Ireland, the longer workout process on defaulted loans and uncertainty in relation to collateral realisation and the relatively elevated levels of Non-Performing Loans and restructured loans in Irish banks. These higher capital requirements increase the cost of lending for banks, but now leave them in a more resilient position, reducing the risk of systemic stress events. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of a resilient banking sector that can withstand adverse shocks.</p></reply>

As I have stated before, the primary objective of any vacant residential property tax would be to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand rather than increasing tax revenues. However, before introducing such a tax it is of course important to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long term vacant properties, and the reasons why they are vacant. </p>  <p>  The recently enacted Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 enables Revenue to collect certain limited information on vacant properties in the LPT return form it will issue to property owners in advance of the new LPT valuation date of 1 November next. This information, together with information from other available sources will be used to assess the merits and impact of introducing a Vacant Property Tax. </p>  <p>  It is important to identify the reasons for vacancy and whether this is long or short-term in nature. There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate. Appropriate exemptions from any charge would have to be considered in addition to acceptable periods of vacancy. </p>  <p>  While it is the clear intention of Government to introduce a Vacant Property Tax, the matter needs extensive consideration for such a measure to be effective and to determine the properties that should be targeted. Once this information has been collated, I will be in a better position to assess the merits and precise design of a Vacant Property Tax. </p></reply>

Furthermore, I also note the CCPC&rsquo;s ongoing concerns regarding the culture within the Irish insurance industry.  </p><p>The outcome of the CCPC&rsquo;s investigation underlines the importance of insurance in general and the impact of its cost and availability on consumers, businesses and community groups.  The Government remains committed to reform of the sector, through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>. The first six-monthly Implementation Report of the Action Plan, published in July 2021 indicates that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 34 of the 66 actions now complete. </p><p>The upcoming Competition (Amendment) Bill is a priority this year for Government, as part of our overall Action Plan commitments to reform the insurance sector. This new law, to be published this autumn, will significantly strengthen the CCPC&rsquo;s powers, giving them the ability to administer significant fines for breaches of competition law. </p><p>Separately, one of the central achievements in the first half of this year under the Action Plan was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, which was realised several months ahead of schedule. These significantly reduce award levels for many categories of common injuries, particularly those of soft tissue.  </p><p>The Guidelines should help to bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such reinforce the benefits of using the PIAB to settle claims. This in turn should further reduce the costs of claims. It is my expectation is that insurers should now be reflecting savings from reduced award levels to customers, in line with past commitments, in the form of reduced premiums across their product lines. </p><p>Minister for State Fleming has had number of positive engagements with the CEOs of the main insurers operating here on the matter, and they have indicated that they will respond positively to the Guidelines. He will meet with them again later this year to review their ongoing actions. </p><p>Another significant achievement of the reform agenda is the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market within the Department of Finance. The Office has held a number of meetings with several key stakeholders, including insurance providers, representative bodies and other civic society groups, to understand gaps in the Irish insurance market. Its aim is to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. The Office will meet the CCPC to discuss their recent investigation.</p><p>I would also add that work remains ongoing across Government Departments to deliver further key aspects of the Action Plan over the coming months. Furthermore, Minister of State Fleming intends to shortly bring forward legislation to help increase transparency and provide enhanced protections for consumers. </p><p>In conclusion, securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my firm belief that implementation of the Action Plan will have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses, community and voluntary groups across Ireland.  </p></reply>

The annual rate of HICP inflation rose to 3 per cent in August &ndash; the highest rate since 2008. Similar trends have been observed across advanced economies, with inflation rates of 5.3, 3.2 and 3 per cent recorded in the US, UK and euro area in August.  </p>  <p>  However, the increase in inflation since the beginning of this year is largely explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time, including the reversal of the temporary VAT cut and &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the normalisation of oil prices following their collapse last spring. More fundamentally, on the demand side the easing of restrictions led to a rapid rebound in consumer spending, in particular spending on goods, in the second quarter. As the economy continues to re-open, demand will pivot towards contact-intensive service sectors.  </p>  <p>  Supply by contrast has recovered more slowly, with labour shortages in service sectors putting upward pressure on prices. Indeed, signs of &lsquo;opening up&rsquo; inflation are already evident, with strong increases in prices in the transport and hospitality sectors recorded in July and August. Shipping bottlenecks and shortages of inputs (e.g. semi-conductors, timber) have also raised production costs, putting further upward pressure on prices. Higher trade costs as a result of Brexit may also have contributed to the recent rise in inflation.</p>  <p>  The emergence of inflationary pressures has prompted a debate regarding the likely persistence of these price dynamics as consistently higher inflation could trigger monetary policy changes by the ECB, with implications for the cost of Government borrowing. Looking beyond the short-term, however, it seems likely that these temporary factors will fade as demand stabilises and supply pressures ease. Consistent with this view, the ECB last week reiterated that the current inflationary pressures are largely temporary and inflation in the euro area is still expected to remain below 2 per cent over the medium term. Nevertheless, my Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse inflationary developments and will publish updated inflation and economic forecasts alongside the Budget in the autumn.</p></reply>

From the outset, I must state that it is not appropriate for the Minister for Finance to comment on the tax affairs of individual businesses.</p><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Revenue uses a range of resources to identify instances of tax avoidance, which would include tax avoidance arising from the arrangements described in the Agreement between the Competent Authorities of Ireland and Malta.</p><p>Those arrangements involved an exploitation of a mismatch of Irish and Maltese rules in relation to company residence and domicile, which could have led to income falling out of charge in Ireland and in Malta, resulting in double <i>non-taxation</i>of the income concerned. I cannot comment on the arrangements of any specific taxpayer. However, arrangements as described in the Christian Aid report are not arrangements that involve a mismatch of residence and domicile rules that would lead to double non-taxation, through amounts falling out of charge in both Ireland in Malta.</p><p>The purpose of the Ireland-Malta Competent Authority Agreement was to deter the arrangements described in the Agreement. The Christian Aid report appears to confirm that the Agreement was effective in achieving that purpose&mdash; and I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have not identified information that would suggest otherwise. As regards those arrangements or any other aggressive tax planning, I have repeatedly stated that I will not hesitate to propose legislation to address tax avoidance, where it may not be possible to address arrangements within the existing code. The Revenue Commissioners liaise with my Department on that basis, in relation to potential loopholes they identify.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners cannot comment directly or indirectly on the arrangements of a specific taxpayer. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners &ndash; as a general statement and without their reference to, or implication in respect of, any specific case &ndash; that they do not provide confirmations or opinions to taxpayers on matters in respect of which they suspect there may be a tax avoidance purpose.</p><p>Revenue is strongly committed to identifying and challenging tax avoidance, including schemes that would seek to rely on Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreements. Revenue has reviewed Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) network in relation to the possibility of arrangements, similar to those addressed by the Ireland-Malta Competent Authority Agreement, being implemented using a different DTA. Specifically, Revenue has considered Ireland&rsquo;s DTA with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has been cited in that regard. </p><p>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the absence of a generally-applicable corporate tax in the UAE, the UAE DTA contains provisions designed to prevent companies from qualifying as residents of the UAE for the purposes of the DTA. While Revenue will remain vigilant for indications of avoidance, they consider that DTA has been designed to prevent such possible use and that the risk of implementation of arrangements, similar to those addressed in the Competent Authority Agreement with Malta, is low in relation to the UAE DTA and other DTAs designed for restricted application. </p><p>For my part, I have repeatedly demonstrated that I am committed to taking action to ensure the Irish tax code is in line with new and emerging international tax standards as agreed globally.The January 2021 Update to Ireland&rsquo;s Corporation Tax Roadmap highlights the actions that have already been taken and will continue to be taken in this process of corporation tax reform.</p><p>In this vein, it is important to remember that in recent Finance Acts, the Oireachtas has;</p><p>- substantially progressed transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives through the introduction of Controlled Foreign Company rules, and anti-hybrid rules;</p><p>- introduced defensive measures against listed jurisdictions through enhanced Controlled Foreign Company Rules;</p><p>- updated transfer pricing rules;</p><p>- introduced legislation for OECD BEPS measures on mandatory disclosure rules; and</p><p>- substantially widened the scope of the Exit Tax regime &mdash; with the result that, on the migration of a company from Ireland to another country of residence, the increase in the value of assets to the date of the company&rsquo;s departure will be chargeable to Irish tax.</p><p>It should also be recognised that Ireland has a longstanding General Anti-Avoidance Rule, which goes beyond the standard required in the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives.</p><p>Further, in the upcoming Finance Bill, it is intended that we will complete the transposition of the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives, with the introduction of interest limitation rules and anti-reverse hybrid rules. It is intended that these rules will take effect from 1 January 2022.</p><p>This reform is not complete: As set out in the update to the Corporation Tax Roadmap, over the coming years there are commitments to introduce a series of measures to further reform our corporate tax code, including through the introduction of measures to apply to outbound payments, further action against listed jurisdictions, as well as publishing a tax treaty policy statement with a particular focus on developing countries.</p><p>The need to carry out a further Spillover analysis is outweighed by the need to deliver on important ongoing policy priorities, including publishing a tax treaty policy statement with a particular focus on developing countries and taking due account of the international tax discussions, detailed in the January 2021 Update to Ireland's Corporation Tax Roadmap .  A public consultation to inform this process has taken place and my officials are considering the content in detail to inform this process.</p></reply>

The Statement acknowledges that, as large consumers of electricity, data centres pose challenges to the capacity of our electricity grid and the future planning and operation of a sustainable power system.</p><p>The Government is currently preparing a new Climate Action Plan that will address, amongst other objectives, our ambition to further decarbonise our electricity system. We will seek to further decarbonise our electricity grid while simultaneously pursuing the electrification of sectors such as transport and heating and, crucially, preserving our security of supply and the reliability of our grid. </p><p>Arising from the Climate Action Plan, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has indicated that the <i>&lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy&rsquo; </i>may need to be revised to reflect new policy and regulatory developments, ongoing challenges and potential opportunities facing the sector. The Government will seek to ensure that this important infrastructure for our wider technology sector and information based economy can be facilitated sustainably, and also that new data centre developments can be harnessed to drive the decarbonisation of our electricity system and deliver regional economic opportunities. </p><p>With regard to taxation, businesses may claim capital allowances on capital expenditure incurred on certain types of business assets and business premises. Capital allowances allow the wear and tear of plant and machinery be taken into account as a deduction for tax purposes. In general, such capital allowances are claimed at a rate of 12.5% annually, over eight years.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that data centres are not separately identifiable on Revenue records.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-21a.148.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092100065#WRE02200"><p>The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) was introduced on 26 March 2020. It was legislated for in Section 28 of the Emergency Measure in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and was an emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy. The TWSS was also intended to facilitate the retention of the employer/employee relationship thereby supporting the early recommencement of normal business when conditions allowed. The scheme operated until 31 August 2020 and was replaced by the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) from 1 September 2020.</p><p>To ensure TWSS payments were made as quickly as possible to employees at the outset of the pandemic, income tax and the Universal Social Charge (USC) liabilities for 2020 were not taxed in the normal &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; manner through the PAYE system and were instead calculated at the end of the year. These liabilities may be collected interest free over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing employees&rsquo; tax credits. The EWSS restored the normal &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; arrangements for PAYE with deductions made as employees are paid.</p><p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) which was legislated for in Finance Act 2020 is a social welfare payment for workers who became unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PUP payments are classified in legislation as income supports and as such are subject to income tax but are exempt from USC and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI). The standard mechanism to tax Department of Social Protection (DSP) payments is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands and collect the liability through the PAYE system. However, like the TWSS, the PUP was not taxed in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; in 2020 and was instead calculated at the end of the year and may also be paid, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022 by reducing employees&rsquo; tax credits.</p><p>Revenue published statistics in January 2021 on the preliminary end of year tax position for all PAYE taxpayers for 2020, which can be found on Revenue's website at the following link - </p><p>The statistics show that across the entire PAYE case base of over 2.3 million taxpayer units, including those in receipt of TWSS and/or PUP subsidy payments, over 80% had a preliminary end of year tax position that was either balanced, overpaid, or underpaid by less than &euro;200. </p><p>The statistics also show that, for PAYE taxpayers that were in receipt of the TWSS only during 2020, 29% (79,800) were either due a refund or had no additional tax liability, while 71% (198,400) had an additional tax liability. </p><p>For PAYE taxpayers in receipt of the PUP only during 2020, 67% (203,900) were either due a refund or had no additional tax liability, while 33% (99,700) had an additional tax liability. </p><p>For PAYE taxpayers that received both TWSS and PUP in 2020, 42% (86,900) were either due a refund or had no additional tax liability, while 58% (112,500) had an additional tax liability. </p><p>Overall, for PAYE taxpayers that were in receipt of one or more of the supports (TWSS/PUP) during 2020, about 47% were either due a refund or had no additional tax liability, 23% had an additional tax liability of less than &euro;500, 15% had an additional tax liability of between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 and 15% had an additional tax liability greater than &euro;1000.</p><p>Any liabilities owed could be reduced or eliminated by offsetting additional tax credits due, for example qualifying health expenses. These additional credits could be claimed by employees when completing their 2020 income tax return. As already advised, where a liability still exists after all additional tax credits are offset, the amount due can be collected, interest free, over four years from 1 January 2022, by reducing tax credits. For example, an underpayment of &euro;200 will be collected over the four years at a rate of &euro;1 per week.  </p><p>Finally, I am aware that Revenue will facilitate the payment of TWSS related tax liabilities by employers who wish to do so on behalf of their employees. This includes the non-application of Benefit in Kind rules to payments made before the end of September 2021.</p></reply>

Government has deployed significant resources to limit the economic, health and societal fall-out from the necessary public health restrictions, and this was possible because of fiscal surpluses recorded in years preceding the pandemic.</p><p>Our successful vaccination programme has allowed for a gradual re-opening of the economy since the spring, and this has given rise to rapid economic recovery.  The improving economy has, in turn, been an important tail-wind for the public finances.  The most recent Exchequer returns showed a deficit of &euro;6.7 billion was recorded at-August; this represents a &euro;2.8 billion improvement on the same period last year.  That said, although on a 12-month rolling basis, the deficit stands at &euro;9.5 billion, so we cannot be complacent.</p><p>The year-on-year improvement in the deficit is primarily down to an over-performance in tax revenue, with income tax, corporation tax and VAT performing strongly. A general government deficit of around &euro;20 billion (just over 5 per cent of GDP, 9.4 per cent of GNI*), was projected in the <i>Summer Economic Statement</i>. Given the over-performance on the revenue side, it is likely that the outturn will be lower than this. A revised deficit forecast will be published as part of <i>Budget 2022</i>. </p><p>Budgetary policy must adapt to the changing public health situation.  With mass immunisation and most sectors now re-opened, we must tailor our fiscal strategy accordingly.  Our public debt stands at nearly a quarter of a trillion euros and, while we can absorb this, we can only do so if we slow, and eventually stop, the pace at which we add to it. </p><p>Accordingly, our strategy for <i>Budget 2022</i>will be to begin reducing the gap between expenditure and revenue while continuing to invest in public services. On current estimates, by 2023 we will only borrow for capital investment.</p></reply>

This will provide an additional funding channel for AHBs who will have a large role to play in the recently announced Housing for All Action Plan. </p>  <p>  Following a review of the investment framework for credit unions in 2017, the Central Bank introduced amending investment regulations for credit unions. Since 1 March 2018, credit unions have been permitted to invest in regulated investment vehicles where the underlying investments are investments in Tier 3 Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for the provision of social housing. The regulations require that investments by credit unions in Tier 3 AHBs must be made through a regulated investment vehicle. The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of a credit union's regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of a credit unions regulatory reserves for all other credit unions. These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in Tier 3 AHBs of &euro;911 million.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is the department with primary responsibility for the formulation and implementation of policy, and for the preparation of legislation, in relation to housing.</p></reply>

It contains 16 new measures to build on the resilience shown by the IFS sector throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p><i>Ireland for Finance</i>utilises a whole-of-government approach which is supported through ongoing collaboration between public and private stakeholders.</p><p>Progress on implementing the action measures is reported to my colleague, Sean Fleming TD the Minister of State for Financial Services, Credit Unions and Insurance, on a quarterly basis and considered at the quarterly meetings of both the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>High Level Implementation Committee and the <i>Ireland for Finance</i>Joint Committee. </p><p><b>Digital Finance</b></p><p>The new Fintech Steering Group in the Department of Finance has been established and work is underway. The group is making an active and significant contribution to the development of EU policies and proposed laws (as set out in the EU Digital Finance Package) to foster innovation in fintech while protecting consumers against risks.  It is also coordinating policies on fintech across the Department and various sub-sectors of financial services in addition to engaging with other State bodies, industry stakeholders and interested firms as issues arise. </p><p>This group is complemented by an industry Fintech Foresight Group which is considering separate work-streams in relation to Digital Assets, Sandboxes, Open Banking, and ESG (Environment, Social, Governance). The Fintech Foresight Group has met with the Grand Canal Innovation District (GCID) team a number of times this year to discuss opportunities for collaboration.  </p><p>Insurance Ireland have developed a comprehensive InsurTech Strategy and have set up the InsTech.ie hub to bring this strategy forward. A launch event for these initiatives was held on 21 July 2021 and the founding members are putting a business plan in place to roll the hub out further.</p><p>Technology ICT Skillnet have developed the MSc. In FinTech Innovation in partnership with Munster Technological University Kerry and Letterkenny Institute of Technology. 24 participants have completed the first year of the course which commenced in 2020 and the next intake of the programme is due to start in Q4 2021. </p><p>Aviation Skillnet has developed the &lsquo;Certificate in Data Analytics&rsquo; as part of its Aviation Finance Leaders programme with UCD Professional Academy and this is due to commence on 30 September 2021. </p><p><b>Diversity</b></p><p>Financial Services Ireland (FSI) and the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI) in association with an Industry Review Group (60 firms and organisations) and a Stakeholder Advisory group (diversity best-practice professionals in the industry) have developed Ireland&rsquo;s Women in Finance Charter, a guide to accompany the Charter and an industry reporting template. FSI/BPFI have completed phase one of this objective. Work is ongoing in relation to governance and reporting and the launch date for Ireland&rsquo;s Women in Finance Charter is now likely to be by year-end. </p><p>The 100 Women in Finance NextGen Dublin Committee continue to host quarterly education and peer events. Events held so far in 2021 include &ldquo;The Art of Resilience: An Essential Skill for Lockdown and Beyond&rdquo;, &ldquo;Technology Disruption and the Next Generation of Finance Leaders&rdquo;, and &ldquo;An Introduction to Private Equity in an Irish Context&rdquo;. An event focussed on ESG will be held as part of Climate Finance Week 2021 in October. </p><p>The 30% Club Ireland Financial Services Group are promoting financial services careers as part of their &ldquo;Career Less Ordinary&rdquo; campaign to increase gender diversity in the sector. The &lsquo;Career Less Ordinary&rsquo; campaign includes a promotional video, together with a collection of job profiles that describe a range of roles that go beyond those typically associated with the industry. These feature case studies of those who progressed their careers in the sector and look at the educational choices that helped get them there. A formal launch with Minister of State Fleming was held in September and the initiative will be promoted through Careers Portal and social media.</p><p><b>Regionalisation</b></p><p>Promoting investment into regional locations is one of the five core pillars of IDA&rsquo;s new strategy, Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth, which was launched in 2021. So far, IDA Ireland has had significant success in attracting investment into the regional locations, with over 48% of IDA&rsquo;s job approvals located in the regions in the year-to-date. </p><p>Significant announcements in the regions in IDA&rsquo;s portfolio include investor services group IQ-EQ creating 45 jobs in Shannon, alternative investment manager Alter Domus creating 100 jobs in Cork, and State Street&rsquo;s decision to create 400 new jobs as part their new specialist team providing technology infrastructure and cybersecurity services from Kilkenny.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional office network (including through the regional enterprise groups) is engaged with stakeholders such as business innovation centres, accelerators and innovation hubs in regional locations as well as with regionally based groups focussed on financial services such as the Cork Financial Services Forum. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland have launched a &ldquo;Start in Ireland&rdquo; portal aimed at supporting entrepreneurs (including fintech firms) at different stages of development with information for potential, new and existing start-ups. Regionally based start-ups have the option to limit search results to immediate geographical locations by county or region to find out information on events, programmes, co-working spaces, accelerators or incubators, competitions, and funding opportunities.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s NDRC (National Digital Research Centre) Accelerator is now centred in Dogpatch Labs in Dublin but critically the accelerator is also spread over three regional locations at Galway&rsquo;s Portershed, Cork City&rsquo;s Republic Of Work and Killorglin&rsquo;s RDI Hub Kerry.</p><p><b>Sustainable Finance</b></p><p>The Department of Finance has worked with the European Commission and the other EU Member States on agreeing science-based standards for climate change adaptation and mitigation under the Taxonomy for sustainable activities. The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation has been implemented in Irish law. My officials have started negotiations on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal for a European Green Bond standard &ndash; a label that corporates and sovereigns could voluntarily use to demonstrate the credentials of their products. Finally, my officials have engaged in the development of the European Commission&rsquo;s renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy, and also facilitated consultation on this new Strategy.</p><p>The Institute of Banking has developed a portfolio of training programmes in sustainable finance. The Institute of Banking advises that it is planning to publish details on a portfolio of sustainable finance programmes for the financial services sector after the National Sustainable Finance Roadmap has been published, which is expected later this year.

The topic will be covered during the series of events for Climate Finance Week Ireland, which will run from 11 to 15 October. </p><p><b>Progress in other areas</b></p><p>Due to the prioritisation of the Remote Work Strategy and its implementation, the commencement of the study by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) to assess the potential additional skills demands in international financial services has been delayed. The scope will be finalised in the coming weeks and consultants will be contracted to undertake the report commencing in Q4 2021 with an expected completion date of Q2 2022.</p><p>IFS Skillnet has developed its Leadership in a Regulated World course with 39 participants completing the in-company version of the programme to date. This programme will be made available again in 2022.</p><p>The CFA Society Ireland continue to promote uptake of their &lsquo;Certificate in ESG Investing&rsquo; course which has seen 230 candidates register for or complete the certificate so far this year.</p><p>In Q1, the Central Bank published a Consultation Paper entitled: &ldquo;Enhancing our Engagement with Stakeholders&rdquo; which set out four key proposals.

It is important to note that there are several critical issues to be resolved, including in respect to the proposed minimum effective tax rate.</p><p>I have been clear that I am broadly supportive of the agreement but I have a reservation, in particular, in respect to a commitment in the July interim agreement to a rate of &lsquo;at least 15%&rsquo; for a global minimum effective tax rate.  The process must bring about certainty and there are too many unknowns currently.</p><p>It is also the case that while Ireland is among a number of countries who have reservations on key issues such as the rate, others have expressed reservations on critical issues such as;</p><p>- the proportion of the reallocation of profits under Pillar One, </p><p>- on how any agreement will be consistently implemented, </p><p>- on the roll-back of unilateral measures such as digital services taxes,</p><p>- and, importantly also on the very ambitious implementation timeframes. </p><p>I have consistently said that we want to be part of the agreement at OECD. However, any agreement must bring certainty and stability, and currently there is a lack of clarity on what is in the agreement.</p><p>Given the economic importance of the OECD proposals to Ireland, I held a public consultation on the proposals, which ran until 10th September with submissions received from a broad range of interested stakeholders.  These submissions are under consideration by my Department.</p><p>Discussions are continuing at the OECD with the objective of finalising key aspects of the agreement in October and we are fully committed to that process.  The next key date in this process is expected to be the 8th of October when the OECD's Inclusive Framework will next meet. </p><p>I remain optimistic that an agreement can be reached which meets the needs of all countries and I can assure you that Ireland will continue to constructively engage in the further discussions and technical work.  </p></reply>

In this regard, the publication of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Final Report and Public Consultation on Differential Pricing in the Motor and Home Insurance Market in July this year &ndash; two months ahead of schedule &ndash; was a major development in this area and marks the completion of a further deliverable of the Action Plan.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will recall that the Central Bank&rsquo;s Interim Report on this matter in December last year showed that consumers who do not shop around and switch regularly can be subject to a &lsquo;loyalty penalty&rsquo;.  However, the report also indicated that differential pricing can also benefit new customers or those that engage with their provider, or switch provider regularly. The Government has consistently said that it is important that we also protect the ability of consumers to get a good deal.  </p>  <p>  The Bank&rsquo;s Final Report this summer showed that the majority of motor and home insurance firms apply some form of differential pricing and that some of the pricing practices identified could result in unfair outcomes for some consumers. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the Central Bank is proposing to use its own powers to ban a practice known as &lsquo;price walking&rsquo; in the motor and home insurance markets for personal customers. &lsquo;Price walking&rsquo; is where customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs they incur the longer they remain with an insurance provider.  In addition to a price walking ban, the Central Bank is also proposing to require insurers to review their pricing policies annually and introduce new consumer consent and disclosure requirements around automatic renewals of all personal non-life insurance products.  The Central Bank currently intends on having the new rules in relation to price walking in place on 1 July 2022 and I would strongly encourage all stakeholders to respond to the Central Bank&rsquo;s public consultation on this matter, which runs until 22 October.  </p>  <p>  Finally, I think it is important to note that these proposals are evidence-based and tailored to the specific circumstances in the Irish market.  The Government supports them and stands ready to assist the Central Bank in any way it can to enable it to implement its proposals, if required.  </p></reply>

Services consisting of the care of the human body, including beauticians, are subject to the 13.5% rate.  </p>  <p>  This arises from the fact that many of goods and services to which Ireland applies a reduced rate of VAT, including services related to care of the human body, have their basis under an EU derogation that provides that as Ireland applied a reduced rate to these items on 1 January 1991, we are entitled to continue applying that reduced rate to those items.  However, this is conditional on the rate being no less than 12%. These are known as &lsquo;parked&rsquo; rates, and are provided for under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive.  As the services provided by beauticians are part of these parked rates, it is not possible for Ireland to apply the rate of 9% to them.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-21a.179.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092100066#WRF00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 76 together.</p>  <p>  Ireland operates a managed employment permits system maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market.  The employment permits regime is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages in the State, required to develop and support enterprise for the benefit of our economy.  However, this objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work and that the shortage is a genuine one.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit and these lists are subject to twice-yearly evidenced based review. </p>  <p>  Since March 2020, my Department has implemented Covid-19 contingency arrangements moving employment permit operations seamlessly to a totally remote working environment.  Feedback received from enterprise across the board has been universally positive.  In fact, Ireland was one of the few countries that has managed to keep their employment permit system fully operational throughout the crisis. </p>  <p>  From the outset of the crisis, in order to assist the HSE and all other medical providers in the State to respond to, and to assist with, the public health response to the threat of Covid-19, all medical employment permits are expedited with immediate effect. </p>  <p>  My Department has seen a significant increase in applications for employment permits this year.  To the end of August, some 14,624 applications were received, representing a 35% increase over the same period in 2020 (10,772) and a 19% increase on 2019 (12,276).  Some 9,526 employment permits were issued over this period.  </p>  <p>  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also because of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other nonstandard methods.  This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications. </p>  <p>  It is important to point out that when set against other international employment permit regimes, Ireland continues to compare extremely favourably, even at current processing times.  </p>  <p>  However, my Department is very conscious of the recent lengthening of timeframes for processing Employment Permit applications and is taking a range of measures to reduce the current backlog as quickly as possible.  It advises employers to take current timelines into account as part of their recruitment plans.</p>  <p>  My Department updates the employment permit processing timelines on its website on a weekly basis and regularly issues updates on relevant employment permit matters to Trusted Partners such as the recent update on employment permit processing timelines. </p>  <p>  Regarding Ireland's attractiveness for foreign direct Investment, Ireland continues to remain a highly attractive destination for companies seeking to invest, with 142 investments won up to the end of Q2 2021.  These investments provide employment potential of over 12,500 jobs.  It is also encouraging to see that during the first half of 2021 investment continued with 62 new name investments.  All this reflects foreign direct investment employment creation plans approaching the record levels of 2019. </p></reply>

The vast bulk of dealings by the Department with the general public are conducted by phone, email or via dedicated online portals specific to the services being sought. </p>  <p>  In relation to the Offices of my Department, the primary &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; onsite interaction with the public as we continue to transition back safely to our buildings is predominately undertaken by the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) mainly at Lansdowne House, Dublin 4. This is a state-owned property overseen by the OPW. Much of this work throughout the pandemic was conducted in a virtual setting but we are now seeing a safe and phased return to in-person onsite meetings. Such interactions typically involve discussions involving the Labour Court and WRC with employers, unions and individual workers on a wide range of industrial relations and employment rights issues. </p>  <p>  The WRC also has regional locations in Carlow, Cork, Ennis and Sligo and again, given the nature of the work involved, do engage in in-person interactions across the regions.</p>  <p>  Other Offices, such as the Companies Registrations Office (CRO) and the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland have moved more and more of their operations online over recent years as part of the public sector reform process. </p>  <p>  The CRO Public Office closed in March 2020 in the initial phase of COVID-19 restrictions and has not reopened. Since the closure of the Public Office the CRO moved to a new IT system where close to 90% of submissions to the CRO are now online. The vast majority of the remaining submissions are received by post. Searches can be done online and there is no need for anyone to attend the Public Office to request information. The CRO is currently reviewing the position in relation to the Public Office and a decision will be made shortly.</p>  <p>  Similarly the Public Office of the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland (IPOI) has also been closed to the public since March 2020.  The IPOI is currently reviewing when the Public Office will re-open.  Most of the work of the Office can be conducted online, such as the e-filing of applications, fee payments and so on, and members of the public can still contact the IPOI  by either telephone or email, as they have been able to  since March of last year.  </p>  <p>  Such is the nature of the work of Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement that is does not have a public office. </p>  <p>  The agencies under the direct remit of my Department include the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, Enterprise Ireland, the Health and Safety Authority, IDA Ireland, the Irish Accounting and Auditing Supervisory Authority, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Such is the nature of the enterprise agencies work is that they deal with their respective clients across a range of locations, nationally and internationally, and do not operate public offices for access by the general public.</p></reply>

Mr Mulcahy had the Department&rsquo;s handling of these matters considered by the Office of the Ombudsman and by the Information Commissioner and neither body found the Department at fault in any aspect.  Mr Mulcahy also raised matters with both the European Commission and the EU Ombudsman, neither of whom criticised the Department&rsquo;s engagement on these matters.  </p>  <p>  In all these circumstances my department has maintained that it has been fully open and transparent with Mr Mulcahy on issues, which ultimately relate back to a decision by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association to conclude his employment in 1998 - a decision in which the Department played no part.</p>  <p>  The Department has over many years devoted a considerable amount of time and resources to this issue. It has afforded every facility and courtesy to Mr Mulcahy in these matters and is strongly of the view that it has acted with probity with no adverse findings from consideration of these matters by the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner.</p>  <p>  Given the passage of time and the efforts made by the Department, I advised Mr Mulcahy that it is no longer tenable we continue to engage with him in any further correspondence.  This message was conveyed to Mr Mulcahy by my predecessor Mary Mitchell O&rsquo;Connor and the Secretary General of my Department in 2016 and 2017. I have informed Mr Mulcahy that this matter is closed in my correspondence to him.</p>  <p>  I fully appreciate and respect Mr Mulcahy&rsquo;s desire to vindicate his good name. However, it is my view that this would be best done through engagement with his former employer, ISME.</p></reply>

I am informed that the company in question had an annual return date of 1<sup>st</sup>August 2020 and had an extended deadline of up to 2<sup>nd</sup>November 2020 to submit the Form B1 and a further 28 days from the filing of that form to submit the remaining elements of the annual return. </p><p>Under the Companies Act 2014, the Registrar does not have any discretion in relation to the waiving of late filing penalties, where annual returns are deemed to be late.

The Tourism and Hospitality Careers Oversight Group, under the auspices of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, was established in 2019 to coordinate relevant bodies to agree and implement a work programme addressing labour supply and skills requirements in the tourism and hospitality sector.</p><p>The State operates a managed employment permits system maximising the benefits of economic migration and minimising the risk of disrupting Ireland&rsquo;s labour market. The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.</p><p>The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.</p><p>Since 2019 all grades of Chef are eligible for the General Employment Permit which is the primary vehicle used by the State to attract third country nationals in occupations where it can be demonstrated that the employer was unable to fill the position from the Irish and EEA labour market.  The minimum remuneration to be met to be eligible for a permit as a Chef is &euro;30,000 with the requisite that the prospective employee have a number of years&rsquo; experience in the role, depending on the Chef grade applied for.</p><p>The Critical Skills Employment Permit targets those who have the skills identified as being in critical short supply, in order to drive our economic future. The prospective employee concerned must have secured a 2-year job offer in respect of the eligible occupation from the prospective employer.</p><p>The qualification criteria for this permit type are as follows:</p><p>- <font color="#222222">Occupations with a minimum annual remuneration of &euro;32,000 for occupations on the the </font>Critical Skills Occupations List<font color="#222222">. A relevant degree qualification or higher is requirement.</font></p><p><font color="#222222">- In the case of a nurse or midwife, a third level degree or diploma accepted by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland as a sufficient qualification for registration to practice as a nurse or midwife in the State.</font></p><p><font color="#222222">- All occupations with a minimum annual remuneration of over &euro;64,000, other than those on the Ineligible List of Occupations for Employment Permits. In this circumstance, a non-EEA national who does not have a degree qualification or higher, must have the necessary level of experience.</font></p><p><font color="#222222">In order to maintain the relevance of the occupation lists to the needs of the economy and to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, the lists undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by the Department and of the relevant policy Departments including the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media.</font></p><p>A review is currently under way with submissions received, including submissions from the Hospitality sector, under consideration. It is expected that the review will be finalised in the Autumn.</p></reply>

A summary report of the submissions received has been published on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  While the primary aim of a microgeneration scheme is to enable a household to meet its own electricity needs, it is intended that a suitable tariff for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all renewables self-consumers later this year, subject to regulatory arrangements, in line with the transposition of Articles 21 and 22 of the recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED II).</p>  <p>  It is expected the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) will publish a draft framework in the coming weeks outlining the details, including eligibility criteria and timescales for introduction, of the Clean Export Guarantee tariff for exported renewable electricity. This framework will introduce an obligation on electricity suppliers to offer remuneration to their customers, by way of a Clean Export Guarantee payment, for excess renewable electricity exported to the grid by eligible micro- and small-scale generators. The CRU consultation will last four weeks, with a decision expected to be published in November.</p>  <p>  The legal basis for the enabling framework is dependent on the transposition of the relevant articles of RED II and Directive (EU) 2019/944 on common rules for the internal market for electricity (IMED), which establish the renewables self-consumer model of electricity generation. My Department is engaging with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on transposing these Articles into Irish law. It is envisaged that this will be achieved before year end.</p>  <p>  Further to the public consultation mentioned above, my Department is developing a final scheme design for the MSS that incorporates the feedback from the consultation and subsequent additional analysis. It is envisaged that a proposal on the supports to be offered to citizens, farms, schools and businesses under the MSS, which may include grants or premium tariff payments for new installations, will be submitted to Government later this year.</p></reply>

Since 2000, over 450,000 homeowners have upgraded their homes with support from these schemes, representing nearly one home in four across the country.  This has resulted in warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that are easier to heat and light.</p>  <p>Building Regulations have been progressively amended and strengthened over the years and new buildings must now meet very high energy performance standards.  Homes constructed since 2006 are generally more energy efficient than those built prior to that period due to energy performance requirements of the 2003 Building Regulations.  For that reason, grants are not available for insulation or heating controls for homes built and occupied after 2006.  However, grant funding for renewable energy measures (heat pumps, solar thermal and solar PV) are available for homes built before 2011.  Full details of all schemes operated by the SEAI and the application processes are available at www.seai.ie, info@seai.ie or Tel. 01-808 2004.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the grants available through SEAI aim to maximise emissions reductions and deliver energy savings for the widest range of homeowners possible.  The grants which are available, and their respective eligibility criteria, were chosen as the most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners and the best value for money for the Exchequer. </p></reply>

BLUE areas are not included in the State intervention area covered by the National Broadband Plan as commercial operators are already providing high speed broadband or have indicated future plans to do so. My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.  Complaints about service provision are a matter to be dealt with between the consumer and the service provider in the first instance. If this avenue has been exhausted without a satisfactory resolution, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) may be able to assist further. ComReg is the independent body that issues licences to broadband service providers and investigates complaints to make sure that companies are delivering services in line with their licence obligations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my Department has investigated the matter and from our records we have established that the premises should be served with high speed broadband and should be able to place an order for Fibre To The Home (FTTH) through a commercial operator. </p></reply>

The Commission is expected to proposed legislation to ensure that product information about durability, reparability and green claims is trustworthy and  is working towards establishing a new &lsquo;Right to Repair&rsquo;. Ireland will support and promote this ambition, and believes that a wide-ranging 'Right to Repair' can most efficiently be introduced at EU rather than national level.</p>  <p>  Some progress has already been made. Regulations under the Ecodesign Directive have been enacted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Those regulations require that refrigerators, washing machines, dishwashers and televisions are longer lasting and more reparable, and professional repairers can access spare parts for a minimum of 10 years.</p>  <p>  The Circular Economy Bill, which will be published in the coming months, will provide the necessary legislative basis for several key measures of national waste policy, including the Circular Economy Strategy, the EPA&rsquo;s new Circular Economy Programme, and the inclusion of targets for reuse and repair in the National Waste Management Plan.</p></reply>

To meet these ambitious targets, we must reduce the level of carbon emissions across every sector in our economy, including the residential sector. The Programme for Government and the Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a Building Energy Rating of B2/cost optimal and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings over the next 10 years.    The value of sustainable building practices is recognised in the new EU policy framework known as the European Green Deal and the Renovation Wave &ndash; which focus on the multiple benefits arising from the energy efficient upgrade of homes and buildings more generally.   Ireland welcomes and supports these initiatives.</p>  <p>  The European Commission has also initiated discussion on an implementation plan for a future environmental life cycle assessment framework for construction products, looking at the impacts on the wider environment that occur during the whole life cycle of a construction product. The objective is to identify the strategic issues that need to be addressed with a view to the implementation of the current and the future revision to the Construction Products Regulation. Ireland will be obliged to follow this procedure via harmonised technical specifications for construction products, when a consensus of approach emerges.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is the lead Department on the Construction Products Regulation.</p>  <p>  My Department has not conducted any research into the embedded carbon in retrofit construction materials. However, the SEAI will examine life cycle analysis and embedded energy in buildings to compare the use of sustainable materials.</p>  <p>  A new National Retrofit Plan will be published in quarter 4 of this year. The plan is designed to address barriers to energy efficiency investments in four key areas: customer proposition and demand generation, financing and affordability, supplier capacity, and governance.</p></reply>

It is designed to promote energy security through the operation of more open and competitive energy markets, while respecting the principles of sustainable development and sovereignty over energy resources. The Treaty provides for dispute resolution procedures both between states and between states and investors in said states. Negotiations to modernise the Treaty are currently underway, led by the European Commission, primarily to align with Paris Agreement objectives and reforming the protections provided by the Treaty to carbon-intensive energy infrastructure. The ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union referenced by the Deputy has since determined that the arbitration system under the ECT cannot be used to claim compensation in intra-EU disputes. While there have been further calls from several Member States since the ruling for a co-ordinated withdrawal from the Treaty, it should be noted that there exists a 20-year sunset clause under which Treaty terms would continue to apply. A co-ordinated withdrawal would therefore need to manage this risk.    </p>  <p>  Ireland's position remains to support the Commission's effort to negotiate meaningful reform of the Treaty in the first instance, while reserving the option to support a co-ordinated withdrawal should these efforts fail and if considered appropriate by Government to achieve our national renewable energy and climate ambitions. </p></reply>

Such licences are also entirely permissive in nature, confer no fishing rights on the licensee, are not the property of the holder nor can they be held on a permanent basis.In the circumstances, transferring or offering such an annual licence for sale is not appropriate.  </p><p>In 2007, the Government established a &euro;25m hardship scheme open to all holders of a commercial salmon licence.  In relation to such schemes, as no fishing or property rights are conferred on the holder of an annual licence, the issue of &ldquo;buyout&rdquo; or compensation does not arise.  The majority of active fisherpersons availed of payment under the measure and the scheme closed in 2008 with all funds expended.</p><p>There are no plans to introduce a similar scheme.</p><p>For the information of the  Deputy, I have asked my Department to set out a Roadmap towards a revised policy for the Inland Fisheries sector which will be subject to consultation.  While I cannot pre-empt the policy review or consultation, I intend the review will be comprehensive and focused on conservation imperatives.  Measures for salmon conservation will be included among a wide range of issues and there will be an opportunity for stakeholders to contribute to the consultation and to potential policy initiatives.</p></reply>

The development of the national retrofit plan to achieve these targets is well underway.     Some &euro;221.5 million in capital funding has been provided this year for SEAI residential and community retrofit programmes, including the Solar PV scheme and the Building Energy Rating programme.  This represents an 82% increase on the 2020 allocation and is the largest amount ever for the schemes.  </p>  <p>  Of this amount, &euro;109 million is allocated to provide free upgrades for lower income households with the balance of &euro;112.5 million to be spent on expanding existing SEAI residential and community grant schemes and introducing new initiatives.</p>  <p>  Of the overall capital allocation for 2021, &euro;48.9 million has been spent as of 16 September. It is important to note that extensive COVID-19 related restrictions on construction activity between January and mid-April had a significant impact on activity this year.  Output has also been negatively impacted by challenges associated with availability and longer lead times for materials.   Every effort is being made to maximise output now that construction activity in the residential sector has recommenced.</p></reply>

An additional 40 temporary driver testers have been authorised along with 36 approved for retention or rehire in 2020. These testers have been recruited and trained and commenced testing in July.</p>  <p>  In addition, sanction was granted at the end of June to add a further 40 testers to the cohort. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority have pointed out that many driver testers who can carry out a CPC practical driving test would be designated as trainers and spare testers. Therefore, where there is any training of new recruits, this pulls from the available resources for HGV tests. </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority is looking to increase the number of tests from 6 to 7 per tester per day from the end of September as well as extending operating hours and expanding facilities at existing centres or opening new centres where appropriate.</p>  <p>  Assuming a successful return to 7 tests per tester per day, the capacity of the system will be 4,881 tests per week.  The RSA measure test slots as car test slots and will be assigning 7 car test slots a day to a total of 4,881 in the near future.  However, truck tests take longer, so while there will be an equivalent of 4,881 car tests available, this does not mean that 4,881 actual tests will happen.  There will be some truck tests plus some car and motorbike tests but the total being done will be under 4,881 due to the longer time required for truck tests. </p>  <p>  There is a slower take up of invitations from customers seeking a test in this category. Many applicants on the waiting list have already received an invite and chosen not to use it. Further research carried out by the RSA, at the request of my department, showed that the by far the most common reason cited by customers for not taking up their test invitation (47%) was that they were &lsquo;not ready&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  Every possible measure is being put in place to ensure that the maximum number of customers can be served while complying with public health guidance.  </p>  <p>  There is now real progress to be seen in the increase in capacity in the service.  However, we have also to be aware that as services reopen there will be an increase in applications, so we cannot expect backlogs to disappear quickly.</p></reply>

Increasing the uptake of electric vehicles in the SPSV sector also has a strong leadership and demonstration effect on the public, introducing more people to low/zero emission mobility options. </p>  <p>  &euro;15m was committed this year towards the extension of the Electric Small Public Service Vehicle Grant Scheme to include the introduction of a fund towards the scrappage of older vehicles in 2021 which reflects the Government's commitment to supporting SPSV drivers this year. I am delighted to say that approximately 1,200 applications have been received by the NTA and the funds have been fully committed to assisting this important industry transition. To date, over &euro;5m has been paid to SPSV drivers in 2021.  </p>  <p>  To promote the decarbonisation of the  heavy-duty sector, including buses and coaches, my Department launched a new Alternatively-Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle Purchase Grant Scheme in March this year. The Scheme, which is administered by TII, is intended to help bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles and those powered by alternatively-fuelled power-trains. &euro;2m was allocated to this scheme when it launched and given the excellent response to the initiative, my Department allocated an additional &euro;1m in funds to assist the heavy-duty vehicle sector in its transition to zero-mobility. This funding has now been fully committed and the first payment has been drawn down. </p>  <p>   The grant schemes are kept under continuous review to ensure that they are as effective as possible in driving the decarbonisation effort while also being mindful of budget capacity.</p>  <p>  The increase of the grants to incentivise the purchase of PSVs will be a matter for Government to consider as part of the Budget preparations. </p></reply>

There, I met with Croatia&rsquo;s Prime Minister, Andrej Plenkovic, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, Zdravko Maric, to discuss the economic recovery from Covid and Croatia&rsquo;s preparations for joining the euro. While there, I also gave a joint press conference with the Prime Minister and Minister.</p>  <p>  This visit was taken in my capacity as President of the Eurogroup. I was travelling to Slovenia for the Eurogroup and informal ECOFIN meetings, and there was an opportunity to engage in an additional bilateral with Croatia, as a neighbouring country. </p>  <p>  Exchanging views with my Eurogroup colleagues and the European institutions is an essential dimension of the Presidency, whether that is done virtually, or face-to-face when possible, such as this visit. </p>  <p>  This was the first visit of my Presidency to a non-euro Area member state and I think it is fitting that it should be to Croatia, which is making good progress in its preparations to join the Euro. The Eurogroup is responsible for the close coordination of economic policies among the Euro area member states. Although Croatia is not a member of Eurogroup, it is a participant in the Exchange Rate Mechanism or &ldquo;ERM II&rdquo;, which is the so-called &ldquo;waiting room&rdquo; for joining the euro. Because of this, Croatia participates in some Eurogroup meetings where ERM II is discussed.</p>  <p>  Before joining ERM II, Croatia had taken certain prior and post-entry policy commitments to facilitate smooth participation in ERM II. These commitments are about paving the way towards euro adoption, once the convergence criteria are met. At our Eurogroup meeting in June of this year, we heard that the implementation of Croatia&rsquo;s post-entry commitments is on track. </p>  <p>  During my meetings in Croatia, I had productive discussions and particularly in relation to Croatia&rsquo;s progress towards accession of our shared euro currency. In fact, in Slovenia the following day, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Croatian authorities and the European Commission, to allow the Croatian authorities to undertake the necessary technical preparations to be ready to produce euro coins.  </p>  <p>  I should clarify that the signing of this Memorandum of Understanding does not pre-empt in any way a final decision on the introduction of the euro.</p>  <p>  The process of euro introduction is set out in EU law. In order to adopt the euro Member States have to achieve a high degree of sustainable economic convergence with respect to the fulfilment of criteria related to price stability, public finances, long-term interest rates and exchange rates. Compatibility of the national legislation, including central bank statutes, with the relevant provisions of the Treaty is also necessary.</p>  <p>  The assessment of convergence is monitored regularly on the basis of the reports by the Commission and the ECB, which are foreseen next year. </p>  <p>  Finally, all necessary health precautions were taken, and I followed public health guidelines during this trip.</p></reply>

These declarations are generally submitted based on the information supplied by the exporting party. However, the importer may also provide information to the postal operator or courier business. Where the postal operator or courier business does not have the necessary information to complete the Customs import declaration then, it may contact the exporter or importer in order to gather the necessary information. The postal operator or courier business may also choose to re-export the goods to the country of origin if they do not have sufficient information to ensure the completion of the import declaration. It is a matter for the relevant postal operator or courier business to determine, based on its business model, how it will deal with instances where the data needed to complete the necessary customs formalities is not available.</p>  <p>   I am aware that Revenue provides information and assistance to all importers, including postal operators and courier businesses, to ensure that they are aware of their obligations in relation to customs. </p></reply>

In most cases, a lender is legally required under section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to make sure that a mortgage applicant has mortgage protection insurance in place before granting a mortgage loan.  This is an important statutory provision which is designed to protect the borrower's dependants and their home should the borrower die before the mortgage has been repaid.  However, the Act also recognises that in certain cases such protection is not necessary or would be inappropriate and it provides for a number of limited exemptions to this statutory obligation such as where the borrower belongs to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to a life insurer, or would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally.  In such circumstances, there is no statutory requirement on a mortgage lender to arrange for mortgage protection insurance.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, it may also be the case that, in circumstances where there is no specific statutory obligation on a mortgage lender to arrange for mortgage protection insurance in association with a housing loan, an individual mortgage lender may, as a matter of its own commercial policy, still require a mortgage borrower to put in place such an insurance policy as a condition for obtaining mortgage credit.  That would be a commercial decision as opposed to a statutory requirement for an individual mortgage lender and it is not possible for me to instruct lenders on their commercial lending policies or their commercial decisions on any individual mortgage application, including the insurance and other security they require either in respect of the borrower or the secured property in relation to a mortgage loan.  While I cannot involve myself in the commercial decisions lenders may make in respect of mortgage applications, earlier this year I wrote to Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) for their views and any information they can provide in relation to this particular issue. BPFI indicated in its reply that on an annual basis around 2% of primary home mortgages were provided without the requirement for mortgage protection insurance (utilising one of the exemptions as provided for in section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act) and that on an annual basis only 0.05% of mortgage applications were refused due to the fact that the applicant did not put in place an acceptable policy of mortgage insurance.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that if a person is not satisfied with the way a regulated mortgage provider has dealt with them in relation to an application for a mortgage, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank&rsquo;s codes and regulations or other financial services law, including the requirement for the regulated entity to act with due skill, care and diligence in the best interest of its customers, the consumer can also complain directly to the regulated entity and, if they are not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman. </p></reply>

The purpose of this scheme is to encourage employers to develop childcare facilities and fitness centres onsite for their employees.</p>  <p>  The scheme provides that an accelerated wear and tear allowance of 100% of the capital expenditure incurred on equipment for childcare services and fitness centre facilities can be claimed for the year in which the equipment is first used in the business. An accelerated industrial building annual allowance of 15% over 6 years and 10% in year 7 can be claimed for capital expenditure incurred on the construction of a childcare services or fitness centre facility. The scheme is only available to employers, for facilities to be provided for the benefit of employees. Employers cannot benefit from the scheme if the facilities are open for the general use of the public. </p>  <p>  It was noted in advance of the scheme's commencement through Finance Act 2018 that the eventual cost of the scheme would be determined by the level of uptake by employers, and was therefore difficult to estimate.  My Department estimated that the scheme would potentially have a cost over 8 years of circa &euro;4 million in total. The fitness centre facilities element of this estimate amounted to &euro;2.6 million, with the childcare services element amounting to &euro;1.36 million. Year one of the scheme was estimated to cost &euro;1.86 million, with the fitness centre facilities element of this estimate amounting to &euro;1.37 million and the childcare services amounting to &euro;0.49 million. The high estimated cost for year one relates to the 100% up-front allowance for qualifying equipment, whereas the relief for qualifying buildings is spread over a longer period. </p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that, at this time, data is only available in respect of incorporated businesses for 2019.  In that year, 29 claims have been made by incorporated business under the scheme at a cost of &euro;0.1 million.

The administration of the scheme is under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners and the legislation makes provision for Revenue to publish guidelines on matters to be considered by them in determining whether certain eligibility criteria are met.  Detailed operational guidelines have been published on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  To qualify under the scheme a business must, under specific terms of the Covid restrictions, be required to either prohibit or significantly restrict, customers from accessing their business premises to acquire goods or services, with the result that the business either has to temporarily close or to operate at a significantly reduced level. A business must be able to demonstrate that, because of the Covid restrictions, the turnover of the relevant business activity during the period of restrictions will be no more than 25% of the &ldquo;relevant turnover amount&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The &ldquo;relevant turnover amount&rdquo; is calculated by reference to a business&rsquo;s average weekly turnover for the relevant business activity in a prior period, the identification of which period depends on whether the business is an &ldquo;established business&rdquo; or a &ldquo;new business&rdquo;.  An established business is a business that commenced trading prior to 26 December 2019 and the relevant turnover amount for such a business is based on average weekly turnover in 2019. A new business is a business that commenced between 26 December 2019 and 12 October 2020 and the relevant turnover amount for such a business is based on average weekly turnover in this period. </p>  <p>  In certain limited circumstances, where a business is transferred within the family, after 1 January 2019, such that the transferee is carrying on the same trade in the same business premises with no substantial change to the nature or operation of the business, and the transferee has devoted at least 50 per cent of his or her normal working time to the service of the business, Revenue has advised that they will accept that the person making the claim may use the &ldquo;relevant turnover amount&rdquo; of the business by reference to the turnover for the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019, subject to a number of specific conditions.  </p>  <p>  Details on this treatment, including the conditions that must be met, are set out in Revenue&rsquo;s detailed operational guidelines.  Those guidelines also provide that, where certain conditions are met, on a business reconstruction or amalgamation or on the death of an individual, Revenue will accept that the person making a claim for the CRSS may use the &ldquo;relevant turnover amount&rdquo; of the business by reference to the turnover for the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019.  In each of the circumstances where this treatment applies, Revenue considers it to be reasonable and proportionate, with strict conditions applying to ensure it is only available where there has been no substantial change in the nature or operation of the business and, where appropriate, there is no substantial change in ownership of the business.  </p></reply>

The CCMA sets out the process that entities must follow when a borrower is in or facing difficulties with their mortgage payments and due regard must be given to the fact that each case is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the regulated entity, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his or her mortgage obligations.</p><p>In particular, for 'co-operating' borrowers regulated entities must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements (ARAs) offered by that entity, in order to determine which ARA, if any, is appropriate and sustainable for the borrower&rsquo;s individual circumstances.

The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021, signed into law on 19 July, provides for the extension of EWSS to 31 December 2021, ensuring that the scheme continues to provide ongoing and necessary employment support for eligible businesses as the economy returns to a full re-opening.</p>  <p>  For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%.</p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the configuration of the EWSS in Q4 2021 regarding its various aspects will be addressed shortly.   Also, no formal decisions have been taken by Government in relation to future of the scheme beyond the end of Q4, 2021.</p>  <p>  The Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 provides that for employers to be eligible for the EWSS, they must be able to demonstrate that their business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders for the calendar year 2021 compared to the calendar year 2019 and that this disruption to normal business is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  As regards the concern around a closing date for applications of 15th August, I wish to clarify that no such end-date exists or is provided for in the legislation.  However, I should point out that there is a requirement that immediately at the end of each month, from the introduction of the scheme in August 2020 onwards, each employer availing of the scheme must carry out a self-review of its business circumstances and if it is manifest to the employer that it no longer meets the eligibility test for qualification for the scheme, then the employer must immediately cease claiming wage subsidy payments.</p>  <p>  To assist employers in conducting a monthly review of its continuing eligibility for the scheme, Revenue is providing an EWSS Eligibility Review Form through its Revenue Online Service (ROS). From 21 July 2021, completing and submitting an EWSS Eligibility Review Form to Revenue will be necessary to avail of EWSS supports, with details of an employer&rsquo;s monthly eligibility review check to be submitted by the 15th of the following month. For example, the eligibility review undertaken on the last day of September will need to be completed and submitted to Revenue by 15 October.</p>  <p>  Timely submission of the form will provide assurance to both employers and Revenue that subsequent EWSS claims are appropriate and in line with the terms of the scheme. This, together with Revenue&rsquo;s EWSS ongoing real-time compliance program, will reduce the possibility of employers, inadvertently or incorrectly, claiming EWSS amounts to which they are not entitled and having to subsequently repay those amounts to Revenue. </p>  <p>  Failure to complete and submit the EWSS Eligibility Review Form that confirms the requisite reduction and related declaration will result in suspension of payment of EWSS claims. Where a business who has not completed and submitted the Form within the required timeframe subsequently does so, and is eligible for the scheme, suspended payments will be released and paid.</p>  <p>  Given the scale of resources being disbursed from Exchequer funds under the EWSS, I consider that the eligibility review is the minimum level of due diligence required of employers and Revenue has sought to make the process as user-friendly as possible. </p>  <p>  Finally, employers must have a tax clearance certificate to be eligible to join the EWSS and must continue to meet the requirements for tax clearance for the duration of the scheme.</p></reply>

It provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the numbers of paid and eligible employees on the employer&rsquo;s payroll and charges a reduced rate of employer PRSI of 0.5% on wages paid which are eligible for the subsidy payment. </p>  <p>  While the criteria for eligibility for business in general is based on a reduction in turnover, as a result of the pandemic and having regard to the importance of maintaining the provision of childcare facilities so as to enable parents to continue in, or to take up, positions of employment, the legislation provided that childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS. </p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to support all employment and maintain the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible. The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the continued Covid-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the midst of these very challenging times. To date, payments of over &euro;4.76 billion and PRSI credit of over &euro;750 million have been granted to 51,400 employers in respect of 656,900 workers. </p>  <p>  I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS and, as the Deputy will be aware from announcements made in June, it has been decided that the scheme is now to be extended until the end of December 2021. For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%. </p>  <p>  Decisions in relation to the configuration of the EWSS in Q4 2021 in relation to its various aspects will be addressed shortly.  Also, no decisions have been taken in relation to future of the scheme beyond the end of Q4, 2021. </p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time. </p></reply>

This exemption also applies to childminding, childcare and child protection/ education services. The exemption applies to childcare provided on a non-profit basis and also to childcare regulated by Parts (VII) or (VIII) of the Child Care Act 1991 even where provided on a profit-making basis. Exemption also covers the provision of related goods.</p>  <p>  With regards to the possibility of deducting VAT for the early years sector, Value Added Tax (VAT) is an input tax incurred by an accountable person on purchases made during the course of business. The legislative basis for VAT deductibility is section 59 of the VATCA 2010. Section 59 of the VATCA 2010 sets out conditions required before input VAT may be deducted. To note, section 59 (2) provides that VAT may only be deductible insofar as the goods and services are used for taxable supplies. Only persons making taxable supplies of goods and services or qualifying activities can reclaim VAT charged on goods and services used for the purpose of their taxable trade. </p></reply>

In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant. </p>  <p>  To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled, and satisfy at least one of the medical criteria included in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. </p>  <p>  While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme. With this in mind I asked my officials to undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, and on foot of that review to bring forward proposals for consideration.</p>  <p>  Department officials have been carrying out preliminary work, including an examination of the main issues which will frame the scope of the review. Officials have also been engaging with other Departments in the context of other ongoing work in mobility supports. In particular, the Department has engaged with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in the context of a working group established early last year by the Minister for Justice before the work was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The group, under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, was tasked with a review of transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities, to enhance the options for transport to work or employment supports for people with disabilities and to develop proposals for development of a coordinated plan for such provision.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the review group will be established shortly and will include stakeholders from other Departments, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal and other representative groups.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so. </p><p>Nonetheless, this Government recognises the concerns felt by many groups, including in the childcare sector, regarding the cost and availability of insurance, and has therefore prioritised insurance reform through the <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government recently published the first Implementation Report, which shows that work is progressing well to implement the Plan, with 34 of the 66 actions contained therein now completed. </p><p>One of the key achievements in the first half of this year was the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, which was realised several months ahead of schedule. These will bring more certainty to claimants and insurers, and as such will reinforce the benefits of using PIAB to settle claims. This, in turn, will reduce the costs of claims. </p><p>It is my expectation that insurers will pass on these savings to customers in the shape of reduced premiums across their product lines. Minister for State Fleming has had number of positive engagements with the CEOs of the main insurers operating here on the matter, and they have indicated that they will respond positively to the Guidelines. He will meet with them again later this year to continue to press their commitments in this regard.</p><p>Another significant achievement has been the creation of the <i>Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market</i>within the Department of Finance, which is chaired by Minister of State Fleming. The Office has held meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, representative bodies, civil society groups and state regulators on issues surrounding competition. Its aim is to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department is also working closely with the IDA to encourage new entrants into the insurance market so as to improve its overall competitiveness. Officials from both are developing a customised proposal and are identifying potential providers who offer insurance in identified &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; segments of the Irish market. This includes those coverage areas impacting businesses, consumers and community and voluntary groups. </p><p>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government.  In this regard, it is my intention to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that implementation of the Action Plan can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance across all sectors in the economy including the critical childcare sector.</p></reply>

The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs, to support the geographic spread of the audio-visual sector.</p>  <p>  When originally introduced, the regional uplift was to be phased out on a tiered basis, with 5% available in years 1 and 2 (2019 &amp;amp; 2020), 3% available in year 3 (2021), 2% available in year 4 (2022), and 0% available from year 5 on. However the COVID-19 crisis had a detrimental impact on the audiovisual sector, with the majority of production companies suspending activity for a significant portion of 2020. As a result much of the intended incentive effect of the regional uplift in 2020 was lost.</p>  <p>  Therefore Finance Act 2020 amended the regional uplift to provide for an additional 5% year in 2021, in effect to replace the incentive year lost as a result of the Covid-related public health measures.  The tapered withdrawal of the uplift then restarts, reducing to 3% in 2022, 2% in 2023, and Nil thereafter.</p>  <p>  The regional uplift is an approved State-aid. As approved, the regions which may avail of the uplift are limited to areas in Ireland sanctioned to receive regional aid under the EU Regional Aid Guidelines. This currently excludes Dublin, Cork and the Mid-East generally (i.e. Kildare, Meath and Wicklow).</p>  <p>  Therefore I am unable to commit to amending the regions which may avail of the regional uplift as this is dictated by the EU Regional Aid Guidelines.</p></reply>

Importers of second-hand cars from the UK into Ireland can claim a preferential tariff rate under the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) where they can provide proof that the goods they are importing are of UK preferential origin as required by the Rules of Origin in the Agreement. </p>  <p>  The proofs required by Revenue include a &lsquo;statement on origin&rsquo; from the UK exporter on an invoice or any other document that describes the car in sufficient detail to identify it. Importers requesting the issue of a &lsquo;statement on origin&rsquo; by an exporter must satisfy themselves that the exporter will be able to provide supporting documents if requested by UK customs. Alternatively, a claim for a preferential tariff rate may be made on the basis of supporting documents, or records provided by the exporter or manufacturer which are in the importer&rsquo;s possession. These documents proving the originating status of the car must be available for inspection by Revenue if requested. They must be retained for a period of 3 years from the date of importation. </p>  <p>  Under the TCA rules of origin for a UK originating car that is not a hybrid or electric, the value of non-originating material in the production of a car must not exceed 45% of the ex-works price of a car. Alternative product-specific rules of origin apply for electrified and hybrid vehicles with both internal combustion engine and electric motor as motors for propulsion. For these cars, until 31 December 2023, the value of non-originating material used in the production of the car must not exceed 60% of the ex-works price of the car, and from 1 January 2024 until 31 December 2026, the value of non-originating material used in the production of the car must not exceed 55% of the ex-works price of the car.</p>  <p>  The proofs required for preferential origin in the TCA are the same as the proofs required in other trade agreements that the EU has entered into, and generally come from the exporter, via the car supplier or manufacturer. Where the supplier/manufacturer provides the exporter with the information necessary to determine the originating status of car, the supplier can do so by means of a &lsquo;supplier's declaration&rsquo;. Where the information is not provided by the supplier, the exporter can supply other evidence or supporting documents coming from other sources insofar as they contain the necessary information. Such information can include:</p>  <p>  - a description of the originating and non-originating materials used in the production process</p>  <p>  - the value of the product as well as the value of all the non-originating and/or originating materials used in the production.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the documentation presented at importation in each instance needs to provide clear assurance as to the origin of a second-hand car being imported. This evidence is assessed by Revenue on a case by case basis and it is not possible to provide approval either on the basis of specific manufacturers or vehicle types.</p></reply>

These include the young trained farmer stamp duty relief, consanguinity relief and farm consolidation relief.

It is legislated for in Section 81AA on the Stamp Duties Consolidation Acts 1999 (SDCA 1999), titled &ldquo;Transfers to young trained farmers&rdquo;,</p><p>As with all such reliefs, it is of course subject to a number of terms and conditions. Section 81AA was introduced in Finance Act 2000, has since been extended on a number of occasions, and is currently due to expire on 31 December 2021. </p><p>The primary domestic and EU policy objective of this relief is to encourage the inter-generational transfers of agricultural land, with a secondary purpose being to increase the level and rate of adoption of new more productive and more environmentally friendly farming practices.</p><p>The normal extension of tax reliefs is three years, which, if it were to be extended in the upcoming Budget (and associated Finance Bill) would see this relief next expire on 31 December 2024. There have been some calls from the farming sector for longer extensions, of this and other farming focussed reliefs. </p><p>My position remains that extending such reliefs in three year increments provides an appropriate balance between delivering a degree of medium-term certainty in respect of the availability of a relief for those planning to avail of it, as well as for those operating it, and the need for the relief to be reviewed regularly by my department (with the assistance of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) in order to ensure it remains fit-for-purpose, reflects current government policy, continues to be consistent with EU state aid policy, and other considerations. </p><p>I expect that my decision on the extension of this relief will form part of my speech introducing Budget 2022.<b><i></i></b></p></reply>

Its primary purpose was to widen the tax base and to provide a steady income to the Exchequer to provide funding for public services. It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base.</p>  <p>  The USC is an annual tax payable on an individual&rsquo;s total income in a year, subject to a number of exemptions and reliefs. In particular, an individual is not liable to pay USC where his or her total income in the tax year does not exceed &euro;13,000 and individuals aged 70 and over benefit from a lower rate of USC (provided their total income does not exceed &euro;60,000).</p>  <p>  Pensions, other than pensions paid by the Department of Social Protection, form part of an individual&rsquo;s income for USC purposes in years in which they are paid and are charged to USC.</p>  <p>  In computing the USC payable in a year, contributions to a pension fund are not taken into account to reduce the amount of USC payable as would be the case with income tax. As such, the USC payable by an employee is charged on the person&rsquo;s gross income. The proposal to apply the USC charge after deducting pension contributions would run counter to the principle of keeping USC as broadly based a charge as possible. Its broad base helps ensure that the USC is a stable source of revenue for the State.</p>  <p>  Finally, I might take this opportunity to note that Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems in the world, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution. Our redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI. It is my view that a broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution but according to their means, is the most fair and sustainable income tax system in the long term.</p></reply>

While this relief is commonly referred to as Retirement Relief, it is not necessary to retire from the business or farming in order to qualify. The operation of the relief, as well as the various thresholds available, differ between the disposal of a farm to a child and disposals to anyone other than to a child. </p>  <p>  Relief from CGT is also available where an individual disposes of or exchanges farmland in order to consolidate an existing holding. To qualify for the relief, the first sale or purchase must occur between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2022. The next sale or purchase must occur within 24 months of the first sale or purchase. </p>  <p>  In relation to your query regarding a reduced rate of CGT, there are doubts as to the potential level of additional yield this could raise and its sustainability over time. The current economic environment may increase the uncertainty around any potential Exchequer impact. Furthermore, there is a significant risk of deadweight arising from a reduction in the CGT rate, as many assets would be sold regardless of the rate at a particular time.</p>  <p>  In terms of the cost of changing the headline rate of CGT, each 1% reduction / increase in the headline rate of CGT is estimated to be &euro;33 million, assuming no behavioural change. A 5% reduction in the CGT rate in a single Budget would have an Exchequer impact of &euro;164 million, assuming no behavioural change.</p>  <p>  As with all taxes, CGT is subject to ongoing review, which involves the consideration and assessment of the rate of CGT and the relevant reliefs and exemptions from CGT. I currently have no plans to make a significant reduction in CGT rates at the this time.</p></reply>

Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, lead to a narrowing of the tax base.  Under my Department's Tax Expenditure Guidelines, the introduction of new tax incentive measures, or the continuation of  measures which are due to terminate, should only be considered in circumstances where there is a demonstrable market failure and where a tax based incentive is more efficient than a direct expenditure intervention. </p>  <p>  However, the issues raised in the Deputy's questions are matters that would fall to be considered in the context of the Budget and Finance Bill process, and, as she will appreciate, with three weeks to go to Budget day, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on them at this time.</p></reply>

This scheme provides an exemption from benefit-in-kind (BIK) where an employer purchases a bicycle and associated safety equipment for an employee. </p>  <p>  Under section 118B TCA 1997 an employer and employee may also enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary, in exchange for a bicycle and related safety equipment.</p>  <p>  Where a bicycle or safety equipment is purchased under the &lsquo;Cycle to Work&rsquo; scheme or through a salary sacrifice arrangement certain conditions must be met, for example:</p>  <p>  - The exemption applies to the first &euro;1,250 of expenditure incurred by the employer in obtaining a bicycle and related safety equipment. This exemption limit is increased to &euro;1,500 for pedelecs or ebikes and related safety equipment. Employers may incur costs in excess of these limits, but any such excess will not qualify for the exemption and will be liable to tax. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same monetary limits.</p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be new and must be purchased by the employer. </p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be used by the employee or director mainly for the whole or part of their journey to or from work.</p>  <p>  - An employee or director can only avail of the &lsquo;Cycle to Work&rsquo; scheme once in any 4 year period. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same time limits and any salary sacrifice arrangement entered into must be completed within a 12 month period.</p>  <p>  The &lsquo;Cycle to Work&rsquo; scheme is only applicable where the bicycle and safety equipment is provided by an employer to either a director or someone in its employment. Thus, where an employer-employee relationship does not exist, for example, in the case of retired individuals such individuals can&rsquo;t qualify for the scheme. Likewise, salary sacrifice arrangements may only be entered into between an employer and a director or employee. </p></reply>

Section 469 defines "health expenses" as "expenses in respect of the provision of health care including the services of a practitioner". </p>  <p>  A practitioner is defined in the section as "any person who is:</p>  <p>  - a.registered in the register established under section 43 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, </p>  <p>  - b.registered in the register established under section 26 of the Dentists Act, 1985, or, </p>  <p>  - c.in relation to health care provided outside the State, entitled under the laws of the country in which the care is provided to practice medicine or dentistry there".</p>  <p>  In the case of counselling or psychotherapy, the relief is available where the counsellor, psychologist or psychotherapist carrying out the treatment is a qualified practitioner, or where a patient is referred by a qualified practitioner for a diagnostic procedure.</p>  <p>  This is similar to the position that applies to other medical expenses, and I am satisfied that the legislation provides sufficient flexibility for expenses that should qualify for tax relief.

Under domestic legislation, professional medical care services recognised as such by the Department of Health are exempt from VAT. Professional medical care services recognised by the Department of Health are generally those medical care services supplied by health professionals who are enrolled, registered, regulated, or designated on the appropriate statutory register provided for under the relevant legislation in force in the State or equivalent legislation applicable in other countries.

The annual rate of HICP inflation rose to 3 per cent in August &ndash; the highest rate since 2008. Similar trends have been observed across advanced economies, with inflation rates of 5.3, 3.2 and 3 per cent recorded in the US, UK and euro area in August.  </p>  <p>  However, the increase in inflation since the beginning of this year is largely explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time, including &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the normalisation of oil prices following their collapse last spring. More fundamentally, on the demand side the easing of restrictions led to a rapid rebound in consumer spending, in particular spending on goods, in the second quarter. As the economy continues to re-open, demand will pivot towards contact-intensive service sectors.  </p>  <p>  Supply by contrast has recovered more slowly, with labour shortages in service sectors putting upward pressure on prices. Indeed, signs of &lsquo;opening up&rsquo; inflation are already evident, with strong increases in prices in the transport and hospitality sectors recorded in July and August. Shipping bottlenecks and shortages of inputs (e.g. semi-conductors, timber) have also raised production costs, putting further upward pressure on prices. Higher trade costs as a result of Brexit may also have contributed to the recent rise in inflation.</p>  <p>  The emergence of inflationary pressures has prompted a debate regarding the likely persistence of these price dynamics as consistently higher inflation could trigger monetary policy changes by the ECB, with implications for the cost of Government borrowing. Looking beyond the short-term, however, it seems likely that these temporary factors will fade as demand stabilises and supply pressures ease. Consistent with this view, the ECB recently reiterated that the current inflationary pressures are largely temporary and inflation in the euro area is still expected to remain below 2 per cent over the medium term. Nevertheless, my Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse inflationary developments and will publish updated inflation and economic forecasts alongside the Budget in the autumn.</p></reply>

The outbreak of the pandemic turned the economy on its head in the space of a few weeks however, with the introduction of Covid-19 restrictions resulting in a sharp contraction in economic activity last year. However, in keeping with the pattern seen in other countries, the economy rebounded as restrictions were eased. </p>  <p>  As restrictions were lifted in the second quarter the domestic economy recovered strongly. Modified domestic demand, a proxy for the domestic economy, grew by almost 8&frac12; per cent and surpassed the level immediately preceding the pandemic for the first time since the start of the crisis. This rebound in the economy was supported by consumer spending which increased by 12&frac12; per cent in the second quarter, and the construction sector which grew by 23 per cent as restrictions were eased.</p>  <p>  Although the fundamentals of the domestic economy remain strong there are challenges ahead involving possible international taxation changes and the risk of more persistent inflation. Government is currently planning for an expected impact on receipts from forthcoming changes to the international tax regime, with my Department estimating a loss of &euro;2 billion in corporation tax revenue by 2025. As I have stated on many occasions, this underlines the importance of not building permanent expenditure commitments on volatile windfall revenue. Base broadening policy reforms have made Ireland&rsquo;s tax system far more stable and resilient to external shocks &ndash; despite an unprecedented global pandemic, tax receipts only fell by 3.6 per cent last year.</p>  <p>  Inflation is another potential concern with the annual rate of HICP inflation rate rising to 3 per cent in August &ndash; the highest rate since 2008. However, the recent rise in inflation is largely explained by one-off and temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time. Consistent with this view the ECB recently reiterated that the recent rise in euro area inflation has largely been driven by temporary factors and while inflation will likely remain elevated this year and next, it is expected to remain below 2 per cent over the medium term.</p>  <p>  I am optimistic that the economic recovery will continue as our well educated work force and pro-enterprise culture mean that the long term fundamentals of our economy are strong and will facilitate continued growth. While the effects of Covid-19 have been severe, our resilience and strength comes from being an economy that remains open to investment and facilitates trade across our borders. This has proven to be the fundamental strength of the Irish economy over decades and is still the case today.</p></reply>

Our competitive but fair corporation tax rate is just one small part of the story. This complements our highly educated workforce, making Ireland an attractive EU base for businesses. </p>  <p>  I am aware of a recent publication carried out by a research laboratory which has referred to seventeen jurisdictions, including Ireland, as tax havens used by European banks.  I do not accept the label attributed to Ireland and would question the unique methodology used to arrive at this position.  </p>  <p>  The paper indicates that the identification of countries in the tax haven list relies on two parameters. Firstly, country-specific profit per employee of the banks in question with a focus on jurisdictions with high profit per employee.  Secondly, a country-specific effective tax rate is used, to measure the tax rate applied on profits.  An arbitrary 20% of countries with highest profits per employee is coupled with an arbitrary effective tax rate of lower than 15%.</p>  <p>  Given our headline rate of corporation tax is a low but substantial rate of 12.5% it would appear to make Ireland, or indeed anyone with a rate of 15% or below, the target of such an arbitrary list of tax havens. </p>  <p>  I believe that small countries, and Ireland is one of them, need to be able to use tax policy as a legitimate lever to compensate for advantages of scale, location, resources, industrial heritage and the real, material and persistent advantage enjoyed by larger countries. </p></reply>

Strong growth in the domestic economy was recorded in the second quarter of this year and domestic economic activity surpassed its pre-pandemic level for the first time since the start of the crisis. </p>  <p>  The global economy experienced the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic in a reasonably symmetric way and a strong but uneven recovery is now anticipated. As in Ireland, the improving health situation and continued easing of public health restrictions in the European Union has put EU economies back in motion. In July, the European Commission projected growth of 4.8 per cent for the EU in 2021. This is broadly in line with expectations for the domestic economic recovery. </p>  <p>  The expected rebound in the EU and globally creates a supportive external environment for Ireland&rsquo;s exports in the coming years. The multinational sector in Ireland proved resilient throughout the crisis and is expected to continue performing strongly into the future. The outlook for Irish indigenous exports is also brighter in light of strengthening global demand, although Brexit is expected to have a strong impact on indigenous exports from next year. The Irish modified current account, which strips out the effects of globalisation, is  expected to remain in surplus in the medium term. </p>  <p>  Ireland provides an attractive location for FDI, with our talented and flexible workforce, our hard-won reputation as a pro-enterprise jurisdiction, and our successful record as home for global business. Evidence such as the IDA&rsquo;s FDI results for 2020 suggests that foreign companies continue to value our FDI strengths. </p>  <p>  Despite the positive outlook, risks to the international recovery continue to exist. As a small open economy, Ireland is particularly exposed to these external risks and my Department continues to monitor them closely. </p></reply>

The vaccination programme has been extremely successful allowing the economy to return to some level of normality. That said, there will, of course, be long-term impacts from the pandemic, particularly in terms of employment.</p><p>A number of key issues were outlined in the report. </p><p>Firstly, the Fiscal Council emphasised the need to address structural fiscal challenges. </p><p>The <i>Summer Economic Statement</i>set out a medium-term budgetary strategy which seeks to address this issue. Through the introduction of an expenditure rule, public expenditure will be fixed to the trend growth rate of the economy. Such an approach enhances fiscal sustainability while allowing investment in key government priorities, particularly capital investment. I note, in particular, the Fiscal Council&rsquo;s view that the expenditure plans are at the limit of what is prudent.  I agree with this assessment, and that is why the Government introduced expenditure ceilings that will apply irrespective of revenue performance.</p><p>Secondly, the Council raise the issue of the high level of public debt. I agree that the level of public debt needs to first stabilise, and then fall. At almost a quarter of a trillion euro, it is among the highest in the developed world. That is why the budgetary strategy set out in the <i>Summer Economic Statement</i>seeks to reduce the deficit to 1.5 per cent of GDP by the mid-part of this decade. By reducing the deficit, we will stabilise the debt to income ratio. </p></reply>

This allows for the sustainability of tax revenues to be actively monitored so as to minimise fiscal vulnerabilities. </p>  <p>  The most recent Report, published in August, demonstrates that Ireland&rsquo;s tax system displays some structural characteristics that have made revenues less vulnerable to external shocks. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, tax revenues fell by just &euro;2.1 billion (3.6 per cent) last year. This is due in part to the strength in corporation tax revenues, which increased by nearly &euro;1 billion (8.7 per cent).</p>  <p>  That said, significant vulnerabilities remain including those relating to the concentration of corporation tax receipts among a handful of large payers, a risk which I have highlighted on numerous occasions. Indeed, my Department has published extensive work examining the future trajectory of, and potential vulnerabilities in, corporation tax receipts, including papers on Assessing Fiscal Vulnerabilities  and Modelling Recent Developments in Corporation Tax (2019), as well as the Roadmap on Corporation Tax (updated 2021).</p>  <p>  I have stated many times that given the inherent volatility of such receipts and prospective changes to international tax rules, we cannot rely on the current level of corporation tax revenues over the medium to long-term. As such, it is imperative that we put steps in place to address this dependency. </p>  <p>  In this regard, medium-term fiscal planning will continue be based on the assumption of a decline in corporate tax revenues. Whilst the final outcome of the discussions on international tax reform remains unclear, the budgetary forecasts currently incorporate a &euro;2 billion loss relative to the baseline by 2025.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will play an important role in independently considering how best the taxation and welfare systems can support economic activity and promote increased employment and prosperity, while ensuring that there are sufficient resources available to meet the costs of public services and supports in the long-term. </p></reply>

This is also articulated in the New Decade, New Approach agreement, in which the Government has made a strong commitment to work with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government in support of greater cooperation, connectivity and opportunity North/South on the island, in line with the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  I always welcome the opportunity to engage and cooperate with institutions and individuals across Northern Ireland, including through engagement with the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) established under the Good Friday Agreement. While I was unfortunately unable to attend the most recent plenary meeting of the NSMC which took place in July of this year, I attended the previous plenary in December 2020 which considered the response to COVID-19, the implications of UK withdrawal from the EU and commitments under New Decade, New Approach.  </p>  <p>  In addition to participating in formal mechanisms for cooperation, I have also enjoyed meeting partners and stakeholders in less formal settings. Most recently, I attended the 2021 British Irish Association conference in Oxford on 4 September, which provided the welcome opportunity to engage once again in person with a range of stakeholders from across the island of Ireland and the UK. I took part in two sessions, speaking first about our economic relations East-West and North-South, and subsequently in a session with representatives of the UK Government and the devolved administrations on working together across the UK and Ireland after the pandemic. </p></reply>

The economy has recovered rapidly, with the vaccination programme proving extraordinarily successful. However, there will, of course, be long-term effects from the pandemic, particularly in terms of employment.</p><p>The most recent Exchequer returns showed a deficit of &euro;6.7 billion was recorded to the end of August this year. This represents an improvement on the same period last year, of some &euro;2.8 billion, although on a 12-month rolling basis, the deficit stands at &euro;9.5 billion.</p><p>The year-on-year improvement is primarily down to an increase in tax revenue. Taxes to the end of August are &euro;2 billion over profile, with income tax, corporation tax and VAT performing particularly strongly. On the expenditure side, gross voted expenditure is behind profile by &euro;1.7 billion, although slightly ahead of the same period last year. </p><p>A general government deficit of approximately &euro;20 billion, or just over 5 per cent of GDP, was projected in the <i>Summer Economic Statement</i>. Given the over-performance in tax, it is likely that the actual deficit will be lower than this. A revised deficit forecast will be produced as part of Budget 2022.</p><p>The fiscal picture in the European Union as a whole is also improving, as the worst impacts of the pandemic recede. In relation to economic growth, the EU Commission forecast GDP growth of 4.8% in 2021 and 4.5% in 2022, both in the EU and the Euro Area. A significant driver of the recovery as been the support shown by EU institutions, most notably via Next Generation EU funding mechanisms and the unprecedented support of the European Central Bank.</p></reply>

The annual rate of HICP inflation rose to 3 per cent in August &ndash; the highest rate since 2008. Similar trends have been observed across advanced economies, with inflation rates of 5.3, 3.2 and 3 per cent recorded in the US, UK and euro area in August.  </p>  <p>  However, the increase in inflation since the beginning of this year is largely explained by temporary factors, including &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the normalisation of oil prices following their collapse last spring as well as an imbalance between demand and supply following the re-opening of the economy. This has been compounded by supply chain disruptions, namely the availability of inputs (e.g. semi-conductors) as well as capacity constraints for shipping, and shifts in demand as the pandemic has boosted the demand for some durable goods and reduced the demand for others.</p>  <p>  Looking beyond the short-term, however, it seems likely that these temporary factors will fade as demand stabilises and supply pressures ease. Consistent with this view, the ECB last week reiterated that the current inflationary pressures are largely temporary and inflation in the euro area is still expected to remain below 2 per cent over the medium term.</p>  <p>  Since the onset of the pandemic the Government has engaged in counter-cyclical budgetary policy. An unprecedented amount of resources has been directed at preserving incomes and helping businesses as the State &lsquo;leaned against the wind&rsquo;. As the recovery takes hold, the same approach must be taken. Temporary emergency supports will be unwound and public expenditure ceilings will be fixed at the trend growth rate of the economy to prevent the State adding &lsquo;fuel to the fire&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  More specifically, the Government is very conscious of inflationary pressures in certain areas, particularly in relation to construction. The &ldquo;Housing for All&rdquo; strategy, for example, has a specific focus on tackling supply side constraints. My Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse inflationary developments and will publish updated inflation forecasts alongside the Budget in the autumn.</p></reply>

Similar trends have been observed across advanced economies, with inflation rates of 5.3, 3.2 and 3 per cent recorded in the US, UK and euro area in August. </p>  <p>  The increase in inflation since the beginning of this year is largely explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time.

This has been compounded by supply chain disruptions, namely the availability of inputs (e.g. semi-conductors) as well as capacity constraints for shipping, and shifts in demand as the pandemic has boosted the demand for some durable goods and reduced the demand for others.</p>  <p>  It&rsquo;s possible that higher trade costs as a result of Brexit can in part explain the emergence of inflationary pressures in recent months. Indeed, non-energy industrial goods inflation which consists largely of UK imports, has picked up since January and various business surveys have cited Brexit related customs checks as a key driver of recent price increases. The uptick in the wholesale price index in recent months may in part be explained by Brexit.</p>  <p>  The emergence of inflationary pressures has prompted a debate regarding the likely persistence of these price dynamics as consistently higher inflation could trigger monetary policy changes by the ECB, with implications for the cost of Government borrowing. Looking beyond the short-term, however, it seems likely that these temporary factors will fade as demand stabilises and supply pressures ease. Consistent with this view, the ECB recently reiterated that the current inflationary pressures are largely temporary and inflation in the euro area is still expected to remain below 2 per cent over the medium term. Nevertheless, my Department will continue to closely monitor and analyse inflationary developments and will publish updated inflation and economic forecasts alongside the Budget in the autumn.</p></reply>

It is a matter for individual contracting authorities to ensure that their public procurement activities are discharged in line with procurement rules and procedures.  The OGP supports contracting authorities in this regard by making them aware of their legal and policy obligations in respect to public procurement. </p>  <p>  The information sought by the Deputy in relation to any requirement to hire construction apprentices in public works projects is not collated centrally. However, the Deputy may wish to note that a pilot social clause was included in the three design and build, devolved schools bundles administered by the NDFA on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. In summary, the pilot clause required:</p>  <p>-  At least 10% of those working on the sites to be drawn from the live register, having been unemployed for more than 12 months; and</p>  <p>-   At least 2.5% of workers on the sites to be engaged in an approved registered apprenticeship, training or educational work placement scheme.</p>  <p>  Similar clauses were included in all PPP projects procured by the NDFA since the announcement of the Infrastructure Stimulus Programme in 2012: Schools PPP Bundle 4, Schools PPP Bundle 5, TU Dublin at Grangegorman PPP, Primary Care Centres PPP, Courts Bundle PPP, Social Housing Bundle 1 and Social Housing Bundle 2. All of these projects are complete and in operations with the exception of Social Housing Bundle 2 which is still in construction. </p>  <p>  Similar clauses are included in current PPPs in the Higher Education PPP Programme (being procured by the NDFA on behalf of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research and Innovation) and in the second Devolved (design and build) Schools Programme (being procured by the NDFA on behalf of the Department of Education). Provisions for future contracts will be determined in consultation with the relevant Sanctioning Authority and my Department.</p>  <p>  The inclusion of strategic, green and social policy considerations in procurement processes is a key feature of the Programme for Government.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, developed Circular 20/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement. The Circular highlights the potential for Departments to support wider social and environmental aims through public procurement. </p>  <p>  Further actions taken by the OGP in this area include: the publication of an Information Note on Incorporating Social Considerations into Public Procurement in December 2018; and the establishment of a cross-departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group to bring together officials from policy Departments with procurement practitioners to share best practice and to facilitate the process of incorporating social and environmental considerations into public procurement.</p>  <p>  The Circular additionally draws the attention of Departments to the cross-departmental Social Considerations Advisory Group, which aims to promote and facilitate the incorporation of social considerations, including environmental considerations, into public procurement projects. This group was established by the OGP, and brings together officials from policy departments with public procurement practitioners to share best practice in relevant fields. In line with Programme for Government commitments the objectives of the group were updated, new Terms of Reference were developed in September 2020, and the group has been renamed as the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group (SPAG). </p>  <p>  In accordance with the &lsquo;Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025&rsquo;, members of the Strategic Procurement Advisory Group will consider the potential for measures supporting apprenticeship in procurement by different Departments and Agencies. Members of the Group and officials from the OGP will work alongside the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to deliver guidance on the inclusion of an apprenticeship/staff development provision within Public Sector tendering processes.</p></reply>

To support the implementation of the Code, the Charities Regulator provides; frequently asked questions,a training video, a toolkit with various templates and guidance notes. There is also a dedicated email address which can be used to email queries directly to the governance code team.  Details are available at <i>www.charitiesregulator.ie/en/information-for-charities/charities-governance-code</i>.</p><p><i>Commitment 14: Strengthen Anti-Corruption Measures</i></p><p>Commitment 14 has been substantially delivered with the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018 enacted on 5th June 2018 and commenced in full on 30th July 2018, and the Judicial Council Act 2019 enacted on 23rd July 2019 and commenced in full on 17th December 2019.  </p><p>The Public Sector Standards Bill 2015 lapsed (as with all Bills that had not completed the legislative process) with the dissolution of the D&aacute;il in advance of last year&rsquo;s General Election.

Its core proposition is that participation in arts, cultural and heritage-based activities drives personal and collective creativity, with significant implications for individual and societal wellbeing and achievement. Under the <i>Creative Communities</i>initiative in the Creative Ireland Programme, my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide funding to each of the 31 local authorities to enable them to implement their individual Culture and Creativity Strategies 2018-2022.  These Strategies were developed in 2017 following extensive local public consultation and are unique to each local authority, reflecting the breadth of cultural and creative work being undertaken in each area as well as the strategic priorities identified by the local community. Within this context, local amateur drama has received support from their local authorities. Further information is available on www.creativeireland.gov.ie/en/creative-communities.</p><p>The Deputy has made specific reference to community based dramatic societies. In the context of my own Department, I wish to advise the Deputy that the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 is a &euro;4.7m capital investment scheme for arts and culture centres.  Under this a range of capital funding measures is being provided to assist in the re-opening of theatres, arts centres and culture venues under Stream D of the Cultural Capital Scheme 2019-2022 as part of <i>Project Ireland 2040 -Investing in our Culture, Language &amp;amp; Heritage.</i>Stream D is specifically for capital adaptations or equipment necessary to assist arts and culture organisations in re-opening. Further details of this scheme can be accessed here at this link  www.gov.ie/en/service/b61b2-stream-d-of-the-cultural-capital-scheme-2019-2022</p><p>Primary support for the arts including drama in Ireland is delivered by the Arts Council and it is independent in its funding decisions under the Arts Act 2003.  The Arts Council&rsquo;s strategy recognises the distinctive role of amateur arts practice, its important contribution to the vitality of the arts in Ireland, including music, theatre and musical theatre, and it&rsquo;s many personal, social and artistic benefits. Earlier this year the Arts Council ran a pilot scheme as a once-off, action-research opportunity, and seeks enhanced engagement, mentorship and advocacy between the amateur and professional theatre, music and musical-theatre sector. Please see link here to the pilot scheme which was designed to enhance engagement between voluntary and professional arts sectors.  www.artscouncil.ie/Funds/Amateur-and-Voluntary-Practice-Pilot-Scheme/</p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that the Department of Rural and Community Development funds a range of programmes and schemes to assist in rural and community development which are available to eligible community groups and organisations throughout the country. These schemes provide funding, support and assistance to communities at local level and include the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, the LEADER programme; the Community Enhancement Programme, the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme; the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and the Community Services Programme. Details of funding allocations under specific schemes provided by that Department are available online at www.gov.ie/en/organisation/department-of-rural-and-community-development/. </p></reply>

The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications on Monday 1st March 2021. By the closing date, over 3,100 applications were submitted seeking over &euro;200m in funding. This is the highest number of applications ever received.</p>  <p>  The scoring system and assessment procedures was published earlier this year and all applications are being assessed in accordance with these. Approximately one thousand of the submitted applications were for "equipment only" projects. These applications were assessed first and grants totaling &euro;16.6m were announced on the 6th August.</p>  <p>  The remaining applications for capital works are now being assessed. Given the large number of applications received, this work is likely to take a number of months to complete with allocations expected to be announced before the end of this year.</p></reply>

It undertakes valuable work for biodiversity, including administering the Red Lists for vulnerable species. Ireland supports the IUCN and is a government agency member, through my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). </p>  <p>  The IUCN is not a decision making body in the sense of the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) or other multi-lateral environmental agreements (MEAs) that Ireland is party to. Accordingly, our engagement with the IUCN must be considered in the context of the resources available to the NPWS and its other priorities at any given time. </p>  <p>  NPWS is the focal point for most MEAs relating to nature and biodiversity and resources available to deal with this wide range of areas are limited. With this in mind, decisions are made within the Department on how best to focus these resources to represent Ireland's concerns and views in this area appropriately. In our capacity as an EU member, Ireland is also part of a much larger, strong and coherent voice for nature and biodiversity on the global stage. </p>  <p>  Ireland's priority has long been the CBD - its Conference of the Parties (COP) and its subsidiary meetings SBSTTA and SBI, which deal with scientific and implementation matters of the CBD respectively. It is imperative that Ireland has a presence and a voice at these important UN decision making forums. </p>  <p>  On the 12th and 13th of October next, I will participate in the first phase of the delayed CBD COP15, the High Level Segment. Over the past 12 months, I have taken part in several international initiatives addressing the biodiversity crisis, including the One Planet Summit for Biodiversity hosted by France in January. Ireland has also signed up to the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, a global initiative to mobilise political will for a new and transformative biodiversity framework at COP15.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department's NPWS has already participated this year in a number of preparatory meetings for COP15, namely SBSTTA-24 and SBI-3. While officials normally attend in person, these meetings have been held virtually to accommodate the restrictions in place as a result of the global pandemic. </p>  <p>  The NPWS is also involved in ongoing work at EU level to develop and agree strong positions for the EU and its Member States at the COP through regular meetings of the Working Party on International Environment Issues (Biodiversity). </p>  <p>  In order to maximise its reach, within its remit, NPWS directs its resources in this area to servicing the key decision making bodies such as CBD, CITES and EU level working parties and expert groups as well as other more focused but important areas including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), CMS-Eurobats, Access and Benefit-sharing of genetic resources (ABS), African and Eurasian Waterbirds Agreement (AEWA) and the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Bern Convention.</p></reply>

The plenary working group has been meeting monthly since March 2021, in addition to subgroup meetings. The group&rsquo;s terms of reference were adopted in May 2021 and include:</p><p>1. Examine defects in housing having regard to the recommendations in Item 4 &ldquo;Addressing the legacy of bad building and poor regulation&rdquo; in Chapter 4 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report - &lsquo;Safe as Houses? A Report on Building Standards, Building Controls and Consumer Protection&rsquo;.</p><p>2. Establish the nature of significant, wide-spread fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 &ndash; 2013 in Ireland through consultation with affected homeowners, homeowner representative organisations, owners&rsquo; management companies, relevant managing agents, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, industry stakeholders, insurance providers, mortgage providers and other relevant parties. Including such matters as:  - Identification and description of defect,</p><p>- Nature of defect &ndash; design, product, workmanship,</p><p>- Non-compliance with building regulations or actual damage, </p><p>- Severity/risk to life or serviceability of dwelling,</p><p>- Period of construction affected, </p><p>- Type of dwelling affected, </p><p>- Location of dwellings affected. </p><p>3. Establish the scale of the issue &ndash; estimate number of dwellings affected by the defects identified including those already remediated. </p><p>4. Consider a methodology for the categorisation of defects and the prioritisation of remedial action.</p><p>- In the case of defects with fire safety implications, consider how the framework for enhancing fire safety in dwellings can be applied to mitigate the risks arising from fire safety defects pending the remediation of defects and the Code of Practice for Fire Safety Assessment of Premises and Buildings, which is currently being developed by National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management.</p><p>5. Suggest mechanisms for resolving defects, in the context of the legal rights, duties and obligations of developers, builders, building professionals, insurers, mortgage providers, building control authorities, fire authorities, owners&rsquo; management companies, owner occupiers, renters and landlords, including:</p><p>- Technical options for the remediation of dwellings,</p><p>- Efficient means of carrying out work,</p><p>- individual dwellings or whole building approach,</p><p>- routine maintenance/refurbishment or remediation,</p><p>- Structures or delivery channels needed to facilitate resolution &ndash; advice and support.</p><p>6. Evaluate the potential cost of technical remediation options.</p><p>7. Pursue options on possible financial solutions to effect a resolution, in line with the Programme for Government commitment to identify options for those impacted by defects to access low-cost, long-term finance.</p><p>8. To report to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the Examination of Defects in Housing.</p><p>In regard to the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, the group will seek to engage with a range of interested parties, including homeowners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals and industry stakeholders, among others to examine the issue of defects in housing and report to me on the matter. Consultation with the relevant parties has commenced and further arrangements in this  regard are currently being put in place by the working group.</p><p>I am satisfied that the group is working effectively and efficiently on this complex matter and I look forward to a report in due course following completion of their deliberation. Once I receive the report I will give full consideration to its contents. </p><p>Any further speculation or discussion on the output of the working group, including speculation with regard to the scale of the issue or the potential cost, is premature at this stage.</p><p>Finally, in regard to income tax relief and Vat, taxation issues are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

National Planning Objective (NPO) 19 aims to ensure that a policy distinction is made between areas experiencing significant &lsquo;overspill&rsquo; development pressure from urban areas within the commuter catchment of cities, towns and centres of employment, on the one hand, and remoter rural areas where population levels may be low and or declining, on the other. </p><p>NPO 19 is aligned with the established planning approach whereby considerations of social (intrinsic part of the community) or economic (persons working full or part-time) need may be applied by planning authorities in certain rural areas under urban influence in order to prevent urban sprawl.</p><p>Updated Rural Housing Planning Guidelines are currently being prepared by my Department to ensure consistency with new requirements and legislation at national and EU level introduced in respect of areas related to rural housing such as environmental protection, the Gaeltacht and climate action.

The Draft Plan will include a number of proposed Areas for Action, including the Tolka in the Fingal County Council area and the Lower Tolka in the Dublin City Council area.  These proposed areas were selected through a collaborative workshop process at each Regional Operational Committee, the membership of which includes key stakeholders such as local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency and Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p>  <p>  The draft plan is due to be published shortly for a 6 month public consultation, and the Deputy may wish to engage in this consultation process.</p></reply>

Exempt buildings principally include domestic premises, farm buildings, buildings used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, as well as buildings used exclusively for charitable purposes and other than for private profit.  The Valuation Office implemented the new provisions of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, which came into effect on 8 June 2015, in connection with Community Childcare facilities. The Act amended Schedule 4, paragraph 22 of the Valuation Act 2001, and provided a new exemption from commercial rates. Under this provision, early learning facilities occupied by a charitable organisation and where the facilities are used for charitable, not-for profit purposes are exempt from commercial rates. </p>  <p>  A review was initiated in 2019 to examine the underlying policy rationale relating to the inclusion of categories of relevant property in Schedule 3 and Schedule 4 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2020.  The purpose of the review was to examine the underlying policy rationale and to assess the likely effects, costs and benefits of any proposed changes in categorisation.  My Department has an overarching objective to ensure the sustainable funding of local authorities. As commercial rates are a critical source of funding for local services, any recommendations arising from the review must support that sustainability requirement.

The primary focus of the project is on blanket bog Natura 2000 sites in the northwest of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The project recently launched a pilot RBPS in the Owenduff/Nephin SAC area. Applications to the project are closed for 2021 and will open for additional farmers in selected areas in the North West in 2022. SACs for inclusion in the 2022 scheme will be based on a number of factors, including overall size, number of Qualifying Interests for which the SAC is designated and location of previous EU-funded INTERREG projects. The project will also seek to establish a good geographical spread of participation in results based programmes, such as European Innovation Partnerships (EIPs), to ensure that a wide range of farmers and advisors have received training and experience in this approach in advance of the next CAP Strategic Plan. </p></reply>

In that, I particularly asked for a focus on one and four-bedroom properties which are in short supply (including properties that allow persons/families to move from homelessness), on vacant and derelict properties that can be brought back to use and on specific properties for people with disabilities or other particular priority needs. My overriding emphasis was that local authorities avoid acquisitions that compete with private buyers (owner occupiers) and that continues to be the case. </p><p>In situations where landlords are selling a property rented to a person or a family in receipt of social housing supports, it is expected that local authorities deploy their tenancy sustainment officer in the first place, to seek a resolution to the situation if possible.</p><p>In the context of the priority acquisition areas and the emphasis on avoiding competition with private buyers, I also asked local authorities to identify their own strategic priorities in relation to other categories of housing acquisitions they might propose to undertake. This recognises that there are different challenges and priorities in different local authority areas. Officials of my Department are in ongoing contact with local authority colleagues regarding areas such as acquisitions so the overall approach to acquisitions should be well understood. Within the strategic priorities a local authority has set for itself, the decision on individual acquisitions is a matter for each individual local authority. </p></reply>

My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.</p>  <p>  In December 2020, I announced a new Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61m. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works etc. were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:</p>  <p> - Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.);</p>  <p> - established Health and Safety needs;</p>  <p> - state of development of the project (is site acquired, etc.?); and </p>  <p> - value for money offered by the proposal.</p>  <p>  This new Programme will see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire engines. In order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding, my Department re-assesses the status of projects in the Programme on an annual basis, and some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value-for-money taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally. </p>  <p>  A new fire station at Loughrea, as well as one at Athenry, is included in my Department&rsquo;s 2021 &ndash; 2025 Fire Services Capital Programme. Galway County Council has indicated that the replacement of Loughrea Fire Station, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.26 million, is their fourth fire station priority. The Council submitted a preliminary appraisal and outline cost plan to my Department. My Department recently requested a design brief from the Council; this information has been received and is under consideration. My Department will continue to work with Galway County Council to progress the Loughrea fire station project. </p>  <p>  Project consideration stages in my Department include submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals; submission of design brief; selection of site; application for approval in principle; appointment of design consultants; submission of a preliminary design; planning application; submission of preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans; and tender process and construction stages - each step subject to approval from my Department.</p>  <p>  Projects in the Capital Programme will be reassessed on an annual basis in order to maximise the available Capital Programme funding. This includes consideration of additional fire station projects from fire authorities which fit the normal fire station project criteria and where an appropriate business case is presented. Priority may be adjusted to bring forward projects offering best value-for-money and to take account of the state of readiness of the projects.</p></reply>

Under section 41 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, local authorities are required to commence this inspection process within 8 months of HAP being paid in relation to a particular dwelling if not already inspected within the previous 12 months. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to the 'retrofit' of 500,000 homes to a B2/Cost Optimal Equivalent BER standard by 2030, of which it is expected that approximately 36,500 will be local authority owned homes. A new ten year Energy Efficiency Programme was launched in 2021 with a significant increase in funding support to &euro;65 million. The newly revised programme will see a significant upscaling (from a &lsquo;shallow&rsquo; to &lsquo;deeper retrofit&rsquo;) on what has been completed by local authorities in previous years and focuses on ensuring that the fabric of the home is upgraded and an energy efficient heating system is provided.</p></reply>

Investment is primarily delivered through Irish Water while my Department operates the Rural Water Programme directly. </p><p>My Department provides funding, through the Rural Water Programme, to deliver improvements to private water services in areas of rural Ireland where there is no access to public infrastructure.  The strategic objective of the Rural Water Programme is to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of water services for rural dwellers in these areas. Private water services in Ireland include:</p><p>- Individual water supplies, typically a bored well. </p><p>- Group Water Schemes.</p><p>- Domestic waste water treatment systems, typically septic tanks.</p><p>- Collection networks, typically developer provided water services infrastructure.</p><p>My Department has recently appointed an external consultant to prepare a report on the provision of research and information, to support a review of the wider investment needs relating to rural water services. The complete report, which will be delivered by the end of 2021, will focus on the governance, supervision, funding and wider investment needs relating to the Rural Water Sector.  The report will be used by the Working Group on Rural Water in its considerations of the wider long term objectives and needs of the Sector.</p><p>Complementary to Irish Water&rsquo;s <i>Small Towns and Villages Growth Programme 2020-2024</i>, my Department is also currently examining waste water requirements in the context of villages and similar settlements that do not have access to public waste water infrastructure.</p><p>I have instructed the relevant officials in my Department to prepare a report on this topic at a national level. This report will include the analysis of a baseline survey of all rural local authorities, to quantify and qualify the number of villages and similar settlements concerned.  This process is at an advanced stage, and I will be in a position to consider the matter further in relation to these villages and similar settlements, as identified in the survey, once I have received the final report.</p></reply>

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of homeless accommodation rests with individual housing authorities. The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988.</p>  <p>  My Department does not fund any homeless services directly but provides funding to housing authorities towards these costs. Under the funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services from their own resources. Housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homeless related services outside of these funding arrangements with my Department. Therefore, the exact spend by housing authorities on homeless services is a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum.</p>  <p>  The Exchequer allocation for 2021 is &euro;218m with a total of &euro;150m recouped to housing authorities to date.

On 18 August, I signed the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Commencement) (Parts 1 and 3) Order 2021, which commenced Parts 1 and 3 of the Act from 19 August. This brought into operation the Cost Rental element of the Act. </p>  <p>  On 19 August 2021, I made the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Cost Rental Designation) Regulations 2021, which came into effect that day.  These Regulations govern the process by which the owners of dwellings may obtain the designation of their properties as Cost Rental dwellings. </p>  <p>  On 2 September 2021, I signed the Affordable Housing Act 2021 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2021, which commenced Part 2 (other than subsections (2)(c), (6), and (7) of section 6) and Parts 4, 6, 7, and 8 of the Act from 3 September.  </p>  <p>  With the relevant elements of the Act relating to the local authority affordable purchase scheme (Part 2) and Cost Rental (Part 3), it is my intention to make further Regulations governing the eligibility and price ceilings that will be applicable to these schemes by November 2021.</p>  <p>  The first Cost Rental homes were delivered by the Approved Housing Body (AHB) Cl&uacute;id at Taylor Hill, Balbriggan, in August 2021, utilising funding from the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme. The eligibility criteria  for prospective tenants was agreed with my Department on an administrative basis given the need to occupy these homes as soon as possible. For Taylor Hill, tenants were required to prove that their net household income was below &euro;53,000 per annum, that they were not in receipt of any social housing supports, that their household size matches the size of the property advertised, that they could afford to pay the cost rent for the home, and that their household had only entered one application for a specific cost rental property.   </p>  <p>  Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides the basis for the establishment of the 'First Home' (shared equity) scheme, which is to be operated and administered by a newly established special purpose vehicle (SPV). It also provides that the Minister may agree the terms by which the equity support may be provided, covering, inter alia, areas such as purchaser eligibility and financial means, the homes that may be considered eligible under the scheme and the amount of funding that can be provided. Work on the detailed design and operation of the scheme is advancing and the Government's recently published Housing For All Plan confirms the intention to introduce the First Home Scheme in Q1 2022.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Building Regulations is primarily to protect the health, safety and welfare of people in and around buildings. While both codes deal with the built environment, they have interrelated but separate roles.</p><p>New buildings and extensions or material alterations to existing buildings must comply with the legal minimum performance standards for the design and construction of buildings set out in the Building Regulations 1997 - 2021.  The Building Regulations are subject to ongoing review in the interests of safety and the well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of changes in construction techniques, technological progress and innovation.</p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific query, Part M of the Building Regulations deals with Access and Use. The associated Technical Guidance Document M provides guidance indicating how the requirements of Part M can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with TGD M, this will, <i>prima facie</i>, indicate compliance with Part M of the Second Schedule of the Building Regulations.</p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment. While the Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision, the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.</p><p>In December 2020, my Department established a Working Group to examine the provision for a changing places toilet in certain buildings. A changing places toilet offers larger supported facilities that address the needs of people for whom current accessible sanitary accommodation is inadequate. These facilities enable people with complex care needs to take part in everyday activities such as travel, shopping, family days out or attending a sporting event.</p><p>The plenary Working Group has met six times to date, in addition to a number of sub-group meetings.  Draft documentation, which includes Draft Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2021, Draft Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use 2021 and a Regulatory Impact Analysis, is currently being prepared to support a public consultation in the matter later this year.</p></reply>

This is set out in the regulations governing the Scheme and ensures the effective targeting of limited resources. </p><p>Applicants who are separated or divorced may be treated as first-time buyers, in accordance with the regulations, if they meet certain conditions, including:</p><p>- they are separated or divorced under a court order or by a separation agreement;</p><p>- the property being purchased is the first property since leaving the family home;</p><p>- they have left the family home and retain no interest in it; or</p><p>- the other party has remained in the family home.</p><p>In meeting the conditions as set out above, in particular that the other party has remained in the family home and that the potential applicant has relinquished any rights they had over that property, no financial gain should have been made by the potential applicant in exchange for relinquishing their rights to the property in this manner. Were the individual to have made a financial gain in releasing their rights to the property, such as being bought out by the other party who remains resident in it, they would be deemed to have been compensated for their interest in the property, and therefore not be eligible as a first-time buyer.</p><p>The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee on a case-by-case basis. Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the Regulations establishing the scheme and the credit policy that underpins the scheme, in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of both borrowers and the lending local authorities.</p><p>As part of Housing for All, a &lsquo;Fresh start&rsquo; principle will apply to applications to State-run affordable housing and loan schemes in future. This means that people who are divorced/separated and no longer have a financial interest in the family home, or who have undergone insolvency proceedings, will be eligible to apply for State loan schemes. </p><p>Therefore, the successor to the RIHL, the 'Local Authority Home Loan', which will be in place later in 2021, will apply this 'Fresh start' principle. I look forward to announcing further details in respect of the Local Authority Home Loan in the coming months.</p></reply>

I call for an end to violence, the immediate and unconditional release of all those detained, including the President and State Counsellor, and the restoration of a legitimate, civilian Government. </p>  <p>  As a result of the coup, there is a political and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar. The country is suffering from conflict, severe economic recession, large-scale displacement, collapsing public and health services and a significant surge in COVID-19 cases. This crisis affects not just Myanmar, but threatens the stability of the region. Ireland supports an urgent, international effort to address pressing humanitarian issues within Myanmar.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to provide humanitarian assistance for the most vulnerable communities in Myanmar and I have called on the Myanmar military to allow unhindered access to all regions for humanitarian workers. Ireland endorses the necessity of a clear separation between the political and humanitarian processes in Myanmar. Delivery of humanitarian aid must be free from political interference and not be linked to political, ethnic or other identity, used as leverage in negotiations, nor used to claim political legitimacy.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide significant resources to humanitarian partners in Myanmar, with approximately &euro;2.5 million approved for 2021 to date.  In July, the Emergency Response Fund Scheme (ERFS) was activated in support of a project to ensure that women and girls affected by the crisis in the conflict affected Kayah State are protected from, and treated for, the consequences of Gender Based Violence.</p>  <p>  My Department is also engaged in regular discussions with United Nations (UN) structures, International NGOs, Human Rights Groups and other organisations working actively on the ground. Ireland continues to engage with discussions at the UN Security Council which has expressed deep concerns regarding developments in Myanmar, strongly condemned the use of violence by the military, and called for the release of all those detained. While this united position is welcome, Ireland would also like to see the Security Council agree more tangible actions to ensure peace and democracy in Myanmar.</p>  <p>  Ireland supports the adoption of the sanctions against the perpetrators of the coup and the economic entities that sustain them. In this regard, I endorsed the strong and comprehensive approach set out in the Council Conclusions adopted by the EU Foreign Affairs Council on February 22 and the adoption of sanctions on 22 March, 19 April and 21 June. We are currently working with the EU to consider further actions which will work to restore the democratic path in Myanmar and not negatively affect developmental gains or exacerbate the humanitarian situation.</p>  <p>  The crisis remains on the agenda of the Security Council and Ireland will continue to actively engage for a peaceful solution to the crisis and for the delivery of humanitarian support. Through the UN and our Embassy network, we are encouraging all those who have influence on the military leadership to use it to find a political resolution to this crisis and protect the human rights of the people of Myanmar.</p></reply>

When I chaired the meeting of the Council on 9 September, I highlighted the need for an inclusive and negotiated peace settlement, the protection and promotion of the human rights of all Afghans, especially of women and girls, and for the Taliban to fulfil their commitment to allow the safe, secure, orderly and unhindered departure of foreign nationals and Afghans at-risk.  I also urged the Taliban to facilitate full and safe humanitarian access to allow life-saving support to reach all Afghans and recently approved the provision of an additional &euro;1 million in humanitarian support to the UN High Commission for Refugees. </p>  <p>  At national level, the Government has responded to assist vulnerable Afghans.  Following the announcement I made together with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Minister for Justice last month, approximately 340 places were allocated under the Refugee Protection Programme and some 110 of these Afghans have since travelled to Ireland.  This Programme comes under the remit of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and our diplomatic network are providing support by liaising with relevant authorities and individuals in relation to travel routes. My Department has facilitated the safe exit of a further 11 Irish citizens and dependents from Kabul at the weekend and they are currently en route to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice is currently reviewing all international protection applications on hand from Afghan nationals with a view to expediting their progress and is examining, as a matter of urgency, proposals for a humanitarian admission programme whereby persons resident in Ireland could apply for family members in Afghanistan to be granted admission to Ireland.  I understand that proposals will be brought to Government in relation to this matter in the near future.</p></reply>

The purpose of that meeting was to raise awareness and support for the deteriorating humanitarian situation there.  </p>  <p>  I set out Ireland&rsquo;s response to date and our intention to continue to support evolving needs, noting that Ireland has so far this year provided &euro;2 million to address humanitarian needs in Afghanistan . This includes funding to Concern Worldwide; to the UN managed Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund; HALO Trust; and &euro;1 million to UNHCR.  In addition, Ireland has contributed to the international response through our core funding to UN agencies, to the START Fund and to joint mechanisms such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).  We are a top ten donor to the CERF, with an annual contribution of &euro;10 million per year. The CERF has allocated over &euro;21 million in 2021 to Afghanistan.  As an EU Member State and a Team Europe partner, Ireland is also part of the EU's &euro;300 million humanitarian response to the crisis, announced this month.</p>  <p>  My officials are currently in the process of reviewing options for early further funding to respond to the Afghanistan crisis, including through the UN Flash Appeal as well other humanitarian partners. </p></reply>

These applications comprise of 63,000 valid applications which are with the Passport Service and 43,000 incomplete applications that require action by the applicant.  </p><p>25% of valid applications are for adult renewals, 16% are for complex renewals for children and 59% are for first time applications. </p><p>First time applications for adults and children are complex applications involving measures to assure the true identity of the applicant, their entitlement to Irish citizenship and, in the case of children, that all guardians have consented to the issuing of the passport. Particular complexity relates to the processing of application from children born in Ireland after 2004 due to the need to verify entitlement for Irish citizenship.</p><p>The Passport Service began scaling up to more normal operational levels on 4 May 2021, in line with the phased easing of restrictions set out in &ldquo;COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 &ndash; The Plan Ahead&rdquo;.  Since that date, the Passport Service has issued over 300,000 passports while continuing to operate the emergency service for priority cases for which customers are encouraged to contact our Customer Service Hub if they require assistance.  Over 4000 Foreign Birth Registrations have also been processed in cases of exceptional urgency.</p><p>The Passport Service are continually looking for ways to improve efficiency and welcome the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal in relation to the return of documentation.While Passport Service resources are primarily focused on meeting current demand, we will be reviewing the documentation required to support a passport application and will examine the processes around the verification and processing of supporting documentation with a view to further streamlining the process and reducing turnaround times.  </p><p>The Passport Tracker Service gives an indication of the estimated delivery date based on the vast majority of applications and is not an intended guarantee of service.  I accept the frustration this may cause to applicants and work is ongoing to improve the information provided to customers in relation to their application.</p><p>The Customer Service Hub has handled approximately 80,000 customer queries since scaling up operations in June through its phone and web chat services.  They also continue to examine ways to meet the very high demand for this service at this time including through the allocation of additional resources.</p><p>The Passport Service, like many Government Services, have been impacted by Covid-19.  Operations have been maintained notwithstanding the fact that the processing of passports requires physical attendance on site to deliver this service. As a result of well implemented safety protocols our staff were able to assist citizens who required passports for a range of emergency and urgent personal, business or legal reasons, or who had compelling humanitarian needs to travel.</p><p>In line with our continued scaling up of services my Department are actively planning for the opening of our Public Offices for the processing of urgent applications for those renewing their passport.  This service will resume initially in the public office of the Passport Service in Dublin and we will be making a public announcement on the specific date very soon.</p></reply>

Some of the issues referenced in the President's speech will require further elaboration and may require specific proposals from the European Commission. Ireland will engage constructively in relation to any such proposals. </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) gives the EU the capacity to undertake peacekeeping and conflict prevention missions and to strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter. Ireland has been and continues to be a consistent supporter and full participant in its development. Participation in the CSDP does not prejudice the security and defence policy of any Member State, including Ireland, or their obligations.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate cooperation between the defence forces of EU Member States when deployed on overseas peacekeeping or crisis management missions, a desire for improved interoperability has frequently been expressed. By developing common standards with regard to training and equipment, many issues which would otherwise be encountered during these types of deployment can be minimised or eliminated.</p>  <p>  In terms of EU-NATO co-operation, we have consistently said that we welcome greater co-operation where that co-operation contributes to international peace and security and where it is focused on avoiding duplication of structures, systems and interoperability standards as this ensures better coherence and effectiveness on the ground in peace support and crisis management operations.  </p>  <p>  Work on the development of the text of a new EU-NATO Joint Declaration is ongoing at an institutional level between the EU and NATO. As such this Declaration will be agreed between the leaders of the two institutions rather than individual EU Member States / NATO Allies.</p>  <p>  Meanwhile, Ireland will continue our existing cooperation with NATO through the Partnership for Peace. The primary aim of Ireland&rsquo;s PfP participation is to enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; interoperability with other professional military forces for the purpose of engaging in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations led by the UN, EU or NATO.</p>  <p>  In relation to the President's proposed Summit on European Defence next year, I expect that the Commission and the French Presidency of the Council will provide further details of the meeting early next year.</p>  <p>  Finally, on the issue of a European Defence Union, I await specific proposals and further elaboration of the President's remarks, including in relation to the creation of a "Joint Situational Awareness Centre", suggested as a means of improving intelligence cooperation within and between Member States.</p>  <p>  However, I would recall that, within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence and that any decisions, including any deepening of EU cooperation, require unanimity. Any new proposals in this regard will have to be in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality, as reflected in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.</p></reply>

The findings of the Ombudsman, in relation to complaints submitted to his Office under the provisions of the Act, are therefore based on his independent assessment of the information he is presented with during the course of his investigation. In this particular case, the Minister is satisfied that the ODF had appropriately exercised his discretion, that a full, fair and objective investigation had been conducted by the ODF in relation to the facts of the complaints in this case.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that WRC rulings are in the public domain and will be also aware that the Adjudicator in his December 2020 ruling on two complaints brought by an individual, upheld one complaint on the grounds of gender discrimination in relation to promotion, owing to the treatment of absences in terms of access to promotion contrary to S.8 (1) of the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015.  The Adjudicator found that the Minister did not discriminate against the Complainant, and did not victimise her, within the meaning of S.2, S. 6(1) and S. 74 (2) of the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2015 as alleged in her second complaint. </p>  <p>  The directions of the ruling are currently being implemented by the military authorities with a view to ensuring that all of the training programmes and materials for Defence Forces personnel are fully aligned, and compatible with, the provisions of the relevant equality legislation and that follow-on actions will be progressed. A  Defence Forces Working Group is established comprising membership from the Defence Forces HR, Legal and Training &amp;amp; Education HQ Branches as well as representatives from the Defence Forces Formations.  The Working Group has had 12 plenary meetings to date in addition to meetings of sub-groups. Progress is continuing in line with the timelines set out in the ruling and this will be fully complied with.</p>  <p>  The complainant has ongoing active litigation in a number of fora, and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.</p></reply>

This includes the recommendations from Public Health that post-primary services would operate at 50% capacity. All other measures relating to hygiene, pre-assigned seating, cleaning and the wearing of masks by post-primary students are also in place.  However, as the vaccination programme for children on post-primary services is rolled out and as the lifting of restrictions on public transport services proceeds, the capacity limit of 50% on post-primary school transport services will be subject to ongoing review and the Department will be considering the position in this regard over the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  Should post-primary services resume operating at 100% capacity and where additional vehicles that were provided for social distancing purposes are removed, any spare capacity available will be offered on those services to concessionary pupils or late applicants where such capacity exists.</p></reply>

On the 27th of October 2020, under the auspices of the WRC, an understanding was agreed on a pathway to progress the issues. Several key strands have been identified, and a phased approach is being taken to the development of proposals. </p><p>Following intensive discussions at the WRC on 13<sup>th</sup>September, there has been significant progress in this dispute. Subject to agreement on all elements of the claim, the Department has offered to move School Secretaries&rsquo; pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale within education and training boards on a pro rata basis with an effective date of implementation for these new pay arrangements of 1<sup>st</sup>September 2021. Pay rates will be pro rata according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. The assimilation of School Secretaries to the CO Grade III pay scale will require further dialogue between the parties and an intensive engagement will take place of over the next two/three weeks to allow this to be finalised.</p><p>My Department has also offered to improve the conditions for School Secretaries with regard to sick leave, annual leave and maternity provisions for this cohort of staff.  This will take place via direct engagement with the unions in the coming weeks in addition to engagement on other elements of the claim and subject to all elements being agreed.</p><p>While there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff. When the final package for secretaries has been agreed and an implementation plan in place for schools and DE, that intensive engagement will begin on regularising the pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers.</p><p>I welcome the deferral of the action scheduled for Wednesday 15th September to allow for intensive talks to resume aimed at resolving the claim and agreeing a final package and I look forward to further progress being advanced.</p></reply>

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p><font color="#001A26">- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised.

In the 2020/21 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020. </p>  <p>  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Department's Post-Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest school/education centre as determined by my Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the planning and timetabling of school transport routes. Bus &Eacute;ireann endeavours, within available resources, to ensure that each eligible child has a reasonable level of school transport service in the context of the Scheme nationally. </p>  <p>  Where practicable, and subject to considerations of cost and logistics, routes are planned to avoid an eligible child having to travel more than 3.2 kms to or from a pick up/set down point. Routes are planned on the basis of the locations of children who are eligible for school transport only. </p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has advised that the families referred to by the Deputy are eligible for school transport. Bus &Eacute;ireann has further advised all eligible families who reside in area referred to and who attend the school in question have been facilitated with school transport for the 2021/22 school year.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann also advises that the service has been reviewed and changes have been implemented taking all pupils on the route into consideration. To extend or alternate the route as requested would inconvenience other pupils on the service.</p>  <p>  In regard to the status of the appeal as requested, the School Transport Appeals Board have contacted this family directly. </p></reply>

The guidance also allows schools to use the additional hours in conjunction with other supports in schools, such as class teachers, and special education teachers. </p><p>The CLASS programme will also provide for shared learning opportunities between schools to ensure that good practice in meeting students&rsquo; needs and mitigating learning loss is shared and replicated.</p><p>My Department will also ensure that research is undertaken both into the impacts of the disruption to learning and the student experience of COVID-19 across a range of areas, and on the impact of the mitigation measures undertaken under this programme. </p></reply>

Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to draft, publish and implement a school admission policy in accordance with the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. </p>  <p>  The admission policy, including the selection criterion to be used where the school is oversubscribed, must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>  <p>  Where a board of management receive an application for admission and they make a decision to refuse admission, a parent/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned. </p>  <p>  Where a parent has been refused admission to a school and wishes to appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 the appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that if admission has been refused due to the school being oversubscribed, and a parent wishes to appeal this decision she or he must firstly make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  If the parent has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, she or he may, but is not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission.  Where admission has been refused for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and the parent does not wish to seek a review by the board of management she or he may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.</p>  <p>  Full details on the section 29 appeals processes are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the link below:</p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed/  </p>  <p>www.gov.ie/en/publication/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed/  </p>  <p>In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS), the Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency, is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child. Contact details for TESS are available at the following link www.tusla.ie/tess/get-in-touch/   or by email at tessinfo@tusla.ie. I would advise the parents of the child for whom the deputy has provided details, to make contact with Tusla Education Support Services to seek their support in securing a school place.</p></reply>

For the 2021/22 school year the staffing schedule is on the basis of 1 teacher for every 25 pupils.  </p>  <p>  The latest figures in relation to pupil teacher ratio shows an improved ratio of teachers to pupils from 16:1 to 14.5:1 at primary level when comparing the 2015/16 school year to the 2020/21 school year.  Average class sizes improved from 24.9 to 23.3 in the same period. The most recent budget announcement will continue the positive trend of improving class sizes.</p>  <p>  The staffing schedule which now stands at a new historical low will also help to ensure better teacher retention in primary schools while also ensuring that less pupils are required to retain or recruit a teacher.  </p>  <p>  As part of the  COVID-19 supports provided to schools, specific funding was provided to support Principals and who undertake teaching duties in primary schools.  This funding provided each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week.  Schools have been advised that this measure will remain in place for the 2021/22 school year. </p>  <p>  Budget 2020 provided for a further 2.5% increase in standard capitation funding for primary and post primary schools that applied from the start of the 2020/21 school year. This builds on the 5% increase in capitation announced in Budget 2019. The combined increases given in 2019 and 2020 mean that circa 40% restoration will be achieved. It is my intention to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 capitation grant will also continue to be the mechanism through which further additional funding will be provided to cater for school costs related to hand hygiene measures, PPE requirements and enhanced cleaning supports. All schools will have received this funding before the end of the week.</p></reply>

This funding provided each teaching principal with a minimum of one release day per week.  Schools have been advised that, in the context of COVID-19, the additional allocation of Principal Release Days will remain in place for the 2021/22 school year and each school with a teaching principal will have 37 Principal Release Days. </p>  <p>  In total 1700 additional leadership posts have been invested in our primary schools since the lifting of the moratorium on posts of responsibility in 2017, which has led to 1 in 3 teachers now holding promoted positions.  The Department has committed to annually revising the allocation of Posts of Responsibility to take into account retirements during the school year which ensures that the current level of Posts of Responsibility are maintained in the school system. The most recent update for the current school year is available on the Department's website (Circular 0025/2021).

Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p><font color="#001A26">- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in the normal way.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications will be processed in order of date received.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website</font>, ncse.ie/for-schools  </p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website . </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020are available on the Departments website.</p><p>My Department does not have a role in making individual school determinations.</p><p>The NCSE have confirmed that the school made and exceptional review application for the school year 21/22. The review outcome was an increase of .5 of an SNA post, bringing to 3.33 the total mainstream allocation of SNAs to the school for the 2021/22 school year. This was communicated to the school by letter dated 29/06/2021.</p><p>The school appealed the decision which resulted in a new review, and a school visit that took place on 10/09/2021. The NCSE state that the outcome of the latest review was communicated to the school on 17/09/2021 advising that the total mainstream SNA allocation to the school now stands at 3.83, following a further increase of .5 of an SNA. </p></reply>

My Department does not have a role in making determinations in individual cases. </p><p>The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p><p>SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. </p><p>It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. </p><p>In light of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the introduction of the new Frontloaded Allocation Model for SNAs for students in mainstream classes in primary and post -primary schools is to be deferred for a further year to the beginning of the 2022/23 school year. </p><p>In order to minimise disruption for schools, in the current circumstances, and to provide for continuity of allocations the following arrangements for the allocation of Special Needs Assistants for mainstream classes for the 2021/22 school year: </p><p><font color="#001A26">- Existing mainstream class SNA allocations in schools on 30 April 2021 will be maintained and will automatically rollover into the 2021/22 school year.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- No school will therefore receive an allocation less than that which they had on 30 April 2021.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- SNAs currently in mainstream settings can continue in post for the next school year in  the normal way.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- Priority consideration will now be given by the NCSE to applications for increased support for the 2021/22 school year, in particular, applications from schools with no SNAs and developing schools will be prioritised. Determinations will be made before 30 June. Other applications willbe processed in order of date received.</font></p><p><font color="#001A26">- As in previous years, where circumstances change during the course of the 2021/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met  within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review. Detailed information on the NCSE exceptional review process is published on the NCSE website </font>ncse.ie/for-schools  </p><p>The NCSE have published the SNA allocations on their website . </p><p>SNA allocations for special classes and special schools are not affected by this arrangement.</p><p>Circular 0029/2021has been published and advises schools of the arrangements for the allocation of SNAs for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Provisions set out in Circular 0030/2020has been extended for the 2021/22 school year.</p><p>Circulars 29/2021 and 30/2020are available on the Departments website.</p><p>The NCSE have confirmed that the school applied in May 2021 for an exceptional review of their allocation of SNA support.

This approach is consistent with the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004.  </p>  <p>  This Department's policy is therefore to provide for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs in mainstream schools. The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports</p>  <p>  This policy is supported by significant investment by this Government.  The Department of Education will spend approximately &euro;2 Billion or just under 25% of its total educational budget in 2021 on making additional provision for children with special educational needs this year.</p>  <p>  Only where it has been assessed that the child is unable to be supported in mainstream education, are special class placements or special school placements recommended and provided for. It is therefore not the case that special educational placements are required to support all children with special educational needs, nor is it intended that this should be the case.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.  </p>  <p>  It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is made available to the school. </p>  <p>  Through ongoing consultation at local level, the NCSE is also aware of those parents whose children are seeking placement for the 2021/22 academic year, including mainstream placement with appropriate support, special class placement, Early Intervention and special school placement. The NCSE continues to work to identify any and all relevant suitable placements. </p>  <p>  The NCSE is working with schools to encourage and support the opening of new special classes at all levels and has specific plans in place to increase the number of places available.</p>  <p>The local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) continue to be available to assist and advise both schools and the parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available at: ncse.ie/regional-services-contact-list  . </p>  <p>Information on the list of schools with special classes, the types and locations of these classes is published on the NCSE website and is available at www.ncse.ie   </p>  <p>  I also understand from my enquiries that this pupil&rsquo;s needs have not been brought to the attention of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) of my Department. NEPS is available to support the school with this matter at the request of the school principal and I would advise that the parent/guardian speaks to the Principal of the school with a view to their concerns being raised with NEPS.</p></reply>

I understand the Deputy has put a similar question to Minister Harris. </p>  <p>  On 2 June 2021 I announced that provisional results of the Leaving Certificate would issue on 3 September 2021. This information was communicated to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS), who continued their engagements with UCAS and relevant organisations in the UK. </p>  <p>  I also raised this subject when I met with the UK Secretary of State for Education in Dublin last July.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the above engagement, students who had applied for places in universities and colleges outside of Ireland were advised to engage directly with these institutions as early as possible to notify them of the results date and to confirm their position. This was communicated to students through the gov.ie/leavingcertificate webpage, through social media  and through bilateral engagement with the Irish Secondary Schools Student Union (ISSU). </p>  <p>  Where issues emerged which could not be resolved in engagement between students and admissions offices in the UK, officials in both my Department and DFHERIS engaged directly with the students and universities in question, seeking that they would respond flexibly in respect of Irish students. The work was also supported by staff from the Irish Embassies in London and Cardiff.  In those cases which were notified to and pursued by both Departments, there is no evidence of students having reverted to either Department to indicate that they were disadvantaged.   </p>  <p>  Where a student applies to pursue their higher education studies in the UK, this is a matter between the student and the UK University in question.  As a result, my Department does not hold any statistics in this regard.</p></reply>

My priority was to ensure CE schemes and participants were fully supported during this period.  While some schemes were able to maintain services while complying with public health restrictions, this was not always the case.  In both scenarios, CE participants, whose contracts were due to end during periods of public health restrictions, had their contracts extended on a number of occasions, most recently up to end October 2021.</p>  <p>  With the successful roll-out of the vaccine programme and in line with Government&rsquo;s  plans for the full re-opening of the economy, under 'Reframing the Challenge, Continuing Our Recovery and Reconnecting&rsquo; my priority and the priority of the Department is to have all CE and T&uacute;s schemes back providing normal services and supports to unemployed participants while delivering vital services to local communities.</p>  <p>  As part of this return to normal operations, a phased and planned schedule of exits for CE and T&uacute;s participants, some of whose contracts have been extended for up to year, will commence in November 2021.   I can reassure the Deputy that the exits will be carried out in a phased basis between November and May 2022. This means that many participants&rsquo; contacts will be extended beyond the end of October. </p>  <p>  These final contract extensions will provide all CE participants with an opportunity to complete any outstanding training while also benefitting from further work experience on CE.  The coordinated and phased exit approach will also support the recruitment of new CE participants while ensuring the ongoing delivery of important local community services.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that all employment and activation programmes have the best outcome for participants, CE will continue to be made available to support those who are long term unemployed and furthest removed from the labour market, including those whose employment has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 emergency. New places are also being assigned to a number of CE and T&uacute;s schemes, delivering on a key Government commitment under Pathways to Work.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. </p></reply>

It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work.  My Department spent a total of &euro;4.7 billion on illness, disability and caring payments in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s main income support schemes for people who are ill or who have a disability include Illness Benefit, Invalidity Pension and Disability Allowance. </p>  <p>  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type.  Additional payments may also be made in respect of a qualified adult and qualifying children.  It is payable to those covered by Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) for up to two years, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility. </p>  <p>  Invalidity Pension is a pension paid to people who are 'permanently incapable of work' because of illness or disability.  This is also a social insurance payment and is dependent on the claimant&rsquo;s PRSI contributions and medical conditions. </p>  <p>  Disability Allowance is not based on social insurance contribution records and as such is paid to those most in need.  The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.  The assessment of means reflects the fact that there is an expectation that people with reasonable amounts of income or capital are in a position to use these resources to support themselves, so that social welfare expenditure can be directed towards those who need it most. </p>  <p>  Where the circumstances of a person in receipt of Disability Allowance changes and they have means in excess of the limits set down in legislation, the payment is discontinued.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that for those in financial difficulty, the Supplementary Welfare Allowance, including Urgent Needs Payments or Exceptional Needs Payments, are available through my Department's Intreo centres.  This is a means-tested payment administered by this Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service. </p>  <p>  The Department regularly reviews its supports and payments schemes to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.  As set out above, a comprehensive set of income support payments is in place for those experiencing illness and disability.  </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Where an international protection applicant has the right to access and labour market and is working, they may establish entitlement to certain Social Welfare payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit and Illness Benefit.  People in that position who lost their work due to the pandemic will have received the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.  People in the international protection system may also qualify for Urgent Needs or Exceptional Needs Payments under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.</p>  <p>  Child Benefit is payable to a qualified person with whom a qualified child normally resides; the child will not be regarded as normally residing with more than one person.  In order to be a qualified person for the purposes of the scheme a person must be habitually resident in the State.

The schemes objectives are to promote (i) a reduction in child poverty, (ii) positive child development outcomes, (iii) labour market activation and (iv) improved quality.  </p>  <p>  The NCS is designed to be highly inclusive and to meet the needs of those families who need it the most. The NCS is based on the principle of progressive universalism and has regard to the best interests of children. </p>  <p>  By making this fundamental shift away from the legacy schemes where subsidies are grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families, the NCS aims to improve children&rsquo;s outcomes, improve labour market participation and reduce child poverty. It is a central policy component of the NCS to poverty proof and assist people in exiting the poverty trap.</p>  <p>  Within this framework, an income-related subsidy is payable for children up to 15 years of age. The subsidy level is determined by the family&rsquo;s income and the child's age. The number of hours subsidised is determined by the parent's employment or education arrangements.</p>  <p>  Underpinned by this approach is strong evidence that shows how growing up in poverty negatively impacts on child outcomes.  Taking up work or engaging in training, even a very low number of hours, is key to enabling families to break that cycle and that is what the NCS is designed to support. </p>  <p>  The NCS does not provide grants to providers in respect of their general operation.  Rather, it subsidises parents in respect of the cost of early learning and childcare, subject to confirmation that these services are being provided and used.</p>  <p>  It is understood that some providers may experience a drop in income where a child has a parent at home who is not in work or study, and where in term time, the child will not be eligible for subsidies. </p>  <p>  This is because the scheme is also built to ensure that families are supported to access a minimum level of early learning and childcare provision to support positive child outcomes. </p>  <p>  Importantly, the evidence also shows that these benefits are, in most cases, realised with part-time participation.</p>  <p>   On this basis, 20 hours are available all year round for children who have not started school, and in non-term time for school age children, regardless of whether the parents or guardians are in work or study. </p>  <p>  They may also see increases in other areas where the NCS is supporting new families to take up places through subsidies of up to &euro;229.50 per child per week. This should increase demand particularly as we move out of the current Covid-19 emergency measures and childcare usage reverts to a more normal level.</p>  <p>  I absolutely understand that there will be children in exceptional circumstances for whom this is not enough.</p>  <p>  For these children, families can avail of up to 45 hours free early learning childcare, with no work or study rule through sponsorship arrangements. </p>  <p>  Sponsorship referrals can be made by a number of designated bodies. Already over 2,000 children have accessed these supports.</p>  <p>  My Department is keenly aware of the importance of maintaining sustainable, progressive services and in this context work is progressing on a new funding model for the early learning and childcare sector. </p>  <p>  This work is being led by an Expert Group, due to report later this year, who are tasked with designing mechanisms to deliver additional funding to ensure greater levels of affordability, accessibility, quality and inclusion. </p>  <p>  The work to design the new funding model will also include recommendations for the introduction of a model that will provide specific and additional supports to services with high proportions of children who experience disadvantage.  </p>  <p>  In the interim, my Department has made supports available to services who are experiencing financial difficulty, including those who have had challenges in transitioning to the new scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department oversees a Case Management process through City/County Childcare Committees (CCCs). CCCs and Pobal work together to assess and provide support to early learning and care (ELC) and school-age childcare (SAC) services experiencing difficulties. </p>  <p>  Pobal co-ordinate the overall case management process with the CCC administering on-the-ground case management assistance. This can include help with completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, fee setting and cash flow, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  Financial supports, which may also be accessed through the Case Management process, are available for community services presenting with sustainability issues following a financial assessment by Pobal.</p>  <p>  Normally, financial supports are only available for community services. However, there is a COVID-19 Impact Support funding strand available in 2021, which is for both Community and Private services. The funding will be available on a rolling basis throughout 2021 for eligible ELC and SAC services that require further financial assistance in addition to current support measures available and others that may be announced throughout the year.</p>  <p>  The CCC should be the first point of contact for any service seeking support; I would therefore urge any SAC or ELC service in difficulty to contact their local CCC as soon as possible if they have not done so already.</p>  <p>  The National Childcare Scheme has been in place for almost 22 months, albeit very disrupted months given the Covid-19 crisis. </p>  <p>  My Department has engaged an external consultant to review the first year of the scheme including looking at usage by socio-economically disadvantaged families and providers serving socio-economically disadvantaged communities.</p>  <p>  This review is almost finalised and I will be considering its recommendations with a view to ensuring it meets its policy objectives and supports those most in need in the best evidence informed manner.</p>  <p>  My Department is actively monitoring the issues raised and is committed to ensuring that the scheme functions in the best interests of families and children, that services will be supported in adjusting to this newer more progressive approach to early learning and childcare and that State investment in this sector delivers affordable, accessible, sustainable and high-quality provision.</p>  <p>  In considering matters, I have met with a number of bodies to hear their concerns including within the area mentioned by the Deputies, as have my officials. I continue to be available to hear the issues and consider responses informed by the ongoing reviews.</p>  <p>   With regard to the issue of afterschool interventions in DEIS areas (differentiating from School Aged Childcare funded through subsidies by my Department), all schools in DEIS receive a DEIS Grant. This year the Department of Education allocated in excess of &euro;16m in DEIS Grant funding to 884 schools in the programme. The DEIS Grant should be utilised to attain the targets set in the school&rsquo;s DEIS Action Plan across the DEIS themes. In this regard, financial resources should be targeted at the individual pupils who are considered most at risk and at addressing educational disadvantage through a focused response. </p>  <p>  Some of the DEIS Grant may be used to meet ancillary costs such as heating, lighting and other miscellaneous charges arising from activities such as homework clubs. These costs should be linked to the DEIS themes., eg, the cost of heating and lighting for breakfast/homework clubs operated in order to promote school attendance. However, when considering expenditure of funds from the DEIS grant, schools should look to other agencies and supports to identify if there are any existing schemes or support programmes available and avoid duplication. For example, can the homework club be delivered/supported by the local School Completion Programme or other local community resources.</p>  <p>   The School Completion Programme (SCP) provides programmes and interventions to 689 Primary and post-primary schools, the majority if which are DEIS. SCP projects may provide a range of afterschool supports, which can include homework/afterschool clubs, to children targeted for inclusion in the SCP programme across the 122 SCP projects nationally. The extent of the provision varies across the SCP projects nationally ranging from one to two days per week up to four or five days per week. The provision cannot be considered childcare and in general afterschool activities operate for 1 to 1.5 hours including homework, a snack and some fun activities. In many rural settings due to transport requirements there may be no afterschool provision and activity like this is undertaken at lunchtime. Some SCP projects may target the resource to more individualised afterschool provision.</p></reply>

The most recent available data shows that the number of services notifying their closure to Tusla for the period of Jan-July 2021 is comparable to the same period in 2020 and is less than the number of service closures that occurred in Jan-July 2019. The overall number of service closures each year has remained steady, as has the number of new services registering with Tusla.   <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>ELC Closures </th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th>ELC New Registrations </th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>2021 </td>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>2021 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Jan - July </td>       <td>112 </td>       <td>105 </td>       <td>91 </td>       <td>34 </td>       <td>28 </td>       <td>14 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Full Year </td>       <td>196 </td>       <td>197 </td>       <td>n/a </td>       <td>93 </td>       <td>91 </td>       <td>n/a </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that some early learning and childcare services do face difficulties and that this is sometimes the reason for closures.

This excludes substantial funding provided to support the sector during COVID-19. </p><p>Despite this progress, investment in the area remains low by international standards. </p><p>The <i>First 5</i>Strategy, commits the Government to at least double public spending in early learning and care and school-age childcare by 2028. A key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers optimally for children, families and the State will be the new Funding Model. An Expert Group to develop the new Funding Model was appointed in September 2019, and I expect their report to be finalised in November and look forward to receiving that shortly.  </p><p>Extensive research has been commissioned to inform the work of the Group and has been published.

Insurance premiums for early year providers average &euro;60 per child, per annum.</p><p>Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Aged Childcare (SAC) services are required to have insurance as part of their registration with Tulsa, the independent regulator of the sector.  My Department provides funding to childcare providers under a number of programmes to provide fully or partly subsidised childcare services to families.  Childcare providers are private businesses and my Department does not provide funding for specific operational costs such as insurance.</p><p>With regard to the cost of insurance, it is important to note that neither the Government, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive) which expressly prohibits Member States from doing so.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, insurance reform is a priority for this Government. The <i>Action Plan for Insurance Reform</i>, which was launched on 8 December 2020, contains a range of deliverables in a number of Government Department policy areas. It is intended that the cumulative effect of the implementation of the actions will be to improve the insurance environment, in particular for businesses. I am a member of the Sub-Group for Insurance Reform, chaired by An T&aacute;naiste, which has been set up within the Cabinet Committee for Economic Recovery and Investment to implement these reforms, and will publish progress reports every six months. </p><p>Seeking to secure a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland remains a key policy priority for this Government. In this regard, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to ensure that the implementation of the <i>Action Plan</i>can have a positive impact on the affordability and availability of insurance for individuals, businesses and voluntary groups, including childcare providers.</p></reply>

The Programme is provided for three hours per day, five days per week over 38 weeks per year (i.e. from September to June).</p>  <p>  Following a 7 per cent increase in 2018, the capitation rates for the Programme are &euro;69 per child per week, with a higher capitation rate of &euro;80.25 per child per week where the ECCE programme is provided by a practitioner with a relevant qualification of level 7 or above.  There is a separate payment (Programme Support Payment) towards the cost of administering the Programme.</p>  <p>  An independent review of the cost of providing quality early learning and childcare (ELC) in Ireland, which was undertaken in 2018, estimated an average hourly unit cost of &euro;4.14 for delivering ELC across all services. This compares with hourly capitation rates for the ECCE Programme of &euro;4.60 (standard capitation) and &euro;5.35 (higher capitation).</p>  <p>  While these findings on unit cost suggest current levels of ECCE capitation are sufficient, I am acutely aware that the unit cost can vary across service type and location. The unit cost is also based on pay rates, which are unacceptably low.</p>  <p>  In line with a commitment in First 5 to at least double investment in ELC by 2028, work is underway to develop a new funding model for the ELC sector. This funding model will be the vehicle to ensure additional funding allocated to the sector further reduces out of pocket costs to parents, ensures a range of additional supports can be provided to children from disadvantaged groups, compensate providers so that they can deliver ELC on a sustainable and high-quality basis and attracts and retains a well-qualified workforce. An Expert Group is leading the development of this new funding model and is on track to report in November.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, providers offering the ECCE programme, as with all ELC providers, are currently eligible to receive the employment wage subsidy scheme (EWSS), without having to show a drop in turnover of 30% as is required in other sectors of the economy. My Department has calculated that the EWSS at enhanced rates covers on average 80% of staff costs, or 50% of total operating costs. </p>  <p>  A Covid-19 Impact Support Scheme is also available for ELC providers who require further financial assistance in addition to current financial supports available. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Covid-19 Impact Support Scheme is to support the sustainability of ELC services who may be left with short-term sustainability concerns due to lower attendance or higher costs arising from Covid-19. Funding is provided to successful applicants that have experienced an income/expenditure deficit in respect of the ELC aspect of their business/organisation and do not have sufficient funds in reserve to absorb this deficit. This funding is available on a rolling basis until 31 December 2021. Any service that has concerns about their viability should contact their local City/County Childcare Committees (CCC) for further information on this Scheme.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to reforming the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC) system to create one that brings together the best of community and private childcare provision, is focused on children&rsquo;s rights and quality outcomes, reduces inequalities, supports staff retention, and substantially reduces costs to parents. </p><p>State investment in this sector has increased by an unprecedented 141% since 2015. This funding has been used to extend access and ensure that children can enrol and meaningfully participate in high-quality ELC and SAC. It has, for example, funded a second year of the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) pre-school programme, enabled the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) and the introduction of the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM). </p><p>The ECCE pre-school programme provides for ELC provision for all children in the two years before they begin primary school for fifteen hours per week, entirely free for parents. </p><p>Families may also be entitled to subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme. The NCS represents the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support for ELC and SAC in Ireland. The Scheme aims to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, and tangibly reduce the cost of ELC and SAC for tens of thousands of families.</p><p>The Scheme comprises two types of subsidies:</p><p>- A universal subsidy is payable for children between the ages of 24 weeks and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the ECCE programme if later) who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider. The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level. </p><p>- An income assessed subsidy is payable for children from 24 weeks to 15 years of age who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider. The level of subsidy is determined by the family&rsquo;s assessable income (i.e. gross income minus tax, PRSI and other deductibles and minus any applicable multiple child discount).  </p><p>NCS subsidies are awarded as an hourly rate for a maximum number of hours per week. Parents in work, study or training can avail of up to 45 subsidised hours of childcare per week. Parents not in work, study or training can avail of up to 20 subsidised hours of childcare per week. </p><p>Information on the Scheme can be found at www.ncs.gov.ie and by phoning the Parent Support Centre at 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm. Parents can also contact their local City/County Childcare Committee to learn more about Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare supports available to them. Details about local CCCs can be found at www.myccc.ie.</p><p>Looking to the future, First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, commits to at least doubling investment in ELC and SAC in the decade to 2028. A key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State will be a new funding model. The new funding model will be the framework for additional investment in services in return for clear evidence of quality and affordability to ensure effective use of public funding. </p><p>An Expert Group has been leading the work on developing this new funding model since 2019. The Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in ELC and SAC systems, funding, quality, economics, and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments who will be involved in implementing the new funding model. They have met eighteen times to date and it is expected that their report will be submitted in November 2021. The Expert Group&rsquo;s work is informing the Budget 2022 process.</p><p>The research partner for the funding model project, Frontier Economics, has produced eight working papers, with three that directly address affordability issues including international comparisons of fees and public investment, approaches to funding the early learning and care sector, and mechanisms to control fees charged to parents. </p><p>The Expert Group have agreed a set of draft guiding principles to underpin the new Funding Model, which state that funding should mitigate the cost of ELC and SAC to parents.

The White Paper sets out a new Government policy to establish a new International Protection Support Service which I envision will be fully operational by December 2024. This new system will have human rights at its core and will help to ensure that all applicants are treated with dignity and respect. In the wider context of ending Direct Provision by this date, I have committed to ending the use of emergency accommodation for International Protection applicants by the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  IPAS has been working to this end since early 2020 and has already closed 19 such centres. This is just under half the total in use at one time.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the International Protection Support Service Transition Team of this Department is progressing a detailed implementation plan for the new system and is working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Housing Agency and the Local Authorities on developing the new Accommodation Model and wrap-around services for residents.</p>  <p>  As we transition to the new system, in order to meet our legal obligations to provide accommodation and other support services for protection applicants, existing accommodation centres will continue to operate in the short to medium term; as such my Department currently utilises a mixture of state owned, commercial and temporary emergency accommodation centres. </p>  <p>  As for the concerns expressed in the correspondence regarding the welfare of applicants in the current system, there is a clear graduated complaints procedure set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection applicants.  Complaints are made initially to the centre manager with a view to informal resolution. If the resident concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, they may make a complaint to IPAS who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate. In the event that a resident remains dissatisfied with how their complaint is dealt with, they have full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.?</p>  <p>  To provide further support to all residents, a confidential Freephone telephone support service exists. The Freephone helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS). A complaint made to the JRS may be resolved without any IPAS intervention through mediation between the JRS team, the resident and whatever service their complaint relates to.  Should a resident desire,  a complaint made through this service may also be passed, in confidence, back to IPAS for investigation and resolution. </p>  <p>  In addition to the existing complaints mechanisms available to residents, two new specialist teams were established in IPAS earlier this year to provide a greater focus on the individual needs of residents.  </p>  <p>  A new dedicated IPAS Customer Services Team is working to strengthen the existing resident complaints system and take a more proactive approach to dealing with residents' issues, actively engaging with residents through regular resident feedback clinics.  As well this increased engagement in person with residents at centres throughout the State the Customer Services Team team will also be exploring the use of other feedback mechanisms such as customer focus groups in the months ahead.  </p>  <p>  The IPAS Resident Welfare Team is a new multi-disciplinary team which focuses on residents with more complex issues including those with physical and mental health issues and persons identified through the IPAS Vulnerability Assessment Process as having special reception needs.  This team is supported by  officials from Tusla, the HSE's Social Inclusion Team and the Department of Education.   Additional Social Workers are currently being recruited to provide further support to the team.   </p>  <p>  I trust that this information is of assistance to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The degree of support provided through AIM depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school service. </p>  <p>  AIM has seven levels of progressive support, moving from universal supports (levels 1-3) to targeted supports (levels 4-7), based on the needs of the child and the pre-school setting they are attending. </p>  <p>  Universal supports (Levels 1-3):</p>  <p>  - Level 1, which aims to embed an inclusive culture in services, includes the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of the Leadership for Inclusion (LINC) training programme, the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator (INCO) roles in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation of &euro;2 per registered ECCE child for services with qualified Inclusion Co-ordinators.</p>  <p>  - Level 2 involves provision of information for parents and providers on AIM, through the AIM.gov.ie website, and information provided by County/City Childcare Committees.</p>  <p>  - Level 3 recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children participating in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).</p>  <p>  Targeted supports (Levels 4-7):</p>  <p>  - Level 4 addresses the needs of early learning and care practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early learning and care (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs.</p>  <p>  - Level 5 recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or that some early learning and care settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some minor capital building works.</p>  <p>  - Level 6 provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable a child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE programme.</p>  <p>  - Level 7: Additional assistance in the pre-school room involves additional capitation for service providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports at Level 1-6  have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. Funding can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or reduce the staff/child ratio, supporting the pre-school leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.</p>  <p>  In total, 17,316 children in 3,786 services have benefitted from targeted AIM supports since AIM began in 2016.  </p>  <p>  For the 2021/22 programme year, 2,377 initial applications for Level 7 support were received by the end of August. This is the largest number of applications received by the end of August since AIM began operating in 2016. It represents a 69% increase on the number of applications received at the same point in time in 2020, and a 16% increase on the number of applications received at the end of August 2019 for the 2019/20 programme year.  </p>  <p>  By the end of August 2021, 159 applications for Level 5 support had been received (142 equipment and 17 alterations), which is 47% higher than the number received at this time last year and is 137% higher than the number received at the same time of year in 2019.</p>  <p>  An evaluation of the AIM programme is currently underway, with the final report due to be published in early 2022. The evaluation of AIM builds on an earlier End of Year One Review of AIM and an interim evaluation of the LINC programme.</p></reply>

A further period of 16 weeks maternity leave may also be taken but there is no associated benefit. </p><p>The Parent&rsquo;s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 introduced two weeks paid parents leave for each parent, and this year I have, through the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021, extended the entitlement to five weeks of leave for each relevant parent, to be taken in the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a child. The definition of relevant parent under the Act includes a parent of the child and the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a parent of the child.</p><p>  The intention of parent&rsquo;s leave is to enable parents to spend time with their child in the earliest years and is deliberately non-transferable between parents to ensure that both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to spend time with their child.  This is further supported through the provision of Parent&rsquo;s Benefit, which is paid at an equivalent rate to maternity, paternity and adoptive benefits at &euro;245 per week.  Taken together, these forms of family leave should support parents of very young children.</p></reply>

Tusla, through its Early Years Inspectorate, is the independent statutory regulator of early years services in Ireland, with the responsibility for regulating and inspecting these registered services to ensure compliance with the requirements of the legislation. The purpose of inspection is to ensure the health, safety and welfare of children, and the promotion of their development, as well as to ensure compliance with the relevant statutory requirements by registered service providers operating early years services.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been in contact with colleagues in Tusla, who have provided the following information in relation to their inspection programme:</p>  <p>  Early years service inspections take place under an inspection programme carried out by the Early Years Inspectorate, with each service receiving at least one inspection in a three-year registration cycle. Many services, however, are inspected more frequently, with services prioritised based on the size and type of service, the age-profile of the children attending, and the history of regulatory compliance. The frequency of inspections is increased where the Inspectorate may have concerns regarding a specific service, necessitating greater oversight, such as a persistent and consistent history of regulatory non-compliance. The Inspectorate may also carry out immediate or multiple inspections of services as necessary on receipt of feedback or concerns, or where a service has been escalated for regulatory enforcement action. Likewise, where the Inspectorate is satisfied that a service has strong internal control mechanisms and can evidence compliance with regulation, then the inspection frequency may be reduced.</p>  <p>  In addition to this programme, the Inspectorate also carries out a separate programme of Fit for Purpose Inspections. Fit for Purpose Inspections take place prior to opening the service as part of the assessment of applications to register a new early years service, or where an existing registered provider applies to make a change to their current registration status, such as a change of service provision, a change in the number of children catered for, or change of address. The purpose of these Fit for Purpose Inspections is to determine the suitability of the premises and the proposed service provision in line with the relevant statutory requirements.</p>  <p>   Completed inspection reports are available on the Tusla website at www.tusla.ie/services/preschool-services/creche-inspection-reports/</p></reply>

An online survey was disseminated to a range of stakeholders, seeking public view of topics and proposals contained within the new scheme. </p><p>Many respondents felt positive about the proposals in relation to the Scheme, however a number of concerns and strong recommendations emerged.  In particular, childcare providers and advocacy organisations focused on issues of administration, quality and sustainability, whereas parents focused on fairness and equality. The affordability of childcare remained a central concern for all stakeholders. These concerns paved the way for the aims and objectives of the NCS policy guidelines, as follows:  </p><p>- Ensuring that access to affordable childcare is not a barrier to labour market participation, including female labour market participation; </p><p>- Promoting positive child outcomes; </p><p>- Narrowing the gap in attainment between more and less advantaged children by enabling <i>all </i>children to access high quality, affordable childcare; </p><p>- Driving quality across the sector; </p><p>- Through the above objectives, contributing to poverty reduction in Ireland; and </p><p>- Providing a sound and flexible platform for sustainable future investment.</p><p>Over the last 9 months my Department has conducted a number of stakeholder consultations to gain further insights into their experience of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). The stakeholder consultations were established to provide services with the opportunity to engage in a structured consultation and discussion process, identifying any concerns and opportunities to further support the operation and development of the NCS.</p><p>As part of the statutory 12 Month Review of the NCS, surveys were rolled out to service providers and parents so that their experiences of using the NCS could be gathered and understood. A considerable response was received and the responses have been examined by the consultant contracted to undertake the 12 Month Review of the NCS. A number of stakeholder interviews were also conducted by the consultant across service provider organisations and representative bodies. </p><p>This is informing the review which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. I will then consider the findings of the review including the views of stakeholders therein and consider what, if any, reforms are required. </p><p>Given the multi-faceted and wide-ranging engagements, I am confident that all representatives from the sector have had an opportunity to engage with process prior to and since the launch of the NCS.</p></reply>

As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the scheme is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants. </p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. </p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. </p>  <p>  However, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. </p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances would clearly include no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.</p>  <p>  An applicant can request a review by contacting the SUSI Support Desk at 0761 087 874 or emailing support@susi.ie. </p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.  For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19. I am confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.</p>  <p>  Any student who believes his/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p></reply>

Publically funded Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The level of registration fees and tuition fees to be charged are therefore a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria.</p>  <p>  In considering fees, it is important to note that the State currently provides very substantial financial support to undergraduate students in higher education towards the cost of their studies. </p>  <p>  Under the Department&rsquo;s Free Fees Initiative (FFI), the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate higher education students. All students eligible for the scheme receive state support whereby the Exchequer pays the cost of tuition fees exclusive of the student contribution.  Any proposal to increase EU undergraduate tuition fees rates of eligible courses and charged to eligible students would have a budgetary impact on the exchequer and such an increase would require prior agreement between the sector, HEA, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In this regard no such request for an increase was submitted, considered or approved for 2020/2021 and the last agreed increase was in 2008/2009.</p>  <p>  In 2020/21 the Exchequer currently contributed over &euro;357m to meeting the tuition fee costs of 146,000 eligible undergraduate students in higher education. In addition, over 65,000 students have all or part of the &euro;3,000 student contribution paid on their behalf under the Student Grant Scheme at a cost of over &euro;190m. This substantial funding support has played a very important role in enabling access to and growth in higher education in Ireland. </p>  <p>  I am very much aware of the difficulties facing students and in July I secured Government approval for &euro;105 million for the third level sector to safely reopen in September 2021. The package will include financial support for further and higher education to return on-site safely and in line with public health advice, and additional student supports for students in further and higher education.</p>  <p>  &euro;21 million of this funding will be allocated to provide specific extra supports for students including an extra &euro;3m for student mental health, an extra &euro;10m for the Student Assistance Fund which provides financial supports to students experiencing financial difficulties while in college, and &euro;8m for the Mitigating Educational Disadvantage Fund which supports and engages disadvantaged learners. </p>  <p>  In general there is a real requirement in these exceptional times to have a responsive approach to student needs wherever possible and it is important to acknowledge that HEIs have to date shown enormous willingness to be responsive in numerous ways. I would encourage all students to engage with their institution to discuss any issues in relation to their course, including fees.</p>  <p>  The main support available to assist students with the cost of attending higher education is the Student Grant Scheme. Students can check eligibility and apply for grant supports on www.susi.ie. The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments I gave approval to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. My Department is overseeing the implementation of the review. It is anticipated that the review will be completed later this year and will inform future priorities regarding the development of student grant policy.</p></reply>

The CAO process applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the HEIs. Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. Neither I nor my Department have a role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, the Leaving Certificate results in any given year have the same status as any other Leaving Certificate as a measure of attainment at the end of Senior Cycle. To alter or revise the results of any particular Leaving Certificate cohort after the fact would undermine this principle.</p>  <p>  It is our understanding that  adjustments will be made to the 2022 Leaving Certificate examinations which are similar to those published in December 2020 in respect of Leaving Certificate 2021. The adjustments are outlined in Assessment Arrangements for Junior and Leaving Certificate 2022, which is available on www.gov.ie/leavingcertificate. These adjustments were made in recognition of fact students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022 have experienced a degree of disruption to their learning.</p>  <p>  In 2020 and 2021, in recognition of the challenging circumstances these cohorts faced during their Leaving Certificate year, my Department worked with the HEA and the Higher Education Institutions to identify where additional places could be provided in the higher education system. It is my intention that future growth in higher education is planned on a strategic basis that aligns demand for places and the provision of places in an efficient and effective manner consistent with the objectives of the Higher Education Strategy, while reflecting broad skills and human capital requirements for the economy and for society.</p></reply>

The higher education institutions will then do their best to accommodate applicants with offers on Round Two. A portion of the offers that are issued in Round Two every year are to applicants who need to be accommodated after adjustments have been made due to applicant omissions or errors, or administrative errors caused by the higher education institutions or CAO.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that it can be quite upsetting for an applicant to realise their examination information was incorrect, and it is my understanding that every effort is made by CAO and the higher education institutions to facilitate such applicants in Round Two.</p>  <p>  If the issue is not resolved the applicant&rsquo;s satisfaction, the option to appeal is available. The CAO has an Independent Appeals Commission, to which recourse may be had by applicants who believe that they have been treated unfairly by CAO, and whose complaints have not been resolved by CAO. The function of the Appeals Commission is to ensure that the rules are applied fairly.</p></reply>

The CAO process applications for undergraduate courses on behalf of the HEIs. Decisions on admissions are made by the HEIs who then instruct the CAO to make offers to successful candidates. Neither I nor my Department have a role in the operation of the CAO.</p>  <p>  The CAO system is a system that works on the assumption that grades obtained in the Leaving Certificate by candidates determine their points. It is on this basis that the CAO system allocates places to applicants including those from different years. To ensure impartiality, the automatic CAO points systems have been created in a way that does not allow for different treatment to be applied to different sub-groups. </p>  <p>  In recognition of the particular circumstances faced by students this year, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science worked with the HEA and the Higher Education Institutions to identify where additional places could be provided in the higher education system. As a result of this, together with the additional places created under the Human Capital Initiative, 4,650 places have been created across a wide range of courses which ensured that more students than ever before could be offered a place in a third level course.</p>  <p>  Nonetheless there were fluctuations in CAO points this year, as there are every year. As this year saw a stronger than usual set of grades, and a record number of applications, there was more volatility this year than there would be in a typical year.</p>  <p>  I know how difficult a time it has been for students and parents, and we appreciate how disappointing it can be not to receive an offer for your course of choice, but we would like to stress the range of options available both in further education and training and apprenticeships, but also in pathways in higher education. For those whose route into higher education may not be what they originally planned, there are many pathways available in the further and higher education system. For primary teaching, those who are not successful in gaining place on an undergraduate Bachelor of Education may apply for a Professional Master of Education (PME) course on completion of a level 8 undergraduate degree. </p></reply>

Otherwise he or she would continue to be assessed on the basis of parental income.</p>  <p>  Only in exceptional cases, where compelling evidence of estrangement from parents/guardians is provided, can candidates who are under 23 be assessed without reference to their parents/guardians income or address. Otherwise he or she will be assessed as a dependent student for student grant purposes i.e. assessed on the basis of the income and address of parents/legal guardians. </p>  <p>  The assessment of a case of estrangement is carefully considered to ensure there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the exceptional circumstances pertaining in such cases genuinely exists.  The scheme does not stipulate precisely how an awarding authority satisfies itself that such circumstances prevail. This is to allow the awarding authority sufficient flexibility to assess the evidence of irrevocable estrangement in each individual case. The type of documentary evidence required is dependent on the applicant's individual circumstances. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments I gave approval to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  My Department is overseeing the implementation of the review. A Steering Committee has been established to provide direction for the external consultants undertaking the review. Its membership includes: the Union of Students of Ireland; Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), SOLAS, the HEA; Irish University Association (IUA); Technological Higher Education Association (THEA); Technological University Dublin (TUD), the Department of Social Protection and officials from my Department. </p>  <p>  A public consultation process closed in April with over 280 submissions received. The views of students were sought via an online survey process in May and over 9,000 survey responses were received. The consultants appointed to conduct the review are carrying out their analysis of the data captured in the surveys. While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review, It is anticipated that it will be completed later this year and will inform future priorities regarding the development of student grant policy, including in the context of forthcoming Estimates process for 2022.  </p></reply>

In particular PhD students, in addition to conducting research, participate in other activities to develop generic and transferable skills. These activities are regarded as an integral part of the training, and typically include a teaching contribution. Development of these skills is important in equipping postgraduate students for their future careers, including for academic positions. </p><p>A range of activities can be included under the teaching contribution, such as taking tutorial groups, demonstrating at practical classes, co-supervising undergraduate projects and student mentoring. Hours may be included that are spent in class preparation, advising, monitoring student projects, and correcting projects, notebooks or essays and will vary according to School/Discipline. PhD students may contribute to teaching, often at a level of up to 120-150 hours per year over the course of their studies. </p><p>While contributing to teaching can be an integral part of the training of a research Master&rsquo;s or PhD student, the core component of research programmes across all higher education institutions is the advancement of knowledge through original research, which must remain the primary focus of the activity of research students.<b></b></p><p>The delivery of teaching duties by graduate students in a higher education institution is a matter for the institution concerned reflecting their independent self-governed status.  It is important that the allocation and conduct of such work is undertaken in accordance with the objectives of the National Framework for Doctoral Education and the PhD Graduate Skills Statement in enabling the development of key skills and competencies for postgraduate students. </p><p>In the academic year 2020/21, there were some 7,938 full time PhD students enrolled. There were also 1,352 full time Research Masters students enrolled. In total, there were 30,059 full time postgraduate students enrolled in the academic year 2020-2021. In addition, there are also part-time students enrolled in these categories.</p><p>In relation to PhD students, a number would be in receipt of grants from research funders, a number would be receiving institutional or other scholarships, while others would be self-funded.

The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. However, once an equivalent period of study has been completed on the new course, the student may be eligible for student grant assistance for the remainder of the course. </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, under Article 15(8) of the Student Grant Scheme 2021, the awarding authority (SUSI) has discretion to award a grant for a repeat period of study in exceptional circumstances in line with guidelines drawn up by the Minister. Chapter 1 of the Guidelines refer to exceptional circumstances that may arise which could impact on a student completing a particular period of study or undertaking exams. It is necessary, therefore, for the awarding authority to treat each application for repeat funding on a case-by-case basis.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that students who opted to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations in November 2020 who received an improved CAO offer on foot of these results also received a deferred college offer to start their course in the 2021/22 academic year. If a candidate who has commenced first year of a course becomes entitled to a higher CAO offer and chooses to accept same in the following academic year, attendance for the first year on the new course would remain eligible for free fees and SUSI funding as appropriate.</p>  <p>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need may apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the college attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis. </p>  <p>  Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries. Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

Registration fees and postgraduate tuition fees are payable to Higher Education Institutions. </p>  <p>  Higher Education Institutions are autonomous bodies and are responsible for their own day-to-day management and operational affairs, including the management of academic affairs. They retain the right to determine their own policies and procedures. The level of registration fees and postgraduate tuition fees to be charged are therefore solely a matter for the relevant institution to determine in line with its own criteria. My Department is therefore not in a position to provide an estimated cost for removal of such fees by the sector.</p>  <p>  The main support available to assist postgraduate students with the cost of attending higher education is the Student Grant Scheme. Students can check eligibility and apply for grant supports on www.susi.ie. </p>  <p>  This year&rsquo;s scheme includes enhanced supports for postgraduate students which I secured in Budget 2021. This is an initial step in meeting part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments regarding SUSI grant support. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates and postgraduate grant supports. On foot of these commitments I gave approval to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme. My Department is overseeing the implementation of the review. It is anticipated that the review will be completed later this year and will inform future priorities regarding the development of student grant policy.</p></reply>

They comprise of a standard seven phase programme of alternating on-the-job and off-the-job phases.  The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities. Given the practical nature of off-the-job training for craft apprentices, the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 had a significant impact on the ability of craft apprentices to progress through their course. </p>  <p>  In addition to the general activity surrounding a return to on-site learning across the further and higher education sector a number of specific actions were put in place to support craft apprentices to progress in their training in a timely manner:- </p>  <p>  - Craft apprentice off-the-job training was prioritised for a return to on-site learning across further and higher education institutions as COVID restrictions allowed.  </p>  <p>  - Delivery of off-the-job phases continued over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach assisted institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.  </p>  <p>  - &euro;20m in capital funding has been provided to increase training capacity in the system with SOLAS and HEA allocating this to ETBs and HEIs. This will facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places, assisting significantly with the immediate backlog issues but also more broadly increase training capacity in the apprenticeship system as the sector caters for higher demand. </p>  <p>  - An additional &euro;12 million was allocated for 2021 to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures at higher education level (Phases 4 and 6). </p>  <p>  - A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the coming period by SOLAS and further and higher education providers is in delivery. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time.</p>  <p>  - Phase 2 apprentice commence off-the-job training throughout the year. SOLAS are engaging with the ETBs to maximise and expand provision to clear the waiting lists for phase 2 training.</p>  <p>  - Phase 4 and 6 intakes are currently scheduled three time per year &ndash; September, January and April.  Additional capacity coming on stream at phase 4 and 6 from September has resulted with in the region of 2,500 phase 4 and 6 apprentices scheduled to commence off-the-job training in September, up from 2,100 per intake immediately pre-COVID. </p>  <p>  - In the event that Phase 4 and 6 are prevented from returning at full capacity, a number of alternatives remain available to ensure that craft apprentices are not precluded from qualifying in a timely manner, including the potential for competency assessments to allow apprentices to qualify.  Any such measure would need to safeguard the integrity of the Craft Certificate qualification.</p>  <p>  The SOLAS apprenticeship scheduling management system aims to call apprentices for their off-the-job training on a longest waiting basis on the day of scheduling. There is no facility to prioritise apprentices based on age, or any other factor.</p>  <p>  Further updates will be published over the coming weeks on www.apprenticeship.ie.</p></reply>

Section 40 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 provides that where offences involving physical or sexual violence are committed in the context of a marriage, civil partnership or an intimate and committed relationship, that fact shall be an aggravating factor at sentencing. This sentencing provision applies to any offence that involves violence or the threat of violence to a person. </p><p>While presumptive mandatory minimum sentences are provided for in respect of certain offences, the Law Reform Commission (2013) and the Strategic Review of Penal Policy (2014) studied their use and recommended against their continued use. The reports raised concerns about the effectiveness of such sentencing regimes in reducing crime as well as their proportionality and fairness.  </p><p>It may interest the deputy to know that officials in my Department are currently working on the repeal of all criminal penalties involving mandatory minimum sentences for <i>second or subsequent offences </i>via the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2021.</p><p>This is being done on foot of a Supreme Court ruling (Ellis v the Minister for Justice) that provision involving a mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences in the Firearms Act 1964 was unconstitutional. The mandatory minimum sentence applied in cases in which the convicted person was before the court for a second firearms offence, or had previously been convicted of another similar firearms offence. </p><p>The Supreme Court held that the provision impermissibly encroached on the judiciary&rsquo;s role to administer justice in individual cases under Article 34.1 of the Constitution, and breached the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.  The Court noted that the penalty discriminated between different categories of persons (those who may not have committed an offence previously and those that have done so) and therefore was an interference by the legislature with the administration of justice, a function reserved to the Judiciary.  </p><p>As such, my Department is proposing to repeal provisions which provide for mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences from legislation on firearms / explosives, misuse of drugs, receiving stolen goods, illicit distillation / liquor licensing, false imprisonment, threats of harm, organised crime and blackmail / extortion. </p><p>While the distinction here - that all of these provisions relate to mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequent offences, as opposed to mandatory minimum sentences in general - is a real and important one, in the Ellis case, the Supreme Court made a general point that sentencing always involves a consideration of the following factors by the Judiciary:</p> <blockquote> 	- the gravity of the offence,<br /><br />- circumstances in which it was committed,<br /><br />- the personal situation of the accused, and<br /><br />- mitigating factors.   </blockquote></reply>

There is also a constitutional presumption in favour of the granting of bail as, under Irish Law, a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The Criminal Justice Act 2017 strengthens the operation of the bail system with the aim of making the law as effective as possible in protecting the public against crimes committed by persons on bail.</p><p>Under the Act, the Court is required to have regard to persistent serious offending by an applicant for bail and the nature and seriousness of any danger presented by the granting of bail to a person charged with an offence that carries a penalty of 10 years&rsquo; imprisonment or more.  The Court also has the power, in certain cases, to hear evidence from the victim of an offence before a decision on bail is taken. Where an accused person is granted bail, the Act provides for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, including the use of curfews and strengthens Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy has been sought from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). The tables attached provided by the CSO details the number of crime incidents recorded on PULSE where at least one suspected offender is recorded as having been on bail at the time of the offence. The tables do not provide any information on the number of crime recorded incidents which subsequently led to a prosecution or which following prosecution resulted in conviction.</p><p>It is important to note that the CSO classifies these figures as under reservation. This categorisation indicates that the quality of these statistics do not meet the standards required of official statistics published by CSO. More information in this regard can be found on the website of the CSO at www.cso.ie/en/methods/crime/statisticsunderreservationfaqs/.</p><p>The way in which suspected offenders were recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na changed in early 2018.  This is the reason that years 2018 to 2020 are presented in separate tables.</p><p>As such, the 'before' and 'after' are not directly comparable and these figures may increase over time as more investigations reach conclusion.</p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="3"><div><b>Recorded crime incidents (where at least one suspected offender recorded as being on bail), 2016 to 2017</b></div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td colspan="3"><b>By type of offence committed.</b></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>Incident Type</b></td>       <td><b>2016</b></td>       <td><b>2017</b></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>01 Homicide Offences</b></td>       <td>8</td>       <td>6</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>02 Sexual Offences</b></td>       <td>23</td>       <td>36</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>03 Attempts/Threats to Murder, assaults, harassments and related offences</b></td>       <td>756</td>       <td>945</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>04 Dangerous or Negligent Acts</b></td>       <td>430</td>       <td>503</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>05 Kidnapping and Related Offences</b></td>       <td>8</td>       <td>13</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>06 Robbery,  Extortion and Hijacking Offences</b></td>       <td>323</td>       <td>370</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>07 Burglary and Related Offences</b></td>       <td>1346</td>       <td>1415</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>08 Theft and Related Offences</b></td>       <td>5998</td>       <td>7085</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>09 Fraud, deception and Related Offences</b></td>       <td>242</td>       <td>284</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>10 Controlled Drug Offences</b></td>       <td>1983</td>       <td>2024</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>11 Weapons and Explosives Offences</b></td>       <td>441</td>       <td>465</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>12 Damage to Property and to the Environment</b></td>       <td>868</td>       <td>862</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>13 Public Order and other Social Code Offences</b></td>       <td>4260</td>       <td>5168</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><b>15 Offences against Government, Justice Procedures and Organisation of Crime</b></td>       <td>8811</td>       <td>9515</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td></td>       <td></td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td colspan="3">These statistics are categorised as Under Reservation.

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal aid themselves.  The 1962 Act specifies that the court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid. </p><p>The provision of criminal legal aid in circumstances where a person is unable to fund their own criminal defence has been established as a Constitutional right in Irish law. There is no limit to the number of times that a person can be granted legal aid under the Scheme.  Whether or not an applicant has received legal aid previously and / or has previous convictions is not considered in determining eligibility for legal aid.</p><p>It is not possible to provide the data on the cost of legal aid by county as the system is largely paper based and figures are not kept in such a manner that this data can be retrieved. As legal aid data is also not captured by offender neither is it possible to provide data on the costs per offender. </p><p>The costs for the main Criminal Legal Aid Scheme for each of the years 2016 to 2021 (to end August) was as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year</th>       <th>Expenditure</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2016</td>       <td>&euro;52.9   million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017</td>       <td>&euro;58.1   million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018</td>       <td>&euro;64.8   million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019</td>       <td>&euro;65.1   million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020</td>       <td>&euro;62.2   million</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (to end August)</td>       <td>&euro;46.0   million</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Payments to legal practitioners for the period 2016 &ndash; 2020 are as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Solicitors</td>       <td>29.3M</td>       <td>32.2M</td>       <td>32.8M</td>       <td>34.4M</td>       <td>34.2M</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Counsel</td>       <td>19.8M</td>       <td>21.5M</td>       <td>24.4M</td>       <td>23.1M</td>       <td>23.3M</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for this Government. Over the past year we have introduced significant measures to combat trafficking, to create a more victim-centred approach to identifying and supporting victims, and to raise awareness and provide training.</p><p>While it was very disappointing that the US State Department did not acknowledge the significant progress made by Ireland over the past 12 months as sufficient to upgrade our ranking in the latest &lsquo;Trafficking in Persons&rsquo; Report, I am confident that the work we are doing should be reflected in the next TiPs report and that Ireland&rsquo;s ranking should be upgraded accordingly.</p><p>I note that a number of key areas identified in the latest TiPs Report reflect the ongoing work that is, in some cases, already well-advanced, including:</p> <blockquote> 	- The recent approval by Government to revise the National Referral Mechanism to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, be identified and access advice, accommodation and support;<br /><br />- The drafting of a new National Action Plan on Human Trafficking<br /><br />- The development of training, through NGOs, targeting front line staff in industries such as hospitality, airline and shipping who may come into contact with trafficked persons;<br /><br />- The work being undertaken to provide dedicated accommodation for female victims of sexual exploitation;<br /><br />- The improvements being made to the Criminal Justice System to support victims through the implementation of <i>Supporting a Victim's Journey</i>;<br /><br />- The running of a new awareness raising campaign in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to build on the success of previous campaigns:<br /><br />- An increase in funding for supporting victims of crime generally and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking. </blockquote>  <p>In addition to highlighting the ongoing work underway to combat human trafficking  and support those who are victims of it, I think it is also important to highlight the significance of the recent convictions for human trafficking handed down by the Courts and to acknowledge the dedication of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating and tackling this hideous crime.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Ireland. A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been in place since 2009 to conduct investigations into human trafficking. It also provides advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level.

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria attendant to naturalisation, including the residency requirement,  can only be made after an application is received. </p>  <p>  Minister Humphreys and I recently announced a final temporary extension of immigration and international protection permissions to 15 January 2022. This extension of permission will allow adequate time for everyone, who is covered by this final temporary extension,  to either register or renew their permission, where that permission can be renewed, by 15 January 2022 to ensure that they have a qualifying permission to remain in the State after that date. </p>  <p>This final extension of immigration permissions provides that people who held a valid permission to be in the State in March 2020 are legally permitted to remain until 15 January 2022, even if their Irish Residence Permit (IRP) card has expired and they are awaiting a new one. All the other terms and conditions of the immigration permission remain the same.</p>  <p>  Therefore, where a person held an in date immigration permission on 20 March 2020, that was reckonable for the purpose of making an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation, and has relied on the eight emergency extensions of permissions to remain in the State, and there are no reasons why that permission should not be renewed, then the period of extension from the 20 March 2020 to 15 January 2022 will be considered reckonable and meeting the criteria when submitting an application for a Certificate of Naturalisation.</p></reply>

Prior to this, the three strands were examined sequentially and this could lead to long delays in obtaining a final decision.</p><p>My Department is committed to implementing the key recommendations in the Expert Advisory Group Report to reduce processing times of both first instance decisions and appeals to 6 months respectively, as outlined in the White Paper to End Direct Provision and Establish a New International Protection Support Service. </p><p>The White Paper proposes that the new system should be phased in and operational by 2024 and that the intervening period should provide an opportunity to progress improvements in the overall processing times for international protection. </p><p>Work is under way in my Department towards identifying mechanisms which will assist with this. For example, additional ICT resources have been secured for this year, and detailed practical work, including the end-to-end review of relevant international protection processes by a multi-disciplinary team from within my Department, has now been completed. </p><p>My Department's main focus now is to get its processing system functioning as effectively and efficiently as possible, while adhering to all measures in place to combat the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>A number of initiatives have already been introduced, including the relocation of the Ministerial Decisions Unit to the International Protection Office (IPO) premises to improve work processes; the designation of the International Protection Appeals Tribunal as a body authorised to hold remote hearings; and the holding of virtual interviews with some applicants living outside of Dublin by the IPO, which resumed on 10 May. </p><p>The IPO has also put in place a range of measures to improve efficiencies across a number of work streams, such as improved processes, implementation of non-cooperation measures, and initiatives to speed up the return of completed questionnaires from applicants. A new, shorter and more user-friendly questionnaire is being used since 28 June and the IPO has also agreed a new prioritisation schedule with UNHCR that is effective from 14 June. </p><p>My Department will, by October 2022 at the latest, commence a review of progress made in reducing and improving processing times and based on the outcome of that review, decide by the end of 2022, whether additional measures are required in order to ensure that the new system can come into operation without the overhang of any significant number of legacy cases.</p><p>As requested by the Deputy the table below sets out the total number of applications for asylum / international protection between the years 2001 to date.  <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year of Application </b></th>       <th><b>No. of Applications for Asylum 2001 - 2016 </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2001 </div></td>       <td><div>10,325 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2002 </div></td>       <td><div>11,364 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2003 </div></td>       <td><div>7,900 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2004 </div></td>       <td><div>4,766 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2005 </div></td>       <td><div>4,323 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2006 </div></td>       <td><div>4,314 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2007 </div></td>       <td><div>3,985 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2008 </div></td>       <td><div>3,866 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2009 </div></td>       <td><div>2,689 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2010 </div></td>       <td><div>1,939 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2011 </div></td>       <td><div>1,290 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2012 </div></td>       <td><div>956 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2013 </div></td>       <td><div>946 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2014 </div></td>       <td><div>1,448 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2015 </div></td>       <td><div>3,276 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td><div>2016 </div></td>       <td><div>2,244 </div></td>    </tr> </table> <div></div> <table>    <tr>       <th><b>Year of Application </b></th>       <th><b>No. of Applications for International Protection 2017- 2021* (end August &ndash; Provisional) </b></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 </td>       <td><div>2,920 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 </td>       <td><div>3,674 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td><div>4,781 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td><div>1,566 </div></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021* </td>       <td><div>1,148 </div></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The tables below set out the number of negative decisions for each of those years in which all avenues of appeal were exhausted.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-09-21a.1336.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092100081#WRV06800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 493 and 494 together.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  </p>  <p>  I am deeply conscious of how important the granting of naturalisation is to those who apply for it and my Department has continued to accept and process citizenship applications throughout the pandemic and at all levels of public health restrictions.  However, processing rates have been negatively impacted by the necessary health and safety related restrictions imposed and it has not been possible to hold in-person citizenship ceremonies since March 2020. </p>  <p>  This has further exacerbated significant delays which arose from a High Court case in 2019, which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal.  Unfortunately that resulted in the loss of over six months&rsquo; processing time, before the appeal resolved the issue.</p>  <p>  This accumulated delay in 2019 combined with the impact of the pandemic since March 2020 means that, regrettably, there are just over 22,210 applications currently on hand. These applications are at various stages of processing, ranging from those just received to those where a decision has been made and are "ceremony ready". </p>  <p>  To deal with applicants that were in the final stages of processing, on 18 January 2021, my Department opened a temporary system to enable applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty.  Since then, my Department has delivered on its commitment to communicate with 6,500 applicants by the end of June, inviting them to complete the final steps required prior to the granting of a certificate of naturalisation. </p>  <p>  As of 15 September 2021, 6,167 certificates of naturalisation have been issued so far this year. A further 1,000 people have paid the statutory fee and will receive their certificates in the coming weeks. </p>  <p>  Since the beginning of this week, the staff of the Citizenship Division of my Department have returned to the office on a new attendance pattern that will see a gain of approximately 500 production hours per week due to increased footfall on-site. To further address the volume of applications on hand, additional staff are being assigned to the citizenship team; and a number of digitisation measures have been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. </p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. Based on this, my objective is to achieve an improved decision making timeframe of 6-9 months for a majority of applications during 2022. </p></reply>

This new Strategy is being co-designed in partnership with the sector. It will be the most ambitious strategy to date and will radically improve services and supports for victims. The strategy is on track to be developed by my Department in consultation with all relevant Departments and stakeholders with a view to it coming to Government for approval before the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  The Department of Justice has partnered with Safe Ireland and the National Women&rsquo;s Council (NWCI) to provide expert support in developing the new strategy. Among other actions, this includes expert advice on moving to an outcome-focussed framework, the development of a prevention focused strategy, and support for wider public involvement in the consultation phase.  </p>  <p>  The process is being supported by external research consultants who are working on a number of different elements including a review of the second national strategy, identifying the major issues to be addressed and coordinating public input into the new strategy. The public input to date has included - </p>  <p>  -  Five geographically focused workshops and 12 thematic workshops (addressing intersectionality and thematic sessions) attended by more than 100 individuals, and</p>  <p>  -  An online survey which attracted 109 responses, of which 87 were eligible.  77% of respondents were either victims/survivors of DSGBV or family and/or friends of victims/survivors.</p>  <p>  Analysis of the feedback at these events is currently being examined. </p>  <p>  Interviews with senior decision makers in relevant Departments and agencies have also been undertaken with a view to exploring potential co-design action areas for implementation. </p>  <p>  In line with the cross Government approach being taken in developing this strategy, Minister Humphreys and I recently wrote to all Ministers asking how they can contribute to the strategy. We will also be asking the same of all of the relevant agencies in the justice sector, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service. </p>  <p>  It is my intention to have a draft strategy ready for a further round of public consultation in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

During the same period, my Department granted a total of 47 visas to Afghan nationals. </p>  <p>  From 1 May to 15 September 2021, my Department granted 170 visas to Afghan nationals, including 19 that were granted on appeal. </p>  <p>  Visa applications for Afghan family members of Irish citizens and Afghan nationals living in Ireland are being assessed speedily and sympathetically.

These are being prioritised, with full consideration given to the current humanitarian context. To date this year, family reunification permission has been granted to 106 Afghan family members under the terms of the International Protection Act 2015.</p>  <p>  The Government announced that a number of places would be allocated to Afghan nationals as &lsquo;programme refugees&rsquo; under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP). The Department of Children, Equality, Integration, Disability and Youth (DCEIDY) has overall responsibility for the IRPP, with practical support provided by my Department by way of issuing visas to facilitate travel to Ireland.  Priority has been given to those working on human rights issues, including the rights of women and girls and minorities, as well as those working with NGOs and European and international organisations. As of 19 September 2021, my Department has issued 368 visas or visa letters in lieu to this cohort on a humanitarian basis.</p></reply>

The NPHET&rsquo;s advice remains that those who are not fully vaccinated should avoid congregated indoor settings for their own and others safety.</p><p>For this reason, current Government policy, based on the advice of the NPHET, is that certification of immunity is required for indoor hospitality. On 31 August, the Government agreed that during the period between 6 September and 22 October, certification of immunity should be used to access some organised indoor and outdoor events and mass gatherings.</p><p>These measures have been implemented on an interim basis and subject to necessary criteria being met, the full reopening of events and activities will take place from 22 October, with certification of immunity as a prerequisite for access to, or engagement in, any activities or events no longer required (with the exception of international travel). However, it is important to note that the public health advice will continue to be that those who have not been fully vaccinated should avoid or exercise very high levels of caution in high-risk environments.</p><p>The Deputies may wish to be aware that on 15 July, NIAC made a recommendation, which was endorsed by the Chief Medical Officer and accepted by the Minister for Health that while the preference was for homologous vaccination regimens (using the same vaccine as part of a two dose regime) that selective use of heterologous vaccination schedules (two different vaccines used as part of two dose regime) should be permitted where a second vaccine dose of a homologous regimen is contraindicated, irrespective of whether the first dose was an mRNA or adenoviral vector vaccine. NIAC in conjunction with the RCPI and the Irish Association of Allergy and Immunology have prepared a guide to aid vaccinators and other healthcare workers on how to advise allergic individuals in respect of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, this guide is available here: <i></i></p></reply>

The Department of Health is in the process of developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home-support. It is intended that the new scheme will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person&rsquo;s assessed care-needs. </p>  <p>  As part of this work, my department is examining the potential demand and cost of introducing such a scheme. Following this, work will be undertaken to examine the associated workforce requirements for the introduction of such a scheme and officials from the department will engage with relevant stakeholders from other sectors as required.</p>  <p>  The employment permits system operated by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment is designed to facilitate the entry of appropriately skilled non-EEA nationals to fill skills and/or labour shortages.  This objective must be balanced by the need to ensure that there are no suitably qualified Irish/EEA nationals available to undertake the work. The employment permits system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit.</p>  <p>  The critical skills and ineligible occupation lists are reviewed twice a yearly in a process led by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. It is an evidence-based process that takes account of labour market conditions and submissions from sectors and other stakeholders together with contextual factors, including in the current context, COVID-19. The purpose of the system is to maximise the benefits of economic migration while minimising the risk of disrupting the Irish labour market.</p>  <p>  The review of the occupations list for 2021 is currently underway and officials from my department will engage in discussions with officials from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment in respect of submissions received relating to the health sector.   The public consultation phase of this review commenced on 1 July 2021 with a closing date for submissions of Thursday, 12 August 2021.

The National Sports Policy (NSP) was published by our colleagues in DTCAGSM (then DTTAS), in 2018. The two policies are being implemented in co-ordination, with Healthy Ireland represented on the Sports Leadership Group and DTCAGSM co-chairing the NPAP Implementation Group. </p>  <p>  NPAP implementation is overseen by a cross-sectoral Implementation Group co-chaired by the Departments of Health and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. The Departments of Education, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration &amp;amp; Youth, Housing, Local Government &amp;amp; Heritage, and Rural &amp;amp; Community Development are also represented, along with Sport Ireland, the HSE, the Federation of Irish Sport, the Local Government Management Agency and the academic sector.  The Sports Leadership Group, chaired by Minister of State for Sport and the Gaeltacht, Jack Chambers T.D., also has cross-sectoral and multi-disciplinary representation.</p>  <p>  The NPAP contains 60 actions intended to promote increased physical activity levels across the population, divided into 8 Action Areas. Implementation of the current Physical Activity Plan is being reviewed this year with a view to charting the future direction of the Plan. </p>  <p>  The evidence base regarding the protective effect of physical activity on health will be taken into consideration in drafting a renewed version of the Plan.  Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of premature death globally.  Previous research, quoted in the National Sports Policy, estimates that inactivity may contribute to 12,000 excess deaths in Ireland alone. In Ireland, non-communicable diseases &ndash; cancer, CVD, COPD and diabetes, account for 76% of all deaths.</p>  <p>  If physical inactivity were absent in the Irish population it is estimated that the occurrence of new chronic heart disease cases would reduce by 8.8%, new diabetes cases by 10.9%, new breast cancer cases by 15.2% and new colon cancer cases by 15.7% and the overall life expectancy of the population would increase by 0.87 years. Moreover, regular exercise is also effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p>  <p>  More recent research, conducted in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, shows that being sufficiently physically active has significant protective effects against severe impacts from infectious disease also. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of upper respiratory tract infections and results in a 31% decreased risk of community acquired infectious diseases; moreover, there is a 37% decreased risk of infectious disease mortality between active and inactive individuals.  Regular physical activity can be shown to increase post-vaccination antibody levels, particularly in older adults, and to reduce markers of inflammation.</p>  <p>  Recent advice from HIQA to NPHET, following an examination of 46 cohort studies, advises that interventions focussed on maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, exercising often, being Vitamin D sufficient and moderating alcohol consumption would have beneficial effects on general health and may reduce the risk of adverse effects from Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Efforts to support higher population activity levels are ongoing; the NPAP aims to raise the numbers meeting our National Physical Activity Guidelines (NPAG) by 1% per annum, while the NSP has a target of 60% of the population meeting the Guidelines by 2027. The Healthy Ireland Survey, 2019, found that the proportion meeting the NPAG had risen to 46% from 44% in 2015; the Irish Sports Monitor reported that this proportion rose to an all time high of 51% during Q1-2, 2020, during the initial period of Covid-19 restrictions, before falling back slightly again. </p>  <p>In planning to increase physical activity and sport participation levels, it will be necessary to include long-term health condition management and additional supports for people living with disabilities, chronic conditions and/or increasing frailty and disadvantage.  In tandem with an increased prevalence of chronic conditions, physical activity levels typically decline with age and those from socio-economically vulnerable communities have lower levels of physical activity and sports participation rates compared to more affluent communities.</p>  <p>  The National Physical Activity Plan is currently undergoing a review process; the need for additional supports for people living with disabilities, chronic conditions, frailty and/or disadvantage will be considered in the context of this review and of policy renewal.</p>  <p>  In addition to the above response, as the specific query relates to a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Mask wearing will remain in place in day services, except for those who are exempt from wearing a face covering. </p>  <p>  I also note that on 2nd September, also in line with the government statement on &lsquo;Reframing the Challenge&rsquo;, the HSE issued guidance to all providers that day service transport can now return to 100% capacity, with all relevant infection prevention and control measures still to be observed, including the wearing of face coverings where possible and appropriate for service users.  </p>  <p>  As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times. However, the HSE advise that acute services are now almost all fully restored to pre cyber-attack levels, and are operating in line with relevant Covid protocols.</p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are focusing on improving access to elective care in order to reduce waiting times for patients. These plans include increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, providing virtual clinics and increasing capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>An additional &euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 for an access to care fund, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the NTPF. This is to be used to fund additional capacity to address the shortfall arising as a result of infection control measures taken in the context of COVID-19, as well as addressing backlogs in waiting lists.  </p><p>My Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are currently working on a Multiannual Waiting List Plan to address waiting lists and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years.</p><p>The NTPF has advised that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate average wait times. In particular, the time to treatment of patients who have already received their care is not collected. The NTPF collects data on patients currently on the waiting list and the average time that these patients have been waiting is provided here.</p></reply>

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p>  <p>  In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p>  <p>  The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p>  <p>  The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p>  <p>  Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p>  <p>  Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.

Significant progress has been made on the capital project, with planning permission for the hospital secured in 2017 and, in 2018, the awarding of the contract for substantial enabling works. </p>  <p>  I am committed to ensure that there is no religious ethos brought to bear in the provision of public maternity and gynaecology services which would restrict the provision of all legally permissible services in the new hospital. I will not bring any proposal to Government unless it achieves this, and in addition, safeguards the State&rsquo;s investment in the new hospital. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new National Maternity Hospital were set out in the Mulvey Agreement, which was finalised in 2016 following an extensive mediation process between the NMH and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group (SVHG). A draft legal framework has been developed to copperfasten the clinical and operational independence of the new hospital, and to ensure the protection of the State&rsquo;s investment. The draft legal arrangements have of course been, and continue to be, the subject of very detailed consideration by the HSE Board, as would be expected. Work is ongoing to finalise the legal arrangements, as part of which I have engaged further with stakeholders. However, as I have clarified previously, I will not be making any further comment on the nature of this engagement until the process has concluded.</p></reply>

It is estimated that over 400,000 medical card and GP visit card patients will benefit from the programme.  In order to support patients in managing their chronic condition(s) there are two scheduled reviews with the GP in a 12-month period, each preceded by a practice nurse visit.

This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from rapid antigen tests undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland. In response to significantly increased demand for testing caused by the Delta variant, the HSE has planned the deployment of self-swab antigen tests for the testing of close contacts, should challenges in the demand for PCR testing capacity arise. Those in receipt of a &lsquo;detected&rsquo; result from an antigen test will be referred for a confirmatory PCR test.</p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, supported by the HSE, has implemented an antigen testing programme in food processing facilities, supplementing the PCR serial testing programme there. These tests are being carried out under clinical governance arrangements put in place by the Department of Agriculture. Further pilot programmes are underway in a number of further and higher level institutions in the education sector, and amongst staff in early learning and childcare settings. An additional pilot programme for staff of Residential Care Facilities for Older Persons will  commence on the 20th September. These pilots will contribute to an improved understanding of the feasibility of large-scale RADT usage in these settings.</p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Report of the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Group&rdquo; which was chaired at my request by the Government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, and published on 1 April 2021, made a number of recommendations for sectors outside the health sector and these are a matter for the Ministers and Departments with responsibility for the sectors concerned.</p>  <p>  I have established an Expert Advisory Group on Rapid Testing, chaired by Professor Mary Horgan, Consultant in Infectious Diseases at Cork University Hospital and President of the Royal College of Physicians. The group will support and advise government departments, who are responsible for progressing pilots and the rollout of rapid tests in their respective sectors. It will also be responsible for communicating to the general public. </p>  <p>  The membership of the group and it's terms of reference are available at www.gov.ie/en/press-release/e2767-minister-donnelly-establishes-expert-advisory-group-on-rapid-testing/ .

The committee's recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation. It makes recommendations on vaccination policy to my Department. The NIAC continues to revise recommendations to allow for the introduction of new vaccines in Ireland and to keep abreast of changes in the patterns of disease. Therefore, the immunisation schedule will continue to be amended over time.</p><p>In 2009, the NIAC recommended HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccination for all 12 to 13 year old girls to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer when they are adults. In September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of secondary school.</p><p>In June 2017, on foot of the NIAC&rsquo;s recommendation that the HPV vaccine should also be given to boys, my Department asked the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a health technology assessment (HTA) to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of extending the immunisation programme to include boys in the first year of secondary school.</p><p>The HIQA completed the HTA in December 2018, recommending that the HPV immunisation programme be extended to include boys. A policy decision was made to extend the HPV immunisation programme to include boys, starting in September 2019, with the introduction of a 9-valent HPV vaccine.</p><p>The ages at which vaccines are recommended in the immunisation schedule are chosen by the NIAC in order to give each child the best possible protection against vaccine preventable diseases. As the HPV vaccine is preventative it is intended to be administered, if possible, before a person becomes sexually active, that is, before a person is first exposed to HPV infection.</p><p>Therefore, the gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme targets all girls and boys in first year of secondary school to provide maximum coverage. All vaccines administered through the School Immunisation Programme are provided free of charge.</p><p>My Department will continue to be guided by NIAC's recommendations on any emerging evidence on this issue in the future.</p><p>Anyone not in 1st year of secondary school or age equivalent in special schools or home schooled during the 2020/2021 school year who wishes to get the HPV vaccine, must go to their GP or sexual health clinic and pay privately for the vaccine and its administration.

This does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the adverse experience<b>.</b>The information received by the HPRA may also be limited at the time of initial reporting (for example the report may or may not specify whether the patient has been hospitalised), and more information about individual reports may become available through follow-up.</p><p>The majority of regularly reported suspected side effects are consistent with the types of events typically observed following vaccination, including those described in the product information for the individual vaccines. Whilst not experienced by everyone, all vaccines have some side effects, the vast majority of which are mild to moderate in nature. These side effects need to be continuously balanced against the benefits of preventing COVID-19 illness. Overall, the national reporting experience in Ireland, as well as international experience, continues to support the assessment that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the risks.</p><p>The HPRA has been publishing regular public safety updates on reporting experience with COVID-19 vaccines, including information on the numbers and nature of these reports. To date, 11 such updates have been published and are accessible from the HPRA website (www.hpra.ie/homepage/medicines/covid-19-updates/covid-19-vaccine-communications), with the most recent publication issued on September 9th.</p></reply>

The goal of this amendment is to assist in protecting the viability and sustainability of family farms and family-run businesses. </p>  <p>  The principal amendment introduced under the Act extended the three-year cap on contributions based on farm and business assets where an appointed family successor commits to working the productive asset for a period of 6 years. To be considered for the 3-year cap, the legislation requires that an asset owned by an applicant for the Scheme, or recently transferred to a family member, is a productive family asset that has been actively worked by a family member for a significant period of time in advance of the person entering care.</p>  <p>  For the purposes of calculating the three-year period after which contributions will be capped under the amendment, time already spent in care when the amendment comes into force will be taken into account. This means that a person who entered nursing home care three or more years ago should be able to benefit from the relief under the amendment when it comes into force, provided they can meet the other conditions. </p>  <p>  However, the amendment does not provide for any retrospective relief or refunds on contributions to care made before the amendment comes into operation. Retrospective application of the proposed legislative changes would create a challenging precedent, involving high legal and administrative costs and risks, in attempting to apply retrospectively a complex set of conditions. It would also introduce a degree of inequity where conditions would be imposed in the past, with only some people in a position to satisfy those &ndash; as then unknown &ndash; conditions.</p></reply>

These services are provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the HSE. Patients may choose to have their treatment undertaken by any dentist who participates in the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I am aware that there has been a reduction in the numbers of dentists participating in the DTSS since the beginning of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Some people are experiencing problems in accessing a service close to their home. However, I have been assured by the HSE that their local services on the ground will assist any persons who are experiencing problems in accessing a service. </p>  <p>  The national approach to future oral health service provision will be informed by Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the National Oral Health Policy, which was published in 2019. The aim of the policy is to develop a model of care that will enable preventative approaches to be prioritised, improve access, and support interventions appropriate to current and future oral health needs.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring the sustainability of the DTSS, but recognise that it needs to be aligned  with the new Policy. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the roll-out of the National Oral Health Policy to be delayed, and the proposed review of the DTSS contract to be deferred. Officials in my Department and from the HSE are currently engaging with the Irish Dental Association on matters relating to the provision of services under the DTSS.</p></reply>

This guidance came into effect on 19 July. The public health advice is to restore visiting to near normal in terms of frequency of visits in those settings with a high level of vaccination of residents as quickly as possible, while also recognising the need to remain cautious as we continue to deal with the evolving risks associated with COVID-19.</p><p>The new guidance provides that:</p><p>-  Providers should put in place the necessary measures to progress to more normalised visiting and visiting frequency as quickly as possible in line with public health guidance with no more than two visitors at any one time.</p><p>-  Routine visiting will no longer need to be scheduled in advance.</p><p>-  There is no requirement to have a list of nominated visitors.</p><p>-  The duration of the visit should not be limited.</p><p>-  Fewer restrictions will apply to residents going on outings or visits outside of the nursing home.</p><p>Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. In a broad sense, visits to nursing homes are governed by legislation under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013; regulation 11 provides that the nursing home should facilitate visiting and not restrict visiting except in circumstances such as the resident requesting same, or potential risk posed from visiting &ndash; this aligns with the risk assessments referred to in the visiting guidance.  The regulations also require that the nursing home has suitable facilities in place and available for residents to receive visits. It is the legal responsibility of each provider to assess the risks and mitigation measures associated with their service and how best to manage visits having regards to the specific circumstances that arise in relation to their service. The HPSC has developed public health guidance, mentioned above, to assist and support providers in this regard.</p><p>Notwithstanding the current positive epidemiological outlook and the continued reopening of society, risks continue to remain and emergent risks such as variants of concern present ongoing challenges and the need for vigilance. Visiting arrangements should continue to take account of general public health advice and the necessary infection prevention and control measures, to reduce the risk of introduction and spread of COVID-19 and protect those living in our communities. This is particularly important in the context of the increasing prevalence of the more transmissible Delta variant. This variant poses a significant risk, in particular to those who are not yet fully protected though vaccination.</p><p>Visitors are reminded of their responsibilities with regard to self-checks for COVID-19 in advance of visits, infection and prevention control and social interaction with all individuals, while in the nursing home.</p><p>I have communicated with the nursing home sector to emphasise the need for service providers to follow the guidance and have requested the issue of visits continues to be monitored by HIQA.</p><p>The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges.</p></reply>

Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service that the HSE may provide.  Staff in these section 39 organisations were not subject to the provisions of FEMPI legislation and therefore did not receive those cuts that were applied to the pay of public servants.  They were not and are not party to the Public Service Agreements and are therefore not covered by the pay restoration provided for in these Agreements.  While it is understood that pay savings were made by the organisations, the precise mix of pay cuts or other savings measures will have varied.</p><p>WRC Agreements reached in 2018 and 2020, determined the criteria for organisations who would be deemed eligible under the pay restoration process. South Doc were encompassed in the 2020 agreement, which included two instalments to be paid in 2021, with the third and final instalment due in 2023. </p><p>As of April 2021, a signed statutory declaration from South Doc was outstanding, and they were made aware of this outstanding requirement. No funding could be released prior to all relevant forms being signed and return to the HSE through the appropriate channels. </p><p>Following receipt of all required documentation, South Doc have been notified of their funding allocation, inclusive of both the 1st January and 31st May instalments. </p><p>Notwithstanding the impact that the cyber-attack has had on this process, I can confirm that the CHO has received the allocation and they are currently processing the payment. It will be made by the end of September and is being incorporated into the service level agreement. </p></reply>

However this is not an accurate reflection of full mental health spend. For context, the figure does not include funding for other parts of the health service that provide mental health services and supports, such as psychotropic medicines funded by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, liaison mental health services in acute hospitals, some dual diagnosis (addiction and mental health) services and mental health and well-being promotion. </p><p>It also does not include spending by other departments on services that incorporate psychological or mental health supports, such as the Prison and Probation Services, Defence Forces, Department of Foreign Affairs supporting the Irish diaspora or the Department of Education. </p><p>Finally, 2021 saw significant extra funding to health services for infection control measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 which has the effect of reducing the figure as a percentage of the overall health allocation. </p></reply>

In the first instance, queries relating to the performance oversight of the DFB are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p>  <p>  The HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) also provides some emergency capacity within the greater Dublin area. Where required, the NAS also provides additional resources from neighbouring counties to address demand in Dublin, including motorbikes, rapid response vehicles and emergency ambulances. In addition, ambulances from other parts of the country, which may be travelling to or from a Dublin hospital, may be available to respond to emergency calls in the Dublin area where they are the nearest resource to a patient.</p>  <p>  As emergency response time performance is an operational matter in the first instance, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly with any further information that might be available in regard to ambulance services provided by the NAS in the Dublin area. </p></reply>

We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle.</p><p>Underscoring the government&rsquo;s commitment to Women&rsquo;s Health has been the establishment of a Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce in September 2019 to improve both health outcomes and experiences of healthcare for women and girls. The members of the Taskforce meet regularly, with its fourteenth meeting held this week on September 15th.</p><p>The Taskforce is an important element of the Department's response to the Scally Review Recommendation 2 which stated that the Minister should give consideration to<i>&quot;how women&rsquo;s health issues can be given more consistent, expert and committed attention within the health system and the Department of Health.&quot;</i></p><p>The Taskforce is chaired by the Director of the European Institute for Women&rsquo;s Health (EIWH), Peggy Maguire, with more than 30 members from all grades and divisions within the Department of Health working in partnership with members from stakeholder organisations as follows: </p><p>-  senior members of the HSE including the National Women and Infants&rsquo; Health Programme</p><p>-  National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland</p><p>-  Irish College of General Practitioners</p><p>-  Institute of Public Health</p><p>-  Dept. Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth</p><p>Full membership can be found in the attached document.</p><p>The Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce continues to work with the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and the European Institute of Women&rsquo;s Health to prioritise different issues each year with the aim of improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes and experiences of healthcare. Critical to this work is the process of listening to women - the Taskforce has so far listened to, engaged with and worked with more than 1,000 women and hundreds of organisations representing women and girls across the country.</p><p>Based on this information, the Taskforce has developed proposals to improve supports for gynaecological health, mental health, physical activity, and menopause all of which are rolling out this year and next year.</p><p>Budget 2021 has provided a dedicated &euro;5million Women&rsquo;s Health Fund to implement a programme of actions arising from the work of the Taskforce.  The first three proposals to be supported under the Women's Health Fund are:</p><p><b>Two community-based Ambulatory Gynaecology Services in Tallaght and Limerick/Nenagh, with an associated cost of &euro;1.415million</b></p><p>The provision of two community-based Ambulatory Gynaecology Services governed by two acute hospitals (Tallaght University Hospital, and University Maternity Hospital Limerick, though located in Nenagh General Hospital) under the banner of the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. This project, with an associated cost of &euro;1.415m, will see the establishment of one-stop &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; gynaecology clinics in the community in which women can be seen and assessed, following referral by their GP to the hospital&rsquo;s general gynaecology services. This service will address a clear and identified need, as gynaecology services are acknowledged and recognised as being a service area that continues to be under significant and growing pressure. These one-stop-see-and-treat clinics will play a significant role to improve access to gynaecology, reducing waiting times and improving clinical outcomes for women.</p><p><b>Expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital, with an associated cost of &euro;641k.</b></p><p>The second area to be funded is the expansion of the endometriosis service at Tallaght University Hospital (TUH), with an associated cost of &euro;641k, will deliver a specialist endometriosis centre for the management and treatment of all forms of endometriosis, with particular focus on advanced and complex cases for which there is no ready access in Ireland. Endometriosis is estimated to affect 1 in 10 women and represents one of the top four categories of symptoms that comprise approximately 80% of gynaecology referrals. The provision of a secure, supported, expanded and specialist service in Tallaght University Hospital will help to improve both clinical outcomes and overall care experience for women suffering from this debilitating condition.</p><p><b>Establishment of dedicated specialist menopause clinics across Ireland, with an associated cost of &euro;157,000</b></p><p>The third area to be funded are dedicated specialist menopause clinics, which will form a core part of a new approach to menopause care for women in Ireland and will be supported by enhanced community and primary care supports as well as the publication of targeted and trusted sources of information for women experiencing menopause. </p><p>The first phase of change will include the development of a dedicated specialist clinic, in the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street this year. The clinic will be multidisciplinary supported by GPs with a certified special interest in the area of menopause and clinical nurse/midwife specialists. In addition to seeing women who meet the clinical criteria for referral to the service, the clinical team will also provide advice and guidance to GPs in the community to support the effective management of menopausal symptoms for women closer to home within primary care. </p><p><b>Radical Listening</b></p><p>In addition, a Radical Listening exercise was conducted to hear the voices of women on their health, to understand their perspectives on health and wellbeing, how those perspectives were shaped, and to understand the forces that shape health outcomes for women. A report of the &lsquo;radical listening&rsquo; exercise was published this week on Tuesday September 14th. </p><p>Led by independent researchers, over 270 women participated in these discussions from all over Ireland, sharing their experiences of, and wishes for, the Irish health system. The research was carried out in three stages, beginning in mid-2020 and finishing in June 2021, involving social and media listening; hearing women&rsquo;s stories and experiences, and national workshops with women. </p><p>The report is the result of a priority project for the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce and provides invaluable insight into women&rsquo;s experiences of healthcare in Ireland. Women highlight some really positive experiences but also important issues that they want to see improved in particular around information, respect, and access. </p><p>Engagement is ongoing with Dept. of Health and HSE stakeholders to finalise further activities to be implemented under the Women&rsquo;s Health Fund in 2021. A number of proposals are in different stages of finalisation and approval, which will be announced shortly and which will consolidate and drive impact for women in the coming months. </p><p>A 2022 plan for women&rsquo;s health is in development, informed by the available evidence and engagement with women across the country, key stakeholders, clinicians, and advocates for women&rsquo;s health through the Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce. It is intended the plan will be brought to Government and published later this year.</p><p>Appendix 1 - Name of Members: <table>    <tr>       <th>Name</th>       <th>Organisation </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Peggy Maguire <br /><br />(Chair) </td>       <td>European Institute of Women&rsquo;s Health - Director </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td colspan="2">External Members </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Orla O&rsquo;Connor </td>       <td>National Women's Council of Ireland - Director </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Alana Ryan </td>       <td>National Women's Council of Ireland - Women's Health Coordinator </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Anne O&rsquo;Connor </td>       <td>Health Service Executive - Chief Operations Officer and Deputy Director General </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Stephanie O&rsquo;Keefe </td>       <td>Health Service Executive - National Director, Strategic Planning and Transformation </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Carol Baxter </td>       <td>Department of Justice &amp;amp;

Safeguarding adults at risk of abuse and harm by others in the context of their interactions with the health sector is a key objective of the Department of Health, every statutory body under its aegis, and every health and social care service that interacts with such adults. </p>  <p>  In the health sector, a framework of standards, policies and procedures for safeguarding adults who may be at risk of abuse, harm and exploitation within the sector is in place, and further measures are being developed to strengthen this framework. The framework includes:</p>  <p>  -  joint national adult safeguarding standards developed by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the Mental Health Commission, approved by the Minister for Health and launched in 2019;</p>  <p>  -  the significant inspection and other regulatory powers of HIQA and the Mental Health Commission in relation to the quality and safety of healthcare and social care provision generally (under the Health Act 2007 and the Mental Health Acts);</p>  <p>  -  the HSE&rsquo;s national operational adult safeguarding policy Safeguarding Vulnerable People at Risk of Abuse &ndash; Policy and Procedures (2014), which is in place primarily in all HSE and HSE-funded social care settings.</p>  <p>  A range of structures and processes are established by the HSE to support and further develop its national operational adult safeguarding policy, including:</p>  <p>  -  a HSE National Safeguarding Office leading policy development and oversight;</p>  <p>  -  specialist Safeguarding and Protection Teams in each of the 9 HSE Community Healthcare Organisation (CHO) areas;</p>  <p>  -  over 1,700 designated safeguarding officers nominated by service providers and provided with additional training; and, </p>  <p>  -  clear guidelines set out in the existing policy for HSE and HSE-funded staff to follow in cases of suspected abuse or neglect of adults at risk;</p>  <p>  -  an adult safeguarding policy and procedures training programme, and a requirement that staff must attend training. The training is also accessible to non-HSE and HSE-funded services;</p>  <p>  -  a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; approach to abuse, meaning that abuse must be reported by staff in all instances; and</p>  <p>  -  implementation planning for a revision by the HSE of its operational adult safeguarding policy which is expected to extend the policy outside of the social care pillar and to all HSE and HSE-funded services.</p>  <p>  I have met with and corresponded with Care Champions on their issues of concern.  I have also met with HIQA and I have been assured that it has robust mechanisms in place to address safeguarding matters.  Specifically in relation to the nursing home sector, under existing law nursing home providers have an obligation to take all reasonable measures to protect residents from abuse. The person-in-charge of the nursing home has a legal obligation to investigate any incident or allegation of abuse. The nursing home is obliged to maintain a record of any incident in which a resident suffers abuse or harm, and the records must include the nature, date and time of the incident, whether medical treatment was required, the name of the persons who were respectively in charge of the designated centre and supervising the resident, and the names and contact details of any witnesses, the results of any investigation and the actions taken. There is also a statutory requirement that the nursing home notify the Chief Inspector of any allegation (suspected or confirmed) of abuse of any resident within 3 days. </p>  <p>  The Chief Inspector, in discharging her duties determines, through examination of all information available to her, including site inspections, notifications received and records, whether a nursing home meets the regulatory requirements in order to achieve and maintain its registration status. Should a nursing home be deemed to be non-compliant with the Regulations and the National Quality Standards, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status. In addition, the Chief Inspector has wide discretion in deciding whether to impose conditions of Registration on nursing homes.</p>  <p>  Significant regulatory reform is ongoing in conjunction with HIQA, in line with the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel&rsquo;s recommendations and lessons from the pandemic. Earlier this year, Government agreed the progression of interim enhancements to the current regulatory framework for nursing homes this year, with a view to commencing a wider, root and branch review of nursing homes regulation in 2022. Subject to Government approval, the interim enhancements to the legislative framework are expected to include enhanced powers and oversight for the Chief Inspector and enhanced reporting of key data by nursing homes providers.</p>  <p>  To strengthen the health sector&rsquo;s wider adult safeguarding framework, the Department is currently developing a national policy on adult safeguarding in the health and social care sector. This national sectoral policy will be in place in all private, voluntary and public health and social care settings and services and will be underpinned by any legislation that may be required. To date, the Department, assisted by a high-level Steering Group, has completed key stakeholder consultation and primary evidence development phases of this major and complex policy project. In developing the policy, the Department is considering the merit of a number of issues including appropriate access to non-public health settings.  </p>  <p>  The Department is now preparing for a formal public consultation exercise, to be launched later this year, and a costing study, with a view to submitting a draft policy to Government for approval and, thereafter, preparing any legislation required to underpin the approved policy.  </p></reply>

This includes an appeals process for clinical placement. The appeals process is designed and agreed by the academic programme board of each Higher Education Institution (HEI). The clinical assessment appeals process is outlined for students in the HEI student handbook, and the process is adhered to using the same principles as an academic assessment. Queries regarding assessment oversight is a matter for the individual HEI. </p></reply>

The work of the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board is significantly more challenging than it is for registration boards for some of the more established professions owing to the different and complex pathways into these professions, the variety of titles used, and the variety and number of courses and course providers.

It is important to note that antibody tests check for antibodies to see if a person had an infection with the virus in the past. A positive antibody test should not be taken to mean that a person is protected from being infected again with COVID-19; a positive result does not mean that the person is immune to coronavirus.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the underpinning EU Digital COVID Certificate regulation concerns the issuing and verification of certificates for medical events including vaccination, recovery, and testing related to COVID-19. The EU Digital COVID Certificate regulation, and subsequent associated national regulations, do not allow for the issuing of a certificate for individuals who have not had a medical event as outlined.</p>  <p>  Under the EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation, a certificate of recovery is a certificate confirming that, following a positive result of a NAAT test, meaning a molecular nucleic acid amplification test, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) techniques, used to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA), carried out by health professionals or by skilled testing personnel the holder has recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></reply>

The latest draft Guidelines, dated August 2017, are available from the EPA website.  I understand applicants may seek details regarding the particular scope and level of detail of the information to be included in the EIAR for any given project. </p>  <p>  As set out in the Department's Forestry Divisions Circular 5 of 2021, in the case of projects involving &ldquo;the replacement of broadleaf high forest with conifer species&rdquo; the obligation to obtain planning permission or submit an EIAR arises from the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended, and not from the Forestry Act 2014 or the Forestry Regulations 2017, as amended. As such, the authority responsible for assessing an EIAR in respect of these projects and in particular providing a &lsquo;Scoping Opinion&rsquo; in advance of its submission is the relevant local Planning Authority.</p>  <p>  The Department is not aware of any minimum cost of preparing an EIAR having been published by the EPA or any other State authority.  I understand that generally costs will vary depending on the size and complexity of the project, sensitivity of the landscape and the efficiency of the study undertaken to prepare the EIAR. </p>  <p>  Critically, the requirement to obtain planning permission or submit an EIAR does not apply where a landowner intends to replace an existing broadleaf crop with broadleaf species.</p></reply>

The main criterion here was submission of a good quality harvest plan.</p>  <p>  In 50% of the files reviewed, the harvest plan was deemed to be of sufficient quality and therefore proceeded.

The Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine (DAFM) continuously engages with DECC on all energy related matters from an agricultural perspective, as well as a wide range of industry and other stakeholder groupings. </p>  <p>  The agricultural and forestry sector has a key role to play in the supply of bio-energy feedstocks as part of their positive contribution to the decarbonisation of energy systems through the displacement of fossil fuels and energy intensive materials. With this in mind, my Department has had extensive engagement with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on their recent National Heat Study project which aims to assess, amongst other things, the ability of the agricultural sector to provide relevant feedstocks to the Anaerobic Digestion industry.</p>  <p>  DAFM also continues to support research, development and demonstration in this particular area. Of particular importance are two projects which have received part-funding from this Department through the European Innovation Partnerships initiative (EIP), as part of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  The Bio-refinery Glas (small scale farmer-led green bio-refineries) and Irish Bio-energy Association (IrBEA) (small biogas demonstration programme) have both been awarded funding of over &euro;900,000 each and upon completion will provide valuable information of specific relevance to Irish farmers. </p>  <p>  DAFM also engages with farmers and other relevant stakeholders as part of it`s regulatory role in the Anaerobic Digestion industry specifically when animal-by-products are utilised as a feedstock for Anaerobic Digestion. There are currently twelve anaerobic digesters producing biogas in operation nationally that are approved and under licence by my Department.</p>  <p>  Engagement with interested stakeholders, including farmers and farm organisations has been further strengthened through the current DECC-led public consultation on the Introduction of a Renewable Heat Obligation which will further enhance the demand and consequent feasibility of the developing Anaerobic Digestion industry in Ireland.</p></reply>

I am in regular and intensive consultation with all stakeholders, and it is my immediate priority to resolve the issues which have led to this backlog and to issue licences in the volume needed for this important sector to continue to contribute to our rural economy. </p>  <p>  The delays that have arisen were caused by changes to the licencing system which means that a significant number of cases now need ecological input to comply with environmental requirements. To find solutions towards resolving these issues, as well as focusing on woodland creation, Project Woodland was initiated early in 2021. </p>  <p>  It comprises four working groups, each with an independent chair and with members drawn from forestry and eNGO stakeholders on the Forestry Policy Group. The Project Board, chaired by Secretary General of my Department, published its first Interim Report in July and the  Project Manager has published the Project Charter which details project management oversight.</p>  <p>  As part of Project Woodland,  we are about the select a preferred bidder with legal and environmental expertise to carry out an in-depth review of the forestry licensing system. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licencing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework. </p>  <p>  The business systems analysis currently being undertaken by an independent systems analyst will interact with and run parallel with the regulatory review, so that best possible system improvements are delivered.</p>  <p>In June this year, the Department issued 415 forestry licences. This output  was interrupted in July and August by the introduction of a new requirement for public participation under SI 293/2021, signed on 25th   June  by the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage and  which applies to all similar planning issues. However in the last three weeks licences exceeded expected levels with a total of 392 licences issued. This means that September will be the highest month this year for new licences. In those three weeks  a total of 342 felling licences issued, of which 171 were private for over 1million m3 of timber. We anticipate that we will maintain expected levels of output to the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Along with Minister of State Pippa Hackett, who has overall responsbility for the sector, we recognise that the delivery of afforestation licences needs to improve.  We are now  putting  in place a dedicated team of 10 ecologists who will deal  solely with these licences for the forseeable future.  This will increase output over the coming weeks.  Productivity will depend on the quality of the information provided (e.g. NISs, ecology reports, pre-screening reports and habitat maps) provided. </p>  <p>  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate my commitment to supporting the forest sector and to building on the recent progress, so that a continual improvement in delivery is achieved.</p></reply>

This map is a key tool in assessing land use, and forms the basis of the information needed to determine land uses as well as the ability to identify carbon rich soils under agricultural management in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Land use is a crucial climate mitigation measure available to Ireland, but there are significant challenges to be overcome to maximise the potential contribution from land use. The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future (2020) commits to a land use review to ensure that optimal land use options inform all relevant government decisions. The review will include consideration of urban and rural land use, forests and peatlands. The national land use review will also:</p>  <p>  -  Balance environmental, social, and economic considerations and involve a process of evaluation of the ecological characteristics of the land;</p>  <p>  -  Gather the data and evidence to report on and determine the environmental, ecological, social and economic characteristics of land cover, land use and land-based activities across Ireland and how they interact and influence each other; and</p>  <p>  -  Include consideration of emissions to air and water, carbon sequestration, and climate adaptation challenges. </p>  <p>  The review is being overseen by a Steering Committee co-chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine (DAFM) and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC).  The steering committee is in place with representatives from DAFM, DECC, EPA, Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) and independent nominees.  </p>  <p>  The review is being carried out in two phases.  Phase 1 of the Land Use Review is an evidential review being chaired by the EPA with technical advisors from National Parks and Wildlife services, Teagasc, DAFM, DECC, OSI, DHLGH, Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) and the Heritage Council. Work is already underway with agreed work packages and timelines in place. Phase 1 will form the principal evidence gathering phase of the review to determine the environmental, ecological and economic characteristics of land types across Ireland.</p>  <p>  The second phase will build upon the results of the evidential review and consider policies and measures in the context of the Government&rsquo;s wider economic, social and climate objectives. </p></reply>

To that end, Government and my Department have introduced a number of supports to assist sectors in dealing with the impact of COVID-19 and social restrictions necessary in the interests of public health.</p>  <p>  During 2020, the COVID-19 Stability Fund supported close to 600 organisations to continue to deliver vital services to the communities that depend on them. A further allocation of &euro;10m was provided to the Stability Fund for 2021 as part of the revised Resilience and Recovery plan announced on Tuesday 23rd February by the Taoiseach. The COVID-19 Stability Fund 2021 was launched on Thursday 6th May, and was targeted at organisations, who meet the published criteria, and which deliver critical services to vulnerable people within their community but which now face closure or a loss of service due to the impact of the pandemic. To date 180 organisations have been approved for funding under the 2021 fund and another announcement will be made shortly.  A number of mental health and suicide prevention charities were supported through the COVID 19 Stability Fund in 2020 and 2021.  </p>  <p>  The Stability Fund is now closed. As the country moves to a new phase of living with COVID-19 and restrictions are eased, there are no plans to reopen the Stability Fund. In general, I would encourage all organisations to continue to engage with their Local Authority and Local Development Company, and to check on the Gov.ie website in order to be aware of funding opportunities as they become available.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises, building on our mission to promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland.</p></reply>
