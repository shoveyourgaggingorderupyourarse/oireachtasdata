The amount of such discount will be reflected in the sale price of the site to the purchaser. </p>  <p>  All available sites will be advertised on the relevant local authority&rsquo;s website and/or in relevant local publications along with a closing date for receipt of applications.</p>  <p>  As the scheme has just been launched, each local authority has been asked to assess suitable sites for the scheme. Carlow County Council have indicated that they currently have seven sites that could be made available under the Ready to Build Scheme, with a survey to be carried out over the coming weeks to ascertain if there are other potential sites. In addition, each local authority has also been asked to collect data from the outset in order to inform the ongoing review of this scheme.</p></reply>

When Irish Water was established in 2014, they inherited a system in need of very significant improvement. Irish Water has been working with local authority partners to improve the entire waste water system by investing in new infrastructure and by improving the performance of our treatment plants. </p>  <p>  Irish Water has built new wastewater infrastructure for 18 towns and villages across the country, ending the discharge of raw sewage into the environment, with an additional 15 locations currently under construction.  Irish Water is on track to fully remove the majority of raw sewage discharges in Ireland by 2025.</p>  <p>  In 2022, funding of over &euro;1.57 billion was provided to support water services. This includes &euro;1.459 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water.  </p>  <p>  This investment will deliver significant improvements in our public waste water services and improve water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine areas.</p></reply>

This will be facilitated through Approved Housing Bodies, Local Authorities, and the Land Development Agency.</p><p>Limerick City and County Council has developed a Housing Delivery Action Plan to underpin its delivery of social, affordable purchase and cost rental housing in the period to 2026. The plan is available on the Council&rsquo;s website.</p><p>AHBs will deliver Cost Rental housing with support from my Department through Cost Rental Equity Loan funding. Approval in principle has already been confirmed for approximately 900 Cost Rental homes to be delivered by AHBs under the CREL scheme. To date, some 293 Cost Rental homes have already been delivered by AHBs, with the rest to be delivered between now and 2023. Local Authorities can also deliver Cost Rental homes directly through my Department's Affordable Housing Fund.</p><p>My Department is actively encouraging the Local Authority, AHBs and the LDA to consider appropriate schemes.  I understand the LDA is examining delivery of Cost Rental homes on the State lands at Colbert Station and I know that Limerick City and County Council is also exploring the possibility of delivering Cost Rental homes on an adjoining site, in conjunction with the work being undertaken by the LDA. Linking these two key sites together will be important in delivering a new urban quarter for the city of Limerick, with an emphasis on the delivery of affordable homes.</p><p>I am happy to say Minister O'Brien recently approved an application from Limerick City and County Council for funding of &euro;1.8m for 25 affordable purchase homes at Br&uacute; na Grud&aacute;n, Castletroy in Limerick under the Affordable Housing Fund which will be delivered in 2023.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that the First Home Affordable Purchase Scheme is available to first time buyers unable to afford new homes and I understand there have already been applications in Limerick.</p></reply>

My officials are also keeping in regular contact with the Board on the matter. In addition, this week I secured additional resources to assist the Board in their operations, including in relation to providing customer service, with an increase in the RTB allocation from &euro;11m this year to &euro;13m in 2023.</p>  <p>  Given the genuine difficulties among its user community, the RTB will be refunding all late fees paid to it for new tenancy registrations with a tenancy commencement date on or after the 4 April 2022, and annual registrations of existing tenancies which became due on or after 4 April 2022. The RTB has commenced work to operationalise this new process over the coming weeks and will provide its customers with an update once the detail is finalised, via its regular website customer service announcements. This will not apply to any late fees which have accumulated prior to the introduction of annual registration on 4 April 2022.</p>  <p>  Changes have been made to processes within RTB customer service provision to help alleviate delays and backlog and the RTB has almost doubled the staffing in its outsourced call centre. As I said my Department continues to engage with the RTB on a regular basis to ensure it is fully resourced to deliver on its ever increasing mandate.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including noise, setback distance, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections.</p>  <p>  Guidance on the noise aspect is currently being finalised by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, which has primary responsibility for environmental noise matters.  Officials from the two Departments are in regular contact to discuss ongoing developments in relation to noise, including the impact of the revised 2030 target to generate up to 80% of our electricity from renewable sources and the need to ensure that proposals regarding the measurement and assessment of noise from wind turbines are fit for purpose. This matter is currently being considered by DECC and further inputs are expected shortly. Following this, I will be in a better position to provide an update on the expected publication date of the revised Guidelines, the finalisation of which remains a priority.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the review and finalisation of the Guidelines has been included as an action in the recently published Climate Action Plan, with a Q2 2023 delivery date target.</p></reply>

It offers larger supported facilities that address the needs of people for whom current accessible sanitary accommodation is inadequate.</p>  <p>  There is no current legislation requiring the provision for a changing places toilet in publically accessible buildings in Ireland.   </p>  <p>  In December 2020, in support of Government policy on advancing the rights and inclusion of people with disabilities, a Working Group was established to examine the provision of a changing places toilet in certain buildings to promote community participation and social inclusion. The Working Group recommended the types and sizes of buildings where a changing places toilet should be required. Additionally, they recommended the technical requirements of a changing places toilet such as equipment, room size and layout of the facility.   </p>  <p>  In February 2022, my Department conducted a public consultation seeking submissions, observations and comments on a draft proposed amendment to the Building Regulations and associated Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use to make provision for a changing places toilet in certain buildings. The consultation period ended on May 12, 2022 and more than 600 individual submissions were received. </p>  <p>  Since the conclusion of the public consultation phase the Working Group has met. They are scheduled to meet again shortly to continue the consideration of the submissions with the view to finalising documentation on the matter later this year.</p></reply>

Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes; 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing and 28,500 new affordable homes in the period 2022-2026. Over the same period to 2026, the Housing for All strategy commits to delivering 10,000 Cost Rental homes and 18,000 Affordable Purchase homes which will be delivered by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), local authorities, the Land Development Agency (LDA) and the First Home shared equity scheme.</p>  <p>  A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery as appropriate over the period 2022 - 2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All. All local authorities submitted their Housing Delivery Action Plans in December and my Department has been working closely with the local authorities to review and finalise the Plans, having regard to the targets and policy objectives set out in Housing for All. The Plans have been published by each local authority on their website.</p>  <p>  Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) has been identified as a key measure to address the different housing needs in Ireland and methods to support the development of MMC in Ireland are set out in Housing for All Pathway 5 Section 5.3.2. All new dwellings must comply with building regulations, the aim of which is to provide for the safety and welfare of people in and about buildings, and in addition achieve a 60-year durability for all key elements. </p>  <p>  The development of MMC, which will improve productivity and increase efficiency in construction, and the coordination of activities to promote the development of MMC, is being led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (DETE). DETE has recently established a MMC Leadership and Integration Group. </p>  <p>  The Group&rsquo;s leadership aim to ensure a coordinated approach, and that those emerging innovations and new technologies being developed and deployed by the industry in Ireland and abroad, and promoted by the public sector, can be showcased and demonstrated in a coordinated and timely manner, particularly (but not exclusively) by the Demonstration Park for MMC, and could also inform the design of construction training modules. </p>  <p>  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY) is responsible for meeting the immediate and short-term accommodation needs of persons arriving in Ireland from the conflict in Ukraine. My Department is supporting the national response in a number of ways, including working with the Local Authority sector to identify multi-unit vacant buildings that might be suitable for refurbishment. In addition, the OPW, with DCEDIY as the lead Department, is leading on a project to secure the provision of modular homes to accommodate Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection from the Ukraine.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government outlines our ambition to tackle the biodiversity crisis and includes a commitment to ensure that each Local Authority has a sufficient number of biodiversity officers and heritage officers among their staff complement.  Local authorities are uniquely positioned, within their own biodiversity plans and working with communities, to help halt biodiversity loss. Biodiversity officers are a key part of this and are crucial to the implementation of actions for biodiversity at local and regional level.</p>  <p>  There are currently five biodiversity officers employed in the following local authorities:</p>  <p>  Fingal County Council;</p>  <p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council</p>  <p>  Dublin City Council</p>  <p>  Galway City Council</p>  <p>  Kerry County Council.</p>  <p>  The Biodiversity Officer programme is currently under development and will be delivered by the Heritage Council and County and City Management Association, with the support of my Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Expressions of interest for participation in the pilot were advertised by the Heritage Council in July and that it is expected that participating Local Authorities will begin recruiting in the near future. </p>  <p>  My Department also administers the Local Biodiversity Action Fund (LBAF), previously National Biodiversity Action Plan Local Authority Grant Scheme, to assist local authorities in the implementation of actions in the National Biodiversity Action Plan. The funding stream is available to biodiversity officers and heritage officers and enables them to develop projects that address biodiversity loss in their localities by raising awareness for biodiversity, creating new habitats, restoring existing ones and by tackling invasive alien species. My Department has approved almost &euro;1.5m this year in projects to support Local Authorities implement local actions to support our biodiversity objectives, with a total of 128 projects approved, covering a range of biodiversity related activities, including invasive alien species control, dune restoration, wetland surveys and biodiversity awareness and training.</p></reply>

The 4<sup>th</sup>NBAP will set the national biodiversity agenda for the period 2023-2027 and aims to improve the governance of biodiversity in Ireland so that we can better respond to the biodiversity emergency. The Plan also addresses the connections between biodiversity and climate change, and the need to enhance the evidence base for biodiversity conservation policy and practice.</p><p>The draft Plan has been developed against a backdrop of unprecedented challenges for nature in Ireland and globally. It is informed by an extensive review of national, European, and international policies, strategies, legislation and science. A first draft of the Plan was circulated to an initial group of stakeholders, including the Biodiversity Forum, the Biodiversity Working Group, Government Departments and organisations that are likely to be involved in implementing the Plan. Further development of the draft Plan involved stakeholder engagement in the form of exploratory discussions, surveys, detailed workshops and valuable discussions held at the 2<sup>nd</sup>National Biodiversity Conference in June.</p><p>Promoting a &lsquo;whole of government, whole of society&rsquo; approach to biodiversity conservation is central to the next National Biodiversity Action Plan. The draft Plan recognises the need for responsibility for biodiversity to be shared across government, acknowledging that responding to the challenges we face is not the sole responsibility of one department or organisation. </p><p>I urge members of the public to have their say and engage with this public consultation.</p></reply>

The 4<sup>th</sup>NBAP will set the national biodiversity agenda for the period 2023-2027 and aims to improve the governance of biodiversity in Ireland so that we can better respond to the biodiversity emergency. The Plan also addresses the connections between biodiversity and climate change, and the need to enhance the evidence base for biodiversity conservation policy and practice.</p><p>The draft Plan has been developed against a backdrop of unprecedented challenges for nature in Ireland and globally. It is informed by an extensive review of national, European, and international policies, strategies, legislation and science. A first draft of the Plan was circulated to an initial group of stakeholders, including the Biodiversity Forum, the Biodiversity Working Group, Government Departments and organisations that are likely to be involved in implementing the Plan. Further development of the draft Plan involved stakeholder engagement in the form of exploratory discussions, surveys, detailed workshops and valuable discussions held at the 2<sup>nd</sup>National Biodiversity Conference in June.</p><p>Promoting a &lsquo;whole of government, whole of society&rsquo; approach to biodiversity conservation is central to the next National Biodiversity Action Plan. The draft Plan recognises the need for responsibility for biodiversity to be shared across government, acknowledging that responding to the challenges we face is not the sole responsibility of one department or organisation. </p><p>I urge members of the public to have their say and engage with this public consultation.</p></reply>

The delivery of the Clonburris SDZ has the potential to be a transformative project of national, regional and local significance in terms of regeneration and urban development. The project will facilitate the provision of distinctive and attractive places where housing can be delivered in tandem with state-of-the-art public realm, green infrastructure and community facilities.  The wider project to develop the SDZ comprises of up to 11,000 homes, extensive open space and recreation, cycle ways and walkways, excellent connectivity, community facilities, schools and employment floor space. </p>  <p>  The Clonburris URDF Project, which was approved into the URDF programme as part of the second call for proposals in 2021, involves the provision of critical strategic infrastructure that will be essential to the further development of this unique and complex site.  All URDF supported projects must be carefully developed and managed by the Sponsoring Agency, in this case South Dublin County Council, in accordance with the normal conditions and arrangements that apply to public sector managed projects in compliance with the Public Spending Code. </p>  <p>  South Dublin County Council submitted a preliminary business case in respect of the project which was approved by Government on 27 July 2022, giving approval in principle to Exchequer funding of &euro;186.3m at Decision Gate 1 of the Public Spending Code.  On foot of that approval, South Dublin County Council are currently progressing the planning, design and development of the individual infrastructural elements of the project. </p>  <p>  In addition to the infrastructure elements of the project, South Dublin County Council own six sites in the Clonburris SDZ that have been master-planned with a capacity of over 2,500 homes.  The Council has plans well advanced for the development of social, affordable purchase and cost rental homes across the six sites with the first two sites currently undergoing detailed design for mixed tenure projects.</p></reply>

My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing the legislative framework, running a central training programme and issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects. The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management manages fire service issues in my Department. </p>  <p>  Fire services in Ireland are provided by the local authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Fire Services Acts, 1981 and 2003. Under this legislation, 31 authorities provide fire prevention and fire protection services for communities through 27 service delivery structures. Approximately 3,300 local authority staff engaged at 217 fire stations nationwide deliver local authority fire services, 16 of these stations being staffed by full-time firefighters, a further 4 are mixed full-time and retained, and 197 are staffed by retained firefighters, with approximately 2,065 retained firefighters around the country. It is important to note that the numbers of fire service front-line staff have been maintained at a constant high level throughout the economic challenges of the past number of years, even when staffing numbers, by necessity, were reduced in other areas of the local authority sector. </p>  <p>  In 2013, my Department published 'Keeping Communities Safe (KCS) - A Framework for Fire Safety in Ireland'. The adoption of KCS as national policy saw national norms/ standards established for fire services in Ireland for the first time, against which local authority fire services could benchmark themselves. The report of the Fire Service Validation Group, 'Fire Services in Ireland, Local Delivery - National Consistency', published in 2016, noted the staffing arrangements in place in fire services across Ireland to achieve these standards and that fire services manage staffing levels in fire stations to achieve the national standards of fire service response.</p>  <p>  The provision of fire services by local authorities is based on a risk management approach, which involves an analysis of the nature of the fire hazards and the incidence and extent of fires that occur, as well as the fire protection measures in place. There has been a welcome downward trend in the incidence of fire, with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was twenty years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population and positions Ireland among countries with very low fire fatality rates.</p>  <p>  In May 2021, the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management mandated a small internal project team to undertake a review of the model of local authority &lsquo;Retained&rsquo; fire services delivery. This review has a particular emphasis on the recruitment and retention of staff, with the proviso that due consideration also be given to input from the County and City Management Association.</p>  <p>  The objective of the review was to explore and understand the issues that can impact service delivery, to undertake research and analysis and to propose options that will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future.</p>  <p>  The initial engagement element of the review was the gathering of appropriate data and information, to inform the needs analysis and option appraisals for further development. To that end, the project team undertook a procurement process and engaged the services of an independent consultant to survey the views of the personnel who work in the retained fire services and those that have recently retired from the retained fire services. In preparing the survey, the project team sought the views of retained services trade union representatives through the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group.</p>  <p>  Comprehensive updates on the progress of the report have been positively received by the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group. There is broad agreement that the survey outcomes are reflective of feedback received directly from Retained Fire service members previously, and that the Fire Services National Oversight and Implementation Group remains the appropriate forum for feedback on the report.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the final review report will be submitted to the Management Board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in the coming months. Following this, any recommendations made to the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management&rsquo;s Board, to address the issues raised in relation to the recruitment and retention of Retained Firefighters, will then need to be considered together with all relevant stakeholders.</p></reply>

It supports first-time buyers in purchasing new houses and apartments in the private market through the use of an equity share model. Full details of the scheme are available at www.firsthomescheme.ie. </p>  <p>  On a countywide basis, regional price ceilings for eligible home purchases have been aligned with the median purchase prices of new-build homes recently purchased by first-time buyers, as found in the CSO&rsquo;s Residential Property Price Index. The initial setting of the ceilings was also informed by a review of live market data. </p>  <p>  The price ceilings for the First Home Scheme are designed to temper inflationary pressures, to target support specifically at the lower part of the price distribution in each area, and to encourage the development of additional housing supply at this level. </p>  <p>  It must be recognised that any system of geographically-based price ceilings necessarily requires defined borders. This will result in examples of homes on either side of given borders with differing price ceilings.  To this end, the price ceilings from the launch of the scheme were selected in order to strike an appropriate balance between the making sure the scheme could administratively and practically operate, that homes could be made available below those ceilings and to temper any inflationary pressures.  </p>  <p>  When considered overall, I am confident the methodology broadly reflects price trends across the country, and represents a clear, easily understandable method for utilising the scheme.  However, I can advise that it has been confirmed to me a review of price ceilings will be undertaken by the First Home Scheme DAC before year end.  In carrying out that review it would be necessary to consider whether available and robust data will support the drawing of borders in an alternative or more finely determined manner and whether the scheme could practically operate any new price ceiling structure being proposed. The review process, which will continue periodically thereafter, is to ensure that the ceilings allow the scheme to deliver on its underlying objectives. </p>  <p>  The First Home Scheme Designated Activity Company now holds responsibility for maintaining the scheme, and for reviewing and updating of price ceilings nationally and can be contacted directly at www.firsthomescheme.ie/get-in-touch/.</p></reply>

Included in the planning exemptions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural to which specific conditions are attached. </p>  <p>  My Department, in the context of the Climate Action Plan and in consultation with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, has undertaken a review of the solar panel planning exemptions set out in the Regulations, with a particular focus on facilitating increased self-generation of electricity. This review is now complete. Substantial changes to the current planning exemption thresholds for solar panels are proposed, including those relating to the installation of solar panels on the roofs of houses, as well as the introduction of new classes of solar panel planning exemptions for apartments and educational/community/sports buildings. </p>  <p>  The draft regulations have been reviewed under the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive and it has been determined that they are likely to have significant effects on the environment, necessitating the undertaking of a full SEA on the draft proposals. The draft regulations have also been screened for Appropriate Assessment (AA) under the Habitats Directive by my Department&rsquo;s Ecological Assessment Unit (EAU) and the need for AA has been screened out. </p>  <p>  A public consultation on the draft solar regulations as part of the SEA process ran from 15 June 2022 to 13 July 2022. My Department has had regard to the written submissions and observations received as part of the public consultation, which have been taken into consideration in the finalisation of the draft regulations. </p>  <p>  As required under planning legislation, the proposed exempted development regulations must be laid in draft form before the Houses of the Oireachtas and receive a positive resolution from both Houses before they can be made and the SEA process concluded. In this regard, the process for finalising the solar regulations has commenced and is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

The Cultural Landscape of the Burren Uplands, County Clare;</p>  <p>  2. Iniscealtra (Inis Cealtra), County Clare;</p>  <p>  3.

The Passage Tomb Landscape of County Sligo; </p>  <p>  6. Glendalough Valley, County Wicklow (Wicklow County Council subsequently paused their application pending completion of the Glendalough Master Plan). </p>  <p>  In July 2021 I appointed an Expert Advisory Group (EAG) to evaluate each application on their ability to demonstrate potential Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) and evidence of local stakeholder support, both of which are essential for inscription on the World Heritage List.</p>  <p>  The EAG&rsquo;s recommendations were issued to the applicants in November 2021. A Technical Group (TG) was also established in 2022 to offer specific technical advice to the applicants in relation to the EAG recommendations and UNESCO processes.  After thorough assessment this process enabled a final decision on the composition of the new Tentative List.</p>  <p>  The EAG acknowledged that the Burren has the potential to fill a gap on the World Heritage List, however, it recommended that the potential OUV needed to be demonstrated by focussing on the criteria for assessment of OUV, authenticity/integrity, and the protection and management aspects of a potential World Heritage property. Also, as the original application was submitted by Clare County Council, a revised application needs to be drafted to incorporate aspects of the Galway Burren to ensure a coherent mutually balanced approach. My Department is committed to supporting Clare and Galway County Councils to develop this application further and looks forward to receiving a revised joint application to the Tentative List. The Burren is therefore not precluded from being on the Tentative List in the future.</p>  <p>  In relation to Iniscealtra the EAG recommended that it could be included on the Tentative List if the potential OUV was clearly demonstrated. However, although it demonstrated that it was nationally significant, the Technical Group process concluded that a robust narrative for OUV was not sufficiently demonstrated, and that any future proposal to submit Iniscealtra to the Tentative List should be based on a strong comparative analysis, supported by more detailed research, and possibly its consideration as part of a coherent and credible serial site application, (it is worth noting that previously Iniscealtra was not on the TL by itself, but was part of a serial application site, the Early Monastic Sites).</p>  <p>  Furthermore my Department is currently working on publishing a Technical Evaluation Assessment which will outline the Tentative List revision process and details the exact reasoning behind the composition of the new Tentative List. When completed is will be available online at World Heritage Ireland at www.worldheritageireland.ie.</p></reply>

Where arrears do arise the local authority will work with the tenant to put in place a repayment arrangement to assist the tenant in managing the arrears. These arrangements would generally take into consideration any other forms of indebtedness on the part of the tenant and can include advising the tenant of the services offered by the Money and Budgeting Advice Service. Local authority rent schemes also generally make allowances for specific hardship cases. In such cases, they may accept lesser amounts for a specified period if they consider the amount of rent due would cause undue hardship for the tenant.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme offers a safety net within the overall social welfare system by assisting those whose means are insufficient to meet their own needs and those of their dependents. The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. There are several payments within the scheme, including once-off exceptional needs payments which can cover rent arrears.</p></reply>

In this regard the Government's housing plan, Housing for All, contains a specific action (Action 20.4) - to &ldquo;develop new regulatory controls requiring short-term and holiday lets to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland with a view to ensuring that houses are used to best effect in areas of housing need&rdquo;.  Funding was allocated in Budget 2022 to F&aacute;ilte Ireland which has been tasked with the design and implementation of a new short term lettings registration system. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is also presently scoping out the legislative provisions that will be required to underpin the new Failte Ireland registration system with a view to these provisions being enacted in 2022.</p>  <p>  As an interim measure and pending the establishment of that registration system, Section 3A of the Planning and Development, Maritime and Valuation Act 2022 provides for the introduction of a new regulatory regime in relation to the short-term letting sector, specifically non-principal private residences advertised for letting in the designated Rent Pressure Zones. However, the provisions cannot come into effect until supporting supplementary regulations providing for the detailed operational arrangements in relation to the proposed measure are made and signed into law.</p>  <p>  My Department is presently engaging with the relevant stakeholder groups on the detailed operational arrangements that will apply in relation to the proposed measure to be incorporated in the required supplementary regulations. It is intended to conclude the consultation process as soon as possible. My Department is also engaging with the European Commission on the legislation under the notification requirements of the Technical Regulation on Information Society (TRIS) Directive, which engagement is ongoing.</p>  <p>  In relation to social housing, a key priority for this Government is that everybody should have access to sustainable, good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard, and located close to essential services, offering a high quality of life.</p>  <p>  The Government plans to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade. This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 Affordable Purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes by 2030 and Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum.</p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing from 2022 to 2026. In the same period over 29,000 affordable homes will be delivered including 18,600 affordable purchase homes and 10,400 cost rental homes.</p></reply>

This need to allow for transition overtime has been factored into growth targets at a regional and county level. </p>  <p>  The Planning and Development Act includes in-built mechanisms to allow for regular review and update of the NPF.  The Programme for Government commits to review the NPF by 2024.  This review will look at NPF implementation to date and be informed by the final results of Census 2022 when available next year.  The review will also consider a range of factors that will influence how we manage future growth in a planned, productive and sustainable way.  This will include consideration of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the Climate Action Plan and the influence of geopolitical factors on future growth.  It is intended to publish a &lsquo;roadmap&rsquo; document by the end of 2022 that will address the review process in more detail. </p>  <p>  My Department has also made significant advances in the development of marine policy over the last number of years, culminating in the launch of the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) in June of last year, and the enactment of the Maritime Area Planning Act in December 2021, elements of which have already been commenced.</p>  <p>  The NMPF creates an overarching framework for decision-making that is consistent with the wider objectives of the NDP, evidence-based and secures a sustainable future for all activities in the maritime area. It contains the objectives, policies and supporting actions which the Government considers necessary to support the effective management of marine activities and more sustainable use of our marine resources.</p></reply>

It is a matter for the Management Group to bring forward proposals to my Department that meet the needs of homeless individuals in their administrative area and the funding requirements will be considered in this context. Therefore, the exact amounts spent by housing authorities on homeless services, as well as the type and operation of homeless services including the number of places in accommodation and the numbers turned away are a matter for individual housing authorities in consultation with the Management Group of the relevant regional joint Homelessness Consultative Forum.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the pressures currently being experienced in accessing Emergency Accommodation nationwide and local authorities are working to address these, with assistance from my Department where necessary.

These include the Pyrite Remediation Scheme and the Defective Concrete Blocks Scheme. </p>  <p>  In regard to defects in purpose-built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013, following receipt of the report of the working group I established to examine this issue, I will now, in consultation with Government colleagues, develop options with a view to providing support for homeowners who find themselves in a difficult financial situation through no fault of their own.   </p>  <p>  The Regulation of Providers of Building Works Act 2022 was signed into law by the President in July this year. The main objective of the Act is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations in the construction sector which will benefit consumers and the general public. </p>  <p>  When the register is operating on a statutory footing it is envisaged there may be in the order of at least 5,000 entities who will be required to register.  It is envisaged that builders can begin registering early 2023 and it will be statutory from 2024 for the first categories established.  These will likely be house builders and non-residential builders. Registration for various trades will happen subsequently. </p>  <p>  The legislation will require providers of building services to register with the Construction Industry Register of Ireland. This will apply to entities or individuals who hold themselves out for consideration as a provider of building works for both residential and non-residential buildings (subject to the building regulations). It does not include employees of such entities but does include sole traders. This will have a significant impact on all sections of the construction industry from small contractors and craftspeople up to the larger construction companies. </p>  <p>  In addition, in response to defects that have come to light in buildings my Department has embarked on a range of building control reforms. Since 2011, the reforms have focused primarily on ensuring strong and effective regulation in the building control system and the construction industry, on improving compliance with the Building Regulations, and on greater consumer protection. </p>  <p>  To further support the building control system, preparatory work is progressing on establishing an independent Building Standards Regulator to oversee building control nationwide and to act as custodian of the Building Control Management System.</p></reply>

The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupation lists. </p><p>My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year and a half, which impacted on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  16,275 employment permits were issued in 2021, and a total of 17,968 applications processed, which represents a significant volume of activity.  This increased demand was also driven by the extension of categories of employment permits following the Review of the Occupational Lists in October 2021.</p><p>My Department and I recognised the impact delays in the processing times for employment permits has had for businesses and their workers.  An internal plan of action was introduced which increased resources and implemented more efficient methods of processing applications in the permits system.  The processing team trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled this year compared to 2021 levels.</p><p>Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has made positive progress by reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from about 10,900 in January 2022 to under 2,200 today, despite further strong growth in demand in 2022.</p><p>The tables below show the details requested by the Deputy in tabular form.</p><p><b>The number of work permits that have been issued for non-European Union workers to date per month in 2022</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Issued 2022 (25/09/2022) </th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>       <th></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>January </td>       <td>February </td>       <td>March </td>       <td>April </td>       <td>May </td>       <td>June </td>       <td>July </td>       <td>August </td>       <td>September </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2,278 </td>       <td>2,539 </td>       <td>3,458 </td>       <td>4,012 </td>       <td>3,996 </td>       <td>3,876 </td>       <td>3,957 </td>       <td>3,535 </td>       <td>2,696 </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The sectors in which work permits have been issued for non-European Economic Area-workers by month to date in 2022 are set out at the link:</p><p><a href="https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-09-28_pq77-28-09-2022_en.xlsx">Work Permits Non-EEA</a></p><p>The current average turn-around times for a work permit for non-European Economic Area-workers from the date that the application is received until the date of approval are set out in the table. <table>    <tr>       <th>CSEP </th>       <th>Weeks Waiting (queue) </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Trusted Partner </td>       <td>2 Weeks </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Standard </td>       <td>4 Weeks </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>GEP </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Standard </td>       <td>3 Weeks </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Trusted Partner </td>       <td>3 weeks </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>ICT </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Trusted Partner </td>       <td>3 Weeks </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Standard </td>       <td>3 Weeks </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Other </td>       <td></td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Trusted Partner </td>       <td>3 Weeks </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Standard </td>       <td>3 Weeks </td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The number of applications for work permits for non-European Union workers that are currently awaiting processing within the system as of 26<sup>th</sup>September 2022 is 2181.</p></reply>

Digital technologies have the power to transform small businesses, opening up new opportunities, increasing productivity and efficiency, and building resilience. </p><p>In line with the National Digital Strategy, in June I launched the Digital Transition Fund alongside Grow Digital, which focus on driving the uptake of digital technologies among businesses in Ireland. This &euro;85m fund is part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan and will run to 2026, drawing on the EU&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) to help SMEs at all stages of their digital journey. </p><p>Under Grow Digital, my Department held a series of workshops for businesses around the country, offering practical advice to businesses considering digitalisation. Work is also under way on the development of a new, web-based Digital Portal, which will offer information to all businesses on how they can approach their digital transition and the supports available to assist them in the process.  I expect this will be launched in 2023.  </p><p>My Department is also allocating funding towards the establishment of a national network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs). The initiative is co-funded by the EU under the Digital Europe Programme. The EDIHs will provide access to technical expertise and experimentation, so that organisations can &ldquo;test before invest&rdquo;, as well as innovation services, financing advice, and the training and skills development necessary for successful digital transformation. These Hubs will specifically target emerging technology awareness and capacity-building, enhancing the uptake and deployment of Artificial Intelligence, high performance computing, and cybersecurity. Ireland will have four hubs in the network, and they are set to be operational by the end of 2022.</p><p>The need for robust cybersecurity is called out  in the National Digital Strategy, as a prerequisite for a successful Digital transition. This requires a systemic approach, as set out in the National Cybersecurity Strategy. In terms of individual SMEs, we would advise that businesses always engage with trusted software and cloud providers, and promote awareness of cybersecurity issues among staff on an ongoing basis. </p><p>Policy and funding responsibility for both cyber security and high-speed broadband rests with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, who may be able to provide more detail on those specific areas.</p></reply>

In each case an appeal was received, however the appeals were received after the 28-day period in which an appeal must be submitted, and therefore they could not be considered.  The applicant was informed in each case of this decision. </p>  <p>  The refusal to grant an employment permit does not preclude an applicant from submitting another application for an employment permit.  Such an application should comply with all of the legislative requirements for the particular employment permit type.   </p>  <p>  It must be noted that due to the length of time from the expiry of the original permits in respect of these individuals, renewal applications cannot be considered, therefore new General Employment Permit applications are required to be submitted.  </p>  <p>  Under employment permit legislation 90% of the fee paid is refunded if an application is either withdrawn or refused.  The applicant is advised to request a refund in respect of these three cases, by completing and returning the mandate form which will facilitate the processing of the refund.</p>  <p>  A checklist document has been prepared to assist applicants when applying for a General Employment Permit specifically for the role of a horticultural worker and this document can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website through the following link: enterprise.gov.ie/en/publications/publication-files/checklist-for-horticultural-meat-dairy-general-employment.pdf.</p>  <p>  It is important to note however that the role of horticultural worker is subject to a quota and once the quota of 1,000 permits introduced last year has been reached no further permits will issue for this role.  All applications received are dealt with in order of date of receipt, so the company concerned is advised to submit new General Employment Permit applications for this role as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As the Deputies note, the European Commission has proposed a number of short-term exceptional emergency measures recently which include a proposal to incentivise coordinated electricity demand-reduction across the EU. Other proposals include capping the revenues of inframarginal electricity producers with low costs of production and introducing a solidarity contribution from fossil fuel companies to be used to mitigate the impact of high energy prices on customers.</p><p>  Measures which can assist consumers and those measures which seek to reduce demand on the energy system are welcomed. The short-term emergency proposals as put forward by the Commission are complex in nature and therefore it is up to each country to see how they might apply these proposals and, in this regard, there is flexibility build in. As regards demand reduction, this is a critical measure at both national and EU level, in particular demand reduction at peak hours. If demand can be reduced at peak hours that can in turn bring down electricity costs for everyone.</p><p>  Separately, as noted by the deputies, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has also recently proposed changes to the electricity network tariffs to assist with, inter alia, demand reduction. The CRU has statutory responsibility to ensure security of supply, the duty to monitor electricity supplies and to take such measures as it considers necessary to protect the security of supply. These proposals are part of a programme of actions underway to ensure the security of our electricity supply over the coming winters. The CRU, as an independent regulatory body, will play a central role in any national electricity demand reduction policies based around tariffs. Officials from my Department are in contact with the CRU in order to ensure that priority matters regarding the energy crisis continue to progress.</p></reply>

Micro-generation has an important role in creating opportunities for homes, schools, community groups and small commercial customers to take the first steps towards investment in renewable technologies, by generating and consuming their own electricity, which can help offset rising electricity prices as well as decarbonise homes and businesses. </p><p>  The Micro-generation Support Scheme (MSS) provides capital grants through the SEAI for domestic applicants for Solar PV installations up to 6.0kW, primarily for self-consumption. Grant amounts are up to a maximum of &euro;2,400. The SEAI will also be assessing extending such support to other technologies under the MSS, including Micro-Hydro, Micro-Wind and micro-renewable CHP. </p><p>  Micro-renewable CHP excludes oil, solid fuel, natural gas and other non-renewable fuels as it does not reduce primary energy or CO2 and therefore does not align with the climate ambitions of Government as it would lock-in fossil-fuel technologies. </p><p>  The Government funds a number of grant schemes to support homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. These are administered by the SEAI. </p><p>  The National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme provides increased grant levels of up to 50% (up from 30%-35%) of the cost of a typical deep retrofit to a B2 BER standard. </p><p>  The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides a financial incentive to private homeowners who wish to improve the energy performance of their home taking a step-by-step approach.  Grant amounts have been significantly increased this year in line with the National Home Energy Upgrade Scheme. </p><p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.</p></reply>

This is in line with the approach that has been taken with mature students who are in full-time third level education.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to advise that the NTA have already commenced the technical work on this matter, which is scheduled to be completed in the coming weeks, at which point those third level students aged 16, 17, and 18 will be able to order a Student Leap Card and avail of the discount.</p></reply>

These have been exacerbated by international events.</p>  <p>  Ireland is at the beginning of its transition to private electric transport. Within a few years I anticipate there will be a viable second hand market that will provide a more affordable pathway to the purchase of an EV. In addition, the motor industry is planning to bring more affordable electric vehicles onto the market.  Notwithstanding this, I am taking steps to accelerate the establishment of a second hand EV market in Ireland. </p>  <p>  My Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. This Group considered a variety of regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to accelerate EV adoption. The Group also examined the issue of price parity between EVs and ICE vehicles and found that parity in respect of the Total Cost of Ownership is likely to be achieved later on this decade, driven by falling battery prices and savings due to economies of scale. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, in order to support the transition to EVs, the Group recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years. </p>  <p>  An Implementation Group has been established to progress the recommendations and consider further potential measures and barriers to the adoption of the EVs. It will also examine the creation of a second hand market. This Group will report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year. </p></reply>

The decision to join the global agreement was not taken lightly, and I firmly believe this agreement brings a unique opportunity to reframe the international taxation architecture which has largely remained in place for almost a century.  </p>  <p>  My long-standing position is that the international tax system needs to adapt to keep pace with changes in how business is conducted internationally. This is a global issue which requires global action to solve. The OECD agreement is designed to bring long-term stability and certainty to the international tax framework.</p>  <p>  My Department received 12 responses to the public consultation in relation to the Pillar Two minimum tax rate, and it is intended that the responses will be published shortly. The consensus from the responses received was positive. A general desire was expressed that Pillar Two would be introduced in as certain and straightforward a way as possible and that any opportunity is taken to simplify the tax rules in its implementation. It was also generally recognised that the implementation of Pillar Two in Ireland will be a major practical challenge.</p>  <p>  The Inclusive Framework agreed and published Pillar Two Model Rules on 20 December 2021. An accompanying Commentary was published on 14 March 2022. The Commentary, which provides detailed technical guidance on the application of the Model Rules, is intended to promote a consistent and common interpretation of the rules across jurisdictions and taxpayers.</p>  <p>  Pillar Two technical work remains ongoing at the OECD. Such work includes the drafting of further technical guidance, the design of a standardised information return to be filed by in-scope groups annually, and the development of a peer review process which will verify that jurisdictions have correctly implemented the rules.</p>  <p>  An EU Minimum Tax Directive has been proposed to provide for co-ordinated implementation of the Pillar Two across all Member States, and I expect that unanimous agreement will be reached on the Directive later this year.</p>  <p>  The proposed Directive provides for an implementation deadline of 31 December 2023 and work will be ongoing in my Department over the next year towards that deadline. It is expected that this will include further stakeholder engagement, through public consultations and/or Feedback Statements, all of which will be signalled publicly on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This included the commissioning of work to scope and develop options for a revised or new social housing income eligibility model. This work will commence shortly under the aegis of the Housing Agency who have been tasked with commissioning it. It is expected that the work will be complete by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  Pending completion of this work, I have also approved changes to the social housing income eligibility bands. Five local authorities - Carlow, Clare, Galway County, Laois and Westmeath - will be moved from Band 3 to Band 2. Accordingly, the baseline income eligibility threshold for these areas will increase from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000. The change reflects the movement in rents in recent years in these areas and will ensure local authority areas with similar accommodation costs continue to be grouped together in the respective bands. The changes will come into effect from 1 October 2022. </p>  <p>  It is now appropriate to await the report I referred to before considering the appropriate income threshold levels for all counties, and the potential impact of any changes that might arise.</p></reply>

Significant funding has been secured and is being made available to support delivery of affordable housing.  Based on a Housing Need and Demand Assessment each City and County Council has developed a Housing Delivery Action Plan to underpin its delivery of social, affordable purchase and cost rental housing in the period to 2026. These plans have been made available on Council websites.   </p>  <p>  I have provided a range of funding schemes and programmes to help achieve delivery targets.  This includes the Affordable Housing Fund for local authorities, the Cost Rental Equity Loan for Approved Housing Bodies, LDA capital funding and the First Home Scheme.  Taken together, these interventions are intended to actively encourage affordable housing delivery across all public and private providers.   </p>  <p>  Local authorities have been asked to begin collating information on delivery of affordable homes in their area in the same manner as is currently undertaken for social housing. It is intended that information on delivery across all delivery streams will be gathered by my Department and I expect that my Department will be in a position to begin reporting on affordable delivery in national quarterly delivery statistics later this year.</p></reply>

This allocation will ensure that local authorities will have the necessary resources, in terms of people, to perform their functions and provide essential public services to our citizens; in excess of one thousand services in fact.  Furthermore, as has happened in previous years, we will be engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of any additional pay increases that are confirmed for 2023.</p>  <p>  Across all schemes and funding sources, my Department provided &euro;3.98 billion in 2020, &euro;4.07 billion in 2021 and over &euro;2.03 billion so far in 2022 (as at end August) to all local authorities. Included in this is the unprecedented level of support provided by central Government to local authorities in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID -19 pandemic. A more targeted rates waiver scheme was in place for Q1 2022, and payments to local authorities in respect of this scheme will be an additional c &euro;61m.</p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, the move to 100% retention of Local Property Tax (LPT) will take place in 2023. All Equalisation funding will now be met by the Exchequer, to ensure that all authorities receive, at a minimum, an amount equivalent to their Baseline.  This increased equalisation requirement will come to &euro;118m in 2023. In addition, a move to this model will lead to an increased surplus for those authorities with LPT income above their funding baseline. These authorities shall now retain a greater proportion of that surplus for their own use in 2023; an increase from 20% of the overall yield this year to 22.5% next year.  It is intended to commence a comprehensive review of the current LPT baselines in the coming months. This review could not commence in time for the 2023 LPT allocation process without reliable and up-to-date data primarily the detailed census data.</p>  <p>  I am very aware of the funding pressures facing all local authorities and the provision of additional support of &euro;60m is in recognition of those pressures. My Department will continue to engage with the sector on the issue.</p></reply>

In respect of the civil service occupational pension schemes for which I have responsibility, the relevant pension scheme rules include a right of appeal to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  The procedures to be followed in respect of civil service pension appeals are set out in Circular 16/2020: &lsquo;Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR) procedure for pension appeals in relation to beneficiaries/disputed beneficiaries of pre-existing civil service pension schemes and of certain public service pre-existing pension schemes&rsquo;. These procedures are designed to ensure comprehensive gathering of the information necessary in the evaluation of a complaint under the IDR Process. </p>  <p>  A civil or public servant intending to pursue a complaint to the FSPO must first engage in the IDRP / pension appeal process applicable to them, prior to the FSPO accepting the complaint. The requirement for a complainant to complete an IDRP also applies in respect of private pension/financial service providers, prior to the FSPO accepting a complaint.</p>  <p>  I understand that the 2017 Act abolished the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman, as well as repealing certain provisions of the Pensions Act 1990 relating to IDRPs. I am not aware of any subsequent changes to the requirements for pursuing complaints to the FSPO, as provided for under the 2017 Act. However, as my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has overall responsibility for that Act, any questions relating to the provisions of that legislation, or to any potential amendments to that legislation, should be directed to the Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

The AHB or local authority (in the case where the property is sold to a private company) becomes the landlord and the borrower remains in the property as a tenant paying a differential rent to the landlord based on his or her income.  </p><p>To the end of June 2022, a total of 1,905 households with unsustainable private mortgages have completed the MTR process and 635 cases are being actively progressed. A total of 5,602 individuals are benefitting from the scheme, which comprises of 3,079 adults and 2,523 children.</p><p>The following table outlines the number of active, completed, ineligible and terminated cases assigned to AHBs and Home for Life from January 2022 to end Q2 2022. Those that are unassigned are also provided. <table>    <tr>       <th>MTR Provider</th>       <th>Completed</th>       <th>Active (as of end Q2 2022)</th>       <th>Ineligible </th>       <th>Terminated</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>AHBs</td>       <td>45</td>       <td>192</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>23</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Home for Life</td>       <td>178</td>       <td>436</td>       <td>18</td>       <td>71</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Unassigned</td>       <td>0</td>       <td>7</td>       <td>6</td>       <td>15</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total</td>       <td>223</td>       <td>635</td>       <td>24</td>       <td>109</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The Housing Agency publishes, on a quarterly basis, detailed statistical information on the operation of the MTR scheme. This information is available on the Housing Agency's website at the following link: www.housingagency.ie/housing-information/mortgage-rent-statistics </p><p>A MTR scheme was also introduced for local authority borrowers which is called Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) and has been in place nationally since 2014. Under the scheme, a local authority can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as social housing tenants. Information in relation to the Local Authority MTR scheme from its inception in 2013 to end 2021, broken down by local authority area, is available on my Department's website under the heading Local Authority Mortgage to Rent at the link below. During that period, a total of 552 households had benefited from the scheme. </p><p>www.gov.ie/en/collection/42d2f-local-authority-loan-activity/#local-authority-mortgage-to-rent-scheme (Refer to the section &quot;Local Authority Mortgage to Rent scheme&quot;)</p></reply>

This applies to both new and existing tenancies. </p>  <p>  Although many landlords and agents have successfully registered their tenancies on the system, I have been made aware that some landlord and agent customers are encountering issues with the new RTB tenancy registration system. The RTB has assured my Department that it is working collaboratively and constructively with the sector to assist anyone experiencing difficulties. </p>  <p>  The RTB has recently almost doubled the staffing in its outsourced call centre to deal with these issues and has been working hard to find the right balance between ensuring contracted staff are adequately trained and capable of assisting customers with their queries, ranging from linking tenancies, verifying accounts, and data-inputting paper applications. </p>  <p>  Following recommendations in the RTB Workforce Plan (2018 &ndash; 2021) and engagement with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER), the RTB received sanction for significant additional staff over the past three years and my Department will continue to work with the RTB to ensure it is sufficiently resourced to deliver on its expanded mandate, including any specific requests with regard to annual registration. To this end, additional funding of &euro;2m will be provide to the RTB for 2023, bringing its total allocation to &euro;13.03m.</p></reply>

Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over &euro;4bn per annum, through an overall combination of &euro;12bn in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5bn in funding through the Land Development Agency and &euro;5bn funding through the Housing Finance Agency. </p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 47,600 new build social homes and 3,500 social homes through long-term leasing in the period 2022-2026.  In September 2021, I issued social housing targets to each local authority for the period 2022-2026 and in March I issued local authority targets for affordable purchase and cost-rental.</p>  <p>  A key action of Housing for All is that local authorities will develop and submit Housing Delivery Action Plans to include details of social and affordable housing delivery. The Plans set out details of both social and affordable housing delivery as appropriate over the period 2022-2026, in line with targets set under Housing for All. These Plans are available on the websites of the relevant local authorities. To support local authorities social and affordable housing delivery, The Housing Delivery Coordination Office (HDCO) has been established within the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), to provide co-ordination of all Local Authority housing activities, including all aspects of social and affordable housing procurement and delivery.</p>  <p>  My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on a quarterly basis on social housing delivery activity in all local authorities. This data is available until the end of Quarter 1 2022 and is published on the statistics page of my Department&rsquo;s website, at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/ . </p>  <p>  My Department also publishes the Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR). The CSR provides details of social housing developments and their location that have been completed, are under construction or are progressing through the various stages of the design and tender processes. The most recent publication was for Quarter 1 2022. All Construction Status Reports are available at the following link: gov.ie - Social Housing Construction Projects - Status Reports (www.gov.ie). A version of the Q1 2022 CSR file can also be downloaded for analysis at the link: Social Housing Construction Status Report Q1 2022 - Dataset - Dept of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Quarter 2 social housing statistics are being collated and will be published shortly, in conjunction with the Quarter 2 Construction Status Report. </p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, the Government will deliver 54,000 affordable homes between now and 2030, to be facilitated by local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), the Land Development Agency (LDA) and through a strategic partnership between the State and retail banks. 2022 represents the first year of a very ambitious programme of delivery of affordable housing.

All private landlords, Approved Housing Bodies and providers of Student Specific Accommodation are required to register their tenancies with the RTB. Managing the registration of tenancies is a core function of the RTB. This allows the RTB to collect and provide definitive data on the rental sector and for transparency across the rental sector through the public register of tenancies; thus, enabling a better understanding of the sector.</p>  <p>  Non-compliance with the requirement to register a tenancy is dealt with by two processes in the RTB, the Registration Enforcement Process or the Investigations and Sanctions Process.</p>  <p>  The RTB has registration enforcement powers to pursue landlords who have not complied with their obligation to register their tenancies. Failure to register is an offence which may result in a criminal conviction, a fine of up to &euro;4,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment. The RTB makes every effort to inform landlords of their obligations to register and legal action is taken as a last resort. The RTB, receives information from different sources regarding whether a tenancy is registered or not, including local authorities, members of the public, RTB checks and follow-ups and the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  The RTB also has an Investigations and Sanctions unit dedicated to investigating certain potential breaches of rental law by a landlord referred to as improper conduct under Schedule 2 to the Acts. One of the breaches that can be investigated is a failure to register a tenancy with the RTB within one month of the tenancy commencing. The Investigations and Sanctions Unit can start an investigation either as a result of information received from members of the public or as a result of information gathered from records that the RTB has access to under the Residential Tenancies Acts. If a landlord is found to have engaged in improper conduct, a sanction may be imposed on them by an independent Decision maker which may comprise on or all of the following: a written caution, a monetary sanction of &euro;15,000 and &euro;15,000 in costs.</p>  <p>  While I am aware of the issues raised in the residents&rsquo; letter to the RTB, it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, or my Department to provide legal advice, comment on, or to intervene in the specifics of any individual case. However, the RTB has advised my Department that it is in the process of responding to the residents on their most recent correspondence.</p></reply>

This will add an additional &euro;32million to my Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the DEIS programme from 2023, bringing the 2023 allocation to in the region of &euro;180million.</p>  <p>  Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model which is an objective, statistics based model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model has been applied fairly and equally to all schools. </p>  <p>  The DEIS identification process aims to identify those schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage or the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds within a school. The model uses information from the school&rsquo;s individual enrolment database and 2016 national census data as represented by the Pobal HP Deprivation index. The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.  The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homeless accommodation. </p>  <p>  A detailed paper on the refined DEIS identification model is available on gov.ie at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/a3c9e-extension-of-deis-to-further-schools/#how-schools-were-selected-for-inclusion-in-deis</p>  <p>  Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed. The details of the Appeals process is outlined in Circular 0019/2022 which can be found on the gov.ie website. </p>  <p>  Following the processing of the appeal received from the school in question regrettably there was no change to the outcome of the initial application of the refined DEIS identification model to the school. My Department, however, will continue to support the school and the school community as they deliver high quality, inclusive teaching and learning to their students and young learners. The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly across all appellants and the results are final. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the extension of the DEIS programme to new schools is just one phase of work in my vision for an inclusive education system which supports all learners to achieve their potential. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, I recognise that there are students at risk of educational disadvantage in all schools. Conscious of this, and recognising the need to target resources to those schools that need them most, the next phase of work will explore the allocation of resources to schools to tackle educational disadvantage. Part of this programme of work will involve consultation with all relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, following the National Census 2022 held on the 3rd April last it is envisaged that an updated HP Deprivation Index will be generated by Pobal and will be available in Q3 of 2023. My Department will engage with Pobal in relation to this process. The updated HP Deprivation Index, when available, can be considered by my Department to inform future resource allocation to tackle educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  Meeting the educational needs of children and young people from Ukraine is a priority for the Government, and my Department is determined to support the efforts of school communities across the country, who have shown huge commitment and generosity. I announced the establishment of Regional Education and Language Teams (REALTs) to support the needs of Ukrainian children arriving in Ireland. These Education and Language Teams will be hosted by the 16 regional education and training boards (ETBs) and will be staffed by existing regionally-based education support personnel working closely together to ensure good coordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children. My Department will be liaising with the teams to ensure all necessary supports for the Ukrainian children are provided as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  Local Regional Education and Language Team (REALT) co-ordinators visit and engage with the relevant schools around the country on a regular basis. My Department carried out surveys at primary and post-primary level to identify potential capacity in schools and has incorporated this information, along with other information, in the Geographical Information System (GIS) system to enable quick identification of potential capacity near Ukrainian accommodation centres through the Community Analyst reporting system.</p>  <p>  Each REALT team has access to this tool, reflecting their key role in assisting children in finding school places and in supporting schools in their area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge. The tool enables the REALT co-ordinator to work on ensuring that existing capacity in local schools can be leveraged to the greatest extent possible. In some cases, it may be necessary to access capacity in neighbouring schools within reasonable travel distance, supported as necessary through school transport arrangements.</p>  <p>  There is a dedicated helpline for support which can be contacted on 057 9324461 or email Usupport@education.gov.ie. The helpline will be operated from Monday - Friday.</p></reply>

The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.</p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provided &euro;68.1 million for the programme with an additional &euro;9m provided to allow access to all new DEIS schools from September 2022.</p>  <p>  Funding under the school meals programme can be provided for breakfast, snack, cold lunch, dinner, hot school meals and afterschool clubs and is based on a maximum rate per child per day, depending on the type of meal being provided.   </p>  <p>  Any school wishing to provide a cold meal option rather than the hot school meal depending on the time of the year, should make contact with the school meals section of my department to provide details of the proposed changes.

In line with commitments under the Comprehensive Employment Strategy, the Final Evaluation of the Programme was published. </p>  <p>  The current Dormant Accounts Fund Measure to Support the Employment of People with Disabilities was a new employment support measure for people with disabilities. On 30 July last year I announced that 45 projects had been funded up to an amount of &euro;7.6 million. This programme began in September 2021 and runs up to the end of 2022. Prior to applying for this measure, all organisations were notified of the relevant timelines which were clearly indicated in the Call for Applications in April of last year. All 27 organisations who received funding under the former Ability Programme were successful in securing funding under this new measure. </p>  <p>  As I have stated previously, it was agreed that a new employment programme for people with disabilities would be included in the new Operational Programme for Ireland under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) 2021-2027.  This new disability focused employment measure will build on the learnings of the former Ability Programme. The new programme will also need to add complementarity to the suite of existing employment supports targeted at people with disabilities provided by my department and broader national strategies for employment of people with disabilities, including the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities. </p>  <p>  The ESF Managing Authority in Ireland - based in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science - has compiled the Operational Programme for Ireland which has been approved by Government. The Operational Programme has been formally submitted to the European Commission.  It is expected that Commission approval will be communicated in the latter part of the year.  </p>  <p>  Once approval is in place, it is anticipated that the new disability programme will be open by way of a competitive process to applications from organisations across the country, including the organisation referred to by the Deputy, along with the other 26 former Ability Programme organisations.  I should mention that it is envisaged expected that this new ESF+ programme will open to applications in 2023 and not 2024 as is suggested. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the concern he raises is acknowledged and would state that my commitment to providing funding supports to improve the employment possibilities of people with disabilities has not been found wanting to date.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the issue for the Deputy at this time.</p></reply>

These include insurance-based schemes, based on Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions, and means-tested social assistance schemes.   </p>  <p>  The primary disability related social assistance scheme is the Disability Allowance, which is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability who are aged between 16 and 66.  In addition to the means test, in order to be eligible, the disability must be expected to last for at least one year.  The allowance is also subject to a medical assessment and a habitual residency requirement.   </p>  <p>  At the end of June 2022, there were 156,000 recipients of Disability Allowance, including some 14,750 persons in employment / self &ndash;employment while receiving a payment under the scheme. </p>  <p>  The other smaller disability related scheme is the Blind Pension, which is a means tested payment paid to blind people and certain people with low vision, aged between 18 and 66, who are habitually resident in the State.  </p>  <p>  At the end of June 2022, there were 1,014 recipients of the Blind pension, including some 50 persons in employment/self &ndash;employment while receiving a payment under the scheme.</p>  <p>  Both the Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension are structured to support recipients to avail of employment opportunities, be that self-employment or insurable employment. When an individual commences employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week. In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;375, are also disregarded for the purpose of the means test. </p>  <p>  When a customer informs the Department of a commencement of self-employment, a review will not be undertaken for a period of 12 months after the commencement of self-employment.  The Department writes out to the client informing them of this procedure and advising them to keep all receipts etc. as an Officer of the Department will be reviewing earnings in 12 months&rsquo; time.   </p>  <p>  The onus is on customers to inform the Department of any changes in their circumstances. This is provided for in legislation and recipients of the Disability Allowance and Blind pension sign a declaration to this effect when they make their application for the scheme.  An example of a change in circumstances includes where a claimant takes up employment or self-employment.</p>  <p>  When income from employment or self-employment is being assessed it is divided by 52 to ascertain a person&rsquo;s weekly means. The means assessment is intended to reflect the income the person may reasonably be expected to receive during the coming 12 months. Where this is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the last 12 months can be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.  Assessing a person&rsquo;s income in this manner takes account of the fact that some people&rsquo;s income may be irregular, and they will earn more during some periods than others.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that reviews of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension payments are carried out where a claimant requests same, for example where a person is self-employed and experiences a change in their income and/or if s/he feels their payment, under a scheme, needs to be adjusted.  </p>  <p>  It would be rare that a review would be undertaken or requested after six months.</p>  <p>  Separately, the Department also has an important control function, under which systematic, periodic reviews are carried out to confirm that all eligibility conditions (such as household means, medical and habitual residency requirements) continue to be fulfilled and that no disqualifications from receiving such payments have arisen and to avoid situations where overpayments are made.  As above, in this context Officers, when reviewing means as one part of the eligibility requirements, take into account that some people&rsquo;s income may vary (for both persons in self-employment and those in insurable employment) and that they may earn more during some periods than others. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This settlement resolves this long-standing issue through the payment of a once off ex-gratia payment rather than a pension to eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.  On the 23rd December 2021, both unions involved confirmed acceptance of this settlement which will benefit approximately 2,500 people employed by CE schemes going back to 2008. It is estimated to have a total cost of over &euro;24 million. </p>  <p>  Generally, under the terms of this settlement, on reaching retirement age, eligible CE supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex-gratia payment in respect of time employed by CE schemes since 2008.  People who retired since 2008 and who have reached retirement age are now able to apply for this payment.</p>  <p>  Over the past number of months, an administrative and ICT system to accept applications and process payments was put in place within the Department of Social Protection. The first group of  ex-gratia applications have been received - these  relate to persons who retired since 2008.   Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Expenditure and Reform as regards the timing of issuing of these payments.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter. </p></reply>

Every year, more than 100,000 children participate on the universal pre-school programme (ECCE) and the National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidises up to 80,000 children.</p>  <p>  Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, with evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p>  <p>  Data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare, and reduced occupancy among early learning and childcare services.</p>  <p>  My Department has continued to monitor early learning and childcare capacity, with a particular focus on monitoring Covid-19 impacts as public health restrictions have been lifted and on responding to the unmet early learning and childcare needs of families. Data captured earlier this year parallels the pre-Covid-19 context, whereby the supply of early learning and childcare places is meeting demand though there is evidence of undersupply for certain age groups including children under 3, and in certain areas.</p>  <p>  The network of 30 CCC across the country, including Cork, are in a position to match children and families to services operating with vacant places. In addition, CCC have been mobilised to engage proactively with services to identify vacant places and to explore possibilities for expansion among services, particularly where there is unmet need.</p>  <p>  In addition to this, a range of steps are being taken to address issues of under supply.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;70m has been allocated to my Department through the revised National Development Plan (NDP) &ndash; with the majority of this funding earmarked for new places.</p>  <p>  Under the National Action Plan for Childminding, I have committed to opening up access to the NCS to parents who use childminders following the extension of regulation to childminders, which is expected to happen within the first 2-3 years of the Plan.</p>  <p>  My Department, in partnership with the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government, is in the process of updating the 2001 Planning Guidelines for Local Authorities on Early Learning and Childcare Settings.</p>  <p>  Finally, the new Core Funding Scheme, introduced in September, provides funding for services aligned to costs of delivery. This means higher levels of funding is available to services that cater for younger children where costs of delivery are higher. There is already emerging evidence of improved capacity in the sector in response to Core Funding, as demonstrated by a 31% and 261% increase in &lsquo;change in circumstances&rsquo; applications to Tusla from early learning and care and school-age childcare services respectively who are seeking to expand the scale and scope of their provision.</p>  <p>  Parents experiencing difficulty in relation to their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance. Contact details for CCCs may be found on www.myccc.ie.</p></reply>

In general, staffing pressures in the sector are caused not by insufficient supply of qualified personnel, but by high levels of staff turnover, and recruitment and staff retention difficulties are undoubtedly linked to pay and conditions, with for example the average pay in the sector being &euro;12.60 per hour in 2021.  </p><p>As the State does not employ early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners, I cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector.  However, there has recently been an important and historic development with the setting of new minimum hourly rates for various roles in the Early Years Services sector. </p><p>On 15 September 2022, the first ever Employment Regulation Orders for the Early Years Services sector came into effect, setting new minimum hourly rates of pay for various roles in the Early Years Services Sector as follows:</p><p>&euro;13.00 for Early Years Educators/ School-Age Childcare practitioners; </p><p>&euro;14.00 for Early Years Lead Educators / School-Age Childcare co-ordinators; </p><p>&euro;15.50 for Graduate Early Years Lead Educators / School-Age Childcare co-ordinators </p><p>&euro;15.70 for Deputy Managers;</p><p>&euro;16.50 for Managers; and  </p><p>&euro;17.25 for Graduate Managers.</p><p>The Orders are being supported by Government&rsquo;s Core Funding scheme, that I announced as part of Budget 2022, which will see increases in funding to early learning and childcare services to support improvements in staff wages, alongside a commitment to freeze parental fees. The commencement date for the Employment Regulation Orders &ndash; 15 September &ndash; coincided with the official launch of Core Funding.</p><p>It is estimated that 73% of those working in the sector will see their wages rise as a result of the Employment Regulation Orders with the wages of 50% of employees in the sector expected to rise by 10% or more, and the wages of 20% of employees are expected to rise by 20% or more.</p><p>I am also committed to addressing other issues which may impact on the recruitment and retention of staff in the sector. In December 2021, I published &quot;Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC), 2022-2028&quot;. Nurturing Skills aims to strengthen the ongoing process of professionalisation for those working in early learning and care and school-age childcare. One of its five &quot;pillars&quot; comprises commitments aimed at supporting recruitment, retention and diversity in the workforce, and it includes actions to raise the profile of careers in the sector.</p></reply>

It will be submitted to me for decision in due course. </p>  <p>  Applications are processed in chronological order by date received. Due to the high volume of applications currently on hand, regrettably, processing times can be up to 19 months.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.</p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  In 2021, my Department issued 11,512 citizenship decisions, which is the highest number of decisions made since 2015, and reflects positively the significant changes undertaken to date.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: INISOireachtasMail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in the cases where the response is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

This is supported by Central Statistics Office figures on recidivism.  </p><p>Non-custodial sentences, which includes sentencing a person to undertake community service, means that a person can retain links to their community (such as family connections, employment and education) which improves the chances that they will not re-offend.</p><p>This is reflected in the Review of Policy Options for Prison and Penal Reform 2022-2024 which I recently published. Among the issues the review makes recommendations on, is reducing the use of short custodial sentences (especially sentences under 3 months) and exploring how the judiciary can be provided with a greater range of non-custodial sanctions. Community sanctions can play a role in addressing criminality, reducing reoffending and providing protection to the public while holding the individual accountable. Non-custodial sentences, which includes sentencing a person to undertake community service, means that a person can retain links to their own community (e.g. family connections, their job) which improves the chances that they will not re-offend. </p><p>Community Service orders are non-custodial sanctions whereby individuals can be ordered by the sentencing judge to carry out unpaid work in the community, for the benefit of the community, ranging from 40 &ndash; 240 hours in lieu of prison sentences of up to 12 months. </p><p>In 2021, the Probation Service managed a total of 1,360 Community Service Orders (relating to 1,195 people) which totals 203,306 hours work in lieu of 713 years in prison. This equates to over &euro;2 million worth of unpaid work for the benefit of communities nationwide.</p><p>A total of 1,195 people were subject to community service orders in 2021. This was a reduction on the pre-pandemic total of 2,355 in 2019. This reduction was a result of disruption to the work of the Courts and to host sites during this period due to national restrictions.</p><p>The type of work carried out by those on community service in Cavan and Monaghan over the past three years includes litter picking, grass cutting, grounds works in graveyards, the maintenance of green areas in both counties and general maintenance work in local clubs, sports facilities and schools. </p><p>People who are subject to community service orders are supervised by a paid supervisor who works alongside them. Each supervisor may supervise a maximum of eight people subject to orders on any one day</p><p>There are currently 3 community services supervisors working across Cavan and Monaghan. </p><p>The cost of a community service order is calculated at &euro;1,500 per order. </p><p>As requested by the Deputy the table below shows the total number of people who were subject to community service orders from 2019&ndash;2021, and the number of people on community service orders in Cavan-Monaghan in 2019-2021.</p><p>It should be noted that the figures indicate the number of people who were subject to an order in 2021. While individuals begin a community service order in any given year, they may not necessarily complete the order in the same year.</p><p><b>Community Service Orders 2019-2021</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>-</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Total number of people on community service orders nationally</td>       <td>2,355</td>       <td>1,033</td>       <td>1,195</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Number of people on community service orders in Cavan-Monaghan</td>       <td>244</td>       <td>88</td>       <td>151</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The report makes reference to health insurance which is under my responsibility, however due to the community-rated nature of the Irish health insurance market people will not be adversely affected by a history of cancer when purchasing or renewing health insurance. While other types of insurance do not fall under the remit of the Department of Health, I have been advised neither the Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance products. This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).</p><p>  My Department, in conjunction with the HSE&rsquo;s National Cancer Control Programme and voluntary groups such as the Irish Cancer Society, continues to work to improve outcomes for patients through the ongoing implementation of the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026. Ireland is very supportive of Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan, which closely mirrors the goals of Ireland&rsquo;s National Cancer Strategy to reduce the cancer burden, provide optimal care, maximise patient involvement and quality of life, and enable and assure change. </p><p>Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan includes an initiative for 2021-2023 to &ldquo;Address fair access for cancer survivors to financial services (including insurance), via a code of conduct and a reflection on long-term solutions&rdquo;. This work is being undertaken through the EU Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non-Communicable Diseases (SGPP) Subgroup on Cancer, which includes representation from Ireland. The Department of Health will closely monitor any developments at the SGPP Subgroup on Cancer regarding this issue, and will liaise with other Government departments as required.</p><p>  The Irish Cancer Society Report also calls for the Government to ensure additional capacity, resources and funding for the National Cancer Registry of Ireland (NCRI). The Department of Health continues to engage closely with the NCRI to ensure it has the resources to effectively address its core functions, while expanding the cancer patient data it collects and ensuring a focus on increasing and optimising the uses of available data to drive improvements in cancer care for patients, as recommended in the National Cancer Strategy 2017-2026.</p><p>  Through the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy and by working together, with EU Member States, the European Commission and cancer organisations across the EU, we can achieve the aims of Europe&rsquo;s Beating Cancer Plan, to the ultimate benefit of patients and their families.</p></reply>

This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments. This shall cover eligible staff in: </p><p>1. Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2. Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3. Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4. Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5. Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; </p><p>6. Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE. </p><p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention. </p><p>Regarding cohorts 1-4, a contractor is being sought to assist with gathering and processing information, with a tendering deadline of 23 September. Once a contractor is in place and details of the necessary processes are finalised, information will be published for those certain eligible non-HSE/non-Section 38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. Once this information is published, the Department is keen that payments to eligible workers will be made as soon as possible thereafter. It is expected that at that point the Department will be able to give further information on matters such as those raised by the Deputy. </p><p>Regarding cohorts 5 and 6, the Department and HSE are engaging with other Departments involved to progress payments as soon as possible for eligible staff. </p></reply>

This measure will be ring fenced to staff working ordinarily onsite in COVID-19 exposed healthcare environments. This shall cover eligible staff in: </p><p>1.Private Sector Nursing Homes and Hospices (e.g. Private, Voluntary, Section 39 etc.);</p><p>2.Eligible staff working on-site in Section 39 long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities;</p><p>3.Agency roles working in the HSE;</p><p>4.Health Care Support Assistants (also known as home help/home care/home support) contracted to the HSE;</p><p>5.Members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in frontline Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE; </p><p>6.Paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE. </p><p>Rolling out the payment to eligible employees of those specific non-HSE/Section 38 organisations covered by the government decision is a complex task, particularly as these employees are not normally paid by the public health service, duplicate payments need to be avoided, and there are many organisations to be covered, but this work is being given priority attention, and it is expected that timeframes will become clearer in due course. </p><p>Regarding cohorts 1-4, a contractor is being sought to assist with gathering and processing information, with a tendering deadline of 23 September. Once a contractor is in place and details of the necessary processes are finalised, information will be published for those certain eligible non-HSE/non-Section 38 healthcare employees that are covered by the Government Decision and the process available to their employers to implement this measure for their eligible staff. Once this is published, the Department is keen that payments to eligible workers will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p><p>Regarding cohorts 5 and 6, the Department and HSE are engaging with other Departments where applicable to progress payments as soon as possible for eligible staff. </p></reply>

This means that individuals are currently availing of complicated and sometimes risky procedures in what is effectively a legal vacuum.</p>  <p>  Once enacted, this legislation will lead to a specific regulatory framework being put in place in respect of this complex, innovative and fast-moving area of medicine, which is currently predominately provided through the private sector. It will assist people to have children safely, clarify the legal position of children born from AHR, and ensure research and new reproductive technologies are carried out within a prescribed ethical context.</p>  <p>  The provisions outlined within the AHR Bill generally will ensure that AHR practices and related areas of research are conducted in a more consistent and standardised way and with the necessary oversight, but it is specifically the establishment of the AHR Regulatory Authority (or AHRRA) which is of central importance in this regard.</p>  <p>  I am not certain as to whether the Deputy has specific types of AHR &ldquo;techniques and treatments&rdquo; in mind, but it is important to reflect that this regulatory framework will regulate how AHR treatments are provided. In the first instance, for example, the legislation provides for a licensing system in place and treatment providers will be required to hold the requisite licence in order to provide treatments. The AHRRA will oversee and monitor this system, including to ensure that providers operate within the scope of the law and their licence. This regulatory framework will help bring guidance, clarity and peace of mind to service users, as well as providers. </p>  <p>  I wish to reiterate my commitment to progress this much-needed and long-awaited piece of historic legislation as quickly as possible to ensure that a robust regulatory framework for AHR is in place.</p></reply>

I can confirm that I met with the group Care Champions, and some of those who had lost loved ones in the nursing home specified by the Deputy, on Monday 12 July 2021. The concerns raised by family members were heard at the meeting and a comprehensive response issued. </p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised, the position remains that the Department of the Taoiseach are considering options for a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed COVID-19. This evaluation will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic over the past two years. </p>  <p>  I want to again emphasise that throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, particularly those resident in nursing homes. This included the establishment of a structured nursing home support system, in line with National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendations, to provide enhanced supports to public and private nursing homes. A comprehensive package of direct and indirect supports was established in early 2020 and many of these remain active across the country to support nursing homes on a proactive basis.     </p>  <p>  In addition, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established early in the pandemic in May 2020 to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing response. As the Deputy will be aware, significant progress has already been made in implementing the recommendations of the Expert Panel, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, and work to progress medium and longer term reform recommendations is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders. Four Expert Panel Progress Reports have been published to date, the latest published on 21 June 2022, and all Progress Reports are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p></reply>

This new strategy aims to change the way in which day case, scheduled procedures, surgeries, scans and outpatient services can be better arranged to ensure greater capacity in the future and help to address waiting lists. The development of additional capacity will be provided through dedicated, standalone Elective Hospitals in Cork, Galway and Dublin. The Government decision is very clear on this.  No other locations are under active consideration. It is important to note that the locations chosen will allow for new facilities of a size and scale to implement a national elective care programme that will tackle waiting lists on a national basis. This means that the new facilities will be designed to maximise their capacity and in doing so will operate to cover as a wide catchment area as possible, extending beyond existing and future health areas including the mid-west.</p></reply>

A transition period of three years for vessels over 18m targeting sprat was allowed to enable adjustment for these vessels, as the sprat fishery is concentrated inside the six nautical mile zone. </p>  <p>  A Policy Directive was issued by that Minister to the independent Licensing Authority to give effect to these measures. The Policy Directive directed the Licensing Authority to insert a condition to this effect into the licences of affected vessels. </p>  <p>  A Judicial Review to the High Court was taken by two applicant fishermen challenging the validity of the Policy. On 6th October 2020, the Judge held in summary that the High Court&rsquo;s final order should be, among other matters, a declaration that Policy Directive 1 of 2019 was made in breach of fair procedures and is void and/or of no legal effect. The breach of fair procedures as referenced above related to a failure with obligations to consult with the applicants in accordance with, and to the extent required by, the consultation process and in particular by failing to consult with them a second time once a preferred option had been identified. A stay on the order was refused by the High Court on 10th December 2020.  </p>  <p>  The Minister appealed the decision of the High Court to the Court of Appeal. He also sought a stay on the order of the High Court. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Ministerial Policy Directive on 19th March 2021, when the Court was persuaded that the balance of justice leaned in favour of the State and granted a stay on the order of the High Court up until the hearing of the substantive appeal in June. Following a full hearing by the Court of Appeal on 22nd June 2021, the Court decided to temporarily extend the Policy Directive excluding large vessels from trawling in inshore waters within 6 miles of the coast, save for a restricted sprat fishery.  </p>  <p>  On September 23rd, 2021, the Court of Appeal refused the Minister's application to further continue the stay. This refusal means that the decision of the High Court stands and the Policy Directive is no longer valid, meaning vessels over 18 metres in length overall have resumed trawling in the waters inside 6 nautical miles. These vessels also no longer require an authorisation to fish for sprat inside 6 nautical miles. </p>  <p>  The Court of Appeal issued an unapproved judgment on 19th July last and the Department is at present considering the implications of the that unapproved judgment in consultation with its legal advisors. Further submissions to the Court have been requested, these are to be provided by October 7th.</p>  <p>  As this matter continues to be sub judice, the Minister is not in a position to comment further until the matter can be resolved before the Courts. </p></reply>

These Regulations put into law certain requirements for sellers and suppliers of pet animals, including minimum ages for sale of certain mammals; record-keeping; registration with the Department; and provision of certain information about the pet in advertisement. The Regulations were welcomed by welfare organisations and are a support to those thinking of purchasing pet animals.</p>  <p>  Extracts from the Register of Sellers and Suppliers of Pet Animals and the Register of Premises (name of seller or supplier, registration number and the county of the premises used in connection with the sale and supply of pets) are published on the Department's website at: gov.ie/en/publication/d3af4-new-rules-on-the-sale-supply-and-advertising-of-pet-animals/</p>  <p>  The Department's website also has additional guidance for potential pet owners thinking of acquiring a pet, further supporting potential purchasers in making informed decisions. </p>  <p>  While no prosecutions have been taken under these Regulations to date, one registration was revoked this year and two last year. The Department continues to develop its controls in respect of this legislation and is advancing its plans and approach to effective enforcement, working to achieve full compliance with the regulations on advertising pet animals. </p>  <p>  My Department also participates in the Irish Pet Advertising Advisory Group (IPAAG), a group of animal welfare organisations, veterinary professionals and advertising platforms that address issues in relation to advertising pet animals, and engages with advertising platforms both through that group and bilaterally on the regulations.</p>  <p>  A traceability and verification system has been developed by a website advertising dogs in conjunction with a microchipping company. I would encourage all websites to use this system.</p>  <p>  Any evidence of animal cruelty or neglect of an animal&rsquo;s welfare should be brought to the attention of my Department by calling the animal welfare helpline on 076 1064408 (Call Save) or 01 6072379 or by emailing: animalwelfare@agriculture.gov.ie</p></reply>

Initial meetings of the group have taken place and the focus will be on regulating the keeping, breeding and trading of exotic animals.</p></reply>

On Monday 19<sup>th</sup>inst. I introduced regulations under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 requiring flock keepers to apply specific biosecurity measures against HPAI, irrespective of flock size. These measures apply to all flock owners, even if they only have one or two birds. To further enhance biosecurity in larger flocks there are additional measures in respect of flocks of 500 birds or more. These biosecurity measures help mitigate the risk of infection of poultry with the virus. Details of the regulations and guidance documents are published on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>In addition, my officials are advising poultry owners to be bio-security aware when returning from areas, both at home and abroad, where sick or dead wild birds have been present. Clothing and footwear worn in areas where sick or dead wild birds have been present should never be brought into contact with poultry without proper cleaning and disinfection as this may spread disease. </p><p>All poultry flock owners are being reminded to remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks, maintain strict biosecurity measures and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Regional Veterinary Office. </p><p>My Department has implemented a comprehensive awareness programme on social media and is in regular contact with stakeholders: holding meetings, issuing regular updates on the AI situation in Ireland, the UK and continental Europe. In addition, a considerable amount of information and guidance has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website, gov.ie/en/publication/50ce4-avian-influenza-bird-flu/, which is of use to both those involved in the poultry industry and members of the public</p><p>My Department liaises closely with the authorities in the UK and elsewhere in relation to monitoring and controlling avian influenza outbreaks.</p></reply>
