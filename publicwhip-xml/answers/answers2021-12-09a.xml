I have engaged extensively with stakeholders on the future of CAP, including on supports to promote gender equality, and the development of the new CSP continues in advance of the end-of-year deadline.</p>  <p>  Some 45 submissions on the need to increase supports for women in agriculture were received as part of the public consultation on the proposed draft interventions for the CSP. My Department has taken these submissions into consideration, resulting in some new innovative proposals to promote gender equality in the draft CSP.  </p>  <p>  The package of measures includes: an increased rate of grant aid of 60% for women aged 40-55 years under Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Schemes (TAMS); women-only Knowledge Transfer (KT) Groups; and a call under the European Innovation Partnerships (EIP) initiative for proposals to examine women&rsquo;s participation in agriculture.</p>  <p>  We recently launched a Public Consultation on the draft Environmental Report on the draft CSP. To date, some 29 submissions on supports for women in agriculture have been received and these will be considered as part of the process to finalise the CSP in advance of the end-of-year deadline. Consultation is also continuing via the CAP Consultative Committee and through bilateral meetings with representative bodies, including the Women in Agriculture Stakeholders Group. </p>  <p>  In addition, the new stakeholder-led strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, Food Vision 2030, recognises the important contribution of women to the sector's long-term sustainability and includes a number of actions to promote and improve gender balance at all levels, and proposes holding a national dialogue on women in agriculture. </p>  <p>  More can be done on this important issue and I am committed to delivering greater equality in the Irish agri-food sector.  </p></reply>

This new sectoral forum will take a strategic view of supporting the development of the sector and contribute to our over arching objective of our Food Vision 2030 strategy, that Ireland will become a world leader in sustainable food systems over the next decade.</p><p>I am clear that the successor to the Beef Taskforce will be one that will look to put beef farming on a firm footing well into the future.</p></reply>

The principal objective of Coillte is to carry out the business of forestry but this also involves providing recreational facilities to the general public throughout its estate of 440,000 hectares. In addition, 20% of Coillte forests are now managed for the protection of biodiversity and habitats.</p>  <p>  The recreation and amenity value of Coillte Forests has also grown considerably over recent years and, in fact, Coillte is the largest providers of outdoor recreation in Ireland.  Coillte manages approximately 6,000 forest properties nationwide and operate an open forest policy which welcomes all walkers to Coillte lands according to the Leave No Trace principles.  Over 18 million individual visits are made to Coillte forests every year with the visitor numbers increasing by 40% during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, Coillte operates 12 forest parks nationwide, along with 260 recreational forests and include over 3,000km of way marked walking trails.</p>  <p>  On their specific plans for the areas mentioned, I have asked  Coillte to respond directly to the Deputy. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-09a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900051#WRA02300"><p>I am a strong supporter of generational renewal and the need to support young farmers as way of ensuring we have the best and brightest enter the sector.  </p>  <p>  The challenge of generational renewal is widely recognised both at national and EU level with the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) citing it as one of its nine key objectives. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to support younger farmers and also to resolve the issue of support for the category known as the &lsquo;forgotten farmers&rsquo;. Food Vision 2030, the new stakeholder-led strategy for the agri-food sector, also highlights the challenge of generational renewal and proposes a number of actions, including maintaining the strong level of current support, the promotion of land mobility &amp;amp; succession planning and increased education &amp;amp; promotion of the diversity of careers in the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  This reflects the need to ensure a vibrant agricultural sector equipped with skilled and innovative young farmers to respond to societal demands for quality food and environmental public goods. We all agree that facilitating generational renewal is critical to ensure a bright future for the agri-food sector. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there are a range of measures both in the existing CAP and at national level that support younger farmers and facilitate generational renewal. Under the current CAP, the Young Farmers Scheme with payments of &euro;110m benefitting over 8,000 farmers each year, and the National Reserve with &euro;35 million allocated since 2015, provide financial support to young farmers during the crucial early years of setting up a farm enterprise. </p>  <p>  Additionally, under the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, young farmers can avail of a 60% grant rate as compared to the standard rate of 40% and over &euro;133m has been paid to over 5,000 farmers to date. Additional support to young farmers is provided under the Collaborative Farming Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  These partnership structures are further supported through the availability of a tax credit at national level of &euro;25,000 over five years to assist with the transfer of farms within &ldquo;Succession Farm Partnerships&rdquo;, promoting and supporting the earlier intergenerational transfer of family farms.</p>  <p>  In addition, at national level, strong taxation measures assist land mobility and facilitate succession and are worth some &euro;200 million per annum., Long-Term Leasing Income Tax Relief has been an important driver of land mobility by providing access to land and security of tenure for younger farmers and a route to retirement for older farmers. Almost 11,000 beneficiaries were supported under this measure in 2018 costing &euro;27.2 million. </p>  <p>  On access to finance, the Future Growth Loan Scheme was developed with assisting young farmers among its objectives and has been in great demand, with 1,294 loans to the value of  &euro;155.5 million sanctioned to farmers. In addition, Teagasc's education activities continue to focus on equipping young farmers with the necessary knowledge to build successful careers.</p>  <p>  In terms of the new CAP Strategic Plan (CSP), as the Deputy will be aware, my Department and I have been actively engaging with stakeholders throughout the process of developing the new plan. The SWOT analysis and Needs Assessment helped to shape the CSP draft interventions that were followed by a five-week public consultation in September 2021, with over 1,000 responses received. We have recently launched a Public Consultation on the draft Environmental Report on the draft CSP in November 2021 and submissions are being considered as the CSP is being finalised. Consultation is also continuing via the CAP Consultative Committee and through bilateral meetings with the main representative bodies. </p>  <p>  Under the current CSP proposals, Ireland will implement the Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme in the new CAP programme, dedicating some 3% of the direct payments ceiling to help young farmers establish their farming businesses. This allocation of approximately &euro;35m per year will see qualifying young farmers benefit on a per hectare basis which will be more advantageous to young farmers than the current system, which was linked to payment entitlements. </p>  <p>  The proposed rate will significantly increase from approximately &euro;70/ha in the current programme to over &euro;170/ha, with a maximum payment area of 50 hectares and payment on all eligible hectares, even those without corresponding entitlements. In tandem with this, we will also implement the National Reserve in each year of the new CAP to fund at a minimum the mandatory categories of young farmers and new entrants to farming.</p>  <p>  In addition, a higher grant rate for qualified young farmers is proposed under the capital investment measure proposed under the CSP. The CSP will also continue to provide support for collaborative farming and will propose innovative ways to advise older farmers on succession and retirement options, which will increase the availability of land for younger farmers.</p>  <p>  I am examining options to address the issue of forgotten farmers, both through the next CAP and also through other measures outside of the CAP. I have asked my officials to examine all the options in order to support this cohort of farmers.  </p>  <p>  My Department and I are committed to supporting initiatives to facilitate generational renewal and will continue to engage with stakeholders to find the best approaches to support young farmers to ensure a bright future for the sector. </p></reply>

My Department's Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) system records and maintains the identification and movement data in respect of cattle and other livestock in accordance with the requirements of EU and national law.</p><p>With regard to the blockchain concept and its applicability to the beef sector, I would agree that this technology certainly has potential for the future. I know some sectors are further advanced than others in examining the benefits such a blockchain approach could bring. It is important that we examine all options open to us to futureproof the sector. </p><p>However, I have no current plans to develop a State owned and controlled blockchain in any sector.  In the first instance, any proof of concept or feasibility analysis with respect to implementing blockchain in the beef supply chain would need to be driven primarily by the sector supply chain actors,  to ensure appropriate buy-in and successful implementation.  </p><p>Secondly, in terms of my Department's regulatory role, as I have outlined this already operates in full compliance with EU and national legislation, and it is unclear what additionality, if any, blockchain could bring to these regulatory requirements. </p><p>More generally, the Deputy will be aware that I have taken a number of important initiatives aimed at increasing transparency in the food supply chain. In early September I signed into law a Statutory Instrument which will give effect in Irish law to additional price reporting obligations which will aim to improve food market price transparency in the EU.  <i></i></p><p><i></i>I believe increased price reporting to be an important tool, along with other initiatives including the establishment of the Unfair Trading Practices (UTP) Enforcement Authority, and support for Producer Organisations, in strengthening the position of primary producers.  <i></i></p><p>My Department is also progressing the drafting of legislation needed to establish the new Office of the Food Ombudsman or equivalent, which will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland, as well as enforcing the UTP Directive. </p><p>Preparations are currently under way to establish a new stakeholder engagement forum on the key strategic issues facing the beef sector and further details will be announced in due course.

I have engaged extensively with stakeholders on the future of CAP, including on supports to promote gender equality, and the development of the new CSP continues in advance of the end-of-year deadline.</p>  <p>  Some 45 submissions on the need to increase supports for women in agriculture were received as part of the public consultation on the proposed draft interventions for the CSP. My Department has taken these submissions into consideration, resulting in some new innovative proposals to promote gender equality in the draft CSP.  </p>  <p>  The package of measures includes: an increased rate of grant aid of 60% for women aged 40-55 years under Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Schemes (TAMS); women-only Knowledge Transfer (KT) Groups; and a call under the European Innovation Partnerships (EIP) initiative for proposals to examine women&rsquo;s participation in agriculture.</p>  <p>  We recently launched a Public Consultation on the draft Environmental Report on the draft CSP. To date, some 29 submissions on supports for women in agriculture have been received and these will be considered as part of the process to finalise the CSP in advance of the end-of-year deadline.

More recently, Coillte has developed and taken an innovative approach, known as BioClass, in assessing biodiversity resource on the estate.  This process identifies over 20,000 hectares of this biodiversity resource to be of international and national importance.</p>  <p>  Coillte is developing detailed ecological enhancement and restoration plans for its high biodiversity value areas. The first of these plans are now being implemented, which can involve the removal of invasive species, improvements to site hydrology, underplanting with native species and implementation of low impact silvicultural systems in these ecologically important areas.</p>  <p>  In addition, they are converting some of their forests from the principal objective of wood production to that of biodiversity and recreation in targeted areas.  A good example of these conversion projects is the &lsquo;Dublin Mountain Makeover&rsquo; where hundreds of hectares of forests in the Dublin mountains are converted to native woodlands and mixed forest, through remove and replant felling and continuous forest cover management systems. </p>  <p>  More generally when it comes to its remit, As the Deputy may be aware, Coillte is a private limited company established under the Forestry Act 1988.  The Act provides, among other things, that a principal object of the company is to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices. The company is self-financing and is not the recipient of Exchequer funding, and indeed has a responsibility to return a profit and make dividend payments to the state in addition to delivering on the State's forestry priorities. </p>  <p>  In order to meet this remit Coillte currently operates across various business strands including forestry, land management, panel products and renewable energy businesses. The company manages an estate of some 440,000 hectares of which just under 400,000 hectares is forested. </p>  <p>  But, as I have already demonstrated, that is not to say that the company focuses solely on commercial activities. For instance 20% of Coillte forests are managed for the protection of biodiversity and habitats. It is my understanding that as part of an ongoing process of updating and refreshing their strategy, Coillte is constantly seeking opportunities to play a role in finding solutions to the biodiversity and climate emergencies.</p>  <p>  In this regard, Coillte is supporting a series of specific initiatives that provide benefits in these areas. For example,  Coillte&rsquo;s forest estate provides a valuable carbon sink by sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere.  </p>  <p>  Further detailed analysis of carbon sequestration and carbon storage on their forest estate is being carried out, using the best expertise and latest technology, to ensure that capture of carbon in both forests and soils is optimized.</p>  <p>  Coillte also has ambitions to deliver new afforestation projects at scale.  One current example of this is the &lsquo;Midlands Native Woodlands Project&rsquo;, where Coillte is partnering with Bord na Mona to create new native woodlands on ecologically suitable areas of cut-away bog.  Another example is the recently launched &lsquo;Nature Partners' initiative, where Coillte has a formed a partnership to attract investors to help in creating new native woodlands across the country.</p></reply>

Galway who wishes to plant trees, a forest owner in Co. Wicklow who wishes to fell their crop or Coillte, who wishes to supply sawmills with product from their estate. Each licence has a value particularly to the rural economy where the timber is harvested, transported and processed. </p>  <p>  This is what I am working towards and is the reason I set up Project Woodland earlier this year to resolve our licensing difficulties.   </p>  <p>  That is why we have also invested heavily in additional resources and in process improvements, alongside Project Woodland, to increase licence output. This has had the desired effect with a marked increase in licences issued in recent months.  In fact, we are now well on the way to reaching our target of 4,000 licences this year, with 3,718 issued up to last Friday.</p>  <p>  Much of that output has been felling licences, which reflects the number of felling licence applications we receive as opposed to forest roads and afforestation licence applications. To the end November this year, we received 3,445 tree felling licence applications, split between 2,294 Coillte and 1,151 private applications. </p>  <p>  My Department has issued 1,229 private felling licences and 1,406 to Coillte. This highlights that overall there is no great disparity this year between both Coillte and private licences.</p>  <p>  This means that the greater output for Coillte reflects the number of felling licences lodged by them.  They of course are responsible for the mature national forest estate and represent 75% of national supply of logs to sawmills.</p>  <p>  Afforestation licensing is not moving at the pace any of us would like to see and is now our main focus. Afforestation licences by their nature are more complex to assess and approve and we have dedicated 10 ecologists now solely to afforestation licensing. This allied to better systems process being implemented will give us a higher level of output than before. </p>  <p>  Overall, I believe that recent gains in output shows that we are moving in the right direction.  It is my intention to build on this momentum in 2022, and I am hopeful that further improvements can be made on foot of the system analysis and regulatory review being carried out under Project Woodland. </p></reply>

I know this will be a challenge for many farmers in 2022. </p>  <p>  The fertiliser market is largely driven by global supply and demand and, while there are a number of factors influencing fertiliser price, the major driving factors for the increase in prices are increased global demand due to strong growth in agricultural commodity prices, rising production costs due to increased raw material and energy costs, protectionism by global players and issues with supply for certain fertiliser products.  </p>  <p>  At the November Agriculture and Fisheries Council, I raised the increasing challenge faced by farmers due to the rising costs of inputs. I called on the EU Commission to consider all options to ease the pressure on farmers at this time, including the question of whether the imposition of anti-dumping duties on fertiliser imports continues to be appropriate and for this matter to be examined as a priority.</p>  <p>  I subsequently wrote to the EU Commissioner for Agriculture requesting that the Commissions assessment of the ongoing appropriateness of anti-dumping duties on fertilisers is completed as a matter of priority. Just last week, I wrote to the EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski asking him to finalise the Commission&rsquo;s examination of the tariffs. </p>  <p>  I engage regularly with the farming organisations and have introduced a number of initiatives to support farmers reduce their dependence on fertiliser including a new initiative to support the planting of multi-species swards and a pilot Soil Sampling Programme.  Additionally, I have tasked Teagasc with developing a roadmap for farmers to reduce the use of chemical fertilisers on farms. I expect to be able to publish this report before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The impact of rising fertiliser prices on the competitiveness of the farming sector will continue to be closely monitored by officials in my Department.</p></reply>

I have secured funding for the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) to meet this commitment by increasing the budget to &euro;21 million in 2022, up from &euro;16 million last year with another &euro;2 million for further organic sector development measures. This builds on the reopening of the scheme in 2021 and means we are continuously taking in new entrants to organic farming. </p>  <p>  This additional funding for the Organic Farming Scheme aims to provide for an extra fifty thousand hectares converting to organic production in 2022. The number of farmers expected to enter the OFS in 2022 depends on the number of hectares each brings into the Scheme. An additional fifty thousand hectares, as provided for in the Budget, would represent an increase in excess of 50% in the area currently farmed organically and takes us further along the route to the goal of 7.5% land cover.</p>  <p>  At the same time, I will also be continuing to progress the implementation of the National Organic Strategy 2019-2025 which sets out ambitious growth targets for the sector by aligning it closely with market opportunities.</p>  <p>  In addition to the Organic Farming Scheme, my Department will provide funding for other supports for organic farmers, such as the Organic Capital Investment Scheme and the Organic Processing Investment Grant Scheme. Initiatives to assist in the development of the sector such as the Organic Demonstration Farm Programme and other training and education projects will also be funded. </p>  <p>  I am committed to the growth of organic farming in Ireland and I believe that the supports which I have provided will assist in achieving our targets. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-09a.85.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900052#WRB02500"><p>I am a strong supporter of generational renewal and the need to support young farmers as way of ensuring we have the best and brightest enter the sector.  </p>  <p>  The challenge of generational renewal is widely recognised both at national and EU level with the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) citing it as one of its nine key objectives.  Food Vision 2030, the new stakeholder-led strategy for the agri-food sector, also highlights the challenge of generational renewal and proposes a number of actions, including maintaining the strong level of current support, the promotion of land mobility &amp;amp; succession planning and increased education &amp;amp; promotion of the diversity of careers in the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  This reflects the need to ensure a vibrant agricultural sector equipped with skilled and innovative young farmers to respond to societal demands for quality food and environmental public goods. We all agree that facilitating generational renewal is critical to ensure a bright future for the agri-food sector.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there are a range of measures both in the existing CAP and at national level that support younger farmers and facilitate generational renewal. Under the current CAP, the Young Farmers Scheme with payments of &euro;110m benefitting over 8,000 farmers each year, and the National Reserve with &euro;35 million allocated since 2015, provide financial support to young farmers during the crucial early years of setting up a farm enterprise. </p>  <p>  Additionally, under the TAMS II Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme, young farmers can avail of a 60% grant rate as compared to the standard rate of 40% and over &euro;133m has been paid to over 5,000 farmers to date. Additional support to young farmers is provided under the Collaborative Farming Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  These partnership structures are further supported through the availability of a tax credit at national level of &euro;25,000 over five years to assist with the transfer of farms within &ldquo;Succession Farm Partnerships&rdquo;, promoting and supporting the earlier intergenerational transfer of family farms.</p>  <p>  In addition, at national level, strong taxation measures assist land mobility and facilitate succession and are worth some &euro;200 million per annum., Long-Term Leasing Income Tax Relief has been an important driver of land mobility by providing access to land and security of tenure for younger farmers and a route to retirement for older farmers. Almost 11,000 beneficiaries were supported under this measure in 2018 costing &euro;27.2 million.</p>  <p>  On access to finance, the Future Growth Loan Scheme was developed with assisting young farmers among its objectives and has been in great demand, with 1,294 loans to the value of  &euro;155.5 million sanctioned to farmers. In addition, Teagasc's education activities continue to focus on equipping young farmers with the necessary knowledge to build successful careers.</p>  <p>  In terms of the new CAP Strategic Plan (CSP), as the Deputy will be aware, my Department and I have been actively engaging with stakeholders throughout the process of developing the new plan. The SWOT analysis and Needs Assessment helped to shape the CSP draft interventions that were followed by a five-week public consultation in September 2021, with over 1,000 responses received. We have recently launched a Public Consultation on the draft Environmental Report on the draft CSP in November 2021 and submissions are being considered as the CSP is being finalised. Consultation is also continuing via the CAP Consultative Committee and through bilateral meetings with the main representative bodies.</p>  <p>  Under the current CSP proposals, Ireland will implement the Young Farmers&rsquo; Scheme in the new CAP programme, dedicating some 3% of the direct payments ceiling to help young farmers establish their farming businesses. This allocation of approximately &euro;35m per year will see qualifying young farmers benefit on a per hectare basis which will be more advantageous to young farmers than the current system, which was linked to payment entitlements. </p>  <p>  The proposed rate will significantly increase from approximately &euro;70/ha in the current programme to over &euro;170/ha, with a maximum payment area of 50 hectares and payment on all eligible hectares, even those without corresponding entitlements. In tandem with this, we will also implement the National Reserve in each year of the new CAP to fund at a minimum the mandatory categories of young farmers and new entrants to farming.</p>  <p>  In addition, a higher grant rate for qualified young farmers is proposed under the capital investment measure proposed under the CSP. The CSP will also continue to provide support for collaborative farming and will propose innovative ways to advise older farmers on succession and retirement options, which will increase the availability of land for younger farmers.</p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting initiatives to facilitate generational renewal and will continue to engage with stakeholders to find the best approaches to support young farmers to ensure a bright future for the sector. </p></reply>

However, it is crucial that we do this is a way that maintains food production. </p><p>Earlier this year I launched the Food Vision 2030 strategy which has signalled an intention to reduce methane emissions by 10% by 2030. This level of reduction will be needed to contribute to the sector's climate goals. </p><p>As outlined in the Climate Action Plan<i>,</i>the main way to reduce methane emissions from a pasture-based production system in the medium term is to transition the beef system to a system of earlier finishing of animals. Currently prime beef cattle are slaughtered at 27 months and this can be reduced to 24 months over the course of the decade. </p><p>This will require support for breeding improvements but also a critical engagement by the beef processing sector to encourage and support farmers to finish their animals earlier and I continue to engage with them on this important matter. </p><p>New technology will also play a role, I note with interest a feed additive to reduce methane emissions was recently approved by the European Food Safety Authority. As carbon farming models are developed across the EU over the coming years, there is no reason why methane cannot be part of this discussion. </p><p>The 2021 Climate Action plan includes a commitment by my Department to explore the development of a carbon farming model and I intend to progress this commitment.

My Department and Bord Bia play an ongoing role in identifying and developing markets and  engaging with key trading partners to enhance the global market share of Irish agri-food produce. Trade missions, facilitated by my Department, Bord Bia, and the Embassy network, are essential in developing market opportunities in international markets.</p>  <p>  Bord Bia has shown great agility since the start of the pandemic in translating the key components of trade missions into a virtual format.  Minister of State Martin Heydon, who has specific responsibility for new market development, and I have participated in a range of virtual events and meetings with key trade customers.  </p>  <p>  Most recently, we have participated in virtual events organised by Bord Bia promoting Irish dairy and meat exports to West Africa, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, China and Japan. Those markets were chosen because of their strategic importance for Irish agri-food exports and I have been hugely impressed by the level of engagement and interest from customers in our quality food and drink offering.</p>  <p>  Opening and enhancing access to international markets is typically a lengthy process with negotiations often taking several years before bilateral agreements are concluded and trade can commence. Nonetheless we have made significant progress in diversification of markets. For example, I was pleased last week with the announcement that the US ban on sheep meat exports from the EU has been lifted. My officials will now engage with US authorities on the next steps to full access and to ensure that Irish sheepmeat exports to this valuable market will be able to commence as soon as possible. </p></reply>

This is my commitment as Minister with responsibility for the area and all of our organic policies are designed to achieving this very ambitious goal. </p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department continues to implement the actions outlined in the National Organic Strategy 2019-2025 to develop the organic sector in Ireland. This sets out ambitious growth targets in line with the market opportunities that exist in the sector and there are a number of actions in there for all stakeholders including agencies under my Department. </p>  <p>  As an example of my commitment, I have also secured an increase in budget allocation for the Organic Farming Scheme in 2022 from &euro;16 million to &euro;21 million. This would facilitate an additional fifty thousand hectares of land under conversion. This would represent an increase of over 50% in the area currently farmed organically.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have also proposed the allocation of &euro;256 under the next CAP for the organic farming scheme. The Department is continuing to develop the CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027 based on this level of funding.

It is currently being proposed that eligible female farmers are those:</p>  <p>-  Aged between 18 years of age and 55 at any time during the calendar year in which she submits an  application for support;</p>  <p>-  Meet the conditions for being head and having control of the holding;</p>  <p>-  Meets the requirements for the appropriate training and/or skills required at the time of applications.</p>  <p>  Applicants who do not meet the criteria above will still remain eligible to submit an application under the On-Farm Capital investment scheme at the standard rate of 40%. No decision has been made on the details of how registered farm partnerships will operate under the new On-Farm Capital Investment scheme.</p>  <p>  Measures in the CSP are complemented by the new stakeholder strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, Food Vision 2030, which recognises the important contribution of women to the sector's long-term sustainability and includes a number of actions to promote and improve gender balance at all levels. It also proposes holding a national dialogue on women in agriculture. I have asked my officials to prioritise this dialogue for next year.</p>  <p>  More can be done on this important issue and I am committed to delivering greater equality in the Irish agri-food sector.</p></reply>

Through the afforestation scheme my Department supports the creation including those small afforestation projects, once the area is at least 0.1 of a hectare. A wide variety of tree species can be planted under the afforestation scheme which includes tree species that have the ability to maximise sequestration in a sustainable manner. </p>  <p>  I encourage all our stakeholders to work with my Department to substantially increase our afforestation rates over the next decade.</p></reply>

BEAM was funded by a combination of &euro;50 million EU aid and Exchequer support. </p>  <p>  It was provided to support Irish beef farmers who saw beef prices fall in light of market disturbance.  Just over 33,000 applicants received some &euro;77.86 million under the scheme with 64% of each payment coming from EU funds and the remaining 36% from Exchequer funds.</p>  <p>  One of the conditions under which the &euro;50 million was granted by the European Commission was that there had to be an element of reduction or re-structuring built into the scheme. This was set out clearly within Article 1 (3) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019 / 1132 of 2 July 2019. In that context, BEAM participants agreed to reduce the production of bovine livestock manure nitrogen on their holding by 5% for the reduction period 1st July 2020 to 30th June 2021 as compared to the reference period 1st July 2018 to 30 June 2019. </p>  <p>  I secured flexibility around the deadline for meeting the 5% reduction after I engaged with the European Commission. Accordingly I introduced an option to allow participants choose an alternative reduction period of 1st January 2021 to 31th December 2021 over which a BEAM participant could meet their 5% reduction requirement. This was done to give BEAM participants every chance of meeting their requirements under the scheme. This option remained open until 21st June 2021 with more than 16,000 applying for the later reduction period.. </p>  <p>  When the original reduction period ended on 30th June 2021, it was identified that approximately 5,300 of those approximately 16,000 BEAM participants who had opted to defer had in fact met all their BEAM commitments including the 5% bovine nitrates reduction. The Department therefore removed them from the later reduction period. Almost 19,000 BEAM participants did meet the commitments they entered into under section 7 of the terms and conditions and thus exited the scheme successfully in August 2021. </p>  <p>  A further 3,627 participants who had not opted to defer did not meet some or all the commitments they entered into under section 7 of the Terms and Conditions of the scheme and thus faced either a partial or full recoupment of monies received under the scheme. </p>  <p>  The total value of these recoupments was &euro;5.27 million with &euro;3.37 million to be returned to the EU and &euro;1.9 million to be returned to the Exchequer in line with the ratio of 64% to 36% under which they were initially paid. </p>  <p>  These 3,627 BEAM participants were given the right to appeal. This left approximately 10,500 BEAM participants who opted to defer and who had not met the 5% bovine nitrates reduction requirement and thus are now within the alternative reduction period of 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021. </p>  <p>  These participants continue to receive a monthly letter from my Department (as all participants have done since February 2021) outlining the amount of nitrates they have already used (accumulated), the amount of nitrates they have left if they are to meet their 5% reduction and a projection based on the livestock numbers on their holding of their final nitrates position at the end of the reduction period. </p>  <p>  The final review of the scheme will be in February 2022 when compliance and administrative checks on those BEAM participants who opted to defer will be conducted. Separately the Scheme was the subject of a European Commission audit in November 2020. The scheme is also subject to audit by my Department&rsquo;s own internal auditors and  external audit by the Certification Body for my Department. </p></reply>

The plan will provide funding of just over &euro;9.8 billion to support viable farm incomes and enhance competitiveness, to strengthen the socio-economic fabric of rural areas, and to contribute to the achievement of environmental and climate objectives at national and EU levels.  </p>  <p>  The CAP will work hand-in-hand with the Food Vision 2030 strategy, which sets out a pathway to Ireland becoming a world leader in Sustainable Food Systems over the next decade. By adopting an integrated food systems approach, Ireland will become a global leader of innovation for sustainable food and agriculture systems, producing safe, nutritious, and high-value food while protecting and enhancing our natural resources and contributing to vibrant rural and coastal communities within the national economy.</p>  <p>  With a focus on the marketplace together with a continuing reduction in the carbon footprint of our produce, I am very confident that we will continue the transition to become even more sustainable, with benefits for water, air quality, biodiversity, our farmers and our consumers. The supports available under the CAP will have a central role to play in this transition.</p></reply>

It has been widely used as a core part of the TB eradication programme in Ireland since 2015, following many years of research and testing in specific problem herds. </p>  <p>  As with tests for many other diseases, none of the tests currently available allow a perfectly accurate determination of the M. bovis infection status of cattle.  </p>  <p>  The single intradermal comparative tuberculin skin test is universally regarded as the best screening test in a general population of animals. However, in a group of animals where TB infection is known to be present, the gamma interferon test is used because it detects infection at an earlier stage; in other words, it has higher 'sensitivity' than the skin test. When used alongside the skin test, the gamma interferon blood test can help to resolve TB problems in a herd more quickly by identifying cattle at an early stage, before they can spread infection onwards.    </p>  <p>  However, the gamma interferon test is not suitable for use as a general screening test in the way the skin test is used, because it has lower 'specificity'. Using it in herds not thought to be TB-infected would result in more false positive results. </p>  <p>  The gamma interferon test is used as standard in herds that have experienced a significant TB breakdown (for example, five or more reactors, 5% of the herd, or where necessary on epidemiological grounds). The gamma interferon test is also used as a quality control measure on skin test reactors. </p>  <p>  Under the new Bovine TB Eradication Strategy, the gamma interferon test is used to reduce the risk posed by animals that yield inconclusive results to the skin test. Other policies being developed under the TB Eradication Strategy, focusing on herds with chronic or recurrent TB problems, will also use the gamma interferon test as appropriate.  </p></reply>

These were part of a series of meetings I had with seafood and marine stakeholders during my trip to County Kerry, which also included visits to Fenit and Cromane.</p>  <p>  In Dingle, I had constructive discussions with fishers operating both offshore and inshore of our southwest coast. Among the issues raised by these fishers was their submissions to the Seafood Sector Task Force and their requests for financial supports in light of impacts from Brexit and COVID-19. I received the Final Report of the Task Force in October, and I am examining its recommendations with a view to implementing a comprehensive response to these impacts on our fishing sector and coastal communities.</p>  <p>  Some fishers in Dingle raised the issue of rates and charges for services at the Fishery Harbour Centre there. I have asked my Department to reflect on these, as the current rates and charges order is dated. A public consultation would be required on any proposals in that regard.</p>  <p>  A query also was raised regarding the minimum mesh size for the hake fishery. I can advise that Ireland would not support any changes that reduce mesh sizes, as indicated in the Programme for Government, where there is a clear ambition to protect fish stocks and ensure a sustainable hake fishery in the longer-term.</p>  <p>  The porcupine nephrops fishery was also discussed. Consultation on this fishery, involving fishing industry representatives, takes place at the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC). The QMAC makes regular recommendations to me regarding managing the quota for this fishery. </p>  <p>  As you will appreciate, I continue to consider the views and concerns of our fishers and other stakeholders on an ongoing basis.

I fully appreciate that this is a very disappointing outturn, especially given that our national target is 8,000 hectares.  </p>  <p>  However, there are 5,000 hectares of approved forestry licences issued and ready for use. I would encourage anyone with a valid afforestation licence to plant their land, thereby accessing generous annual premiums and 100% establishment grants. </p>  <p>  I am aware that significant increases in afforestation will be required over the next decade. I know  that delays in issuing licences may be a contributory factor in terms of interest in planting.

Gender equality is also a key objective of the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals and a priority for me, as Minister. </p>  <p>  I am pleased therefore to be proposing the highest level of direct supports for women farmers in any CAP programme in Ireland. In addition to the TAMs proposal, these include women-only Knowledge Transfer (KT) Groups; and a call under the European Innovation Partnerships (EIP) initiative for proposals to examine women&rsquo;s participation in agriculture.</p>  <p>  On the new CAP Strategic Plan (CSP), my Department has been actively engaging with stakeholders throughout the process of developing the new plan. The SWOT analysis and Needs assessment helped to shape the CSP draft interventions that were then followed by a five-week public consultation in September 2021 with over 1,000 responses received. </p>  <p>  The proposed On-Farm Capital investment Scheme is in the process of development and is subject to the formal approval of the European Commission. As outlined in the draft CSP, it provides for a general grant rate of 40% for eligible investments. It is also proposed in the CSP that eligible female farmers, who meet the eligibility criteria may qualify for grant aid at a rate of 60%. It is currently being proposed that eligible female farmers are those:</p>  <p>-  Aged between 18 years of age and 55 at any time during the calendar year in which she submits an application for support;</p>  <p>-  Meet the conditions for being head and having control of the holding;</p>  <p>-  Meets the requirements for the appropriate training and/or skills required at the time of applications.</p>  <p>  Applicants who do not meet the criteria above will still remain eligible to submit an application under the On-Farm Capital investment scheme at the standard rate of 40%. No decision has been made on the details of how registered farm partnerships will operate under the new On-Farm Capital Investment scheme.</p>  <p>  Measures in the CSP are complemented by the new stakeholder strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, Food Vision 2030, which recognises the important contribution of women to the sector's long-term sustainability and includes a number of actions to promote and improve gender balance at all levels. It also proposes holding a national dialogue on women in agriculture. I have asked my officials to prioritise this dialogue for next year. </p>  <p>  More can be done on this important issue and I am committed to delivering greater equality in the Irish agri-food sector.</p></reply>

These options are currently being developed under the CAP Strategic Plan in consultation with all relevant stakeholders including farmers and land managers.</p><p>One route currently being examined under the CAP Strategic Plan is through the establishment of an eco-schemes incentive that would make up a proportion of Pillar I direct payments conditional on additional environmental action.  Additional environmental action will also be encouraged through voluntary participation in results-based schemes established in Pillar II Rural Development Programme Schemes.  </p><p>The potential to reward farmers for their carbon sequestration activities is also recognised under the recently updated All-of-Government Climate Action Plan 2021 which commits government to, &ldquo;explore the development of a carbon farming model&rdquo;. Officials within my Department are currently exploring how an enabling framework for carbon farming can be developed and although this work is at an early stage the potential rewards for farmers, and society in general, are clear.</p><p>To help establish the required baseline data required for a carbon sequestration reward model, I have provided funding through my Department, for initiatives such as the establishment of the National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory, the Pilot Soil Sampling Programme and the Farm Environmental Scheme along with a number of European Innovation Partnership (EIP) research projects based on peatsoils, to provide the required data for the development of future policy options in this area.</p><p>My Department already supports sequestration through afforestation including agroforestry, in a variety of configurations. An example of a positive development to date in this area is my Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Woodland Environmental Fund&rsquo; where private businesses can part-fund the establishment of native woodlands on farms.</p><p><b><i>National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory</i></b></p><p>The &ldquo;National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory&rdquo; will comprise up to 10 &ldquo;Flux Towers&rdquo; across a range of soil types at a cost of ~&euro;2M. These sites will be established on a range of soils adding value to existing Teagasc projects including; the industry co-funded SignPost farms and the Agricultural Catchments Programme. The resulting &ldquo;National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory&rdquo; will place Ireland at the forefront of EU carbon sequestration research.</p><p>The purchasing of &ldquo;Flux Towers&rdquo; will allow the establishment of the &ldquo;National Agricultural Soil Carbon Observatory&rdquo; which will enable Ireland to: </p><p>- Better quantify soil carbon emissions and sinks from agricultural land, </p><p>- Enable mitigation measures to increase carbon sequestration to be included in the national inventory, </p><p>- Participate in the EU ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System) network </p><p>- Enable Ireland to benefit from the 2018 EU Effort Sharing Regulation. </p><p><b><i>Pilot Soil Sampling Programme </i></b></p><p>- 10 million pilot Programme co-funded by the EU and national exchequer</p><p>- Opened for applications on the morning of the 17<sup>th</sup>of September 2021. </p><p>- No monetary payment to participants but they will benefit from better management decision making as a result of soil analysis report provided.</p><p>- Aims to establish a comprehensive national baseline on the Soil Organic Matter, nutrient and soil pathogen (E-coli) status of our soils across all farming systems and geographic areas.</p><p>- Aims to aid understanding of the linkages between animal health and soil health with a focus on soil pathogen assessment which will provide farmers with information to adapt strategies to minimise anti-microbial resistance (AMR).</p><p><b><i>Farm Environmental Study</i></b></p><p>- The Farm Environment Survey is targeted at bridging the knowledge gap of what habitats are present at farm level in Ireland. This knowledge transfer will help farmers, with support from their Advisors, to inform their management practices with Biodiversity and the environment in mind, along with yielding higher quality outputs.</p><p>- The Pilot Stage of FES will focus on the development of methodology and the up-skilling of farmers and advisors in the roll out of farm level habitat surveys on approximately 8000 farms.</p><p>- The Pilot FES programme will provide the farmer with an inventory of habitats, biodiversity and environmental information about his/her own farm</p><p><b><i>Woodland Environmental Fund</i></b></p><p>- The objective of the Woodland Environmental Fund (WEF) is to facilitate the planting of more native woodlands within Ireland by providing an access point for businesses to part fund the establishment of these forests.</p><p>- Businesses are invited to partner with Government and private landowners in creating these diverse woodland habitats.</p><p>- WEF funding is a once off single payment of &euro;1,000/hectare, paid by the business to the landowner.

The main Afforestation Scheme aims at supporting biodiversity by facilitating a policy to increase species diversity within the national forest estate. It is a requirement that all new afforestation must include at least 15% broadleaves. In response to these incentives, over 30,000ha of new forests have been created since the start of the Programme in 2015 with an average of 27% broadleaves planted during the programming period. The incentives for planting broadleaves were increased upwards in 2018 during a mid-term review of the Forestry programme.</p>  <p>  In addition we have a variety of additional support schemes in place that promote the planting of broadleaves, such as the Woodland Creation on Public Lands Scheme, the Woodland Environmental Fund, and the Neighbourwood Scheme.</p>  <p>  Coillte, under its not-for-profit branch which aims to deliver on biodiversity through specific projects, is also actively promoting the planting of native species. For example, the recently launched &lsquo;Nature Partners' initiative, aims to attract impact investors to help create new native woodlands across the country.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, as the Deputy may be aware, Project Woodland was launched in February this year and one of its key objectives is the creation of a shared national vision for forests in Ireland and the development of a new Forest Strategy.  This includes an extensive and inclusive public consultation, which has recently commenced and which  will consider issues such as diversity within the forest estate. The Strategy will in turn underpin the next Forestry Programme for the period 2023 to 2027.  I would like to invite everybody with an interest in forestry in Ireland to actively contribute to this consultation process.</p></reply>

This has brought our output to 3,718 licences issued to date this year. I am confident that we will meet our target of 4,000 licences by year end which will be a 60% increase on last year. </p>  <p>  Our road licensing output for this year will be double the target set for us in the Climate Action Plan. The volume of timber licensed will be 8 million m3 this year. This is 60% higher than last year and the highest volume ever licensed in a single year. </p>  <p>  We are making progress under Project Woodland, with the second interim report published at the end of October.  In terms of licensing, an important initiative is the in-depth review of the forestry licensing system being carried out by a consultant with legal and environmental expertise. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework.  That report is expected at end February next.  </p>  <p>  In terms of afforestation, outputs are not where I&rsquo;d like them to be but there are signs  of improvement. Officials are prioritising the assessment of afforestation licences on hand, using the same system as was applied to felling licences and 10 ecologists are now dedicated to afforestation, with more to be recruited.  </p>  <p>  We will build on this years momentum in 2022 and will implement any and all practical process improvements which result from the review and analysis in train under Project Woodland. I remain fully committed to delivering a licensing system which will meets the needs of the sector and of society as a whole.</p></reply>

My Department and Bord Bia play an ongoing role in identifying and developing markets and  engaging with key trading partners to enhance the global market share of Irish agri-food produce. Trade missions, facilitated by my Department, Bord Bia, and the Embassy network, are essential in developing market opportunities in international markets.</p>  <p>  Bord Bia has shown great agility since the start of the pandemic in translating the key components of trade missions into a virtual format.  Minister of State Martin Heydon, who has specific responsibility for new market development, and I have participated in a range of virtual events and meetings with key trade customers.  </p>  <p>  Most recently, we have participated in virtual events organised by Bord Bia promoting Irish dairy and meat exports to West Africa, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, China and Japan. Those markets were chosen because of their strategic importance for Irish agri-food exports and I have been hugely impressed by the level of engagement and interest from customers in our quality food and drink offering.</p>  <p>  Opening and enhancing access to international markets is typically a lengthy process with negotiations often taking several years before bilateral agreements are concluded and trade can commence. Nonetheless we have made significant progress in diversification of markets. For example, I was pleased last week with the announcement that the US ban on sheep meat exports from the EU has been lifted. My officials will now engage with US authorities on the next steps to full access and to ensure that Irish sheepmeat exports to this valuable market will be able to commence as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As outlined in the draft  CAP Strategic Plan interventions which have been published for public consultation,  the Pillar II Agri-Environment Climate Measure incudes tree planting actions as riparian buffers for water quality, in belts for ammonia capture near the farmyard or in rows, groups or as parkland.  Furthermore choosing a tree planting action would, as proposed,  give priority access to the agri-environment climate scheme.  In addition it is foreseen that agricultural advisors will be responsible for preparing a farm plan which will include a woodland scorecard under certain circumstances.</p>  <p>  Actions under the agri-environment climate measure are not at whole farm level, which means actions under the Scheme could co-exist with forestry on the farm.  In addition, forestry will continue to attract both grants and premiums under the Forestry Programme in addition to direct payments in accordance with Article 4 of the CAP Strategic Plan regulation. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware we are currently developing a new forest strategy under Project Woodland and this will inform the design of the next Forestry Programme.  It is my intention that farmers will be at the heart of the next programme and we will be consulting widely to ensure that the incentives we put in place will encourage farmers to see forestry as complementary to a sustainable farming enterprise.</p></reply>

Gender equality is also a key objective of the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals and a priority for me, as Minister.</p>  <p>  I am pleased therefore to be proposing the highest level of direct supports for women farmers in any CAP programme in Ireland. In addition to the TAMs proposal, these include women-only Knowledge Transfer (KT) Groups; and a call under the European Innovation Partnerships (EIP) initiative for proposals to examine women&rsquo;s participation in agriculture.</p>  <p>  On the new CAP Strategic Plan (CSP), my Department has been actively engaging with stakeholders throughout the process of developing the new plan. The SWOT analysis and Needs assessment helped to shape the CSP draft interventions that were then followed by a five-week public consultation in September 2021 with over 1,000 responses received. </p>  <p>  The proposed On-Farm Capital investment Scheme is in the process of development and is subject to the formal approval of the European Commission. As outlined in the draft CSP, it provides for a general grant rate of 40% for eligible investments. It is also proposed in the CSP that eligible female farmers, who meet the eligibility criteria may qualify for grant aid at a rate of 60%. It is currently being proposed that eligible female farmers are those:</p>  <p>-  Aged between 18 years of age and 55 at any time during the calendar year in which she submits an application for support;</p>  <p>-  Meet the conditions for being head and having control of the holding;</p>  <p>-  Meets the requirements for the appropriate training and/or skills required at the time of applications.</p>  <p>  Applicants who do not meet the criteria above will still remain eligible to submit an application under the On-Farm Capital investment scheme at the standard rate of 40%. No decision has been made on the details of how registered farm partnerships will operate under the new On-Farm Capital Investment scheme.</p>  <p>  Measures in the CSP are complemented by the new stakeholder strategy for the Irish agri-food sector, Food Vision 2030, which recognises the important contribution of women to the sector's long-term sustainability and includes a number of actions to promote and improve gender balance at all levels. It also proposes holding a national dialogue on women in agriculture. I have asked my officials to prioritise this dialogue for next year.</p>  <p>  More can be done on this important issue and I am committed to delivering greater equality in the Irish agri-food sector.</p></reply>

On an annual basis, employment increased by 221,200 in the year to Q3 2021 to 2,471,200. This represented an annual increase of just under 10 per cent. Employment increased by 113,400, or 4.8 percent in seasonally-adjusted terms, in the third quarter of 2021 alone. In that quarter employment was 98,700 more than the pre-pandemic peak of 2,367,000 recorded in Q1 2020. </p>  <p>  It is positive to note that employment also increased in all eight regions over the twelve months to Q3 2021, with the largest increases recorded in the Border, Mid-West and Dublin regions, increasing by 18.8 percent, 10.4 percent and 10.2 percent respectively. </p>  <p>  Employment also increased in all 14 economic sectors. It is unsurprising that the largest sectoral increase was in Accommodation and Food services, with a 28.8 percent annual increase in the number of people working in that sector, as it reopened during this period. </p>  <p>  The LFS results show that employment levels are fast approaching the 2.5 million target set for 2024 in the Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan. The growth in employment follows a similarly positive performance in Q2 and is reflective of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to help workers and businesses throughout the pandemic, allowing them to return to work relatively quickly as public health restrictions eased, and the Government&rsquo;s vaccination programme was rolled out.</p>  <p>  The Government recognises that the recent additional public health measures to help reduce the spread of Covid-19 will have a big impact on some sectors and may slow this momentum in employment growth. It has, therefore, approved extra economic supports for impacted sectors, as well as a limited reopening of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment, to ensure that businesses are in a position to fully reopen and workers return to work, once public health dangers have abated.</p></reply>

This includes a suite of actions to ensure that Ireland is planning appropriately for new energy demand in the context of our electrification and decarbonisation ambitions. We need to facilitate digitalisation across our enterprise base, while ensuring that we are cultivating reliable energy markets and infrastructure that deliver smart and competitively priced services to all electricity customers. </p>  <p>  We will need to ensure that new electricity demands, and the growth of existing demand, are sustainable and use our infrastructure efficiently. The transformation of our electricity and wider energy system, will require innovative and world leading solutions on both the supply and demand sides of that market. </p>  <p>  A key action in this regard is to revise the &lsquo;Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland's Enterprise Strategy&rsquo;, first published in 2018, to reflect new electricity targets, carbon ceilings, electricity and enterprise policy, as well as recent regulatory decisions. Developments such as Eirgrid's 'Shaping our Electricity Future' analysis; the recent Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) direction on data centre connection policy; as well as our carbon budgets and forthcoming sectoral emissions ceilings; can all be usefully reflected in this revised Statement on enterprise policy on data centres. </p>  <p>  Following detailed research by SEAI on a policy framework for Corporate Power Purchasing Agreements (CPPAs), I also expect that a policy roadmap in this regard will be relevant in advance of publishing this revised Government statement.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and engage with stakeholders such as Eirgrid, the CRU, IDA Ireland and the data centre sector in developing this statement.  This will set out any additional measures required to ensure that the existing demand for data centre development can be managed to drive the decarbonisation of our electricity system and deliver regional economic opportunities. I anticipate that this revised Statement will be published in the first half of 2022. </p></reply>

We are very aware that specific sectors will be particularly impacted by these measures and that targeted supports are needed to help many in these areas. </p><p>This is why there will be a limited re-opening of the Pandemic Employment Payment (PUP) to help those workers who may lose their jobs as a direct result of the introduction of the new restrictions.</p><p>A further extension of the current targeted commercial rates waiver for the first quarter of 2022 has been agreed for businesses in rateable premises.</p><p>Furthermore, additional financial supports from the Department of Finance will be announced imminently and will provide timely assistance to those sectors affected by the recent necessary public health measures.</p><p>The COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is the largest scheme of its type in the history of the State and makes up to &euro;2 billion in lending available to SMEs.  Since its launch in September 2020, it has enabled vital access to loans for the SME sector. To date, loans to over eight and a half thousand SME businesses across the country have been drawn or sanctioned to the value of &euro;599 million.</p><p>Many of these loans have been delivered to the sectors most impacted by the pandemic such as the wholesale and retail sector, accommodation and food services, and construction.  These three sectors alone, account for forty-seven percent of the value of loans drawn.</p><p>The Scheme is currently available until 31 December 2021 in line with European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework.  The Commission recently announced the extension of the Temporary Framework until 30 June 2022 and a legislative amendment to extend the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is currently under scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The COVID-19 Business Loan provides up to &euro;25,000 to eligible micro-enterprises through Microfinance Ireland with low-cost interest rates and with zero repayments and zero interest for the first six months.  Microfinance Ireland also provides start-up business loans and loans for established businesses for up to &euro;25,000.</p><p>Finally, all financial help and supports for businesses are being kept under review across Government to ensure that they are timely and will target those that need them the most.</p></reply>

This rose in 2014 to &euro;130.6m and &euro;135.3m in 2015.  In 2016 the IDA was allocated &euro;163.7m, rising to &euro;179.3m in 2017 and &euro;180.8 in 2018.  In 2019 the IDA was funded in the amount of &euro;214.5m and &euro;189.2m in 2020. </p>  <p>  IDA Ireland offers a wide range of financial assistance to companies wishing to locate and / or expand their existing operation in Ireland including and not restricted to; capital grants, employment grants, training grants and research and development and environmental supports. Grant payments are only one measure of performance.  IDA supports client companies through a range of offerings, and it is worth noting that only approximately 10% of clients are paid grants in a given year. Grants are generally drawn down over the lifetime of a project which is normally over a period of three to five years. Some investments which result in job creation may not be grant aided and some well-established companies may no longer be receiving grant payments. I have asked the Agency to supply the Deputy with the details sought regarding the number of industries supported and amount granted to each company in each of the years. </p>  <p>  In addition to supporting potential investors through financial supports, IDA Ireland also facilitates site visits, introductions and assists companies with property solutions.  </p>  <p>  IDA plays a central role in Government efforts to encourage inward investment. There is good evidence of Ireland&rsquo;s continued attractiveness as a destination for FDI, and investors&rsquo; confidence in Ireland remains strong, as evidenced by the flow of investment projects over recent months and years. FDI has shown great resilience and investment is virtually at pre pandemic levels.</p>  <p>  The number of investments supported by IDA has grown over the past 10 years, rising from 148 investments in 2011 to 246 in 2020, also increasing the number of people directly employed in the multinational sector in Ireland to 257,394.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy, &lsquo;Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-2024 has a strong emphasis on balanced regional development. Almost 145,000 people employed by IDA clients are outside of Dublin, where the impact of FDI is even more keenly felt.</p></reply>

There has been significant progress in implementing these actions which will facilitate hybrid working. I would highlight the following: </p><p>- The publication of the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect in April 2021 by the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>- A public consultation was held on the Right to Request Remote Work.

Each Plan is overseen by a Regional Steering Committee chaired by a senior level businessperson. </p>  <p>  I expect to publish the new Regional Enterprise Plans in early 2022. </p>  <p>  The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, has provided funding to assist enterprise development and regional jobs growth across all regions. For example, my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund, Border Enterprise Development Fund, and recent Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme has approved over &euro;126 million across 79 enterprise strengthening projects in every region over a series of competitive calls since 2017. These Funds enable significant collaborative and innovative regional projects to provide a timely impetus to job creation in regional locations.  </p>  <p>  Almost two thirds of new jobs created by Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2020 were in regions outside of Dublin. IDA will target half of all investments (400) from 2021- 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country.  IDA client companies directly employed almost 145,000 people outside of Dublin in 2020. Combined with indirect employment of 116,000, an estimated 260,000 jobs in the regions were supported by FDI in 2020.  The Local Enterprise Offices continue to provide a first stop shop to individuals who want to start or grow their micro enterprise in every county. There were 35,236 people employed in over 7,500 LEO client companies nationally in 2020.</p>  <p>  The Government is also committed to the development of a &lsquo;Town Centre First&rsquo; policy focused on regeneration of rural towns and villages.  My Department&rsquo;s Retail Forum developed a Framework for Town Centre Renewal which is a useful tool to assist Town Teams in how to improve footfall and customer experience in their towns. Through the Government&rsquo;s National Planning Framework, the main cities are to develop as viable alternatives to Dublin with funding channelled through Project Ireland 2040.</p></reply>

My Department undertook a full public consultation, reviewed international best practice, and formed an interdepartmental group &ndash; to ensure that all views and issues were properly considered in the development of the scheme.  </p><p>The draft Heads of Bill have been published and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>In the first instance, the legislation will provide for a replacement rate of 70% of gross salary for a duration of 3 working days in a calendar year.  Coupled with the 70% rate of pay, the application of a daily earnings cut-off point of &euro;110 will ensure that employers do not face excessive costs and that jobs are not jeopardised.</p><p>However, for those employers who are genuinely unable to cover the costs, we have, under Section 10 of the draft Bill, included a provision whereby an employer may seek an exemption from the Labour Court from the requirement to pay statutory sick leave for a period not less than three months and not more than twelve months.</p><p>Pre-legislative scrutiny commenced on 10th November. Once this process is complete and I receive the Committee's report, I will seek Government approval to present the Bill to the Houses, hopefully early in the new year.</p></reply>

There are 120 IDA supported companies in this region, employing 27,695 people in total, with 93 IDA supported companies in Galway city and county, employing 21,428 people (up 3% on the previous year). This provides scale and scope and gives confidence to potential investors that they will be able to establish themselves outside of a main city area and manage to secure talent and services to make their business work. </p>  <p>  IDA positions the West Region as home to the leading cluster of Life Sciences industries employing the highest per capita of Medical Technology staff in Europe. Examples of companies in region include Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Hollister, Baxter and of course Surmodics in Ballinasloe. These international brands are an attraction for additional companies to potentially locate to the West Region and Ballinasloe. </p>  <p>  The timely provision of appropriate and cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of multinational companies remains essential to winning Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Over the last 5 years the IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme has enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations. IDA actively promotes available buildings and land in IDA Business Parks, as well as high-quality buildings in private ownership through their network of overseas offices.  In Galway, the IDA has invested significantly in the provision of world-class property solutions.  </p>  <p>  Following the decision by Aptar to cease manufacturing operations in Ballinasloe in 2020, IDA Ireland worked to market the vacated facility to potential client companies of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. In May 2021, Enterprise Ireland client company Chanelle Pharma announced plans for 60 jobs in Ballinasloe and a &euro;5m investment. </p>  <p>  I am advised that IDA Ireland continues to market the available lands (c.21.94 acres) on the IDA business &amp;amp; technology park in Ballinasloe to potential investors, which includes the advanced planning permission for an Advanced Technology Unit (ATU) on these lands. The IDA and Ballinasloe Area Community Development (BACD) completed a joint venture to secure planning for an Advance Technology Unit (ATU),  and the availability of the ATU planning permission is being marketed by IDA as a flexible potential property solution to potential investors.</p></reply>

The Local Enterprise Office can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities and all schemes and grants can be availed of by any business that meets the relevant eligibility criteria.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices offer Feasibility Grants to help start-up companies or individual entrepreneurs with the cost of researching their proposed business idea to ascertain its viability and sustainability.

The Local Enterprise Offices also aim to accommodate all clients on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland's Centre of Excellence is planning to deliver Diversity and Inclusion Training for Local Enterprise Office staff in 2022. This will be beneficial in helping the Local Enterprise Office staff understand the needs of all entrepreneurs seeking assistance. </p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices are providing mentors for a new course for people with disabilities who wish to start their own business, which began in September 2021. The course is hosted and delivered by TU Dublin through its Continuing Professional Development programme. It is open to anyone who self-identifies as having a disability and who wishes to start their own business. The course requires participants to have a business idea that they wish to evaluate as a sustainable enterprise. </p><p>The course will include a range of guest speakers whose experience and expertise are relevant to the target audience. Using a newly developed online tool that will enable participants to develop their idea on a week-by-week basis, plus adopting Universal Design for Learning principles, a customised experiential learning approach will allow each participant to maximise their learning from the course.</p><p>Each participant will be allocated a business mentor by their Local Enterprise Office who will support them with the development of their business idea. Pobal and The Open Doors Initiative sponsor the course, so there is no fee required to be paid by participants. </p><p>In 2021, Enterprise Ireland established a Diversity and Inclusion Steering Group to oversee the development of the agency&rsquo;s Diversity and Inclusion vision and strategy.  A critical component of this strategy is specific to supporting entrepreneurship and self-employment for people with a disability. </p><p>Throughout 2021, a number of virtual events (Virtual Ability Series) took place for EI clients and enterprises, including: Recruit for Ability; Inclusive Recruitment podcast; and DesignAbility - Innovation through Inclusion webinar.  Content is hosted on eiLearn portal and is available to all enterprises nationally (e.g. eilearn.ie/designability/).</p><p>EI is also reassessing opportunities for greater employer engagement across their range of enterprise leadership and capability programmes, including Leadership 4 Growth, Attracting and Retaining Talent and Spotlight on Skills.  The latter two programmes specifically explore employers&rsquo; current and future skills needs, and help develop talent attraction strategies, including diversity. Enterprise Ireland has a close working relationship with the Regional Skills Fora, in particular in the implementation of programmes such as Spot Light on Skills programme. This review will be completed by year end 2021.</p><p>My Department is actively represented on the Steering Groups of the<b>National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS) </b>2017-2021 and the <b>Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities</b>2015-2024 and has in place a Disability Consultative Committee to provide a focus for disability inclusion in respect of our policy work, schemes and initiatives.

No. 567 of 2021, the EU (Copyright and Related Rights in the Digital Single Market) Regulations 2021. The Regulations strengthen the rights and protections of copyright holders in order to reflect the impact of technological advances and increased digitalisation. </p>  <p>  The new Regulations also address the legal uncertainty that existed when copyright-protected material was circulated online by way of social media and online platforms. Authorisation is now required from copyright holders so that the online platforms can continue to circulate copyright-protected works such as music, videos, or other works, online. This authorisation is usually obtained by way of a license from the relevant copyright-holders&rsquo; representative, i.e., from a collective management organisation.</p>  <p>  The Regulations also provide for wider access and use of copyright protected works for the benefit of a broad range of stakeholders, including the creative sectors, press publishers, researchers, educators, cultural heritage institutions, and citizens.</p>  <p>  Specifically, as per Regulation 13, the new requirement establishes a press publishers&rsquo; right allowing press publishers (and therefore the industry and its workers including journalists) to seek remuneration for the online exploitation of their works by news aggregators (e.g., the online platforms). Typically, as with other types of copyrighted works, the fee payable for use by an online platform of a press publisher&rsquo;s work would form part of a licensing agreement between both parties. </p></reply>

Under the Climate Action Plan 2021, the Government is committed to 80% of our electricity being created from renewable resources by 2030. Meeting our targets will require a very significant increase in the deployment rates of renewable electricity compared to those achieved in recent years.</p><p>My Department has undertaken a number of measures to prepare us for the transition. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), whose Secretariat is located in my Department, recently published their study on Skills to Zero Carbon. The study outlines recommendations for consideration in areas it identifies as representing &ldquo;Zero Carbon&rdquo; activities including: </p><p>- Onshore and Offshore wind generation (5GW of offshore and up to 8GW of onshore wind) </p><p>- Solar energy generation (1.5-2.5GW)</p><p>- The energy efficient retrofit of 500,000 homes to a minimum B2 BER</p><p>- The installation of 600,000 heat pumps, and </p><p>- The target of having 840,000 electric cars, and 95,000 commercial vehicles, on Irish roads.</p><p>The work of the EGFSN is informing the Government&rsquo;s approach to skills planning across the education and training system for the transition to a low carbon sustainable economy.</p><p>My own Department&rsquo;s agency, Enterprise Ireland, is actively working to develop Irish SME capability in the Offshore Wind sector. In 2019 Enterprise Ireland established an Offshore Wind industry cluster to identify and work with Irish companies to drive the industry&rsquo;s growth. Enterprise Ireland continues to work closely with 60 companies in the sector to solve technology challenges, identify innovation opportunities and to capitalise on end market opportunities. </p><p>EI will also set out actions to embed sustainability and climate action as a fundamental part of its approach to company development and engagement with client companies in the context of its forthcoming new Strategy.</p><p>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy published earlier this year, &ldquo;Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021-2024&rdquo; includes a sustainability pillar. This places sustainability at the heart of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s corporate strategy, and includes a focus on winning FDI from the world&rsquo;s leading companies across all areas of the Green Economy.</p><p>The National Standards Authority of Ireland is involved in the drive towards a green economy which in the renewable energy transformation includes, for example, establishing and enhancing standards for retrofitting, publishing recommendations for the design, installation, commissioning and maintenance of solar PV panels and details on heat pump requirements.</p><p>This work will present opportunities for developing and growing the green economy while also assisting in our transition to increased renewable energy.</p></reply>

In its second report, published in March 2021, the Expert Group concluded that ventilation is an important factor in reducing the risk of long-range airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in enclosed spaces. Clean air is vital in minimising its spread so adequate ventilation, and air filtration measures where necessary, can provide practical and effective ways to facilitate clean air in enclosed workspaces. </p><p>From the outset, this Government has committed itself to protecting workers as much as possible from COVID-19.  The Workplace Safety Protocol sets out a range of public health measures that should be put in place to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19 in workplaces.</p><p>The Expert Group has been very supportive of the approach taken to workplace ventilation in the Work Safely protocol. The Work Safely Protocol contains a section on ventilation to assist employers in all business sectors to understand the importance of ventilation in reducing the risk in the spread of SARS-CoV-2.  The Health and Safety Authority has also produced a ventilation check list for employers as having adequate ventilation in the workplace is a compliance requirement under the Work Safely Protocol. In addition, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) published on 18<sup></sup>November 2021 a document called &ldquo;<i>Guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19</i>&rdquo; which also highlighted that inadequately ventilated indoor spaces present a risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. </p><p>It is worth noting that existing occupational safety and health legislation creates a requirement for employers to ensure that there is an adequate supply of fresh air (ventilation) in enclosed areas of the workplace. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 currently creates a requirement on employers to make sure that there is an adequate supply of fresh air (ventilation) in enclosed areas of the workplace.  The evaluation of ventilation in a workplace should form part of an overall workplace risk assessment. The Health and Safety Authority also has enforcement powers to seek improvement in ventilation in workplaces</p><p>Separately, the National standards Authority of Ireland has established a registration scheme that certifies an individual as a competent independent third party to validate that a ventilation system has been installed, balanced, and commissioned to meet the minimum requirements of Technical Guidance Document (TGD) F - Ventilation (2019) to the Irish Building Regulations. </p></reply>

Ireland has had a National Plan on Business and Human Rights in place covering the period 2017-2020. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is bringing to Government the results of a review of that Plan and this will help to inform future activity across a range of policy areas. </p>  <p>  In relation to matters that are directly within the responsibility of my Department, there are a number of legislative initiatives either already underway or expected in the area of corporate accountability. </p>  <p>  There is an existing obligation on certain large companies in the EU to publish annually non-financial information in respect of their social and environmental impact including on matters such as human rights and climate change or explain where they do not.  In April 2021, the European Commission published a significant revision of the current rules in the form of a proposal for a Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.  Under the proposal all large companies and listed SMEs will be required annually to publish information on their performance and impact in respect of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including human rights matters in accordance with mandatory EU standards. Ireland is taking an active part in negotiations at EU level on these important and positive developments.</p>  <p>  In addition, there are proposals awaited from the European Commission in relation to Sustainable Corporate Governance (SCG). It is understood that the proposals will require companies to put in place policies and procedures to monitor the adverse effect of their operations and/or supply chain on human rights, labour rights, social rights and environmental issues.</p>  <p>  Legislative initiatives in this area are best progressed, where possible, at EU level in recognition of the complex, international nature of many supply chains and to ensure harmonisation, promote policy coherence and avoid the risk of fragmentation within the EU single market. Cross border business activities, by their very nature, are not confined within political borders and are most effectively and impactfully addressed through multilateral cooperation and action.</p>  <p>  Ireland is a strong advocate of human rights protections and seeks to ensure that proposals relating to corporate responsibility strike the right balance by protecting fundamental rights whilst ensuring that the measures to be implemented by companies achieve the policy goals and are not unduly onerous, particularly with regard to SMEs.  Specifically in relation to the expected EU SCG proposals, my Department will carefully consider these, when available, and will engage with stakeholders to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position on the legislation.</p></reply>

I understand that in his recent Budget speech the Minister confirmed that  he is introducing a new tax credit for the digital gaming sector. Details of the relief are available in the Finance Bill 2021. </p>  <p>  Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment legislation, in respect of which the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is mandated to secure compliance. We have a strong track record when it comes to protecting the rights of workers.  Ireland&rsquo;s employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on a contract of service basis.  Inspections carried out by WRC Inspectors operate on a compliance model. This means that an inspector will work with the employer to ensure that the employer fulfils all their statutory obligations and that any outstanding wages or entitlements are given to workers. </p>  <p>  The Inspectorate Division of the WRC carries out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislation. These inspections arise: </p>  <p>  - In response to complaints received of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation. </p>  <p>  - As part of compliance campaigns which focus on compliance in specific sectors or specific pieces of legislation; or </p>  <p>  - From routine inspections (announced and unannounced) which act as an overall control measure.</p>  <p>  The aim of the WRC Inspectorate is to achieve voluntary compliance with employment law through the provision of education and awareness, inspection of employers&rsquo; employment records and enforcement where necessary.  While every effort is made to secure compliance, some employers either refuse or fail to rectify the breaches identified and/or pay money due to their employees.  These cases are referred for prosecution. </p></reply>

The Level Project is a new initiative targeted at CEOs and managers of business in Ireland which has its origins in EI&rsquo;s Action Plan for Women in Business, recognising that increasing the number of women in middle and senior management, as well as on boards, leads to more successful, sustainable, and profitable businesses.  This is a long-term strategy requiring systemic change across the enterprise base.</p><p>The Level Project includes a suite of actions Enterprise Ireland is undertaking to influence and support change in Irish enterprise including providing companies with a toolkit resource that enables them to assess their current situation and put in place a strategy and Action Plan. </p><p>The <b>Online Action Planning Toolkit</b>is available free to all companies at www.levelproject.ie. This toolkit helps companies to assess their current situation and put in place practical actions to enhance gender balance in their senior teams. The output of the toolkit is a focused Action Plan which will help to signpost the way ahead for companies starting on this journey or to reinforce and accelerate the approach by companies already on a pathway to more diverse leadership.</p></reply>

The draft Heads of Bill have been published and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  Our scheme compares very favourably with the UK scheme which uses a flat rate model rather than a percentage of the person's pay.</p>  <p>  In the UK , employees are entitled to a flat &pound;96.35 per week for 28 weeks. Our scheme will provide workers with an entitlement to 70% of the daily salary capped at &euro;110 per day for an initial 3 days, which will rise to 10 days over time. Following this, an eligible employee may transition to illness benefit which for a full time employee is &euro;203 per week, with possible increases for dependents, for a period of up to 2 years.</p>  <p>  However, for those employers who are genuinely unable to cover the costs, we have, under Section 10 of the draft Bill, included a provision whereby an employer may seek an exemption from the Labour Court from the requirement to pay statutory sick leave for a period not less than three months and not more than twelve months.</p>  <p>  Pre-legislative scrutiny commenced on 10th November. Once this process is complete and I receive the Committee's report, I will seek Government approval to present the Bill to the Houses, hopefully early in the new year.</p></reply>

The Plan sets out 66 actions to bring down costs for consumers and business; introduce more competition into the market; prevent fraud and reduce the burden on business, community and voluntary organisations. This is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan includes actions to be taken by my Department, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice. </p>  <p>  Following Government approval, the Department of Finance published the General Scheme of the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021 (the Bill) on October 20, 2021, to enhance transparency and ensure consumer protection. The Bill covers a number of insurance-related matters. Drafting of the Bill has now commenced, and the General Scheme will undergo pre-legislative scrutiny in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice has noted to Government her intention to bring forward legislative proposals to reform the law with regard to Occupiers&rsquo; Liability and I understand that these proposals are at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  Regarding actions under the aegis of my Department, I am developing proposals to enhance and reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Heads of a Bill have been developed in consultation with PIAB, which I am considering in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office. I expect to bring proposals for legislative reform to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  I am also progressing legislation to strengthen competition law in Ireland. The legislation will break new ground in this area, giving competition authorities, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), enhanced powers including administrative sanctions and other tools in dealing with anti-competitive practices.</p>  <p>  The full implementation of the Action Plan for Insurance Reform will help to ensure that we have an insurance system which is both affordable and reliable and one which underpins a vibrant economy.</p></reply>

This scheme aims to assist micro-enterprises in realising  the potential of online trading and offers eligible businesses a voucher of up to &euro;2,500 (50% co-funded by the recipient) to help them develop their online capacity. </p><p>This includes training sessions that cover various topics, such as developing a website, digital marketing, social media for business and search engine optimisation. The training and information provided is impartial and aims to help business owners decide on what trading online options, are right for their business.</p><p>The Scheme targets businesses with limited or no e-commerce presence and vouchers can be used towards adding payment facilities or booking systems to your website, developing new apps for your customers or towards subscriptions to low cost online retail platform solutions, which helps companies quickly establish a retailing presence online.  There is also scope for the purchase of online advertising, but this cannot make up more than 30% of an approved voucher cost.</p><p>In response to the impact of COVID-19, previous voucher recipients are eligible to apply for a second voucher to further develop their online trading capacity. </p><p>Over the past two years, more than 1,000 vouchers have been approved by the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown Local Enterprise Office, to a value of &euro;2.3m. This funding has had a significant impact on the recipient businesses, allowing them to continue trading in spite of the necessary restrictions. </p><p>So far this year the Scheme has seen 4,306 approvals, to a value of &euro;9,323,886 in all LEOs, with 243 vouchers to a value of &euro;495,479 in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown.

In mid November, I led a 5 day trade mission to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The trade mission was organised by Enterprise Ireland and saw participation by 60 Irish companies and organisations. This was the largest outbound trade mission from Ireland since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and had a particular focus on promoting Irish excellence in Education, Healthcare, ICT, Agritech, Equine Solutions, Infrastructure Solutions and Aviation and included trade engagements in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Dubai, UAE.</p>  <p>  While in Saudi Arabia, I visited EI clients, had speaking engagements and attended two receptions in the Embassy of Ireland, Riyadh.  I also had a series of bilateral meetings with the Saudi Arabian Ministers of Industry and Commerce, and Trade and Investment, and the Ministry of Transport, along with meetings with the Saudi Arabian Central Back and GACA, the Saudi Arabian Civil Aviation Authority.</p>  <p>  The Dubai leg of the trade mission coincided with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Dubai Air Show together with 15 Irish companies, and was organised to complement Ireland&rsquo;s participation in EXPO 2020 and our programme of cultural events, including the performance residency of Riverdance during November.</p>  <p>  While in Dubai I had business engagements, attended a Trade Mission Networking Reception in the Irish Pavilion at EXPO2020 and took part in an event to promote Ireland as a premier location for English language study. I was also interviewed during the Tolerance &amp;amp; Inclusivity Thematic Business Forum for a Spotlight event in relation to Ireland's ongoing work in promoting Gender Equality in the Workplace.  </p></reply>

IDA Ireland supports 66 client companies, through the agency&rsquo;s offices in Sligo and Cavan, in this region who collectively directly employ 8,651 people.</p>  <p>  The FDI performance in the region has been strong over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing by 18% as traditional strengths in sectors such as Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies and Medical Technologies were complemented by new investments from the Technology, International Financial Services and Life Sciences sectors. </p>  <p>  The Border region includes the regional growth centres of Letterkenny and Sligo. The region has fostered strong collaboration, for example through Sligo Institute of Technology&rsquo;s participation in NIBRT, the development of the Atlantic MedTech cluster, and Letterkenny Institute of Technology&rsquo;s engagement with client companies on the formation of a North West chapter of Cyber Ireland.  Cavan and Monaghan also benefit from the presence of the Dundalk Institute of Technology in County Louth.  The recent designation of Atlantic Technological University (ATU) as a technological university by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance (CUA) of Galway Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), Letterkenny Institute of Technology (LYIT) and IT Sligo in October 2021 is also a welcome development. The existing FDI base of companies in Cavan and Monaghan enjoy strong collaborative links with several third level colleges.</p>  <p>  Key to the Border region&rsquo;s success in the past, and essential to its success in the future, is strategic collaboration with national and local stakeholders on the enhancement of the regional value proposition for FDI.  In this regard the significant funding both Cavan and Monaghan have received under the Urban Regeneration Development Fund (URDF) is to be welcomed, it will add to the placemaking successes and the value proposition of both counties.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with existing clients throughout the Border region to retain and strengthen their presence through continued company transformation as well as pursuing new areas of opportunity for client companies. The Agency will also continue to collaborate with Enterprise Ireland and its indigenous base of companies to identify synergies, enhance clusters, participate in site visits and maximise benefits for the region.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland has recently completed the construction of an Advance Building Solution in Monaghan which it is currently actively marketing to potential FDI clients and as part of its new strategy &ldquo;Driving Recovery and Sustainable Growth 2021 to 2024&rdquo;. IDA plans to deliver Advance Building Solutions in Letterkenny, Cavan, and Sligo over the strategy period of 2021-2024. </p>  <p>  IDA will target 25 investments for the Border region in the period 2021 to 2024 and will continue to actively promote Cavan and Monaghan as part of the wider Border value proposition.  IDA Ireland will build on the strengths and competencies of the region with a particular focus on opportunities arising in the sectors of Life Sciences, Technology and Services.  The objective will be to take advantage of emerging technologies and business models, including home and hub working. </p></reply>

The Cabinet Committee Sub-Group on Insurance Reform, of which I am a member, published the Action Plan for Insurance Reform in December 2020. This is one of the most important programmes of reform that this Government will undertake.</p>  <p>  Regarding actions under the aegis of my Department, I am developing proposals to enhance and reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Heads of a Bill have been developed in consultation with PIAB, which I am considering in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office. I expect to bring proposals for legislative reform to Government shortly.</p>  <p>  I am also progressing legislation to strengthen competition law in Ireland. The legislation will break new ground in this area, giving competition authorities, such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC), enhanced powers including administrative sanctions and other tools in dealing with anti-competitive practices.</p>  <p>  An Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market has been established within the Department of Finance, supported by my Department which is chaired by Minister Fleming. The work of the Office includes engaging with sectoral stakeholders to understand gaps in the insurance market, with a view to expanding the risk appetite of existing insurers. It is also working with IDA Ireland to explore opportunities for new entrants to increase the availability of insurance.</p>  <p>  Early implementation of these actions will remain a priority issue for my Department in the coming months.</p></reply>

There has been significant progress in implementing these actions which will facilitate hybrid working. I would highlight the following: </p>  <p>  - The publication of the Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect in April 2021 by the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  - A public consultation was held on the Right to Request Remote Work. Informed by this and by a review of international best practice, the drafting of the General Scheme of the Bill is at an advanced stage.

I have spoken before about how the pandemic has caused many of us to reconsider and re-evaluate what an essential worker is. We now understand that it is a much broader group of workers than people would have originally described, many of whom are on low pay and in the private sector. </p>  <p>  The Government has been clear in its belief that a legacy of the pandemic must be better pay, terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay. We are committed, therefore, to honouring the Government commitment to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government. In doing so, we need to recognise that many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic and are struggling to pay existing wages. We need to make sure that we proceed in a way that does not cause jobs to be lost in terms of the numbers of people employed, or would see employees having their hours cut. To do so would be counterproductive.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine the programme for Government commitment and to make recommendations on the best approach. </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission commissioned a team of researchers at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM) to conduct supporting research on the living wage. Terms of Reference for this research were noted by Cabinet earlier this year. The Commission expects to receive this research before year-end. </p>  <p>  Informed by this supporting research, the Commission intends to provide a report to me on the issues surrounding the progression to a living wage early in 2022.</p>  <p>  The report will consider the policy, social and economic implications of a move to a living wage and the process by which Ireland could progress towards it. It will do this by looking at international evidence on living wages, examining different calculation methods, examining the policy implications and outlining options for moving to a living wage in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the calculation of a living wage on the basis of a minimum essential standard of living formula, as used by the Living Wage Technical Group, is being given consideration in the preparation of this report. Other calculation methods, such as a proportion of the median wage, are also being given consideration.</p>  <p>  I look forward to receiving the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s report early next year. Their report will inform Government on the best practical approach to progress to a living wage in Ireland.</p></reply>

Throughout the pandemic my Department and its enterprise agencies have engaged with and supported businesses within their remit, and in recent months there has been the start of a recovery in employment across the economy. According to the latest Labour Force Survey, published by the Central Statistics Office, on a annual basis employment increased by 221,200 in the year to the third quarter of 2021, with employment standing at 2.71 million.</p><p>In seasonally adjusted terms, employment increased by 113,400 in the third quarter of 2021 alone. This came at a time when public health restrictions continued to ease and Ireland&rsquo;s vaccination programme was being rolled out. This highlights the importance of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to help workers and businesses throughout the past 18 months, especially those wage supports which helped businesses maintain a link to their staff.</p><p>In its ongoing engagement with enterprise, my Department and its enterprise agencies have nevertheless been made aware of labour shortages in certain sectors. My Department has worked to signpost businesses towards the training and labour market activation programmes and supports, available through the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, its agencies, and the Department of Social Protection, in order to address their staffing needs.</p><p>Some of these staffing shortfalls are due to pre-existing structural shifts in the economy, which have been accelerated by the impact of the pandemic. The twin decarbonisation and digital transitions, and their associated behavioural changes, are significantly altering the economy and will continue to do so in the coming years, leading to permanent changes in our labour market and business models. As we recover from the pandemic not all previous jobs will return- but embracing these transitions will also open up substantial new opportunities for businesses and jobs, as well as potential skills mismatches as these opportunities emerge.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s Economic Recovery Plan, published earlier this year, commits to supporting the transition of Ireland&rsquo;s economy and workforce to the new Green and Digital economies. It has an overarching objective of having 2.5 million at work by 2024, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. It aims to realise this goal through ongoing support for people and businesses in making a full return to work. The Plan commits to further strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s skills framework to ensure skills mismatches are minimised, and people are supported in securing and remaining in sustainable and quality employment, in areas of identified skills needs for business.</p><p>As the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is phased out, helping people back to work and reducing the risk of labour market scarring and entrenched long term unemployment is also a priority. This will be achieved through a combination of significant upskilling and reskilling opportunities and increased labour market activation interventions through <i>Pathways to Work 2021-2025. </i>A jobs led recovery will also be supported through creating the right environment for employment creation, through measures to boost the resilience, agility, competitiveness and innovation of enterprises across the economy.<i></i></p><p>This will also be supported through ensuring a balanced and inclusive recovery, through strategic investment in infrastructure and reforms that enhance our long-term capacity for growth, balanced regional development and by improving living standards. In moving towards the goal of having 2.5 million people in work by 2024, the focus will be on recovering differently, with more productive, innovative, resilient and importantly more secure and valued employment across the economy.</p><p>Workers from outside the European Economic Area, whose employment is facilitated by the employment permit system, will play an important role in helping deliver on the objectives set out in the Economic Recovery Plan. Ireland&rsquo;s economic migration policy accommodates the arrival of non-EEA nationals to fill skills and labour gaps in the domestic economy in the short to medium term. </p><p>My Department recently announced changes to the permit system in light of identified gaps across the economy, with most construction workers now eligible for a General Employment Permit, the quota removed for HGV driver permits, and further General Employment Permit quotas granted for roles including Hospitality Managers, Horticulture Operatives, Meat Deboners, Meat Processing Operatives and Dairy Farm Assistants.</p><p>In light of the important role played by non-EEA nationals in filling identified skills and labour market needs, my Department is very conscious of the need to quickly address the delays being experienced in issuing employment permits and has taken measures to clear the current backlog as quickly as possible. It is confident that they will bear fruit over the coming weeks and months.  It advises employers to take current timelines into account as part of their recruitment plans.</p><p>A number of factors have impacted processing times in recent months including an increase of over 50% in demand for permits since April this year. In addition, the additional eligible occupations announced on 28 October has prompted an increase in applications for permits. </p><p>It is important to point out that when set against other international employment permit regimes, Ireland continues to compare extremely favourably, even at current processing times.  However, my Department is very conscious of the recent lengthening of timeframes for processing Employment Permit applications and is committed to reducing these further.  </p><p>Applications for Employment Permits have seen a significant increase over the course of the year.  As of the end of November, some 24,058 applications were received, representing a 62% increase over the same period in 2020 (14,846) and a 40% increase on 2019 (17,101), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  The Department has issued some 14,254 employment permits since the beginning of the year, which represents a significant volume of activity.  Processing times have been impacted by this increase in demand but also as a result of the HSE cyber-attack.  As a result of the HSE cyber-attack, employment permit applications associated with the Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other non-standard methods.  </p><p>This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in this process.  The increased time required in processing these manual applications has had a direct impact on wider processing times for other employment permit applications. </p><p>My Department updates the employment permit processing timelines on its website on a weekly basis and regularly issues updates on relevant employment permit matters to Trusted Partners. </p></reply>

This will ensure that tips and gratuities are additional to a worker&rsquo;s wage and are not subsumed by employers into the wage.</p>  <p>  It is intended to introduce primary legislation in this area which will involve amendments to existing legislation as well as some new provisions.  The General Scheme of the Payment of Wages (Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Bill was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 12th November last. </p>  <p>  A key element of the Bill will provide a legal entitlement for workers to receive tips and gratuities paid in electronic form (i.e., by debit or credit card) with a provision that these tips and gratuities should be paid out to workers in a fair, transparent and equitable manner. A fair and equitable distribution will be context specific and is likely to take into account matters such as staff hours, busy and quiet periods, a worker&rsquo;s role in service delivery etc.</p>  <p>  Department officials are currently finalising the draft Heads of Bill in conjunction with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. The T&aacute;naiste will then seek Cabinet approval to publish the Bill early in the New Year.</p></reply>

I have spoken before about how the pandemic has caused many of us to reconsider and re-evaluate what an essential worker is. We now understand that it is a much broader group of workers than people would have originally described, many of whom are on low pay and in the private sector. </p>  <p>  The Government has been clear in its belief that a legacy of the pandemic must be better pay, terms and conditions for everyone, but particularly for those on low pay. We are committed, therefore, to honouring the Government commitment to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government. In doing so, we need to recognise that many businesses have been badly affected by the pandemic and are struggling to pay existing wages. We need to make sure that we proceed in a way that does not cause jobs to be lost in terms of the numbers of people employed, or would see employees having their hours cut. To do so would be counterproductive.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I asked the Low Pay Commission to examine the Programme for Government commitment and to make recommendations on the best approach to meeting this commitment. </p>  <p>  The Low Pay Commission commissioned a team of researchers at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM) to conduct supporting research on the living wage. Terms of Reference for this research were noted by Cabinet earlier this year. The Commission expects to receive this research before year-end.</p>  <p>  Informed by this supporting research, the Commission intends to provide a report to me on the issues surrounding the progression to a living wage early in 2022.</p>  <p>  The report will consider the policy, social and economic implications of a move to a living wage and the process by which Ireland could progress towards it. It will do this by looking at international evidence on living wages, examining different calculation methods, examining the policy implications and outlining options for moving to a living wage in Ireland.</p>  <p>  I look forward to receiving the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s report early next year and then hope to bring proposals to Cabinet in the New Year.</p></reply>

With respect to lands in Drogheda, a concept review for an Advanced Building Solution is progressing with the objective to deliver same within the term of the current IDA Strategy (2021-2024).  </p>  <p>  The timely provision of appropriate, cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of multinational companies remains essential to winning FDI.

Co. Louth is home to 30 IDA Ireland client companies employing more than 4,372 people. In recent years, IDA Ireland supported companies including WUXI, Wasdell, Almac, PCI Pharma Services, Amazon Web Services and Simply NUC have announced investments and expansions for Co.

Since its establishment, considerable progress has been made. For all listed companies, as of 1 March 2021, 24% of directors are female, up from 14% in 2018. ISEQ20 companies had, by March 2021, exceeded the 2021 target of 27% by three percentage points - a sizable improvement from 18% in 2018. The gap between Ireland and the EU28 average for women on boards has also continued to narrow, from 8 percentage points in 2018 to 1.2 percentage points in 2020.</p>  <p>  Outside of individual organisations and the Balance for Better Business initiative, much work has been done across the Government system to ensure women&rsquo;s full and equal representation in Irish business leadership. This includes encouraging and enabling female participation including through promoting women and girls in STEM, new modes of working and providing Early Learning and Care that is affordable, accessible, and high quality.</p>  <p>  Most recently, Enterprise Ireland launched The Level Project - a suite of actions to influence and support change in Irish enterprise. It aims to raise awareness of the business benefits of gender balance in senior teams and includes an online toolkit to provide companies with a resource that enables them to assess their current situation and put in place a strategy and Action Plan, with supports to implement these.</p>  <p>  The Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced by the Deputy, which reflects the recommendation from the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, highlights an important goal - to increase the participation of women at the highest levels of the corporate world. This is something we are both striving to achieve.</p>  <p>  The Fourth Annual Report of the Balance for Better Business Review Group will be published next week and will show further progress against the targets that have been set by the Group.</p></reply>

Details of the supports can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website: Government supports for COVID-19 impacted businesses - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie). I also publish a update table on the uptake of the range of advisory and finance schemes on my Department's website.  </p>  <p>  On 3rd December the Government agreed some additional public health measures to help to reduce the spread of COVID-19 including extra economic supports approved for sectors impacted by public health measures.</p>  <p>  We recognise that these decisions, coming in addition to those of 16th November, will have a particular impact on sectors such as hospitality, the night time economy, and the arts and entertainment sectors.</p>  <p>  In addition to existing economy-wide schemes, including the Employee Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which will remain in place at current rates of payment and qualification criteria, the Minister for Finance is introducing a new scheme for businesses in the hospitality sector that are subject to restrictions on operating.</p>  <p>  This will adjust the COVID Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) to support businesses whose trade is significantly impacted and which are subject to regulatory restrictions on operating. This will involve a weekly payment of payment of 12% of turnover for qualifying businesses. Further details will be provided by the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  There will also be a further extension of the current targeted commercial rates waiver for the first quarter of 2022. This will be put in place at an additional cost of approximately &euro;62.3 million.</p>  <p>  The Government has also agreed to a limited reopening of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment for workers who are temporarily laid off due to the impact of these public health restrictions. There will be a number of refinements to the scheme design to target it more effectively. Further details will be made available by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  While we are responding to a very dynamic situation to address the challenge of getting the right assistance to firms and workers at the right time, all schemes of my Department and agencies include appropriate governance and oversight in the administration of advisory and funding schemes.

The rapid digital transformation of consumer trends and shopping preferences combined with competition from sophisticated international business models in recent times presents both opportunities and threats to many businesses operating in the Irish retail sector.</p>  <p>  The sector has also faced significant challenges due to the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting period of closure of non-essential retail, and the ongoing public health regulations during the pandemic. Despite this, retailers in Ireland continue to play a critical role in the national response to COVID-19.</p>  <p>  To date a range of business supports have been developed for businesses, including retail.  These include the Small Business Assistance Scheme (SBASC), The Covid 19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), wage subsidies, a commercial rates holiday, low-cost loans, a Vat Reduction and the publication of a Code of Conduct between landlords and tenants on commercial rents. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, COVID-19 has accelerated the transition to online retailing and the retail sector has responded to the challenge by coming up with new and innovative ways to trade safely, to protect its employees and customers.  Two schemes offered by my Department can assist retailers in their digital transformation journey. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 Online Retail Scheme (ORS) was specifically introduced to support Irish-owned retail businesses to rapidly adapt and enhance their online business capability as they work within the COVID-19 public health measures. To date the COVID-19 ORS has provided funding of &euro;18.2m to 503 retailers under three calls.</p>  <p>  Prior to the COVID-19 competitive ORS, my Department initially launched a pilot ORS in 2018. The scheme was administered by Enterprise Ireland. The total approved under the combined Online Retail Schemes is over &euro;19m.</p>  <p>  The ORS scheme is complementary to the &euro;2,500 Trading Online Voucher scheme, provided through the Local Enterprise Offices for companies with up to 10 employees.  While this scheme is not solely for the retail sector it provides assistance to retailers to begin their online trading journey.</p>  <p>  In 2020 the scheme attracted 17,315 applications and 12,984 approvals to a value of &euro;30.6m. Between 1st January and 1st December 2021 there have been 4,306 approvals to a value of &euro;9,323,886.</p>  <p>  The full range of supports offered by my Department and across Government for businesses, including retailers, can be found on enterprise.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to address the needs of the sector and engage with retailers through the Retail Forum, which provides a platform for structured engagement between the retail sector, my Department and all relevant Departments and State Agencies.</p></reply>

Typically, the Department and its Offices are in shared accommodation, either with other Government Departments, public bodies and/or the private sector.</p>  <p>  The Department and its Offices are located in 11 locations across the country. As tenants the Department works closely with OPW colleagues, and where relevant, engages with the local landlords and with other tenants, to ensure the provision of appropriate, fit-for-purpose accommodation for our staff and any visitors to the buildings. </p>  <p>  As part of our internal response to the COVID-19 pandemic my Department has implemented a suite of infection prevention control measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission and to assist in making the work environment as safe as possible.</p>  <p>  As alluded to in the national Work Safely Protocol, ventilation is not a standalone measure in itself and it is key that staff, and visitors alike, continue to adhere to all aspects of the prevailing public health guidance such as social distancing, ensuring good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette such as facemask wearing in communal areas, proper cough etiquette and availing of vaccinations when offered same. </p>  <p>  Given the nature of the buildings occupied by my Department and its Offices, the technical advice provided by the OPW to date is that there is no need for additional mechanical interventions to be made to our buildings to enhance ventilation at this time. This OPW advice comes with the caveat that the Department should, and is ensuring, that all reasonable arrangements are in place to maximise ventilation through a combination of actions tailored to their locations. This includes opening more windows and carefully managing the overall numbers daily in each location so as to ensure rooms do not become overcrowded. Such arrangements are overseen by a dedicated Health and Safety Unit working in conjunction with colleagues across the Department and its Offices.</p>  <p>  To provide added assurance to staff and in supplementing our range of COVID-19 specific control measures, my Department has also installed approximately 20 air quality monitors in various locations across our buildings where these were deemed to be warranted. These are small mobile monitors which provide real-time information such as CO2 levels in rooms and will inform us if there are negative issues with ventilation.  To date, the information gleaned from the monitors backs up the OPW technical advice in relation to ventilation in our occupied buildings. </p>  <p>  As has been the case throughout the pandemic, my Department will of course keep all health and safety related issues under review and will liaise closely with the OPW and with other external expertise as required.  </p></reply>

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.</p>  <p>  The system is managed through the operation of the Critical Skills and Ineligible Occupations Lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for an employment permit where there is a surplus of those skills in the domestic and EEA labour market.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy and to ensure the employment permits system is aligned with current labour market intelligence, these lists undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews which are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and involves public/stakeholder consultation. Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market. Consideration is also taken of the views of the Economic Migration Interdepartmental Group, chaired by my Department and of the relevant policy Departments, in this case the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The results of the most recently concluded review were announced on 28 October 2021. The review did not recommend removal of the occupation of care worker/home carers from the Ineligible Occupations List as the evidence suggested that the contracts of employment on offer and employment terms and conditions being offered are significant factors in the recruitment challenges faced by the sector, rather than a demonstrable labour market shortage. The sector has also previously been advised that a more systematic and structured engagement with the Department of Social Protection needs to be demonstrated.</p>  <p>  The next Occupational Lists Review will open in the coming months and submissions from sectors will be invited through a public consultation.</p></reply>

Since its launch in September 2020 it has enabled vital access to loans for the SME sector.  As of the 25th November, eight thousand, five hundred and fifty-six loans with a value of over &euro;598 million have been drawn or sanctioned to SME businesses in all parts of the country.  Many of these loans have been delivered to those sectors most impacted by the pandemic such as the wholesale and retail sector, accommodation and food services, and construction.  These three sectors alone, account for forty-seven percent of the value of loans drawn. Over fifty-seven thousand jobs have been maintained as a result of the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme.</p>  <p>  Loans of up to &euro;1 million are available for up to 5.5 years. Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require any personal guarantees or collateral. The Scheme has an 80 percent guarantee and is based on contingent liability. This means there is no cost to the State unless a participating enterprise is unable to pay back the loan for more than 90 days, whereupon the loan enters a default stage. The finance provider can then call on the guarantee for 80 percent of the outstanding balance.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is currently available through three commercial banks, six non-bank lenders and nineteen credit unions thus providing competition in the market and a variety of loan products. This long-term policy goal of diversification adds competition in the market and ensures a wide range of loan products are available throughout the regions.</p>  <p>  The Scheme is currently available until 31 December 2021 in line with European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework.  The Commission recently announced the extension of the Temporary Framework until 30 June 2022 and a legislative amendment to extend the Covid-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme has been included in the Social Welfare Bill 2021, which is currently under scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p></reply>

IDA will target half of all investments equivalent to 400 investments from 2021 to 2024 to regional locations and maintain the same high level of investment as targeted in IDA&rsquo;s previous strategy for each region of the country. IDA client companies directly employed almost 145,000 people outside of Dublin in 2020. Combined with indirect employment of 116,000, an estimated 260,000 jobs in the regions were supported by FDI in 2020. The Local Enterprise Offices continue to provide a first stop shop to individuals who want to start or grow their micro enterprise in every county. There were 35,236 people employed in over 7,500 LEO client companies nationally in 2020. </p>  <p>  The individual Regional Enterprise Plans (REPs) play a central role in supporting the delivery of balanced regional enterprise development and ensuring that employment growth is spread across all regions. The Plans are complementary to and build on the core activities of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs and the wider range of State Bodies involved in regional enterprise development. The new Plans are expected to be published in early 2022. </p>  <p>  The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, has provided funding to assist enterprise development and regional jobs growth across all regions. For example, my Department&rsquo;s Regional Enterprise Development Fund, Border Enterprise Development Fund, and recent Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme has approved over &euro;126 million across 79 enterprise strengthening projects in every region over a series of competitive calls since 2017. These Funds enable significant collaborative and innovative regional projects to provide a timely impetus to job creation in regional locations.?</p>  <p>  I realise the strain COVID-19 is placing on businesses and that is why we have put in place, a wide range of support measures for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, business continuity and trading online grants, COVID-19 Working Capital Scheme, the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Future Growth Loan Scheme, commercial rates waivers and warehousing of tax liabilities.

It is managed by my Department with administrative support from Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  DTIF focuses on the ability of Irish enterprises to drive disruptive innovation through collaboration on industrial research with other enterprises and research institutions. The Fund is open to partnerships working on projects that have the potential to significantly alter markets or the way businesses operate.  It encourages private co-investment by lowering the risk profile associated with investment in high-risk, high-reward innovations.  Applications to the Fund are required to, inter alia, demonstrate the potential to develop and deploy novel and disruptive technologies in line with the Research Priority Areas 2018-2023.</p>  <p>  A total of &euro;235 million has been allocated to 72 projects with 270 project partners over the first three DTIF calls to date. This funding will give the companies involved opportunities to grow their business, even when trading in increasingly competitive markets, through the development of innovative products and services. These enterprises will be in a strong position as the Irish and global economies rebound once the pandemic ends.</p>  <p>  A Budget allocation of &euro;67 million was made available for 2022 to fund claims from the successful projects under calls 1 to 3 and projects arising from the fourth DTIF call that I launched last month. The closing date for receipt of applications is 10 February 2022 and I look forward to receiving a further set of strong and innovative projects which will have the potential to change the status quo across a range of business sectors over the coming years.</p></reply>

As of the end of November, some 24,058 applications were received, representing a 62% increase over the same period in 2020 (14,846) and a 40% increase on 2019 (17,101), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications. My Department has issued some 14,254 employment permits since the beginning of the year, which represents a significant volume of activity.</p>  <p>  As a result of the HSE cyber-attack, employment permit applications associated with the July Doctors rotation (which occurs twice yearly in January and July) had to be submitted either manually or through other non-standard methods. This resulted in a significant additional administrative burden in dealing with these applications, requiring staff to be temporarily reassigned to assist in the process and had a direct impact on wider processing times for other permit applications.</p>  <p>  An Action Plan has recently been developed to tackle the backlog, with both human resource interventions and systematic changes. These include additional staffing resources, a new ICT system and interim ICT solutions. In terms of systemic changes, working with the Department of Health and the HSE, we are also streamlining how we issue permits to doctors. This will bring significant efficiencies and eliminate the practice of having to re-issue a permit every 6 months to the same doctor who needs to change hospitals as part of their rotation.</p>  <p>  Over the next 18 months a new ICT system will be developed and implemented to reduce the labour requirement of the Section. In the interim, the ICT Unit have conducted initial investigations and found short-term fixes that will help efficiency and filter out permits applications when it is evident that they cannot be granted. This will reduce interactions between staff and applicants for data corrections or clarifications.</p>  <p>  My Department updates the employment permit processing timelines on its website on a weekly basis and regularly issues updates on relevant employment permit matters to Trusted Partners such as the update on employment permit processing timelines.  As of 7th December 2021, the Employment Permits Unit are processing Standard Applications received on 11/08/21 and Trusted Partner Applications received on 03/09/21.</p></reply>

For the overwhelming majority of enterprises in Ireland, nothing changed. For the 95% of enterprises outside of the scope of the agreement, it is very much business as usual. </p>  <p>  The small number of larger companies affected by Ireland&rsquo;s decision to join the OECD agreement now have much-needed clarity, a long-term view, and the assurance of enduring stability and certainty as they make decisions about where to invest. </p>  <p>  Investors are not deterred. The ongoing successes of my agency, IDA Ireland, demonstrate how secure the flow of foreign direct investment is into Ireland. Recent data show that in the first half of this year, IDA won investment from 142 companies, resulting in 12,530 jobs. This is a substantial increase on 2020 figures and bring us close to the record highs achieved prior to the outbreak of Covid-19. This remarkable performance in the face of Brexit, the pandemic, and a global downturn in FDI demonstrates our considerable and hard-won resilience.</p>  <p>  Our tax rate is only one aspect of what Ireland offers potential investors. Companies who set up or expand in Ireland reap the benefits of our business-friendly environment, our highly skilled and educated workforce, and our commitment to the European Union and the Single Market. </p>  <p>  Despite the challenges thrown up in the last two years, Ireland has proved once again to be a resilient, and stable platform for companies choosing to invest here. The decision on corporate tax has not impacted on Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a competitive, attractive, best-in-class location to do business.</p></reply>

These actions will support Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position compared to its peers in coming years. </p><p>In addition, there is a need to capitalise on the opportunities Covid-19 has created which have the potential to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in the long term, such as the acceleration of digital adoption and the possibility for more flexible working. </p><p>To take advantage of such opportunities the Government has committed to addressing the digital divide and enhance digital skills as part of the Economic Recovery Plan along with the publication of the National Remote Work Strategy earlier this year.</p><p>Brexit has also brought into sharp focus the need for Irish based enterprise to step-up their productivity and innovation performance and for Ireland's policy system to be agile in responding to the competitiveness challenges. </p><p>For example, in my own Department the Regional Enterprise Transition Scheme Feasibility Funding supports detailed evaluation of early-stage opportunities for new impactful regional enterprise development projects along with grants. </p><p>This scheme along with others, such as the SBCI Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the Microfinance Ireland Brexit Business Loan, will improve the capability and competitiveness of regional enterprises and encourage entrepreneurial activity among our SME community, ultimately reinforcing the competitiveness of the Irish economy.</p><p>The measures outlined above taken by the Government mean we can be confident the Irish economy will maintain and improve its competitiveness position compared to its peers in the coming years, despite the challenges we and other economies are facing. </p></reply>

However, despite this disruption, the Irish economy has shown remarkable resilience. Using the latest quarterly national accounts data from the CSO, the economy grew by approximately 14.5% in GDP terms in the first nine months of 2021 compared with the equivalent nine months of 2020. While growth in 2020 was predominantly driven by activities in the multinational sector, growth in 2021 was much more broad-based, with domestic activity rebounding swiftly this year as the economy opened up. Robust growth in the domestic and multinational sectors is expected to continue in 2022, with the Department of Finance forecasting grow of 5.0% in GDP terms, while Modified Domestic Demand is estimated to grow by 6.5% next year. </p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan (ERP) published in June 2021, sets out the Government&rsquo;s medium-term economic plan to rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s economy. As well as committing to a package of supports and investments to assist enterprise recovery, the Plan outlines a medium-term policy framework to rebuild sustainable enterprises, encourage job creation and sustainable and balanced post pandemic growth.</p>  <p>  The past 18 months have been difficult for most businesses, and some sectors continue to be impacted by public health restrictions. Last Friday's announcement regarding restrictions was a bitter blow for many businesses. Throughout the pandemic my Department and its enterprise agencies have engaged with and supported businesses within their remit and are continuing to do so as we face the current challenge of significant case numbers across the country.</p>  <p>  The ERP set a target to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by having 2.5 million people in work by 2024 and in more productive and resilient jobs. There has been considerable recovery in employment across the economy in recent months with employment standing at 2.35 million (seasonally adjusted) although this is likely to be impacted by the latest restrictions required to protect public health.</p>  <p>  The Plan adopts a two-pronged recovery approach to rebuilding sustainable enterprises; supporting the domestic SME sector, which is critical to broad-based jobs-led economic growth, whilst leveraging the enormous strength of the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) sector. It aims to create an environment for a jobs-led recovery through a focus on expanding sectors and by helping business become more resilient and agile.</p>  <p>The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation and catalysed new drivers of growth. Growing pressures and the increasingly obvious physical realities of climate change are requiring more ambitious commitments to climate action.  Reflecting the importance of the green and digital transition, the ERP and related strategies commit to driving a step change in the adoption of digital, AI and other new technologies by Irish businesses, as a critical driver of enterprise productivity and competitive advantage and to supporting enterprise on its decarbonisation pathway.  The ERP also includes a commitment to develop a National Clustering Policy and Framework to fully realise the economic potential from clustering. Clusters are now a major part of the industrial landscape internationally and an important policy instrument in driving the green and digital transitions and economic growth. Clustering is also a focus for both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to support their client companies and leverage synergies and spillovers.</p>  <p>  Innovation, collaboration, and knowledge are the cornerstone of a sustainable growth model to ensure the country is equipped to embrace new and emerging opportunities.

Many businesses are still hurting, and will be impacted by the most recent restrictions, but many businesses are also performing very well.</p>  <p>  Economic growth in 2020 was predominantly driven by activities in the multinational sector, but growth in 2021 has been more broad-based, with domestic activity rebounding swiftly this year as the economy opened up. The Department of Finance is forecasting that GDP growth for this year will be 15.6% and the domestic part of the economy, as measured by Modified Domestic Demand, will grow by 5.2%.</p>  <p>  This robust growth in the domestic and multinational sectors is expected to continue over the coming years with the Department of Finance forecasting growth of 5.0% in GDP for 2022 and 4.1% in 2023. This growth will also be reflected in the domestic economy with Modified Domestic Demand estimated to grow by 6.5% next year and 4.2% in 2023.</p>  <p>  The Economic Recovery Plan (ERP) published in June 2021, sets out the Government&rsquo;s medium-term economic plan to rebuild Ireland&rsquo;s economy. As well as committing to a package of supports and investments to assist enterprise recovery, the Plan outlines a medium-term policy framework to rebuild sustainable enterprises, encourage job creation and sustainable and balanced post pandemic growth. </p>  <p>  These measures will help to sustain the positive growth the economy has experienced over the last year and ensure it is sustainable over the coming five years. </p></reply>

In the first instance the Local Enterprise Offices act as a &lsquo;first stop shop&rsquo; providing advice and guidance, financial assistance, and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business. The Local Enterprise Offices provide a &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; service for all government supports available to the SME sector and can provide information and referrals to other relevant bodies under agreed protocols including Revenue, Micro Finance Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, LEADER, and Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Office network can offer direct grant aid to microenterprises (10 employees or fewer) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the Local Enterprise Office can provide financial assistance within four main categories, Feasibility grants, Priming grants, Business Development grants and Technical Assistance (TAME) grants. However, it should be noted that the Local Enterprise Offices do not provide direct grant-aid to areas such as retail, personal services, local professional services, construction/local building services, as it may give rise to the displacement of existing businesses.</p><p>The Local Enterprise Offices also provide a wide range of high-quality business training and capability supports tailored to meet specific business requirements of anyone exploring self-employment as an option or for those who are currently operating a business.</p><p>The Start Your Own Business programme guides clients through the various aspects of business and business planning.  The objective is to assist clients in critically assessing their business idea, its viability and to decide if they should proceed or take a step back. This programme covers a wide variety of topics designed to equip entrepreneurs to tackle the obstacles and opportunities presented in the current business environment. </p><p>The Mentor Programme is a service offered free of charge by the Local Enterprise Offices that allows business owners to work with an experienced mentor to identify solutions to areas of exposure within their business, develop strategies that are more robust, address issues and maximise potential opportunities. Business Mentors can assist business owners with the issue of access to finance for start-ups and can help in the completion of business cases and application forms. </p><p>Scaling and growing the export and start-up base continues to be a key priority for Enterprise Ireland. Enterprise Ireland helps entrepreneurs and start-up companies with business planning, mentoring and development advice, feasibility funding and finance. </p><p>Enterprise Ireland supports new enterprises through the High Potential Start Up (HPSU) division. If a start-up business has the potential to develop an innovative product or service for sale on international markets and the potential to create 10 jobs and &euro;1m in export sales within 3 years of starting up, they may qualify for assistance from Enterprise Ireland as a High Potential Start-up (HPSU). The Innovative HPSU Fund allows Enterprise Ireland to offer equity investment to HPSU clients, on a co-funded basis to support the implementation of a company&rsquo;s business plans. First time and follow-on equity investments in HPSUs are supported under this offer.</p></reply>

Enterprise Ireland, the agency of my Department which is responsible for the development and growth of Irish enterprises in world markets, works in partnership with Irish enterprises to help them start, grow, innovate and win export sales in global markets.</p>  <p>  To strengthen Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s services to clients in international markets, the agency opened new offices including in Manchester in the UK, in addition to the existing London office, to support companies to capitalise on growth opportunities in the North of England.</p>  <p>  New offices have also been opened in Munich in Germany and Lyon in France, with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s team there and elsewhere in the EU and Eurozone actively connecting with buyers in the marketplace and linking them to Irish companies in sectors of opportunity such as Construction, Engineering, Life Sciences/Medtech and Food. By 2020 client exports to the Eurozone had grown to &euro;5.85 billion, up from &euro;4.1 billion in 2015, making this region the second largest market by value for Enterprise Ireland clients.</p>  <p>  Each year, Enterprise Ireland offers a programme of trade missions, trade fairs and knowledge events which give their client companies based in Ireland the opportunity to connect with existing and new customers, access key decision makers, increase sales in international markets and exchange ideas.  In recent years, the majority of Ministerial-led trade missions have taken place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represented the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies. These trade missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and life sciences.</p>  <p>  Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Ministerial-led trade missions and events took place virtually throughout Quarters 1 to 3 of 2021. Physical Ministerial-led trade missions recommenced in September 2021 with missions taking place to the UK, France and Germany and to the UAE and Qatar in October 2021 and to Canada and the USA and to Saudi Arabia and Dubai in November 2021. A trade mission to Finland and Liverpool took place in early December.</p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success in growing exports has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets will be essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.</p></reply>

In 2020, Ireland increased its market share of FDI into Europe in the face of global declines in FDI. In July 2021, IDA Ireland reported significant investment growth in the first half of 2021, noting that FDI employment creation plans were nearing 2019 levels. IDA Ireland gained 142 investments in the first half of 2021, with an associated employment potential of over 12,530 jobs. 62 were new name investments and 48% of investments went to regional locations.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland recognises that there is global competition from many overseas locations within Europe and further afield in attracting mobile foreign direct investment. In this respect, the Agency is constantly monitoring competitor locations and the value propositions they offer potential mobile investment. Published reports from subject matter experts including EY and FDI Markets, a division of the Financial Times, indicate the top performing countries in Europe for FDI attraction. Ireland features prominently in these rankings, typically alongside far larger countries including the UK, Germany, Spain, France, and Poland.</p>  <p>  Competition for FDI is intense, with virtually every country in the world seeking new FDI investments. Every single job created in Ireland by an overseas company has been hard won, against competition from a growing range of sophisticated locations.  Ireland&rsquo;s success in attracting a large share of substantive, job creating FDI reflects the country&rsquo;s strength as a location in which businesses can succeed and grow.</p>  <p>  Our strengths &ndash; including our pro-enterprise policy environment, highly-educated English-speaking workforce and our membership of the European Union &ndash; remain attractive to international investors and IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with international clients, from a range of sectors, to attract job-rich investment from overseas firms.</p>  <p>  Retaining and strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a first-class destination for foreign direct investment remains fundamentally important to our economic model. I am confident that multinationals will continue to locate or expand further in Ireland in the years ahead.</p></reply>

These businesses are buoyed by the combined efforts of Enterprise Ireland, the LEO, IDA and the Local Authorities and partnership projects such as the MERITs Hub. LEO Kildare have conceived and driven this project from the start and predict it will create 120 tech jobs over next three years. I am also pleased to note that the Start Your Own Business Programme run by LEO Kildare, has over 450 participants so far this year, which gives hope for the future growth within Kildare.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government &ndash; Our Shared Future, in recognising the central role that will be played by Ireland&rsquo;s small and medium enterprises in determining the strength of the recovery for the economy and for jobs, from the shock of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, committed to the establishment of the SME Taskforce, and to the delivery by the Taskforce of the SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan, to map out an ambitious long-term strategic blueprint for Irish SMEs and entrepreneurs.</p>  <p>  The SME and Entrepreneurship Growth Plan was published in January of this year and provides Government with a set of recommendations, directly from the business community, of long-term strategic importance for SMEs and entrepreneurs. These recommendations include measures to help SMEs and entrepreneurs to start up, scale up and access foreign markets, as well as recommendations aimed at helping SMEs to become more productive and ready for the transition to a digital, green economy.</p>  <p>  Minister Robert Troy and I chair an Implementation Group, which was established to examine and take forward the Growth Plan recommendations. Through this avenue, we have identified key priority areas, that we feel have the most potential to make a positive impact on the SME sector over the coming year.</p>  <p>  These priority areas relate to the following: access to finance; digital transformation; increasing first time exporters; enhanced assistance for high-potential businesses; clustering and networks; SME management skills; reducing the regulatory burden on SMEs; delivery of a single portal for business information and supports; and ensuring comprehensive enterprise supports coverage.</p>  <p>  To further encourage SME Growth and new Job Opportunities nationwide, my Department is overseeing the development of nine new Regional Enterprise Plans to 2024, including for the Mid-East region, which are expected to be completed shortly. These are bottom-up plans, developed by regional stakeholders including the Local Authorities, the enterprise agencies, LEOs, regional skills forum and education and training institutes in each region.</p></reply>

The CSO does not publish data on the gross job gains or losses in each sector but only the total number employed. Based on the data published in the CSO's Labour Force Survey, my officials tell me that employment in the services sector grew from 1,579,000 jobs in 2015 to 1,906,000 jobs in 2021. There was positive net change in employment for each year between 2015 and 2021 with the exception of year 2020 due to the pandemic. Table 1 sets out the data for employment in services sector over the past six years.</p><p><b>Table 1: Employment (Q3 each year) &amp;amp; Net Change in Employment, Services Sector, 2015 -2021, (000s)</b> <table>    <tr>       <th></th>       <th>2015</th>       <th>2016</th>       <th>2017</th>       <th>2018</th>       <th>2019</th>       <th>2020</th>       <th>2021</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Services employment</td>       <td>1,579</td>       <td>1,628</td>       <td>1,667</td>       <td>1,725</td>       <td>1,775</td>       <td>1,715</td>       <td>1,906</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Services Net Change in Employment</td>       <td>35</td>       <td>49</td>       <td>39</td>       <td>58</td>       <td>50</td>       <td>-      59</td>       <td>191</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>Source: CSO Labour Force Survey, Q3 2021</p><p>A more detailed breakdown of employment and net change in employment within the sub-sectors of services are provided in the tables attached.</p><p>These figures include those on the PUP and EWSS as employed. This is due to the ILO standard measure of employment, unemployment and inactivity. The number on the PUP in the services sector was 32,451 as at 28th November 2021 and the number on EWSS in November 2021 was 275,100.</p><p>The Government published its Economic Recovery Plan in June, which set a target to exceed pre-crisis employment levels by having 2.5 million people in work by 2024 and in more productive and resilient jobs. As well as committing to a package of supports and investments to assist enterprise recovery, the Plan outlines a medium-term policy framework to rebuild sustainable enterprises, encourage job creation and sustainable and balanced post pandemic growth across all sectors of the economy.</p><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, Government has been committed to helping the sectors and workers most impacted. We will continue to create the right environment for a jobs-led recovery and further employment growth by helping business become more resilient and agile and supporting people to transition to new jobs in growing sectors of the economy. </p><p>Our Economic Recovery Plan a two-pronged approach to rebuilding a sustainable enterprise; a focus on domestic SMEs, whilst leveraging and reinforcing the enormous strength and resilience of the Foreign Direct Investment sector in Ireland. We will also accelerate the provision of training, reskilling and upskilling opportunities will be pursued through Pathways to Work 2021-2025. As the labour market recovers and as we approach our employment target of 2.5 million, an increasing focus will also be placed on improving labour market participation levels. </p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs leads on the implementation of this strategy.</p>  <p>  The strategy recognises how returning emigrants bring with them skills and knowledge gained abroad that can help develop both the national and local economies. To support this, the Government also recognises the need to minimise the challenges faced by individuals and families returning to Ireland.</p>  <p>  The strategy commits to a number of actions to support the return of members of the diaspora. These include monitoring barriers to return and adopting measures to remove them where possible; the negotiation of reciprocal agreements with countries that are home to significant Irish diaspora communities, such as double taxation and social security agreements; improvement of the provision of information on returning to Ireland and providing information for Irish citizens living overseas, including the dissemination of information on skills needs; and the expansion of mutual recognition and the portability of academic or professional qualifications earned overseas.</p>  <p>  The deputy may wish to seek an update from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the implementation of these actions.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority. </p>  <p>  The extent of the cutbacks in grant funding during the post 2008 recession meant that grant funding for road improvement schemes had to be curtailed because expenditure on protection/renewal was falling well short of what was required to adequately maintain the regional and local road network.</p>  <p>  Funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate protection and renewal of regional and local roads and so for this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the protection and renewal of the network with some limited investment in road improvement projects.</p>  <p>  Any road improvement projects proposed by local authorities for consideration for funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects put forward by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code (PSC) and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework (CAF). </p>  <p>  There has been some engagement between Kilkenny County Council and my Department  in relation to a proposed Kilkenny Northern Ring Road Extension. The Department has advised the Council of the Public Spending Code project appraisal requirements for any proposed transport scheme in March this year, including the need for the preparation of a Strategic Assessment Report. </p>  <p>  There has not been any further contact from the Council regarding this proposed scheme.</p>  <p>Regarding national roads, as Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.  Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the operation, management and upgrading of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  This is also subject to the requirements of the Public Spending Code and necessary statutory approvals.   In this context, TII is best placed to advise you regarding national roads.</p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred your question, in respect of any applications for national road projects, to TII for a direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

For example, from a post-2025 transport perspective, it is envisaged that green hydrogen may contribute to the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors such as HGVs, shipping and, potentially, the manufacture of synthetic sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs).</p>  <p>  My Department continues to provide policy support for industry-led initiatives focusing on hydrogen for future transport use. This includes the Hydrogen Mobility Ireland (HMI) multi-stakeholder group and the Galway Green Hydrogen Hub (G2H2) group. </p>  <p>  The evaluation of the Hydrogen bus trial by the National Transport Authority (NTA) in collaboration with Bus &Eacute;ireann, involving three new hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric double-deck buses on commuter services in the Greater Dublin Area, will also help to inform the future potential of this new technology within our public bus transport system.</p>  <p>  The Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy Statement was published on the 25th November sets out the future trajectory of increase in renewable fuels use in land transport, including incentives for future supply for use in transport of fuels such as biomethane and green hydrogen. My Department also intends, in early 2022, to carry out an assessment concerning the future availability of renewable fuels, which will inform implementation of this Policy beyond 2025 </p>  <p>  The alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicles grant will continue in 2022, aimed at supporting take-up of technologies such as CNG, biogas and hydrogen to decarbonise the heavy-duty freight sector. In addition, the accelerated capital allowance scheme for natural gas propelled vehicles and related equipment, include hydrogen vehicles and equipment, and the reduced excise rate on natural gas, will continue into 2022.</p>  <p>  As yet the transport market demand for hydrogen infrastructure for transport fuelling remains to be established, whether for national land transport modes or for international shipping and aviation. This is being kept under review by my Department with regard to informing future national and international policy development concerning renewable fuel and fuelling infrastructure for transport.</p>  <p>  In furthering consideration of these matters, officials of my Department are working with cross-Government colleagues, agencies and stakeholders concerning preparation and next steps for Ireland's future approach in relation to the potential use of green hydrogen in transport. As part of this, my Department is in discussion with the Department of the Taoiseach concerning relevant research in early 2022 under the Shared Island Fund. </p></reply>

The EWSS has been a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 crisis. It is an economy-wide scheme that operates across all sectors.  </p><p>In money terms, the overall support provided to-date (2<sup>nd</sup>December) by EWSS is over &euro;6.5 billion comprising direct subsidy payments of &euro;5.684 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;893 million to 51,700 employers in respect of over 694,600 employees.  </p><p>The eligibility criteria for EWSS are based on self-assessment principles and the legislation provides that an employer must be able to demonstrate that his or her business will experience a 30% reduction in turnover or customer orders between 1 January and 31 December 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  </p><p>As announced today, it has been decided to maintain the enhanced rates of EWSS subsidy for a further two months, December 2021 and January 2022. </p><p>Following approval from Government on Friday last, my Department worked with the Revenue Commissioners to further develop a proposal to modify the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) to provide targeted support for businesses which are subject to the latest public health restrictions. The objective of this modified scheme was to provide targeted, timely and sector-specific support to supplement the EWSS payments to affected businesses. However, on further consideration and analysis of the available data, it proved to be administratively very complex to design such a scheme and it would not be possible to have it operational ahead of Christmas as had been intended.</p><p>Instead, maintaining the enhanced rates of subsidy under the EWSS for a further two months offers a relatively more efficient and effective way to support affected businesses in the immediate term. This will give certainty to businesses when they need it most. </p><p>The Government and I have been clear that there will be no cliff edge to supports for employers but we have also been clear that the EWSS cannot run indefinitely, nor is it sustainable to continue with the enhanced rates for a prolonged period of time given the very substantial costs to the Exchequer.</p><p>As such, from 1 February 2022, the original two-rate structure of &euro;203 per week and &euro;151.50 per week will apply; for March and April 2022 the flat rate subsidy of &euro;100 per week will apply and the scheme will end on 30 April 2022.</p><p>The Deputies may wish to note that it has also been decided to extend the end-date of the CRSS to 31 January 2022 to align with the requirement for nightclubs and discos to close until 9 January 2022 under the Health Regulations.</p><p>A further amendment to the Finance Bill 2021 will be brought in the Seanad stage next week to give effect to these changes.</p><p>Finally, as has been the case throughout the pandemic, the Government will continue to monitor developments closely.</p></reply>

This relief is set out in section 825A of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997.</p><p>The relief effectively removes the foreign employment income from a liability to Irish tax where foreign tax has been paid on that employment income. In simple terms, the effect of the measure is that Irish tax will only arise where the individual has income other than income from a foreign employment.</p><p>The relief applies subject to certain conditions, which include the requirement that the duties of a qualifying employment are performed wholly outside the State in a country with which Ireland has a Double Taxation Agreement.  There is an exception in respect of merely incidental duties which may be performed in the State. </p><p>Revenue understands that due to COVID-19, certain individuals whose duties of employment are normally performed outside the State, may be required to work from home in the State, which would result in them being ineligible for relief under Section 825A TCA 1997.  In recognition of this, on 23 March 2020, Revenue issued updated guidance on the COVID-19 hub of its website and notified by eBrief No. 046/20, to provide for a concession in respect of this relief as follows - &ldquo;<i>where employees are required to work from home in the State due to COVID-19, such days spent working at home in the State will not preclude an individual from being entitled to claim this relief, provided all other conditions of the relief are met. For example, the employment income must be fully subject to non-refundable foreign tax</i>.&rdquo; This concession initially applied in respect of the 2020 tax year and was later extended (on 21 December 2020) to the 2021 tax year.</p><p>Revenue continues to regularly review all COVID-19 related matters and, I am advised that, provided all other conditions of the relief are met Revenue&rsquo;s temporary concession will be further extended into 2022, for the period that public health guidance requires individuals to work from home. Revenue will issue further guidance on this extension as soon as possible. </p><p>The COVID-19 concessional treatment is only relevant to those individuals whose employment enables them to perform their duties from home. Certain service type employments requiring in-person attendance at the workplace would not fall into this category and as such, these individuals would presumably not seek to claim the concession.</p><p>I am aware that there have been calls to place this concessional treatment on a statutory footing so that individuals who are resident in the State, but work outside the State for a non-resident employer, can continue to avail of the relief if they exercise their duties of employment in the State. </p><p>During the debates on Finance Bill 2020, I undertook that this matter would be examined as part of the work of the Tax Strategy Group (TSG) for 2021. The resultant paper was discussed by the TSG as part of its deliberations on 8 September last.  The examination encompassed very detailed consideration of all relevant matters including the equity of treatment between Irish residents who pay tax in the State, the competitive position of Irish employers and the established principles of international tax. The review identified a number of significant concerns from a policy perspective when having regard to the interest of the wider body of taxpayers encompassing Irish resident employees and employers. The full TSG paper (TSG Paper 21/04) can be located here  - www.gov.ie/en/collection/d6bc7-budget-2022-tax-strategy-group-papers/. </p><p>At present, I and my Department continue to give this matter consideration having regard to the comprehensive review carried out under the auspices of the TSG and the fundamental points which the TSG paper raises. </p><p>To address the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question relating to the fair tax treatment of cross-border workers, I would note that it is a long-standing principle of the tax code that if an individual is resident in Ireland, he/she is liable to pay tax in Ireland. In the event that an individual does not qualify for Trans-Border Workers&rsquo; Relief he/she may be entitled to relief from double taxation under the terms of the relevant Double Taxation Agreement. Ireland has an extensive network of Double Taxation Agreements, including with the United Kingdom, which have the effect of relieving double taxation on the same source income, thus a double taxation charge should not arise for cross-border workers. </p><p>It should also be noted that Ireland is exceptional in having a domestic relief such as Trans-Border Workers&rsquo; Relief. There is no comparable measure in the United Kingdom nor in many countries in mainland Europe that share land borders.</p></reply>

My Department has been working with the Housing Delivery Coordination Office (HDCO) and the County and City Management Association to identify the additional staffing resources required to deliver the social housing targets set out in Housing for All. As part of this process, the HDCO has undertaken a detailed analysis with each local authority to assess its existing housing delivery capacity and to identify any additional staffing requirements, having regard to the level of social housing to be delivered in that local authority.  </p>  <p>  The posts I have approved are all additional posts, which will provide a significant increase in the capacity of local authority housing teams. </p></reply>

A tenant's reckonable income is determined by the relevant local authority in accordance with sections 24(3) and (4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 and any directions issued by the Minister thereunder. In determining a tenants income, local authorities can include incomes from employment, private pensions, maintenance payments and certain social welfare payments (including pensions) where the social welfare payment is secondary to employment income. </p>  <p>  Financing the purchase of houses under the scheme is generally a matter for tenants and is a not linked to eligibility. Typically, the purchase may be financed from one, or a combination, of (a) their own resources, (b) a mortgage provided by a financial institution or (c) a local authority house purchase loan.</p>  <p>  Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland, commits to maintaining the right of social housing tenants to purchase their homes, albeit with some changes to eligibility.

It is vital that any approach is collective if it is to work, and crucially, that it meets both the needs of victims and our shared international human rights obligations.</p>  <p>  I have taken every opportunity in our regular engagements with the British Government, including at the recent British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) on 2 December, to set out this position. </p>  <p>  We have cautioned the British Government strongly against any unilateral action on this most sensitive of issues and I did so again at this BIIGC meeting.</p>  <p>  As agreed at the BIIGC on 24 June, the Government joined the British Government and the Northern Irish parties in a process of engagement of these issues, with discussions beginning in July. The intention has been to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland.</p>  <p>  As we have consistently stated, a statute of limitations as proposed by the UK Government in their Command Paper is not something the Government can support. It is important to say that there has been a clear message from victims groups throughout this process that this cannot be the way forward. </p>  <p>  At the last BIIGC, which took place on 2 December, I also raised our concerns in relation to specific individual legacy cases, including the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.</p>  <p>  The position of the Government is guided by the All-Party D&aacute;il motion on the 1974 Dublin Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, which calls on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow. The Programme for Government reiterates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to engaging with the British Government on this issue as matter of priority, in accordance with the All-Party D&aacute;il motions.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this request, at senior political level and in official level engagement by my Department, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue until a resolution is found.</p></reply>

Most of these projects have been completed with others being considered in the context of wider public sector pay arrangements. </p><p>Other measures undertaken, aimed at retaining capacity, include two Commitment Schemes, one in the Air Corps which has had a stabilising effect on pilot numbers and one in the Naval Service to incentivise sea going duties. In addition, a sea-going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,270, introduced in 2020, was extended for the current tax year and increased to &euro;1,500, and will be further extended into 2022.</p><p>Concurrent recruitment initiatives have been, and continue to be, undertaken which complement the above retention measures in countering current staffing challenges. Recruitment in 2021 has resulted in 577 inductions as at 15th November which includes 78 inductions into the Naval Service. </p><p>Additionally, the independent Commission on the Defence Forces is examining a range of recruitment and retention matters and I look forward to receiving their recommendations, which will be considered and implemented as appropriate.</p><p>My focus remains on retaining/restoring all branches of the Defence Forces at their full capacity, but there is no quick fix to the current challenges. In that context, I would reiterate that there has been significant work undertaken to date, and such work continues, but it will take time to see the full effect of the measures introduced.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-12-09a.663.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120900063#WRN03500"><p>Access to sexual and health education is an important right for students.  Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is mandatory in all primary schools and in post-primary Junior Cycle. Relationships and Sexuality Education (or RSE) is required at all levels, from Primary through to Senior Cycle. My Department has set out the content for each of these programmes in SPHE syllabuses and guidelines. </p>  <p>  In April 2018, then Minister for Education and Skills Mr. Richard Bruton asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to undertake a major review of RSE in schools across all stages of education to ensure that it is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people today in modern Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The NCCA were asked to look at a number of specific issues in respect of RSE and the curriculum, in particular the importance of consent and what it means. Other areas looked at included, but were not limited to: developments in relation to contraception; healthy, positive, sexual expression and relationships; safe use of the Internet; the role of school ethos: and, LGBTQ+ matters. </p>  <p>  The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) in primary and post-primary schools was published by the NCCA on 11th of December, 2019. </p>  <p>  As part of the review of RSE an extensive consultation occurred. Feedback was facilitated through an online survey, written submissions, round-table meetings and large events. Adjustments were made to the final report to reflect a stronger focus on issues that stakeholders wished to see highlighted, such as gender discrimination, sexual violence and pornography.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of the review was to examine the current experience of RSE within schools, the approach to teaching and learning, supports needed, and what is needed to improve RSE.  It was not within the remit of the review or the Report to set out in detail what students should learn about in an updated RSE curriculum. Such considerations will be part of the work arising from the NCCA Report. The work in redeveloping and updating the curriculum is being undertaken within the curriculum development structures in the NCCA and there will be opportunities for public and stakeholder engagement in this process.   </p>  <p>  The Report does not set out an exhaustive list of the topics that will be included in any future SPHE/RSE curriculum or details on how any specific topic might be taught or contextualised. Important issues such as consent need to be taught within a wider context of particular issues and it is the view of the NCCA that guidance materials and professional development for teachers are needed to create this wider understanding of what is involved. </p>  <p>  The NCCA has established two development groups for SPHE/RSE, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work in this area and support the development of guidance material for schools. </p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the work is on creating support materials for teachers for publication online as part of the Interim Guidance Toolkit. The toolkit's purpose is to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE/RSE linked to the current curriculum. This work is progressing well and sections of the toolkit have been published already, with further sections being published on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  In tandem with providing these immediate supports for teachers, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum is well under way, with an initial focus on the Junior Cycle. The review of the current Junior Cycle SPHE course was approved by the NCCA Council in the summer. This review contains a brief which will inform the work of the subject development groups in formulating an updated Junior Cycle SPHE specification, which began in September. </p>  <p>  Recognising the importance of the consultative approach the final round consultation will take place prior to finalising the new specification by end 2022. It is planned the new specification will be rolled out to all schools from September 2023 to facilitate CPD. The redevelopment of the Junior Cycle SPHE and RSE curriculum materials will be followed by the redevelopment of the Senior Cycle and Primary curriculums. Resources to equip teachers with the skills, competence and confidence to teach the curriculum effectively will also be developed. </p>  <p>  The Department continues to work closely with the NCCA to determine the approach to best give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

Factors such as an individual&rsquo;s social insurance record, their attachment to the workforce, and their countries of employment affect the rate of pension entitlement.  On receipt of a completed application, the person&rsquo;s State pension (contributory) entitlement can be examined by a Deciding Officer and they will be notified of the outcome.</p>  <p>  The person concerned applied for the means-tested residency-based State pension (non-contributory) on 5 November 2021.  Based on the information provided with their application, they do not qualify for this pension.  Their assessed weekly means (half the assessable means of the couple) exceed the current statutory limit for State pension (non-contributory).  The family home is not included in the means assessment.</p>  <p>  The person&rsquo;s spouse may wish to apply for an Increase for qualified adult (IQA) payment on their State pension (contributory) in respect of the person concerned.  An IQA is a means-tested payment, payable to State pension (contributory) claimants whose spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is being wholly or mainly maintained by them, and where that qualified adult&rsquo;s personal means from any source does not exceed a means test income limit.  Where property or assets are held jointly, the qualified adult's means are assessed as half of the total amount.  Again, the family home is not included in the means assessment.  On receipt of a completed application, eligibility for an Increase for qualified adult can be determined by a Deciding Officer.

The Commission was an independent body comprised of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  The Commission has completed its work and its report was published on 7th October 2021.  The Commission's Report, its Technical Sub-Committee's working papers, and submissions made to the Commission are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website, pensionscommission.gov.ie.</p>  <p>  The Commission&rsquo;s Report is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections; an examination of international approaches; and responses to an extensive consultation process.  It has unambiguously established that the current State Pension system is not sustainable into the future and that changes are needed, and it has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard - including measures to increase Social Insurance Fund (PRSI) income.</p>  <p>  The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and to the Commission for Taxation and Welfare for their views.  I understand that both the Chair of the Commission, Ms. Josephine Feehily and the Chair of its Technical Sub-Committee, Ms. Roma Burke met with the Joint Committee on 17th November 2021.  Officials from my Department also attended this meeting. </p>  <p>  In the interests both of older people and of future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far reaching recommendations in the Commission&rsquo;s Report very carefully and holistically.  My officials will work over the coming months to examine each of the recommendations.  They will consult across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.  </p>  <p>  I think it is really important that we complete that work before reaching conclusions.  I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to Government by the end of March 2022.  </p>  <p>  The State Pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland.  It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State Pension age and today&rsquo;s young workers including those who are only starting their careers. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

An Inspector&rsquo;s report is then used to inform the Deciding Officer, who is also appointed under the Social Welfare Acts to make decisions on claims based on all the facts and evidence available.  A record of facts and evidence relevant to an individual&rsquo;s claim is maintained for the purpose of the decision-making process.</p>  <p>  A Social Welfare Inspector will use his or her judgement in considering the most appropriate location for an interview in order to establish eligibility to the Department&rsquo;s schemes.  Interviews may be conducted in a customer&rsquo;s home, in the Department&rsquo;s offices or, for example, on a premises where employment is believed or suspected to be taking place.  </p>  <p>  However, I should emphasise that Social Welfare Inspectors may only enter a private home if invited.  There is no statutory power of entry, unlike a workplace.  If a customer does not wish to allow an Inspector to enter their private home, they may be requested by the inspector to make themselves available for interview at an alternative agreed location.  It is important to understand that Social Welfare Inspectors work across the range of the Department's activities and that home visits could be required, for instance, to facilitate a customer who for various reasons (e.g. a disability) is unable to leave their home, or to review a case without which a delay in payment to the customer might occur.  In many cases home visits are a more suitable way of interacting with the Department&rsquo;s inspectors for customers. </p>  <p>  During this COVID pandemic the Department is mindful of the safety of both Social Welfare Inspectors and customers and consequently all home visits are restricted at this time only to be undertaken in exceptional circumstances.  The operating position remains under review in line with Government guidelines and the ongoing COVID situation. </p>  <p>  Case specific information, including whether a site visit or home visit took place, is not recorded by my Department.  Therefore, it is not possible to provide the information that the Deputy is seeking as the information requested is not available.  However, and as the Deputy recently has discussed with some of the Department&rsquo;s officials, the Department is examining how this information could be gathered and recorded to allow reporting on the number of home visits made by the Department&rsquo;s inspectors.  </p></reply>

I would also note that the figures above reflect the amounts paid which can be impacted by the timing of the payments with, for example, the figures for 2019 also including all Electricity costs related to Miesian Plaza for the period May to December 2018.  These costs are managed by the Department of Health as lead tenant in the building. </p><p>In relation to your request for an additional schedule that sets out all energy costs associated with ICT hardware, that is, servers and so on in tabular form, we are not in a position to provide this information.  From 2016 until May 2018, this Department's server infrastructure was on the premises in Mespil Road.  However the electricity costs related to the server infrastructure etc. cannot be separated from the general electricity costs of the Department.  From May 2018 until December 2019 the Department's server infrastructure was hosted by Department of Social Protection in Con Colbert Data Centre and there were no electricity costs paid by my Department in relation to that centre.  Since December 2019 our infrastructure has been provided by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO).

The Student Grant Scheme, administered by Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), provides grant assistance to students attending an approved full-time course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. </p>  <p>   The Student Grant Regulations prescribe that an approved course is a full-time course leading to a major higher education and training award which takes a minimum of two years to complete in an approved institution. I understand from the details supplied that the student in question is pursuing a part-time Level 9 course entitled the Academy of Play and Psychotherapy. Part-time courses do not meet this definition and are not approved courses under the Student Grant Scheme. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains commitments to, among other things, review SUSI eligibility criteria, adjacency rates, postgraduate grant supports and the definition of an approved course. On foot of these commitments,  I gave approval to commence a review of the Student Grant Scheme.  I am currently awaiting the final report of the review of the Student Grant System. My expectation is that I will receive the final report before Christmas.  My intention is to submit the report to Government, and then to publish it.  The Deputy will understand that implementation of the report's recommendations will be a matter for consideration in the context of such factors as its assessment by Government and the costs and budgetary implications of those recommendations.  The review will, however, have a crucial role to play in shaping the future development and expansion of student support to ensure the accessibility and inclusiveness of our higher education system. </p>  <p>  I would encourage students to contact the free and confidential guidance services available through the Education and Training Boards and the access offices and guidance services in Higher Education Institutions to explore their options.</p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in higher education institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Students on full- or part-time courses leading to a higher education award (National Framework of Qualifications level 6-10) in Irish universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. </p>  <p>  Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is administered by the Department of Social Protection. Accordingly, any queries regarding the eligibility criteria or status of a BTEA application or other social welfare schemes must be referred to that Department.</p></reply>

Management bodies confirmed that they are actively looking at a range of approaches to ensure that end of term examinations will be safe, and that the requirements of students who may have Covid-19 or underlying health conditions can be addressed.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the meeting was that individuals who cannot sit exams due to Covid-19 concerns will be offered alternatives. I would encourage the individual to engage with the institution concerned and seek a different arrangement.  In all instances public health must remain a priority and I know that there will be a continuing focus on the evolving and often quickly changing public health situation overall.

All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  </p>  <p>  There is no review mechanism of citizenship decisions. However, in the past, officials of my Department have met applicants to explain the decision making process relating to Irish Associations. It is open to the person referred to by the Deputy to request such a meeting with my officials, and any such request will be carefully considered. It also remains open to the person concerned to submit a new application at any time.  </p>  <p>  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended gives the Minister the absolute discretion to waive the statutory conditions in certain circumstances, including where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations (defined as related through blood, affinity or adoption to a person who is or is entitled to be an Irish citizen). </p>  <p>  As set out under Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956:</p>  <p>  Section 16; (2) For the purposes of this section a person is of Irish associations if:</p>  <p>  (a) he or she is related by blood, affinity or adoption to, or is the civil partner of, a person who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen, or</p>  <p>  (b) he or she was related by blood, affinity or adoption to, or was the civil partner of, a person who is deceased and who, at the time of his or her death, was an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen. </p>  <p>  There is no right or entitlement to have any of the statutory conditions waived, even where the applicant comes within the certain circumstances defined. The policy is that these powers should only be used sparingly and in exceptional and compelling circumstances, particularly where other viable pathways to naturalisation are available to an applicant under the Act. To do otherwise would be manifestly unfair to the thousands of other applicants who apply annually, having satisfied the statutory criteria under Section 15 of the Act.  </p></reply>

Each applicant will have an opportunity to nominate up to four family members who are currently residing in Afghanistan or who have fled to neighbouring territories and whom they consider would be especially at risk in terms of their freedom and safety. </p>  <p>  My Department will open the Programme for applications very shortly and it may be open to the person concerned to make an application to that Programme, subject to meeting its criteria. Full details of the scheme will be published on my Department's Irish Immigration website (www.irishimmigration.ie). </p>  <p>  A key focus of the Programme will be on establishing the identity of those intending to come to Ireland.

My Department has contributed to and participated in the large scale cross-Government communications programme which has been running since the start of the pandemic.  This includes supporting and amplifying Government and public health messaging through both our internal and external communications channels. There has been no spending by my Department on advertising directly related to COVID-19 during the period in question.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that while not specifically a campaign to raise awareness of COVID-19, since March 2020 my Department has been running the important &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo; campaign. The purpose of this campaign is to reassure victims of domestic abuse that support services from State agencies and the voluntary sector remain available and accessible during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of any restrictions in place.</p>  <p>  In addition to reminding victims of domestic abuse that help is &lsquo;Still Here&rsquo;, the campaign reminds anyone concerned for their safety that any restrictions on movement do not apply to people at risk, or who are removing themselves from a domestic abuse situation. To date the Department has spent &euro;397,944.36 on the 'Still Here' campaign.</p></reply>

It is a priority of mine to ensure that community groups continue to be supported in their valued contributions to their local CCTV schemes whilst ensuring sufficient, proportionate oversight of data protection statutory considerations. </p>  <p>  Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000. </p>  <p>  The scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but also to allow funding applications for extension or upgrade of existing community CCTV systems which are incomplete or obsolete. Applicants may now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.</p>  <p>  A total of 34 schemes have been funded to date with commitments of almost &euro;940,000 made to these schemes across 10 counties. Funding continues to be available for 2021. I am advised that we have not received any applications for CCTV funding from anywhere in North County Dublin. However, if the Deputy is aware of groups wishing to avail of the grant aid scheme, further details are available to download from my Department's website and support and guidance is available to help interested groups through a dedicated email address. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that community-based CCTV is governed by Section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI 289 of 2006). This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must:</p>  <p>  - be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,</p>  <p>  - have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and</p>  <p>  - have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.</p>  <p>  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Digital Recordings) Bill was published on 29 April 2021 and has been submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny. This Bill will provide statutory underpinning for Garda overt recording, which will include CCTV authorised in local communities by the Garda Commissioner. It is planned to have a further review of the terms and conditions of the current scheme to bring it into line with the proposals in this new legislation and in keeping with the commitment in the Programme for Government. Once this review is completed, appropriate guidance will issue to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the control and supervision of CCTV systems. It is expected the Bill will be enacted in 2022.  The legislation, once enacted, will replace Section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  </p></reply>

Ireland remains vulnerable to a further deterioration in the disease profile depending on several factors, including levels of social contact in the coming weeks and over the festive period, adherence to basic public health protective measures and levels of immunity across the population. The potential impact of the recently identified Omicron variant remains uncertain at present.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware a COVID-19 pass, based on certification of vaccination or recovery, is required for indoor hospitality, cinemas, theatres, events, gyms, leisure centres (excluding access to swimming pools or standalone swimming pool facilities) and hotel bars and restaurants. </p>  <p>  The current high level of COVID-19 infection and the dominance of the significantly more transmissible Delta variant poses a very substantial threat, particularly to those who are not fully protected through vaccination. Public health advice remains that those who are not fully vaccinated or have immunity from infection should avoid congregated indoor settings for their own and others safety.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, Covid certification arrangements are in place in many countries across the EU. There are a range of different systems in place, including those which require proof of immunity from vaccination or recovery only, similar to the system in Ireland, to others that allow a not detected test result to permit access to facilities. There are also differences in terms of the types of settings that certification is required for.</p>  <p>  Government keeps all measures under review on an ongoing basis. </p></reply>

This includes establishing the regulatory framework for the new scheme. </p>  <p>  With the aim of ensuring that all service-users are provided with a standard, high-quality level of care which is safe, effective, and person-centred, it is envisaged that the regulatory framework will comprise: (i) primary legislation for the licensing of public and private home-support providers; (ii) minimum requirements (i.e., regulations); and (iii) HIQA National Standards for Home Support Services.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Government gave approval to draft a General Scheme and Heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for home-support providers. This is being progressed by the Department with a view of bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. It is expected that the primary legislation will give the Minister for Health the power to make regulations in respect of minimum requirements which will form the criteria against which a provider&rsquo;s eligibility to hold a licence will be determined. A regulatory impact analysis undertaken by the Department will take place in 2022 to ensure effectiveness and mitigate risks.</p>  <p>  The aim is to ensure that service-users are safe-guarded and protected, and a responsive, person-centred, quality-driven home-support service is provided. This is central to the Sl&aacute;intecare objective of providing &lsquo;right care, in the right place at the right time&rsquo;. The regulations being drawn up by the Department and the standards being drafted by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) both take cognisance of the diverse and often complex needs of those who require homecare and support. </p>  <p>  HIQA has extensive experience in the regulation of social care services and has, in the last 18 months, conducted wide-ranging research into the regulation of home-support services. HIQA ran a public scoping consultation in September to inform the development of National Standards for Home Support Services. HIQA has convened an Advisory Group to assist in the process of developing the Draft National Standards.</p>  <p>  In collaboration with HIQA and in consultation with the Health Service Executive and other key informants, the Department is in the process of developing draft regulations. These draft regulations will be circulated for targeted stakeholder consultation this month. This consultation will inform further amendments in advance of a public consultation in 2022. </p></reply>

It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times for orthopaedic treatment, especially for time sensitive procedures, and I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families. </p>  <p>  As part of Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland&rsquo;s (CHI) paediatric orthopaedic service, most complex orthopaedic cases are treated at Crumlin and Temple Street, with Crumlin providing specialised multi-disciplinary treatment for the most complex patients. The National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional capacity for the treatment of less complex orthopaedic patients, including routine scoliosis procedures. By using the capacity provided by Cappagh, CHI can free up space in order that complex orthopaedic procedures can be carried out centrally at CHI sites.</p>  <p>  More specifically, additional theatre capacity at the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh commenced on the 26 April 2021 for daycase surgery. CHI has advised the Department of Health that this should result in a positive impact in reducing long waiting times for general orthopaedics, in addition to consequential capacity gains for scoliosis patients. In 2022 CHI is planning to undertake a range of inpatient, daycase and outpatient orthopaedic appointments in Cappagh.</p>  <p>  In 2018 Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services. This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018. The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 WTEs in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services.</p>  <p>  Funding proposals submitted to the HSE by Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland for increased investment in paediatric orthopaedic services in 2022 will be decided as part of the finalisation of the Access to Care fund. In addition, the HSE has advised my Department that a proposal to fund an additional theatre at Temple Street is currently progressing through the normal HSE capital approval process. Improving access to scheduled care capacity remains a priority for the Department of Health as work continues to finalise next years&rsquo; Access to Care fund. For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.</p></reply>

These were as follows:</p><p>- there is a significant strengthening of communications targeted at both household settings and relevant sectors, outlining why good ventilation is important and the practical steps that can be taken to improve ventilation;</p><p>- an assessment of ventilation forms a core component of inspection of premises under the Work Safely Protocol and other sectoral guidance; and</p><p>- further to the publication of revised HPSC guidance on ventilation in non healthcare settings, that renewed consideration be given to the provision of mechanisms/incentives to support businesses/organisations to improve ventilation.</p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control Division (AMRIC) was established in early 2019, under the Office of the Chief Clinical Officer.  It is led by the AMRIC National Clinical Lead and consists of a core multidisciplinary team with expertise across a range of relevant clinical domains. </p><p>The AMRIC provides expert advice on the practical and safe implementation and application of antimicrobial resistance and infection control measures in health and social care settings. In addition, the HSE has advised that all HSE AMRIC guidance promotes adequate ventilation as one of a number of measures to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>On 18th November 2021, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre published updated &ldquo;Guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19 V3.0&rdquo;. This is available at: www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/placesofworshipguidance/Guidance%20on%20non%20HCbuilding%20ventilation%20during%20COVID-19.pdf The HPSC advise that guidance should be read and interpreted in conjunction with all sector specific government departmental advice.</p><p>Guidance on the sectoral application of the broad range of public health measures, including ventilation, is a matter for individual sectors. In this regard, the Department of Education has provided detailed information on ventilation within schools, including in relation to air cleaning devices. This is available at www.gov.ie/en/publication/ad236-guidance-on-ventilation-in-schools/.</p></reply>

The OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy.  Childhood obesity is a key priority under the Policy, as is reducing the inequalities seen in obesity rates.</p><p>The OPAP provides for a mid-term review to be carried out, which will lead to a refreshed and updated Plan with a revised set of actions for the remaining lifetime of the OPAP.  This review provides the opportunity to consider developments and new evidence since the publication of the OPAP, and to assess which elements might best be further progressed by legislation or by other means. A strong evidence base will be required for any new legislative measures, and the review of the OPAP will build on the work already underway to identify gaps in the implementation of the Plan, including where actions need to be progressed, whether by legislative or other means, and where further research is required.  This will input into what measures should be included in a Public Health Obesity Act.</p><p>In relation to the issues around advertising and marketing of unhealthy foods aimed at children, Ireland is currently co-leading a Work Package in this area under the EU Joint Action &ldquo;Best ReMaP&rdquo; (Best practices in Reformulation, Marketing and public Procurement).  The title of the Work Package is &ldquo;Best practices in reducing marketing of unhealthy food products to children and adolescents&rdquo;.  Work has been underway under this Joint Action since October 2020 and there are 17 Member States participating.</p></reply>

The HSE has advised that funding was allocated in the 2019 Capital Plan for the provision of a second Cath lab at University Hospital Waterford and planning permission was received from Waterford City and County Council in January 2020.</p><p>The HSE has further advised that the Contractor for the construction of the new Cath Lab at UHW was formally appointed on 25th March 2021. The project commenced on 17th May 2021 with a 13 month works programme. The project could not commence earlier due to levels of Covid Infection presenting at UHW.</p><p>It is expected the main Contractor will hand over the project by the end of June 2022. Equipping and commissioning will follow for a period of 2 months and the Cath Lab is expected to be available for operational use from September 2022 onwards.</p><p>The HSE has advised that discussions are on-going in relation to the 12 bed day ward to support the second Cath Lab and that UHW will commence recruitment of the required staff for the Second Catheterisation Laboratory in the coming months.</p><p>The Herity Report also recommended that the current 9 to 5 provision of emergency pPCI services at UHW should cease to allow the hospital to focus on the much larger volume of planned work. The then Minister for Health asked the Department to address the implications of this recommendation by arranging for a National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services.</p><p>The National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services commenced in January 2018, under the Chairmanship of Professor Phillip Nolan.  While substantial progress has been made on the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services, the COVID-19 Pandemic impacted on the progress of the review during 2020 and into 2021.

At present all children up to and including the age of 5 are eligible for a GP visit card and therefore GP care without charges.</p>  <p>  The Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Act 2020 provides, amongst other things, for the phased expansion of GP care without fees to all children aged 12 years and under in three phases: to children aged 6 and 7; to children aged 8 and 9; and to children aged 10,11 and 12. Budget 2022 provides for the initial stage of this phased expansion, the provision of GP care without fees to all children aged 6 and 7 and my Department has commenced work to roll this service out in the course of 2022.</p>  <p>  The specific date for commencing the expansion remains under consideration in light of COVID-19 and the additional pressures the expansion might place on general practice in that context and will require consultation with the IMO, representing General Practitioners. It is important to ensure that any additional pressures placed on general practice will not limit its capacity to meet the needs of all patients in the community.</p></reply>

While the situation we find ourselves in is far from ideal, I am pleased to report significant progress has been made in the past year, particularly on felling and road licences. </p>  <p>  The investment in resources and continual improvement has had a positive impact with a significant increase in licence output in recent months. This has brought our output to 3,718 licences issued to date this year. I am confident that we will meet our target of 4,000 licences by year end which will be a 60% increase on last year. </p>  <p>  Our road licensing output for this year will be double the target set for us in the Climate Action Plan. The volume of timber licensed will be 8 million m3 this year. This is 60% higher than last year and the highest volume ever licensed in a single year. </p>  <p>  We are making progress under Project Woodland, with the second interim report published at the end of October. </p>  <p>  In terms of licensing, an important initiative is the in-depth review of the forestry licensing system being carried out by a consultant with legal and environmental expertise. It will review the existing statutory framework for the licensing of forestry activities in relation to environmental and public participation obligations in order that practical advice can be provided to the Department on how to work more efficiently within the existing legal framework.  That report is expected at end February next.  </p>  <p>  In terms of afforestation, outputs are not where I&rsquo;d like them to be but there are signs of improvement. Officials are prioritising the assessment of afforestation licences on hand, using the same system as was applied to felling licences and 10 ecologists are now dedicated to afforestation, with more to be recruited.  </p>  <p>  We will build on this years momentum in 2022 and will implement any and all practical process improvements which result from the review and analysis in train under Project Woodland. I remain fully committed to delivering a licensing system which will meets the needs of the sector and of society as a whole.</p></reply>

This is true regardless of the separation distance between the project and the European site(s). </p><p>A likely zone of impact is used to identify those European Sites to be specifically addressed during screening. In decision making, regarding the likelihood of a project having a significant effect on a European Site(s), all European Sites within a certain radius (or &lsquo;likely zone of impact&rsquo;) should be considered at screening stage, in addition to hydrologically connected European Sites.  </p><p>For example, in relation to a Special Protection Area, it is important to consider whether the project area lies within the foraging distance of bird species for which that SPA was designated, and many of these foraging distances exceed 3km. </p><p>There were a number of factors which prompted the Department to make the change in mid-2019. Appropriate assessment screening decisions would be vulnerable to challenge if my Department continued to consider at screening stage only those European Sites within 3km. </p><p>Practice in other land use sectors where appropriate assessment screening is required is also to provide for a 15km likely zone of impact. </p><p>Furthermore, results on individual cases heard by the FAC also indicated that the 3km radius was not appropriate.  Every application for a forestry licence is assessed on a case-by-case basis, but also in combination with other plans and projects in the area.</p><p>The regulatory review currently under way as part of Project Woodland is considering the specific question of the 15km radius and this independent review will report in February 2022.</p></reply>

In advance of this, the Department of Social Protection are involved in helping employers recruit from the domestic and European labour market, supplemented through initiatives such as &lsquo;Help2Harvest&rsquo;. Sectors also need to have appropriate labour attraction and retention policies in place.</p>  <p>  The new Food Vision 2030 strategy includes a goal to &ldquo;Attract and Nurture Diverse and Inclusive Talent&rdquo; and this recommends five actions for the sector: employers in the agri-food industry will develop an education, skills and talent attraction and retention strategy; they will ensure decent work and address labour shortages; education and training programmes, including new apprenticeships, will be kept under review to ensure they respond to needs such as in the areas of environmental sustainability; they will promote and improve gender balance at all levels, but particularly at senior management and board level; and they will promote and develop initiatives to improve diversity and inclusion.  </p>  <p>  I recently chaired the first meeting of the Food Vision High Level Implementation Committee which will provide leadership in progressing the missions and actions set out in the Food Vision strategy.</p></reply>

It is also underpinned on the community side with &ldquo;Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities: A Five-Year Strategy to Support the Community and Voluntary Sector in Ireland 2019-2024&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  Since its formation, the budget for the Department has increased by over 50% and for 2021 it stands at &euro;351m and this has supported rural and urban communities all over the country.</p>  <p>  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme has supported the revitalisation of rural towns and villages in Ireland. Projects supported include, for example, bringing vacant dwellings back into use, shopfront enhancement, town/village marketing, and creation of green spaces. The minimum level of project funding is &euro;20,000, and the maximum is &euro;500,000. Towns and Villages the length and breadth of Ireland have benefitted: - over 1,341 projects in 838 towns and villages supported over the past five years.  </p>  <p>  The Outdoor Recreation and Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS) has provided funding for the development and/or enhancement of outdoor recreational infrastructure such as trails, walkways, cycleways, blueways and bridleways in rural areas. Since 2016, we have invested over &euro;71 million in over 1,100 projects. </p>  <p>  The Walks Scheme has also contracted landholders to undertake maintenance work on National Waymarked Ways and other priority trails that traverse their lands. On 29 September, I announced the 'approval in principle' of 31 new trails to join the Walks Scheme. This fulfils the commitment in the Programme for Government and Our Rural Future to double the number of trails on the Scheme to 80 trails. </p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme has provided funding under a number of different measures for small-scale infrastructural projects in designated rural areas. My Department reviews the type of initiatives to be funded under the Programme each year. The Measures funded through this year's programme included supports for School and Community Safety projects, Outdoor Community Recreation Facilities and Community Wellbeing Supports - funding for Community Gardens and Allotments and Mobility and Cancer Care Transport vehicles. Since 2016, my Department has invested over &euro;45 million in over 1,700 projects under the CL&Aacute;R programme.  </p>  <p>  My Department operates a number of funding schemes that focus on projects supporting remote working through the development of hubs, including the development of Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) as long-term, digitally-enabled community assets. To date, the National Hub Network Working Group led by my Department has identified and mapped over 450 remote working hubs across the country. Approximately 160 remote working hubs have joined the National network with this number rising on an ongoing basis. </p>  <p>  In July this year, through the Connected Hubs funding stream, I awarded close to &euro;9 million in funding to over 100 successful applicants, details of which are available on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  The LEADER Programme supports actions in rural areas targeted at addressing local needs under the broad themes of economic development, social inclusion, and rural environment. The programme is administered by 29 Local Action Groups (LAGs) throughout Ireland. To date in 2021 over &euro;37m has been allocated in Leader funding.</p>  <p>  The Rural Regeneration and Development Fund has provided funding for ambitious and strategic large scale projects in rural areas to support town and village centre regeneration, remote working, connectivity, tourism development and economic and enterprise development which will help assist in attracting people back to live in rural areas. To date &euro;255m has been provided for 164 projects costing &euro;337m. This investment from the Fund will deliver on the National Strategic Objective of Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities and is key to achieving the objectives and key deliverables of Our Rural Future and the forthcoming Town Centre First policy approach.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Community Services Programme, or CSP, currently supports over 420 community organisations. This helps them to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model of delivery, with a total funding allocation of almost &euro;49m during 2021. </p>  <p>  In 2020, my Department supported close to 600 organisations to continue to deliver vital services to the most vulnerable in our communities, through the &euro;45m COVID-19 Stability Fund for Community and Voluntary Organisations, Charities and Social Enterprises. Following an additional allocation of &euro;10m a further 244 organisations were supported by the fund in 2021, allowing them to continue to deliver critical services to their communities.  </p>  <p>  The PEACE PLUS programme 2021 - 2027, which is currently awaiting approval from the EU Commission, will be a new North South cooperation programme which will combine the existing PEACE and INTERREG EU funding strands into one cohesive cross-border programme, with a total value of &euro;1 billion.  </p>  <p>  Under the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) funding is provided to Local Development Companies to complete work with marginalised individuals and the groups that represent them. Since 2018, the programme has supported over 80,000 individuals and over 5,000 Local Community Groups.  My Department will provide SICAP funding in excess of &euro;220 million over the years 2018-2023, with over &euro;39 million in 2021, supporting front line workers in Local Development Companies to deliver SICAP on the ground. </p>  <p>  In 2021, &euro;1m in additional funding is being used to support a &ldquo;Community Development Pilot Programme (CDP)&rdquo;. The aim is to trial community development initiatives that address poverty, social exclusion and inequality, and promote human rights. Seven applicant organisations will take part in the pilot programme.   </p>  <p>  The Community Enhancement Programme (CEP) provides small grants to enhance facilities in disadvantaged areas. The 2021 CEP was launched in May with funding of &euro;4.5m.w closed. More recently, another round of funding, the &euro;9m Community Activities Fund, was launched under the CEP to support groups impacted by COVID-19. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that we are committed to keeping all of our funding programmes and schemes operational into the years ahead as part of our important policies, including Our Rural Future and Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities.</p></reply>

The NDP will support the achievement of the ambitious objectives set out in that document.</p><p>Over the life of the NDP my Department will continue to invest in and support Rural Ireland and communities across the country through various schemes such as the Rural Regeneration and Development Fund, LEADER Programme, Town and Village Renewal Scheme, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, Local Improvement Scheme, CL&Aacute;R Programme, Islands Capital Programme, Community Enhancement Programme, Libraries Investment Capital funding and the PEACE PLUS Programme. However, I can assure the Deputy that investment will continue apace over the lifetime of the NDP.</p><p>Ongoing dialogue is maintained by my Department with rural and urban stakeholders in order to identify and respond to issues impacting on individuals and communities.  I will continue to work collaboratively with my Government colleagues to monitor the issues which impact our urban and rural communities and to support the creation of vibrant and sustainable communities across this country.</p></reply>

To ensure that the views and experience of the volunteering community is strongly reflected in the implementation of the actions, five subgroups oversee and recommend on the delivery of each action.</p>  <p>  A number of actions within the Strategy have also been implemented or commenced. These include the opening of seven new volunteer centres in May 2021, the launch of the Community Volunteers Programme in September and the commencement of research projects in a number of areas including volunteer management and capacity building.  An annual update on the implementation of the Strategy will be published early in 2022 and will be available on my department's website.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has also been made in implementing the National Social Enterprise Policy for Ireland 2019-2022, under its three main objectives &ndash; building awareness, growing and strengthening social enterprise, and achieving policy alignment. As we enter the final year of the current policy the process of reflecting on progress achieved and the priorities for the future has begun. My Department has engaged the OECD to provide an in-depth, independent review of the current policy which should provide a very good starting point to the process of developing a successor policy from 2023. </p>  <p>   As we move forward with the development of a new Policy we will do so in partnership with all stakeholders. This partnership approach has served us very well thus far, and I have no doubt it will be critical to building on the momentum we have achieved in developing the sector further. </p>  <p>  Next year my Department will also be conducting the first comprehensive Data Collection &ldquo;census&rdquo; of social enterprise in Ireland. A Request for Tender is currently on e-tenders until mid-January 2022. This significant exercise will give us a better understanding of the scale of the sector, and will provide a robust evidence basis for the development of our new policy. </p></reply>

No 597 of 2008) provide for a Public Lending Remuneration (PLR) Scheme in respect of the public library service. PLR is the mechanism by which authors receive payment for the loans of their books by public libraries. However, under these regulations, only printed books qualify for PLR.</p>  <p>  My Department has paid &euro;2.8m in PLR since 2009 and remains committed to the PLR scheme with payments in respect of books loaned in 2020 issuing to authors this week.</p>  <p>  I have received correspondence from the Irish Writers Union requesting an amendment to the Regulations to incorporate ebooks into the PLR scheme and this is currently under consideration by my Department in consultation with the Libraries Development Unit in the Local Government Management Agency. </p></reply>
