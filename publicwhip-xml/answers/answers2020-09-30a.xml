The basis of the TSD chapter is the premise that increased trade should not come at the expense of the environment or labour conditions.  </p>  <p>  I welcome that both the EU and Mercosur agreed that strong labour and environmental standards which were seen as vital to the success of securing the Agreement with both parties committed to ensuring that labour and environmental standards are not reduced in order to attract trade and investment. </p>  <p>  Critically, the TSD chapter of the EU-Mercosur Agreement is itself subject to a specific dispute settlement procedure. Therefore, should the EU or Mercosur countries consider that the other party is not abiding by the rules, or honouring their commitments, formal government-level consultations can be requested. If the situation is not resolved, an independent panel of experts can be asked to examine the matter and prepare a report with recommendations. This report, including the recommendations, would be made public so that stakeholders and the relevant institutions on both sides can follow up on the relevant issues.</p>  <p>  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has commissioned an independent consultancy firm, after a competitive tender process, to undertake an Economic and Sustainability Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the EU-Mercosur Agreement. The ESIA will consist of two equally important and complementary components, namely a comprehensive analysis of the potential economic benefits as well as a robust sustainability impact assessment (including social, human rights and environmental impacts) that the trade Agreement could have in Ireland and the Mercosur countries of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.  Similarly, a wide-ranging consultation process will ensure the engagement of all relevant stakeholders in the conduct of the Impact Assessment. </p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the Programme for Government, the ESIA is designed to assist Government in formulating its position on future ratification of the Agreement.  Furthermore, the European Commission&rsquo;s Sustainability Impact Assessment, and other reports such as that published by Oxford University, can form part of the overall analysis work that is being conducted, with a view to informing the Government's approach when the formal legal texts of the Agreement are presented to the Member States by the Commission. In that regard, I have indicated that enforceable guarantees, which strengthen environmental protections, particularly with regard to the Amazon rainforest and climate action, are a priority.</p></reply>

This intervention alone will result in:</p><p>- 90 additional high power chargers (150kW), each capable of charging two vehicles</p><p>- 52 additional fast chargers (50kW), which may replace existing 22 kW standard chargers</p><p>- 264 replacement standard chargers (22kW) with more modern technology and with each consisting of two charge points</p><p>Since the delivery stage of the project commenced in October 2019, 159 22kW chargers, each with two charge points, have been replaced bringing the total number of these chargers nationally to 318.</p><p>In addition to the new replacements for 22kW chargers, three multi charger sites have also been delivered, one each in Galway (M6), Kildare (M9) and Laois, while the programme to upgrade 22kW chargers to 50kW has already commenced with 10 installations now in place. </p><p>ESB is continuing to assess other suitable sites on motorways and national road networks, with the aim of delivering over fifty high power (50-150kW) charging hubs. These hubs can provide up to 100km of driving range in as little as six minutes. Final sites are based on a range of factors including current charge point usage, traffic volume, accessibility, amenities and grid capacity. More site locations will be announced in the coming months. The current project will run until 2023.</p><p>Further information can be found at .</p><p>My Department, via the SEAI, also provides a grant of up to &euro;5,000 to support local authorities in the installation of on-street public chargers. With regard to this scheme applications are currently being assessed in respect of 24 charge points to be installed across 2 local authorities with the expectation that demand for support under this scheme will grow significantly in 2021 and thereafter.</p><p>Combined with an effective public charging network, Ireland's home charging policy will help sustain and service the expected growth of electric vehicles on Irish roads. Charging while at home accounts for around 80% of electric vehicle charging in Ireland and it is best practice, internationally, to promote home charging as the most common and cheapest form of charging. To support home charging, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department, administers an EV home charger grant of up to &euro;600 towards the purchase and installation of an EV home charger unit.</p><p>The cost of installing a charger varies from site to site depending on grid capacity, required civil and electrical works and type of charger. There are a number of charge points installers providing this service throughout Ireland and in this regard ESB ecars procures civil and electrical works and supply of chargers from third parties. Any projected or actual costs are therefore commercially sensitive and ESB ecars does not disclose this information.</p></reply>

This represents an increase from the 150Mbps committed to under the Contract. The deployment plan forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State having access to high speed broadband within the next four years.</p><p>  Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 23 counties and steady progress is being made with over 98,000 premises surveyed as of the 29 September. This activity is increasing week on week and by year end, NBI expects to have completed some 120,000 surveys. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and laying fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December.</p><p>  The number of premises surveyed in Monaghan to date is 4,355 with surveyors working in areas such as Cornacassa, Cortolvin, Ballybay, and Stranooden. Other areas which will be surveyed shortly include Mullinahinch, Bellanode, Drumhilock, Tydavnet, Cloughnart, Scotstown and Killymarley.</p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. Some 155 BCP sites have been installed by NBI to date and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through 'service provider' contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools.</p><p>  In Monaghan, Drumcorrin and Drumgossatt National School will be connected for educational access as part of this initiative, while the public will be able to benefit from this service at locations across the county such as Corduff, Corcaghan, Mullyash, Saint Alphonsus Community Centre, Monaghan GAA centre of Excellence as well as Geraldines GAA Club, Carn and Latton Resource Centre. Further details can be found at .</p><p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network. The extent of this impact is currently being assessed and NBI has committed to put in place measures to mitigate the impact in as far as possible.</p><p>  The Covid 19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of good reliable broadband to ensure that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. This is reflected in the commitments in the Programme for Government where delivery of the National Broadband Plan will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged particularly around increased levels of remote working.</p><p>  The Programme for Government has committed to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. In this regard, my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.</p></reply>

CEF provides co-funding to projects that submit applications through competitve calls for proposals, and supports projects on the EU's Trans-European Network for Transport (TEN-T). The focus is on cross-border projects, removing capacity and service bottlenecks along the main sections of the TEN-T network, and projects with a high EU added-value. The rate of co-funding varies depending on the type of project but is usually a maximum of 20-30% of overall costs for works projects, with a maximum of 50% for projects classified as studies.</p><p>The current CEF funding programme runs from 2014 - 2020. My Department together with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have successfully bid for two rail projects in that time. The first of these, the City-Centre Resignalling Project, which will remove an existing capacity bottleneck in the rail network, is in receipt of &euro;10.9 million in CEF co-funding and is due to be completed in 2021. </p><p>On 16 July the results of the most recent call for proposals were announced and it was confirmed that another rail project is to be awarded &euro;8.8 million from CEF. This project, which is part of the Government's DART+ programme, will focus on the DART South-West line and consists of studies and prepatory work to be carried out, including obtaining of necessary permits, before moving to the construction phase. My Department and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are currently working with the European Commission's Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) to finalise this grant agreement.</p><p>Futher details on these, and other successful Irish projects under the CEF programme, can be accessed on the European Commission's website at .</p><p>The next programming period for CEF will run from 2021 - 2027 and there is an expected budget of &euro;11.3 billion open to all Member States for transport projects. My Department is examining the potential for some of the Government's major public transport projects, including DART+ and MetroLink, to apply for funding in the coming period.  In this regard, my Department has been engaging with the European Commission advisory service JASPERS, an agency jointly established by the Commission and the European Investment Bank to assist Member States with infrastructure development and implementation.</p><p>These major projects are on our core TEN-T network. During negotiations on the new CEF Regulation, Ireland submitted written comments to the European Commission in conjunction with two other island Member States, Cyprus and Malta, with the aim of ensuring that projects on the comprehensive TEN-T network in Member States which have no land border with another Member State could be included as eligible actions. This position was accepted by the Commission, and as a result the latest text of the proposal retains this amendment. Subject to the proposed Regulation being adopted, this means that during the period 2021 &ndash; 2027, projects on Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive TEN-T network, including the rail network, will be eligible to apply for CEF co-funding through relevant calls for proposals.</p><p>In addition, there are a number further potential options for utilising EU funding opportunities. My Department will be reviewing the potential for sustainable public transport projects, including rail, as part of the wider Government plans for availing of funding under the EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility in line with the European Green Deal and the concept of competitive sustainability.  More immediately, the new PEACE PLUS Programme 2021-2027, which will build upon previous PEACE and INTERREG Programmes, will provide opportunities under the EU policy objective of &ldquo;a more connected Europe&rdquo;, contributing to the cross-border economic and territorial development of the region. In this regard, there has been significant bilateral engagement between my Department and the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland, in consultation with the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) and the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform, to examine potential transport projects, including rail projects, that fit the PEACE PLUS criteria.</p><p>Finally, the Programme for Government, commits to a review of how we can utilise and leverage European Investment Bank funding and other opportunities for external funding to the maximum extent possible to support our recovery and transition to a low carbon future. My Department will feed into this review and will continue to examine all funding opportunities and mechanisms with potential for the development of the rail network.</p></reply>

It is a long-standing Government policy to recommend and promote the wearing of helmets. The Rules of the Road booklet encourages the use of cycle helmets and draws attention to their safety benefits, and the Road Safety Authority, the agency responsible for public education and awareness, strongly encourages their use.</p>  <p>  However, opinion is divided internationally on whether the wearing of safety helmets is best achieved through the introduction of statutory requirements or through other strategies.  Making the wearing of helmets compulsory would raise a number of difficulties.  For example, if wearing helmets were made compulsory it would be necessary to have some kind of enforcement system with penalties, presumably fines, for cycling without a helmet.  Whilst enforcement might be possible, it could create considerable strain on Garda resources, and indeed on the courts.</p>  <p>  The matter was considered in the context of the preparation of the Road Safety Strategy 2013 &ndash; 2020.  Although the Strategy strongly favours encouraging the use of helmets, it stopped short of recommending making their wearing compulsory.  International studies also show that making the wearing of helmets mandatory results in a decrease in the number of people cycling.</p>  <p>  It is my view that the wearing of cycle helmets is better achieved by way of educational and publicity campaigns rather than by pursuing a punitive approach to the issue, particularly having regard to the large numbers of children and young people who cycle.  Consequently I have no plans to make the wearing of bicycle safety helmets a legal requirement at this time.</p></reply>

The Driver Test service has seen its weekly capacity reduced significantly in order to comply with occupational and public health requirements. As an example, due to the additional hygiene and sanitation procedures that are now absolutely necessary, each testing slot now takes a much longer time to complete. In addition to this, the number of testers working in any centre at the one time has to be reduced to ensure physical distancing rules can be maintained.</p>  <p>  Those who had appointments cancelled due to Covid 19 are being prioritised in the first instance. Initially, only those who are frontline healthcare workers will be deemed eligible for an urgent test slot. This approach for prioritising customers will be kept under review as the RSA moves through the service resumption. </p>  <p>   My Department is remaining in close contact with the RSA who are examining ways of increasing the number of tests within the current health constraints. One option is the employment of additional testers, something which has been done in the past to address backlogs.  However, I would  like to stress, many of the issues impacting on the delivery of service are concerned with the throughput of centres themselves in light of the restrictions, rather than on the availability of staff.</p>  <p>   In the meantime, my Department has give approval to the RSA to retain 18 driver testers on  temporary contracts due to expire in October and November, and to rehire up to 19 testers whose contracts expired in May.</p>  <p>  While I regret the inconvenience caused by the necessity to adhere to the restrictions imposed on us by NPHET and other experts, the safety of the public, whether through contracting Covid or through deaths or injuries on our roads, must be of paramount importance.</p></reply>

The Deputy knows I am determined that this Government delivers a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland as committed to in the Programme for Government. We need to ensure a holistic, multi-modal approach toward transport planning and provision. In particular we need to see finalised transport strategies integrated into relevant land-use plans and used as a catalyst for the adoption by local authorities of a much more sustainable approach toward the location of housing, employment and other centres of transport demand.</p><p>As required by the current Climate Action Plan, LSMATS seeks to develop and implement &ndash;</p><p>- A metropolitan area strategic transport strategy in line with Action 98 of the Climate Action Plan;</p><p>- A comprehensive network of improved active travel infrastructure in line with Action 95;</p><p>- A transition to low emissions vehicles in the urban bus fleet and roll-out of a BusConnects Limerick  in line with Actions 85 and 88; and</p><p>- A network of strategic park and ride facilities in line with Action 89.</p><p>I know there are those that argue that rail could potentially play a bigger role than that envisaged in the draft Strategy and the consultation process allows them make their voices heard in that regard. </p><p>I do not believe that many people would argue against the need to vastly improve the active travel network in Limerick or to roll-out a BusConnects Limerick for the city, and I certainly support the priority implementation of both measures.  </p><p>Priority implementation of both can facilitate modal shift and will have a positive impact on transport emissions, as well as helping us towards our committed target of an additional 500,000 public transport and active travel journeys daily by 2035, based on 2018 levels. </p><p>I should point out that the predicted modal shares referred to in the draft Strategy are not an ambition or a target, but instead are the result of a strategic modelling exercise carried out by the NTA. I expect the share of sustainable modes will increase as infrastructure is delivered, services improved and local authorities develop relevant demand management measures.</p><p>I want to see a more sustainable Limerick and I am ready to work with the local authority in ensuring that happens through funding available through my Department&rsquo;s sustainable mobility investment programme. </p><p>I would certainly encourage people to make their views known on this draft Strategy and also their views on the importance of prioritising delivery of active travel and public transport elements of any finalised Strategy as may be adopted by the local authority.</p></reply>

Where an individual or jointly assessed tax-payer has insufficient income tax liability to fully benefit from the measure, they may still avail of the relief against their USC contributions.</p>  <p>  In addition to having a tax clearance certificate, participating businesses must also be registered for VAT. While I acknowledge that there are many smaller businesses in the hospitality sector which are not required to register for VAT, it remains open to those businesses to do so in order to participate in the Stay and Spend cheme. However, they should carefully consider the additional compliance requirements associated with VAT registration before doing so.</p>  <p>  More generally, as I indicated recently, when we designed this scheme, and launched it, we were launching it in the anticipation then, that our Economy would be on the way to being fully open, and there would be full mobility across our country.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. </p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities. </p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.</p><p>The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms;</p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th</sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC.

I expect sympathetic and encouraging customer engagement from lenders at this time. This applies to mortgage holders across the country, including those in Dublin to whom the Deputy refers.</p><p>I would encourage any borrower who feels they may have difficulty in resuming payments after a Covid-19 payment break to contact their lender and if possible to do so before the payment break end date.  Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections and lenders have specific obligations, under the Central Bank consumer protection framework, to support and work with borrowers in arrears or in pre-arrears. In particular, lenders are obliged to engage and work with co-operating borrowers to identify an appropriate alternative repayment arrangement having regard to the particular circumstances of a case, and lenders should use the full suite of solutions available to them for their borrowers who continue to be impacted by Covid-19. In this regard, it is important to note that, while the European Banking Authority recently stated it would not extend its 30 September closing date for applications to qualify for a Covid-19 payment break, banks can continue to support their customers with further breaks in payment after 30 September on a case by case basis if needed with such loans classified according to the normal prudential framework.</p></reply>

This exemption limit is increased to &euro;1,500 where the expenditure relates to the provision of an electric bicycle. Any amount in excess of these limits is liable to tax. </p>  <p>  A number of conditions apply in order to avail of the scheme, for example the bicycle must be new and must be for the employee or director&rsquo;s personal use in undertaking the whole or part of the journey to or from work. An individual may avail of the cycle to work scheme once every four years.</p>  <p>  Alternatively, an employer and employee may enter into a salary sacrifice arrangement under which the employee agrees to sacrifice part of his or her salary in lieu of a benefit i.e. a bicycle or bicycle safety equipment in this instance. A salary sacrifice is subject to the same limits referred to above. </p>  <p>  Further information on the cycle to work scheme can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website, available here. </p>  <p>  I can confirm that participation in the wage subsidy scheme has no impact on participation in the cycle to work scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-30a.149.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000073#WRD02500"><p>The specific nature and terms of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) are separate and distinct from the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) discussed below.  Where an eligible employer makes a payment of wages, within prescribed limits, to a qualifying employee during the scheme, the employer can claim a EWSS subsidy in respect of that employee.</p>  <p>  The EWSS will re-establish the normal requirement to operate PAYE and PRSI on all employee salaries, providing for the regular deduction and remittance of income tax, USC and employee PRSI.  This means that some employees may see a reduction in their take home pay.  However, their future tax bill (that would have been accruing under the TWSS) will be reduced in turn and no additional tax liability on the salary payments should accrue to employees. </p>  <p>  As regards the TWSS, tax was not collected in real-time through the PAYE system while the scheme was in operation.  Instead, liability to tax will be calculated by Revenue through the regular end of year review process.  It is important to note that there was no additional tax liability accruing to individuals paid via the TWSS than would have been the case had the employees received the same income directly from their employer (unsubsidised by the State).</p>  <p>  This decision was taken in order to maximise the amount of financial support that was provided to recipients at a time when it was considered that they needed such support most, when the TWSS was first announced and expected to only be in place for 12 weeks.  </p>  <p>  When the TWSS was extended for a further 10 weeks until the end of August 2020, Revenue took steps to minimise the amount of income tax and USC due, if any, on TWSS payments at the end of the year.  This was done by placing all recipients of the TWSS or PUP on the &lsquo;week 1 basis&rsquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that arise at year end. </p>  <p>  In the majority of cases the outstanding tax liability is expected to be modest.  In the case of lower income households or those whose income comprises solely of social welfare payments, a liability to tax typically does not arise because the value of social welfare payments received in a tax year are usually lower than the income sheltered by the main income tax credits.  Further, in cases where the tax liability for those payments exceeds unused personal and PAYE tax credits for 2020, the level of income tax and USC due may be reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset.   </p>  <p>  Revenue will be adopting a fair and flexible approach to collecting tax due on payments made under the TWSS or the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP).  This will be achieved by reducing their tax credits for subsequent tax years, thereby further minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible.</p>  <p>  Revenue has also assured me that if any income tax and USC liabilities still arise following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities and a number of flexible arrangements may be entered into, including the collection without interest over an extended period of time for 4 years beginning in 2022.</p></reply>

The key recommendation in the report is that NCAs for securities markets should be empowered to share information with tax authorities to assist in the detection of withholding tax reclaim schemes. Ireland&rsquo;s NCA is the Central Bank of Ireland, who consulted with Revenue in connection with its contribution to the ESMA report.</p><p>The report published by ESMA is available at the following link:</p><p>As can be seen from the ESMA report, NCAs of many countries, including Ireland, do not consider their country to be a potential target of such schemes.  This is due to a number of factors such as the design of the underlying tax system or the way in which tax refunds are administered. In the context of Ireland, the relevant provisions of Irish tax legislation are not designed in a way that would enable or facilitate the use of these schemes domestically. In addition, Revenue&rsquo;s internal controls surrounding the processing of repayments of tax withheld from dividend payments would minimise the opportunity for such abuses.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-30a.170.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1494" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000073#WRD04600"><p>Through the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, detailed engineering analysis, assessment and extensive public consultation was undertaken for 300 communities throughout Ireland, including 90 coastal areas, which in 2012 were identified as being most likely to be impacted by future coastal and fluvial flooding.  The CFRAM Programme studied 80% of properties at risk from the primary causes of flooding in Ireland, in communities that house almost two thirds of the national population. </p>  <p>  The key outputs of the CFRAM Programme were Flood Maps showing the flood risk for the 300 communities, which support planning decisions and emergency response, and Flood Risk Management Plans (FRMP&rsquo;s) - one for each River Basin in the country. The FRMP&rsquo;s contain proposed flood relief measures - informed by costs, benefits and environmental factors - to address the flood risk in each community and nationwide. As portions of County Louth are located in two River Basins, Louth is included in both the Neagh-Bann and Boyne FRMP&rsquo;s.</p>  <p>  The evidence provided by the CFRAM Programme, which was launched by the Office of Public Works in May 2018, supports the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1bn planned investment to complete 151 flood relief schemes through the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project 2040.   </p>  <p>  As part of this, Louth County Council, working with the Office of Public Works, has agreed to be the Lead Authority in the delivery of flood relief schemes at Dundalk / Blackrock South, Drogheda, Carlingford / Greenore, Baltray and Ardee, all of which are in the first tranche of projects to be progressed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Dundalk / Blackrock South, Co. Louth, for which the current estimated total project cost is &euro;80.9 million (this also includes the budget for the Ardee Flood Relief Scheme) would involve a series of hard defences, including flood embankments and walls, rock armour coastal protection, demountable barriers, road raising, a sluice gate and tanking of two properties, protecting 1,880 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Drogheda, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a preliminary total cost of &euro;16.83 million, would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) along the River Boyne and improvement of conveyance, hard defences and a flow diversion channel on various tributaries, protecting 381 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Carlingford and Greenore, Co. Louth, for which the CFRAM Programme estimated a preliminary total cost of &euro;23.41 million would involve construction of a series of hard defences (flood embankments and walls) and two pumping stations, protecting 409 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - The proposed flood relief scheme at Ardee, Co. Louth will also be progressed directly by Louth County Council in tandem with the Dundalk/Blackrock South Scheme with full funding from the Office of Public Works, the cost of which is included in the budget for that Scheme. The work proposed will involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 7 properties when completed.</p>  <p>  - There is one proposed scheme initially not included in the first tranche of implementation. The scheme at Baltray, Co. Louth at a projected cost estimate of approximately &euro;1.93 million would involve the construction of a series of hard defences (embankments and walls) protecting 73 properties when completed. However, the countywide project steering group comprising Office of Public Works and local authority representatives, has decided to progress the development of this project simultaneously with that for Drogheda.</p>  <p>  While the CFRAM process investigated possible structural flood relief measures for both Annagassan and Termonfeckin, economically viable schemes for these communities were not identified, and so a review of the risk in these communities and the likely costs and benefits is to be undertaken to determine if viable schemes may be available.  The Office of Public Works has put in place a process for undertaking such reviews as recommended in the FRMPs nationally, which is currently being piloted in a number of areas, and it is envisaged that these reviews, including those for Annagassan and Termonfeckin, will be complete within the next 12 months. </p>  <p>  When developing detailed Flood Risk Management options for the selected projects, the adaptability of the option to climate change will also be assessed; for example, in a Project where a significant increase in risk is shown under the future scenarios, options with the best climate change adaptability are more important, whereas climate change adaptability in Projects with low-sensitivity is not as critical.  The appointed Design Teams will produce the detailed design of the options in areas of high sensitivity and will assess whether it is appropriate for the option to be designed to handle climate change from the start of the design process, or whether it is designed to be adaptable later, e.g. building extra capacity into the foundations of a wall to allow it to be increased in the future, or to leave undeveloped areas for flood storage to be added in the future. </p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has also established Engineering Consultancy Framework Agreements, which Louth County Council are using to procure services to progress the design, development and planning of each project and which will help to speed up the process to construction. In addition, the Council has been provided with additional staffing resources by OPW to assist in the implementation of these schemes. </p>  <p>  The Steering Group for flood relief schemes in County Louth has proposed the following prioritisation for progression of first tranche projects for County Louth:</p>  <p>  1. Dundalk/Blackrock South and Ardee - to be progressed simultaneously. The tender for Engineering Consultancy Services for Dundalk/Blackrock South and Ardee was advertised on 16 October 2019, with five tenders received on 24 January 2020. Tenders have been evaluated and the contract has been awarded.</p>  <p>  2. Drogheda and Baltray - to be progressed simultaneously. The consultants brief for Drogheda and Baltray scheme is currently being finalised and is hoped to be advertised to the framework in the coming months.</p>  <p>  3. Carlingford/Greenore. Progress on the Carlingford/Greenore consultants brief will begin following completion of the Drogheda/Baltray brief.</p>  <p>  The Steering Group last met on 24 September 2020 where the project is now being progressed with the consultants now appointed on the Scheme.  Louth County Council is expected to tender for environmental and design consultants for the Drogheda and Baltray Flood Relief Schemes in the coming months. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the measures set out in the flood risk management plans are not definitive and final, and that as part of the project-level assessment required to prepare the measure for planning/ Public Exhibition, more detailed assessments are required at a local level and further public and stakeholder consultation will be undertaken. As such, there is further scope for the community's views to influence the measures that are progressed to implementation. </p>  <p>  Once consultants are appointed to progress each scheme, consultation with statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as the general public, will take place at the appropriate stages to ensure that all parties have the opportunity to input into the development of the proposals within the scheme.</p></reply>

Subject to agreement with the European Parliament, the European Commission has communicated revised allocations for each Member State from the European Structural and Investment Funds based on the revised funding under the Cohesion heading in the MFF.</p>  <p>  In 2018 prices, Ireland&rsquo;s allocation is expected to be &euro;451 million for the European Social Fund, &euro;351 million for the European Regional Development Fund and &euro;258 million for European Territorial Cooperation (which includes the allocation for the PEACE Plus Programme), for a total of &euro;1.06 billion. </p>  <p>  The Commission has not yet provided the composition of this funding by Ireland&rsquo;s three regions. The final breakdown will be based on an allocation formula agreed for each category of region as part of the MFF and set out in proposed Common Provisions Regulation (COM (2018) 375) based on population, GDP/GNI and a number of other socio-economic, migration and environmental indicators. The exact allocation method depends upon the category of region being supported. Ireland has two &ldquo;more developed&rdquo; regions and one &ldquo;transition&rdquo; region &ndash; the Northern and Western Region.</p>  <p>  This EU funding must be co-financed by domestic sources at a rate dependent upon the category of region. This rate is the percentage of the total programme that the EU funding makes up (i.e. the remainder must be funding from domestic sources). For &ldquo;more developed&rdquo; regions, the rate is 40% and for &ldquo;transition&rdquo; regions it is 60%. Thus, the final size of Ireland&rsquo;s 2021-2027 Funds will be determined when the breakdown of the allocation between Ireland&rsquo;s regions is confirmed.</p></reply>

This approach is designed to ensure regional perspectives and complementarities between ERDF and other funds are considered in developing the future ERDF programme, which is reflective of the Integrated Territorial Investment model.</p><p>The report on the public consultation phase, along with the Needs Analysis, adopted by the PPSG in July, will inform the ERDF programming for 2021-2017.</p></reply>

A ceremonial event at the Custom House Dublin in late May 2021 to appropriately mark the centenary of the burning of the Custom House.</p><p>2. A commemoration for all those who lost their lives during the War of Independence, to take place on a suitable date close to the centenary of the coming into effect of the Truce on 11<sup>th</sup>July 1921 in accordance with the guidance of the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations.</p><p>For completeness of my reply, the Deputy may also wish to note that the annual Easter 1916 Ceremony is scheduled to take place on Sunday 4<sup>th</sup>April, 2021 and the annual National Day of Commemoration Ceremony, to honour all those Irishmen and Irishwomen who died in past wars or on service with the United Nations will take place on Sunday 11<sup>th</sup>July, 2021.</p><p>All of the planned events above will comply with the public health advice pertaining as each date falls.</p><p>In addition, my Department continues to support a diverse commemorative programme of initiatives, events(where possible) and activity delivered by partners and stakeholders throughout the country, information on the programme and associated resources can be found on www.decadeofcentenaries.com.  I intend that this support for the programme will remain in place out to 2023.</p><p>The Government's approach to the Decade of Centenaries commemorations will continue to be informed by advice from the Expert Advisory Group on Centenary Commemorations and consultation with the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations - I will reconvene the latter group shortly.</p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the State's approach to the remembrance of this very complex period in our history and all of those who suffered or lost their lives during those years, will be based on the ethos of authenticity that has become the hallmark of the Decade of Centenaries programme.</p></reply>

The Government is acutely aware of these challenges.</p>  <p>  The Government recently published Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19, which sets out the medium-term approach being taken to managing virus-related risks while facilitating continued economic and social activity insofar as possible.  As the Deputy notes, the Framework for Restrictive Measures under the Plan makes provision for greater numbers of people to attend organised events at levels 1 and 2 of the Framework in appropriately-controlled environments in very large purpose-built event facilities, in line with public health advice and subject to specific sectoral guidance to be developed.</p>  <p>  My Department has already ensured that detailed guidance is available for a range of sectors in relation to COVID-19 restrictions. Officials are in ongoing discussions with relevant stakeholders and the Department of the Taoiseach to examine how best to make appropriate provisions in relation to the Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 whilst safeguarding public health and limiting the spread of COVID-19.</p></reply>

As a result, a number of flexibilities have been included in the EWSS, while the rates and eligibility criteria have been modified so that the support is sustainable from an Exchequer cost perspective.</p>  <p>  The objective of the EWSS is to maintain the link between employees and employers insofar as is possible and a number of elements are contained in the scheme that have particular benefit to the tourism sector raised. For example, it includes employees that were not previously eligible for the TWSS, such as seasonal workers and new hires, and applications for such workers under the EWSS may be backdated to 1 July 2020.</p>  <p>  The operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months. The relevant legislation obliges the Minister for Finance to monitor the scheme and empowers him to make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where he determines that these are necessary.</p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism sector. In this regard the Tourism Recovery Taskforce is expected to publish its Final Recovery Plan shortly and I will consider its recommendations at that stage.  In the context of the Budget and the development of the National Economic Plan, the Government will review and, if necessary, refine existing supports and consider any further necessary measures.</p></reply>

Over 12,000 projects have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to close to &euro;1 billion.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city in the country.</p>  <p>  In relation to the most recent rounds of the SCP, the full scoring system was published in advance of the assessment work commencing.  One of the key criteria in scoring applications has always been whether the proposed project will increase participation and in this regard the scoring system for the most recent round of the SCP specifically references the likelihood of increasing female participation. Other key criteria in scoring projects under the latest rounds of the programme include whether proposed projects were from disadvantaged areas or groups, whether the applicant had received significant funding in the past and whether the proposed facility or equipment would be shared with other groups in the community.</p>  <p>  With regard to future rounds of the programme, a full Review of the 2018 round of the SCP has now been complete and the terms and conditions of the next round of the programme will be based on the recommendations in the Review. Work on these terms and conditions is now being finalised and a new round of the programme will be open for applications before the end of the year with an announcement in this regard expected in the coming weeks.  I expect that projects likely to increase female participation will continue to be prioritised when these terms and conditions and the scoring system are finalised.</p></reply>

The core exchequer allocation from my Department to An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s in 2020 is <b>&euro;23.652m</b>, which represents an increase of &euro;1m from the previous year.</p><p>It is important to note that the Government has allocated substantial funding to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta from various other sources, such as an additional capital allocation of <b>10.484m</b>under the Rural Regeneration &amp;amp; Development Fund and the Regional Enterprise Development Fund.</p><p>In addition, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta also receives current funding of circa <b>&euro;3m </b>per annum from my Department in respect of cultural and language planning activities.</p><p>In light of the impact of Covid-19 on our society and economy, the Government has provided additional funding and supports to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and its client companies, through both targeted national and sectoral measures.</p><p>The July Jobs Stimulus package includes a significant additional capital allocation of <b>&euro;8m</b>for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in order to enable it to undertake essential upgrades to existing building stock and water treatment facilities, thereby facilitating the marketing of currently dormant factory spaces for modern job-creation projects. </p><p>This will create 40-50 new construction jobs across Gaeltacht communities in the short-term while the re-developed building stock will support the longer-term creation of 320 new jobs in &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client-companies. </p><p>Earlier this year, my Department secured access for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta client companies to an initial <b>&euro;5m </b>available from the Sustaining Enterprise Fund, which is administered through the State&rsquo;s development agencies following successful negotiations by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation with the European Commission under the temporary state aid framework.</p><p>Prior to this, extra funding of <b>&euro;0.6m </b>was secured for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to administer the Trading Online Voucher Scheme in the Gaeltacht.</p><p>In addition to the funding allocated directly to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta to support new and existing enterprises in the Gaeltacht, it is important to note that the organisation also facilitates access to the schemes administered by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices in Gaeltacht areas.</p><p>Where a specific programme or scheme administered by Enterprise Ireland or the Local Enterprise Offices is not available from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta&rsquo;s existing broad suite of incentives and programme offerings, arrangements are in place to ensure such programmes, supports and services are available to all indigenous Gaeltacht-based clients of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding between the organisations.</p><p>The Programme for Government clearly illustrates that the Government is committed to support and resourcing &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and a solid foundation has already been laid, as evidenced by the initiatives detailed above.</p></reply>

The review is addressing a number of key aspects including sound or noise, visual amenity setback distances, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. </p><p>As part of the overall review process, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is being undertaken on the revised Guidelines before they come into effect, in accordance with the requirements of European Union Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA Directive. SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.</p><p>As part of the SEA process, the previous Minister launched a ten-week public consultation on the draft revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines on 12 December 2019. The documents prepared for consultation are available on my Department's website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>The consultation closed on 19 February 2020. Almost 500 submissions were received as part of the public consultation, many of which are extremely detailed and technical in nature.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (DECC) is currently analysing the submissions received. </p><p>Finalised Guidelines will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase, and the conclusion of the SEA process. The Department, in consultation with DECC, is endeavouring to finalise and publish the revised Guidelines by end Q4 2020, as per the Climate Action Plan and the new Programme for Government.</p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.  Planning authorities and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.  In the meantime, the current 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines remain in force.</p></reply>

It is the first comprehensive upgrade of Ireland&rsquo;s water infrastructure in over 60 years.</p><p>Public consultation in respect of this project is a matter for Irish Water. In 2015, Irish Water embarked on an extensive public consultation process to identify a new source of water supply for the region. Overall, ten options were assessed on technical environmental and economic grounds. The abstraction of raw water from the Parteen Basin and the Lower River Shannon was ultimately identified as the preferred option.</p><p>In addition, Irish Water is currently preparing a National Water Resource Plan (NWRP) which will be a 25 year strategy to ensure a sustainable, secure and reliable public drinking water supply. The NWRP will set out how Irish Water are to balance the supply and demand for drinking water over the short, medium and long term. It will be a strategic framework used to identify deficiencies across the whole water supply system, and to develop plans and programmes to address them through capital investment, demand management and improved operation of facilities and distribution networks  including, as I understand, with respect to the  Eastern and Midlands Water Supply Project. I also understand Irish Water are preparing to undertake a public consultation shortly on the draft plan. This will provide everyone with an opportunity to engage further on the project in the light of the most up to date information. </p><p>Separately, the Water Services Act 2013 requires the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in conjunction with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to provide consent for all commitments for capital expenditure above a certain threshold.  Given the scale and importance of the Eastern and Midlands Water Supply Project, and recognising the statutory role of the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities (CRU) as independent economic regulator of Irish Water, including its role of reviewing Irish Water&rsquo;s capital investment plans, the CRU was requested to undertake the review to support consideration of the capital consent that will be required in the event that planning approval is obtained for the project. This review has commenced but has not progressed as quickly as originally envisaged in order that the CRU can take into account the output of the National Water Resources Plan. I expect to receive the CRU report in 2021. It will also be an important input in the context of the updated Public Spending Code for evaluating, planning and managing the public investment in the project as it proceeds through its lifecycle.</p><p>The Terms of Reference for the review are available on the CRU website at the following link:</p><p>.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-30a.286.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000075#WRF04500"><p>When the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December, the UK will no longer apply the rules of the Single Market and Customs Union. This means that any business, regardless of size, that moves goods from, to or through Great Britain will be subject to a range of new customs formalities and other regulatory requirements.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Brexit Readiness Action Plan, published on 9 September, sets out the steps that Government is taking and the actions citizens and businesses must take to prepare for this eventuality. </p>  <p>  Section 2.2 of the Action Plan provides specific advice for  operators in respect of the Landbridge. This includes the need for traders and hauliers to understand the new procedures applying to goods moving across Great Britain under the Common Transit Convention (CTC). In addition to new paperwork requirements, operators will also have to have a financial guarantee in place to cover potential customs duties and other taxes at risk during the movement.  Operators using the UK landbridge should also familiarise themselves with the provisions of the UK's Border Operating Model.</p>  <p>  The Government has undertaken substantial engagements at political and official level to facilitate transit movements in EU ports. We have also invested in the infrastructure and systems required for additional checks and controls on trade with the UK, in both directions, at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort, as well as at Dublin Airport. Provision has also been made to facilitate the deployment of around 1,000 staff to ensure compliance with customs, sanitary and phytosanitary, and food safety regulations.  Our approach to this work is driven by the twin objectives of ensuring trade can flow through our ports and airports to the greatest extent possible while maintaining food safety and public health and Ireland&rsquo;s obligations to the Single Market.</p>  <p>  While the Government continues to work with our EU partners to facilitate the movement of goods through EU ports, there is little the Government can do to address the severe delays anticipated at UK ports, with Dover-Calais identified as a particular likely bottleneck.  It is important that operators using the landbridge take these delays into account.</p>  <p>  By contrast, no new procedures will apply to goods that move directly between Ireland and other EU Member States.  In the Government&rsquo;s engagement with shipping companies, they have indicated that sufficient capacity exists on direct shipping routes and that the market can respond to increased demand for direct services as a consequence of Brexit. Traders currently moving goods via the UK landbridge should consider switching to direct route options, where feasible.</p>  <p>  So far this year, we have already seen a number of new direct services commenced from Irish ports to continental ports including Cork - Zeebrugge, Dublin - Santander, Waterford - Rotterdam, Rosslare - Bilbao and Rosslare - Roscoff.  Extra sailings are also planned in 2021, including on the Rosslare - Cherbourg and Cork - Roscoff routes.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to engage with the shipping companies  and will keep the situation under review.  I would encourage all traders, operators and hauliers to read our Readiness Action Plan which sets out concrete actions  that should take to prepare for the substantial and enduring changes that will arise on 1 January, 2021 regardless of the outcome of the EU-UK Future Relationship negotiations.</p></reply>

Primary schools are currently provided with class teachers on the basis of one teacher for every 26 pupils which is at its historically lowest level.  </p>  <p>  My Department has published guidance in respect of the COVID -19 operational supports for Primary and Post Primary schools to fully and safely reopen in a sustainable way while minimising risk associated with COVID-19. This is available at  www.gov.ie/backtoschool </p>  <p>   The operational supports include funding of approx. &euro;84.7 million so that schools can employ replacement teachers, SNAs and administrative staff. There is additional funding of &euro;41.2 million, for substitution in primary schools. This will provide more certainty on the availability of substitutes for primary schools and cover substitutions that are not covered by existing schemes. The Supply Panel Scheme has being expanded nationwide and over 300 posts have been allocated to provide substitute cover through these panels. The purpose of supply panels is to support schools to manage the sick leave and other absences by having a supply of teachers to meet substitution needs when required. Schools will continue to be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel.</p>  <p>  There is also funding of &euro;40m for enhanced supervision for post primary schools to minimise the interaction of students from different classes, in line with public health advice. An additional 1,080 teaching posts at post-primary level at a cost of &euro;53 million has being provided to support the important work of teaching and learning and provide additional teachers needed to support teacher substitution, management of physical distancing requirements by reallocating class timetables in schools to smaller groups class sizes where necessary.</p>  <p>  My Department recognises that notwithstanding the range of measures put in place, some schools have experienced challenges and my Department has continued to engaged with and support schools where they have demonstrated particular difficulties in accordance with circulars 45/2020 and 46/2020.</p></reply>

These guidelines on the elimination of single-use plastics in the interest of environmental sustainability have not been changed. However, these guidelines were issued prior to the onset of Covid-19, and prior to other guidelines from the Department of Health concerning responses to the virus. In the present circumstances, guidelines in the interest of public health in the face of Covid-19 should take precedence over other guidelines.

Disposable items, such as plastic lunch bags and disposable rubber gloves, can be used when and where it is advisable or preferable to do so in the interest of public health.

The starting salary for a new entrant teacher in 2012 was &euro;30,702. As a result of the programme of pay restoration, the starting salary of a teacher from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.</p>  <p>  Section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 provides that &ldquo;the Minister [for Public Expenditure and Reform] shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the cost of and a plan in dealing with pay equalisation for new entrants to the public service.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The report laid before the Oireachtas on foot of this provision by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform assesses the cost of a further change which would provide a two scale point adjustment to new entrants recruited since 2011. The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for approximately &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).</p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.</p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.</p>  <p>  This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.</p>  <p>  I am fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.</p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring.</p></reply>

The purpose of the investigation is to allow students to experience the practical application of the core geographical skills that are central to all units of the syllabus including physical, regional, human and economic geography. Students are required to identify aims, objectives and hypotheses for their investigation, select and use methods of collection and gathering appropriate to the chosen investigation topic, analyse and interpret results, draw valid conclusions and prepare a report.</p>  <p>   The topic for the investigation must be chosen from an annual list of prescribed topics issued from the State Examinations Commission. The list of prescribed topics is prepared to ensure that the range of topics relate to as many of the units of the syllabus as possible including physical, regional, human and economic geography. This broad scope also ensures that the geographical investigation is accessible to as broad a range of learners and learning environments.</p>  <p>   Furthermore, the list of topics provides scope and flexibility for a broad range of approaches to the investigation which may include the undertaking of a field study or an investigation which may involve desk based research. The 2021 investigation topics include a study of changing land-use, impact of migration, a local environmental issue, geology in a local area, impact of economic activity and impact of erosion on the landscape. The collection and gathering of information for each of these topics may involve gathering data through outside the school vis-&agrave;-vis an field study, survey, questionnaire etc. Alternatively, data may be collected using primary and secondary data available from journals, databases, government departments, published reports etc.</p>  <p>   Some students may have the collection and gathering of data completed at this stage and in such cases they should complete their analysis and write up their report. In cases where the collection and gathering of data has not being undertaken, the flexibility of approach provided by the range of prescribed topics should be considered when choosing a topic for the geographical investigation in order that the investigation can be completed in line with public health requirements and guidelines. Any activity undertaken as part of the investigation should be done in compliance with these requirements.</p>  <p>  The Department has also published a series of guidance documents as part of the reopening of our schools. These are available on www.gov.ie/backtoschool.</p>  <p>  This includes guidance regarding practical subjects in post-primary schools. While this guidance does not specifically name Geography, the guidance provided in provided in relation to Science is applicable. The guidelines outline areas that may be considered when schools are making decisions about implementing the curriculum, while acknowledging that teachers are best placed to consider how to safely manage equipment within current public health guidelines as they may account for their own local context.</p>  <p>  For example, the guidance advises that where the sharing of equipment between students cannot be avoided, each piece of shared equipment should be cleaned/wiped between each use and that group sizes should be kept as small as resources allow.</p></reply>

Many sectors and industries have been badly affected during the emergency period and my sincere thoughts are with all employers and employees in these situations at this time. </p>  <p>   In situations where an employer has to make an employee redundant, the employer is obliged to comply with the existing provisions outlined in the Redundancy Payments Act 1967. Under section 17 of that Act an employer who proposes to dismiss an employee by reason of redundancy must give that employee notice of the redundancy at least 2 weeks before the date of dismissal. Employees may also be entitled to longer periods of notice under Section 4 of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973, depending on their length of service.</p>  <p>  Furthermore Section 5 and Schedule 2 of the 1973 Act provide that if an employee is made redundant and they are not required to work out the notice or there is no work available, they are entitled to payment in lieu of notice.</p>  <p>  If the employer is unable to make the redundancy payment, an application may be made to the Department for payment under the Redundancy Payments Scheme. In such cases a debt is raised against the employer and an agreed repayment plan can be put in place.  The purpose of the Insolvency Payments Scheme is to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer. Payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Act of 1973 is one of the entitlements covered under this scheme. The scheme, which operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers&rsquo; Insolvency) Act 1984 also covers entitlements including wages, holiday pay, sick pay, certain pension contributions and various other statutory awards made by the Workplace Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Circuit Court.</p>  <p>  Further information on the Insolvency Payments Scheme can be found at gov.ie.</p></reply>

The scheme plays a useful role in supporting the development of new enterprises allowing participants to retain welfare support over the first two years of their business. The average cost of BTWEA for each participant on the scheme is &euro;211 per week. This equates to an average of almost &euro;11,000 per year for each participant.</p>  <p>  The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) provides income support for jobseekers and certain others in receipt of social welfare payments who pursue courses of education at second or third level.  The main focus of the allowance is to assist qualifying applicants to improve their educational qualifications and their prospects of gaining employment. The average cost of BTEA for each student on the scheme is &euro;231 per week. The BTEA remains in payment throughout the academic year, typically 9 months. The estimated cost is &euro;9,000 per student for each academic year.</p>  <p>  My Department provides assistance to jobseekers through a Training Support Grant (TSG) to fund quick access to short term training.  This grant provides the financial resources to respond to the identified training needs of a jobseeker. As part of the July Stimulus the funding available to a jobseeker increased from &euro;500 per year to &euro;1,000. The estimated cost of an additional 12,500 places funded through the TSG would be &euro;12.5 million where the grant is availed off in full. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Of these, some 6,340 (or 2.9%) are members of the arts, entertainment and recreation sector.In total we have spent over &euro;3.5bn on PUP payments.</p><p>  The Government has decided that from 17 September the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be paid at three rates linked to a person's pre-covid employment earnings.  Individuals whose prior earnings were &euro;300 or over per week will receive a payment of &euro;300 per week.  A rate of &euro;250 will apply to those who previously earned between &euro;200 and &euro;300 per week; and the rate of &euro;203 remains unchanged for those who had prior earnings of less than &euro;200 per week.  </p><p>  One of the reasons it is necessary to recalibrate the PUP is so that we can extend its availability while being mindful of the cost to the State.  I have also secured approval to keep the scheme open to new applicants until the end of the year.  This means that anyone who loses their employment over the coming months, including those who may have returned to work but may be affected by new restrictions, will be able to avail of the support.</p><p>  These new rates will apply to all recipients.  I do not think it would be fair to make exceptions for those who had previously worked in the arts or entertainment sector, while applying the changes to over 97% of recipients who have worked in other sectors.</p><p>Finally, my Department has put in place a mailbox dedicated to the sector for individual artists to raise queries directly with the Department at artistspup@welfare.ie.</p><p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that Childcare Ireland will assist in expanding high quality childcare, best practice and innovation in community and private childcare settings. Childcare Ireland will also be tasked with developing career paths for childcare staff and for expansion of the Early Years Curriculum, S&iacute;olta.</p>  <p>  In 'First Five, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families', published in November 2018, the Department committed to complete a comprehensive review of the operating model for Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Age Childcare (SAC) in this country.</p>  <p>  The review's objective is to ensure that the operating system is equipped to implement the Departmental policy to the scale and standards required in a sector which has seen substantial growth in the past two decades, with the citizens of Ireland at its heart as core beneficiaries. </p>  <p>  The final operating system will support high quality, accessible and affordable ELC and SAC services to children and families through the efficient and effective administration of a number of programmes, schemes, quality initiatives, and other functions such a compliance and communications. </p>  <p>  This operating model will support service providers, operate transparently and accountably, provide value for money to the Exchequer and demonstrate good governance. The model will also enable appropriate linkages and effective working relationships with all other agencies and Departments charged with delivering better outcomes for children and families. </p>  <p>  Preparatory work for the review has been undertaken and the first meeting of the Interdepartmental Group to oversee the review will take place in October. The review will conclude in July 2021. The review will be led by the Department, with appropriate assistance from external bodies, secured by tender. In addition, the Department will engage with all relevant stakeholders during the process. </p>  <p>  The review will aim to explore a variety of options in relation to how best the ELC and SAC operating system can be overseen by the DCYA in the coming years. It is envisaged that the analysis carried out through the review will provide a robust evidence base to inform a decision concerning the establishment of Childcare Ireland and the range of functions it may provide and ultimately the role it will play in the Childcare sector.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that low pay and poor working conditions in the sector remain a serious concern and impact on the quality of provision to children through their effect on the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. The lack of consistency of care caused by high staff turnover impacts directly on quality, while low wages are a constraint on plans to upskill and professionalise the workforce. I have met with employee and employer representatives on a number of occasions and have listened to their concerns.</p>  <p>  However, as the State is not the employer, my Department does not pay the wages of staff working in early learning and care settings, and cannot set wage levels or determine working conditions for these staff.</p>  <p>  In terms of policy approaches, work continues to progress the Workforce Development Plan, which will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualifications requirements, and associated policy mechanisms along with leadership development opportunities and working towards a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce.</p>  <p>  I launched an extensive consultation with the sector on the Workforce Development Plan on 19 August. The consultation process includes a call for submissions/survey which is available to anyone who wishes to provide feedback. On 22 September, I addressed an online information webinar on the consultation process, which was very well attended. This event provided an update to the sector on the consultation process and how those working in the sector can take part.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2020-09-30a.498.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020093000079#WRK02200"><p>The reopening of the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector and the resumption of services has been positive to date. </p><p>Undoubtedly, the stimulus package provided by my Department has been critical to sustain capacity in their sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme, which operated from April to June, enabled participating providers to retain almost 23,000 staff. A funding package to support the reopening of services from 29 June enabled the majority (approximately 95%) of services the ordinarily operate during the summer months to do so. There is strong evidence to suggest that further supports secured in August for the sector have ensured that capacity in the sector has been retained. </p><p>So far in this new programme year, 4,331 (95% of all services) have signed a funding agreement with my Department to operate at least one of the ELC and SAC funding schemes and child registrations for ECCE, NCS, CCS and TEC are higher than the same period last year. There have also been 4,044 applications for the capital grant and 3,832 applications for the reopening support payment with a combined payment to services of almost &euro;26 million.</p><p>While some of these settings may reduce capacity depending on their layout to implement public health guidance, there is no required capacity reduction owing to COVID-19. The Regulations in relation to the adult-child ratios and the floor-space requirements for ELC or SAC services have not been amended. This decision was based on advice provided by the HPSC.  Most services should be able to comply with the public health advice with no or little reduction in numbers of places.  </p><p>In respect of closures, where a registered early learning and care service decides to close, they are obliged,  in line with the requirements of the Child Care Act 1991 (as amended by Part 12 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013) to notify the Tusla Early Years Inspectorate of their planned closure. This data is collated and verified by Tusla on a rolling monthly basis. On this basis, 130 services that were on the Early Years Register reported permanent closure to Tusla between January and end of August 2020 (see Tables below for breakdown). This compares to 133 for the same period last year.</p><p>Separately, Tusla have also reported that 9 standalone school-age childcare services have closed this year, though there is no comparable data for 2019 as registrations for School Age Services only began during 2019.</p><p>Looking further at capacity, additional data from Tusla indicates that 53 new services have opened this year to date, compared to 56 by the same time last year.  It is also known that overall capacity has grown by approximately 60% over the last 5 years and the average service size has grown from 33 in 2014, to 47 in 2019.</p><p>Closure Tables: <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="2">Cessations by County: January &ndash; August 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>County </td>       <td>Number of Cessations </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork </td>       <td>17 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin </td>       <td>43 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway </td>       <td>5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare </td>       <td>13 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny </td>       <td>4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary </td>       <td>1 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath </td>       <td>5 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford </td>       <td>3 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow </td>       <td>7 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total </td>       <td>130 </td>    </tr> </table>  <table>    <tr>       <th colspan="2">Cessations by Service Type: January &ndash; August 2020</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Service Type </td>       <td>Number of Cessations </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Childminder </td>       <td>4 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Drop-In </td>       <td>2 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Full Day</td>       <td>25 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Part Time</td>       <td>14 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Sessional </td>       <td>85 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>Grand Total </td>       <td>130 </td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

There are currently over 30,200 children who are subject to a claim by childcare providers. This is the highest number of child registrations on NCS to date and in comparative terms more children are registered for my Department&rsquo;s schemes overall than were registered at the same time last year.</p><p>The online application process for the NCS has been designed to be accessible, intuitive and user-friendly. The flexibility of the NCS means that the Scheme is designed to recognise that childcare needs are different for each family. As such, depending on the particular application type and family circumstances of an applicant, the process flow and processing time can vary between applicants.</p><p>The NCS offers a flexible application process, with a variety of assessment options for parents. For income-based applications, the quickest way for a parent to have their income assessed is to use the 'Fast Track' option online. Fast Track assessment will gather information from Revenue and DEASP for the most recent year that full income information is available. In general this is either last year or the year before. This requires a verified MyGovID account and families can apply directly at .</p><p>A parent can choose not to Fast Track their assessment if their income has decreased significantly from the previous tax year or if they want to opt out of an automatic assessment. This will require the parent to upload documents to support the application. The NCS advises parents choosing this option the assessment will take longer to process than Fast Track assessments.</p><p>Parents who do not wish or are unable to submit an online application for the NCS may submit a paper application instead. Parents can apply offline by requesting a postal application form by contacting the NCS Parent Support Centre on 01-9068530.</p><p>An application will take longer to process where the Scheme Administrator is awaiting further documents to be submitted by the applicant. The system allows for a partially completed application to remain active for some time.</p><p>Following the application process, a parent will receive a &lsquo;CHICK&rsquo;. Parents must bring this CHICK to their childcare provider in order for their child to be registered for the NCS. NCS subsidies can only be paid once a CHICK has been registered by a childcare provider, and the parent has confirmed on the NCS system that all details are correct.</p><p>My Department is not aware of any significant technical issues with the registration of children on the NCS system by childcare providers which would impact the payment of NCS subsidies for parents. A small number of issues have arisen which have been quickly resolved. Such issues are normal within any new system and are being ironed out as they arise.</p><p>Pobal as Scheme Administrator, under the oversight of my Department, will continue to monitor the service delivery times and take appropriate measures to speed up processing times where necessary and bring efficiencies to bear on what is still a relatively new scheme.</p><p>If the Deputy is aware of specific issues being experienced by individual parents I would encourage him to refer them to the NCS Parent Support Centre on 01 906 8530. Childcare providers experiencing difficulties in registering children on the NCS can be referred to Pobal&rsquo;s Early Years Provider Centre by contacting eypc@pobal.ie or calling 01 511 7222.</p></reply>

Prospective applicants on higher incomes may not have applied for support as their income was above the relevant threshold. As such, it is not possible to accurately cost the number of additional students who may qualify for support, if the thresholds are increased. </p><p>Allowing for the limitations regarding the accuracy of the costings, it is estimated that a 10% increase would cost in the region of &euro;20m. </p><p>The above figures do not include any changes to the income thresholds for the special rate of maintenance grants which are linked to long-term social welfare payments nor do they include any changes to the post-graduate income thresholds.</p><p>The estimated cost of increasing the student maintenance grant rates by 10% would cost in the region of &euro;17m.  <b></b></p><p>Under the Department&rsquo;s free fees schemes, the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate Higher Education students with students paying the student contribution.</p><p>The student contribution fee is currently set at &euro;3,000 per annum and can be paid in instalments.  The State pays the contribution in full or part, through SUSI, for approximately 44% of students eligible for free fees funding.</p><p>Based on data in relation to 19/20 and expected demographic increase the estimated additional cost to the Exchequer for reducing the student contribution at the rate of  &euro;500 for the 2020/21 academic year is &euro;40.3m.</p><p>The above figures are the estimated net cost to the Exchequer factoring in the subsequent estimated reduction in the SUSI Student Grant budget. </p><p>The costs for the Exchequer of reducing the student contribution would increase in line with the demographic increases expected in the coming years up to 2030.</p><p>My Department is undertaking a comprehensive economic review currently which is progressing under the European Commission DG Reform&rsquo;s Structural Reform Support Programme.  This review is focussed on Increasing the Future Sustainability of Higher and Further Education Provision in Ireland. The review encompasses an assessment of the funding options for higher education included in the 2016 (Cassells) Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding of Higher Education which includes the student contribution charge. The study is scheduled to be substantially complete in Q4 2020.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.</p>  <p>  The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.</p>  <p>  The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019.  Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.</p>  <p>  This piece of legislation is a priority for the Minister and will be progressed as soon as possible, to support Farm Families and Businesses.</p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.   In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review. </p>  <p>  I note that restrictions have eased somewhat in certain hospitals in recent weeks and I hope this will continue.  However, the recent rise in the numbers of people infected with the virus, including healthcare workers, is very worrying and may impact on the pace of the easing of restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has developed a guidance document on restrictions in maternity hospitals/units and this issued to all maternity services last week. The paper seeks to ensure a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions, as far as is practicable and having due regard to local circumstances.   Each maternity service/network has been requested to review visiting arrangements on a weekly basis, in the context of the issues and factors identified in the paper.</p></reply>

It aims to enable patients to be seen in the community wherever possible by providing a better service in community health care settings; to receive timely care in hospital when this is necessary; and to return home or to appropriate care settings when fit to leave hospital by providing more homecare and stepdown options. It aims to deliver 4.76 million more home support hours to facilitate this.</p>  <p>  There are additional supports in the HSE Winter Plan for people at greater risk including the elderly, homeless, and those with chronic illnesses to allow them to stay at home.

The Plan puts in place supports for GPs, particularly those in rural practices, to support service continuity. A key action will be a comprehensive flu vaccination programme. The HSE has placed orders for approximately 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine, as well as 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine, which will be made available to children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The report was informed by the available national and international evidence and the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.  </p>  <p>  In July 2018, in advance of publication of the full report, the CMO requested the HSE to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so. This pause was instigated pending implementation of initial recommendations regarding (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.  </p>  <p>  The CMO report was published in November 2018. Four of the 19 recommendations relate to data gathering to support the development of information resources to permit long-term research and audit of practice, ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications, and ensuring timely, appropriate arrangements for the management of women with complications.</p>  <p>  The HSE published a detailed Implementation Plan for the recommendations in the report in April 2019.  The National Women and Infants Health Programme is leading on this work. </p>  <p>  The pathways for women experiencing mesh complications, established by the HSE, have been in place for over a year.  All appointments offered to women through these pathways have been to the public system.  I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for. </p>  <p>  The Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) is not available for patients wishing to have mesh related surgery for Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) or Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) as there is currently a pause on mesh surgeries for these specific ailments.  The TAS scheme is not available for mesh removal, full or partial, as the treatment is available publicly in Irish hospitals.  </p>  <p>  I wish to advise that Translabial Scanning has been made available on an interim basis under the TAS until the two scanners which have been purchased by the HSE are operational in the two Mesh Complications Centres.  As Translabial scanning is a diagnostic tool and not a "treatment" it does not normally qualify for this scheme. However, having listened to the requests from women for this specific type of scanning to be made available this interim measure was taken.  </p>  <p>  I would assure the Deputy that considerable work has been done to date in this country and continues to progress on patient safety in relation to mesh implants; and the patient voice is central to our understanding of these, and similar, issues.  As part of the ongoing policy response, my department officials are examining options to establish a process for an independent, compassionate engagement for women affected by mesh to have their voices heard; and will make proposals to me in this regard.  Any engagement process will need to take account of the wider context relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></reply>

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) in accordance with the advice of the World Health Organisation. </p>  <p>  The resumption of services from June onwards has allowed for increased activity, with the HSE utilising innovative methods including telemedicine to facilitate patient appointments. Patient safety remains at the forefront of service resumption. To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols which has resulted in reduced capacity and activity </p>  <p>  The HSE continues to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and alternative outpatient settings.</p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund has also recommenced arranging treatment in both private and public hospitals for clinically suitable patients who have been waiting for long periods on public hospital waiting lists.</p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy is a standardised approach used by the HSE to manage scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures.  It sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists and was developed in 2014 to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. </p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Like all other COVID-19 measures, as a country we are completely reliant on the good will and solidarity of everyone to continue individually and collectively, to comply with all public health measures, including testing. I would again stress how important it is for everyone to follow the public health advice and get tested if you have symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive.</p>  <p>  The serial testing in meat and food processing facilities commenced on 21 August, starting in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, and was since expanded to food production facilities on a national scale.  Up to 21st September, 18,420 tests have been carried out with 56 detected cases, this represents a positivity rate of 0.30%.  </p>  <p>  The HSE advised in relation to serial testing in food plants that in general, it is satisfied there is a high compliance rate when full account is taken of available staff due to shift patterns, exclusion of previous positives, staff on holiday or long-term leave and would like to acknowledge the support of the industry in for testing.</p>  <p>  The schedule for the rollout of Direct Provision Centre testing on a nationwide basis commenced 12th September, with expected 500 tests per day 7 days per week.  Up to 21st September, 2,518 tests were carried out with 7 detected cases, this represents a positivity rate of 0.28%.  </p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that management of serial testing of direct provision centres remains challenging as the complexities differ from the serial testing programmes which have been carried out to date. The concept of Direct Provision, as a service, is a highly sensitive and divisive concept, therefore any planning involving the testing of staff and residents of these direct provision sites must take into account the nature of this service and the associated nuances. With this in mind the working group set up to plan and oversee this programme have worked hard to ensure that all our communications for testing in congregated settings, whilst ensuring all the right information is contained, also strike the right tone. To date, the working group has overcome any challenges which have arisen.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.</p>  <p>  The proposed policy change to the NHSS, to cap contributions based on farm and business assets at 3 years where a family successor commits to working the productive asset, has been approved by Government. The Department developed draft Heads of Bill while considering a number of complex ancillary policy and operational matters which may need to be addressed in the proposed legislation.</p>  <p>  The stated policy objective of the general scheme of the Bill is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.</p>  <p>   The amendment of the scheme will bring certainty to the duration for which a contribution to the cost of care under NHSS will be levied against family farms and businesses. This in turn will support the viability of farms and businesses by increasing the likelihood of access to financing &amp;amp; promoting investment, which will encourage orderly succession planning with family members, encourage young farmers to remain farming and potentially encourage family members that had changed occupation or emigrated to return to the family farm.</p>  <p>   The General Scheme of Bill for the Amendment to the NHSS was approved by Government on 11 June 2019 and subsequently published. The changes to the Scheme will come into effect as soon as the legislative process is successfully complete. The General Scheme was sent to the relevant Joint Committee and the Department participated in pre-legislative scrutiny on 13 November 2019.  Engagement with the Office of the Attorney General began in early 2020 to progress the legislative development process.</p>  <p>  Further progress on the development of the Bill has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with focus entirely on responding to the challenges presented by COVID-19. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been and continues to be a national and public health priority.</p></reply>

This Framework sets out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19 in a range of areas over the next 6 - 9 months.</p><p>The Plan sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It aims to allow society and businesses to be able to operate as normally as possible, while continuing to suppress the virus. The Plan is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. Each level outlines what is permitted for social or family gatherings, work and public transport, bars, hotels and restaurants, exercise activities and religious services. </p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another.

For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful when socialising and working with others. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, Dublin is currently at level 3. At level 3, the priority is to keep schools and early learning and childcare services open and minimise disruption in the work force. This means that a number of services will be moved online and some businesses will be closed (e.g.  museums and other indoor cultural venues). Additional restrictions will apply to restaurants and pubs. People will also be required to reduce the number of people that they meet to a minimum and stay in their own region. These measures will remain in place until 9th October.  </p><p>Under Level 3, gyms may remain open with protective measures, for individual training only.  Further information on level 3 restrictions in relation to gyms and personal trainers be found at  https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/ad569-level-3/ and on the Active Ireland website at .</p></reply>

Maternity hospitals rely on very specialised personnel; should an outbreak of COVID-19 occur in a maternity hospital, the ability to provide safe, quality care would be severely impacted.  It should be remembered that maternity hospitals care for fragile infants at the extremes of prematurity.</p>  <p>  All maternity hospitals are challenged by the pandemic, but those challenges vary considerably.  Decisions on any restrictions are therefore made, implemented and reviewed at hospital level.</p>  <p>  Decisions to restrict visitors in our maternity hospitals have not been taken lightly.  Management and staff are acutely aware of the very important support provided by partners at the time of birth.  I have been assured that maternity hospitals wish to facilitate this support as far as possible.  In that context, I can assure the Deputy that any restrictions currently in place have been minimised as much as possible and will be subject to ongoing review. </p>  <p>  I note that restrictions have eased somewhat in certain hospitals in recent weeks and I hope this will continue.  However, the recent rise in the numbers of people infected with the virus, including healthcare workers, is very worrying and may impact on the pace of the easing of restrictions.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has developed a guidance document on restrictions in maternity hospitals/units and this issued to all maternity services last week. The paper seeks to ensure a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions, as far as is practicable and having due regard to local circumstances.  Each maternity service/network has been requested to review visiting arrangements on a weekly basis, in the context of the issues and factors identified in the paper.</p></reply>

The legislation prohibits routine clipping or grinding of the corner teeth of piglets and routine docking of pig&rsquo;s tails. However, these procedures are allowed where it has been shown that injury has occurred to either sow&rsquo;s teats or the tails of other pigs, provided other measures have been taken to prevent tail biting and in the case of teeth clipping/grinding the procedure is carried out within the first 7 days of the piglet's life.</p>  <p>  My Department does not have specific data on the number of piglets that have had their teeth clipped/grinded or their tails docked in the years mentioned. However in the coming weeks, the ante mortem aspect of the Department&rsquo;s computerised pig meat inspection system (&ldquo;Pig AMPM&rdquo;) will become operational. In addition to other ante-mortem inspection criteria, the system will record the percentage of pigs that are tail docked for every batch of pigs sent to slaughter.

Prior to this, the sales data of antimicrobials for use in pigs has been included in the annual report published by the Health Products Regulatory Authority. This sales data is at a national level, and it is not possible to directly extrapolate figures for the pig industry.</p><p>The Pig AMU database is designed to collect farm level data on a quarterly basis, feed back reports to farmers to inform them of their level of antimicrobial use, and allow farmers to benchmark themselves against their peers.  Data received by the AMU database for pigs so far indicates that the most widely used antibiotics in pigs are the older classes of antibiotics,  with much lower amounts of other antibiotics regarded as Highest Priority Critically Important antibiotics for human health being used. </p><p>At this point in time, antibiotic use data has been received from 121 herds of interest out of approximately 350 who are required to submit data. The data received so far is encouraging in that it demonstrates a relatively low level of antibiotic use in many herds with a national average of <b>96mg/kg </b>for 2019.<b></b>This figure is likely to change as we receive more data but it does highlight the value in having a figure for the level of antibiotic use in Irish pigs.</p><p>Measuring antimicrobial use is a pivotal part of the national effort to reduce overall use, and promote responsible use where necessary. Quantifying antimicrobial usage also allows us to measure the impact of the reduction strategies being implemented, demonstrate national trends, inform policy decisions, and enhance best practice. Development of this Pig AMU database is part of a range of measures that have been commenced and implemented as part of Ireland's National Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance 2017-2020 (iNAP) Animal Health Sector Implementation Committee action plan. My Department together with the Department of Health launched Irelands first  &lsquo;One Health&rsquo; national action plan, iNAP,  to address the challenge of antimicrobial resistance in human health, animal health and the environment. The launch of the iNAP Animal Health Implementation Committee in January 2018 has played a pivotal role in facilitating multidisciplinary collaborative efforts across key stakeholders in the animal health sector to tackle AMR. </p><p>Currently, there are 54 actions in the implementation plan for the animal health and environment sector. Actions or measures that have been taken to reduce the use of antibiotics in the pig sector include raising knowledge and awareness of AMR amongst pig farmers, farm advisors and veterinary practitioners through conferences, discussion groups , online campaigns, articles in print media. A set of guidelines on the responsible use of antibiotics in the pig industry were developed collaboratively by the IFA, Veterinary Ireland and Teagasc under the stewardship of the Animal and Plant Health Association, these guidelines provide practical tools and strategies for pig farmers to reduce the use of antibiotics. There is national surveillance of AMR in zoonotic and commensal bacteria in pigs carried out in accordance with EU legislation and the findings of this surveillance are shared with industry in order to drive behavioural change around the use of antibiotics.</p><p>New EU Regulations which will apply from January 2022 will aim to reduce the amount of antibiotics being used in all sectors of agriculture in the context of the global fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to protect human health. A research project funded by DAFM and carried out by Teagasc (AMURAP) covered one third of the Irish sow population and quantified the level of antimicrobial usage (AMU) in the pig  industry between 2016-2018 and is currently looking at the levels of AMR present on those farms monitored in the study to try and correlate AMU to AMR. A previous research project, PathSurvPig looked the incidence of respiratory disease on pig farms and what interventions are necessary to improve overall animal health and thereby reduce the need to use antibiotics. The findings of this project were shared directly with pig farmers and the farms involved in this research had very significant reductions in antibiotic use. One of the farmers participating in the research project won an award at EU level, and was highlighted as an example of best practice. My department continues to fund research that focuses on disease prevention and other ways of reducing the overall usage of antibiotics in the pig sector as we continue to adopt a One Health approach. The overall goal of iNAP is to reduce the use of antibiotics in both the human and animal health sectors and thereby address the public health threat of AMR.</p><p>A previous research project, PathSurvPig looked the incidence of respiratory disease on pig farms and what interventions are necessary to improve overall animal health and thereby reduce the need to use antibiotics.

This new authority will enforce EU-wide rules on prohibited unfair trading practices in the food supply chain and will have powers to enforce this Directive, penalising those who breach regulations. The NFO will have a specific role in analysing and reporting on price and market data in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Directive (EU) No. 2019/633, the Unfair Trading Practices (UTP Directive), must be transposed into Irish law by 1 May 2021. This can be done by way of a Statutory Instrument, but any measures that extend beyond the minimum harmonisation requirements of the UTP Directive will require primary legislation. </p>  <p>  Therefore, I propose to adopt a two-step approach to this commitment.  </p>  <p>  Firstly, my officials are currently drafting a proposal for a Statutory Instrument to directly transpose the UTP Directive as it stands.  Secondly, the legal requirements for the establishment of a new Office of a Food Ombudsman are also being considered, including the requirement for primary legislation in order to give that Office additional powers going beyond those in the UTP Directive.</p></reply>

To date, &euro;243 million has been paid across all the available schemes and we estimate that we have committed an additional &euro;130m to scheme participants which they have yet to draw down. </p>  <p>  However there are a wide range of Farm Safety related investments which are grant-aided under the suite of seven TAMS measures. These are included under the - Animal Welfare, Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme, Organic Capital Investment Scheme, Tillage Capital Investment Scheme and the Young Farmers Capital Investment Scheme. Grant aid of approximately &euro;5.5m has been incurred on specific Farm safety investments in TAMS II since the scheme opened in 2015. </p>  <p>  In addition &lsquo;Health and Safety&rsquo; guidelines are included in all &lsquo;Building Specifications,&rsquo; drawn up by the Department for the construction of agricultural buildings and structures.  The guidelines give advice on best practice and legislation. All animal housing and slurry storage facilities constructed under TAMS II include a range of health and safety related elements that create a safer working environment on farms. Approximately &euro;54 million has been spent on animal housing under the Animal Welfare Safety and Nutrient Storage Scheme since 2016 under TAMS II.   </p>  <p>   It is also a requirement that all farmers applying for grant-aid under the TAMS II schemes have completed a minimum of a half-day course on farm safety before they can draw down funding.  This course has now been completed in over 16,000 applications for payment under TAMS II.</p></reply>

Furthermore, my Department also has a contingency plan in place in order to effectively deal with any potential outbreak of ASF in Ireland. This includes the carrying out of checks for illegal food products at ports and airports in conjunction with Revenue using a targeted, risk-based approach. A food detector dog is used in addition to manual checks and scanning equipment at Dublin airport.  </p>  <p>  The risk of an incursion of African Swine Fever in Ireland can be reduced through the practice of effective biosecurity at farm level. If consistently applied, biosecurity measures will  help  prevent disease, whether exotic to or endemic in Ireland, from entering a farm and from spreading within a farm. My Department is currently finalising a strategy on National Farm Biosecurity which will emphasise the importance of  good biosecurity in protecting and improving animal health and welfare as well as ensuring good public health, through reduced antimicrobial usage, reduced transmission of zoonotic disease and improved environmental health. The strategy also provides a road-map that will hopefully ensure that good farm biosecurity is consistently practiced by all farmers at all times, and not just in the face of an immediate risk of a disease outbreak.</p>  <p>  The international disease situation is continuously monitored and updates are issued to stakeholders when necessary such as for example to inform them of the recent cases of ASF in wild boar in Germany. The EU has legislation to control outbreaks of the disease and places specific restrictions on the movement of live pigs and pig products from affected areas to free Member States such as Ireland and the trade of wild boar between EU Member States is prohibited in order to reduce this risk.</p></reply>
