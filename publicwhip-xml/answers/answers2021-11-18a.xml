This ensures that the Passport Service protects the integrity of the passport itself and the rights of the child and their guardians.</p><p>In this case, the Passport Service contacted the parent of the children on 6 November 2021, explaining the problem with the Child Passport Identity and Consent forms and requesting that new forms be correctly completed and returned.  These will be processed immediately once received. </p><p>In recent years we have been monitoring and mitigating issues that arise for applicants during the online and paper based passport application process. We regularly advise applicants online to ensure that their consent form is correctly witnessed at the final stage of the online process.  </p><p>Comprehensive instructions on how to complete these identity and consent forms are available on my Department's website (www.dfa.ie/passports/) and are also available to the applicant as they go through the online application process. </p><p>In summary, it is a three step process</p><p>1. One of the child&rsquo;s guardians must accompany the child to an appropriate witness;</p><p>2. The witness must know the child, confirm the child&rsquo;s identity and</p><p>3. Witness the signature of the guardian or guardians who have accompanied the child by completing, signing and stamping the relevant sections of the online or paper application form.</p><p>If the second guardian is not present, they can, if necessary, ask another appropriate witness to witness their consent separately.</p></reply>

Settlement expansion in sensitive areas such as E1 around Jerusalem undermine the viability of a two-State solution.  </p>  <p>  During my recent visit to the region, I saw at first-hand the impact on Palestinian communities. In my meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, I conveyed in clear terms my concerns about the situation in East Jerusalem. I raised the recent announcement of plans for over 3,000 new housing units and called on the Israeli authorities to cease all settlement activity, which is illegal under international law as set out in UN Security Council Resolution 2334.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Representative Office in Ramallah regularly visit Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan, along with other diplomatic representatives and continue to monitor the situation closely, including attending legal proceedings on eviction cases. Ireland also funds a number of civil society partners that are active on human rights issues, which impact specifically on Palestinians in East Jerusalem, including in relation to evictions.</p>  <p>  The Government's support for the D&aacute;il motion earlier this year, declaring that Israel&rsquo;s settlement policy in occupied Palestinian territory amounts to unlawful de facto annexation, reflected our grave concern about the scale and character of settlements and their negative impact.</p>  <p>  I have raised these issues with my EU counterparts at the Foreign Affairs Council and at the Security Council. Following recent settlement announcements, Ireland supported a request for the matter to be discussed at the Security Council on 8 November. The UN Deputy Special Coordinator in Jerusalem, Lynn Hastings, briefed the Council. Ireland underlined our concerns at the impact of this development on the viability of a future Palestinian State. Together with EU members of the Council as well as Norway and incoming member, Albania, Ireland made a joint press statement after the Council meeting highlighting the illegality of such settlements and calling for an end to them.</p></reply>

I welcome the news that one of the individuals concerned has recently reached an agreement with the Israeli authorities to end his strike. </p>  <p>  I  share the concerns raised by EU Special Representative for Human Rights Eamon Gilmore on 16 November regarding the deteriorating health conditions of the detainees .</p>  <p>  Irish officials are monitoring this matter, in cooperation with partners on the ground. Ireland supports the statement by the EU Delegation in Jerusalem on 5 November, calling on Israel to respect international law and avoid loss of life in this case, and reiterating the right of all detainees to a fair trial. </p>  <p>  I support the call made on October by UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, and the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, to end completely the practice of administrative detention. </p>  <p>  Ireland, and the EU, have repeatedly raised the treatment of Palestinian prisoners with the Israeli authorities. At the Human Rights Council, Ireland has called on the Israeli authorities, in accordance with their obligations under Article 9 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to refrain from conducting arbitrary arrests and to follow the acceptable procedure established by law regarding arrest and detention.</p>  <p>  Both Ireland and the EU also provide financial support to NGOs in Israel and in oPt who are active in bringing issues regarding the treatment of detainees to light.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-18a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111800063#WRA02000"><p>It has been the consistent position of the Government that the Stormont House Agreement provides a balanced and comprehensive framework to address the legacy of the Troubles. It was agreed by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it should be implemented &ndash; for the families and victims who have waited for too long. </p>  <p>  We have taken every opportunity in our regular engagements with the British Government at all levels to set out this position.</p>  <p>  As agreed at the BIIGC on 24 June, the Government joined the British Government and the Northern Irish parties in a process of engagement of these issues, with discussions beginning in July. The intention is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland.</p>  <p>  As we have consistently stated, a statute of limitations as proposed by the UK Government in their Command Paper is not something the Government can support. It is important to say that there has been a clear message from victims groups throughout this process that this cannot be the way forward. It has also been strongly and publicly opposed by all the parties. </p>  <p>  It would also go against the conclusions of the UK Government&rsquo;s own extensive public consultation in Northern Ireland on legacy legislation in 2019. There would be very serious questions as to whether such an approach would be consistent with the obligations of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is itself a key element of the Good Friday Agreement. We believe it would face well-founded legal challenges, causing further years of uncertainly and pain for families.</p>  <p>  We have consistently said that we are ready to engage with concerns or issues to do with the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement but any such changes must be discussed and agreed by the parties and both Governments. It is vital that any approach is collective if it is to work, and crucially, that it meets both the needs of victims and our shared international human rights obligations.</p>  <p>  It is crucial now to come back to the table at the level of political leaders to discuss next steps and find a way forward, with the two governments and the parties, that meets the needs of victims, and is based on the principles of justice, reconciliation and the rule of law. We have a responsibility to seek an agreed approach, for those families who have waited for too long.</p></reply>

My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Pippa Hackett, also participated as the second Government representative at the session. Also in attendance were the four Oireachtas representatives to the Plenary: Senator Alice-Mary Higgins; Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute; T.D.; Neale Richmond T.D.; and Niamh Smyth T.D., along with Ireland&rsquo;s National Citizen Representative, Noelle O&rsquo;Connell. </p>  <p>  The Conference Plenary comprises representatives from the European Commission, the Council, the European and national parliaments, and the National Citizen Representatives from all 27 member states as well as representatives of EU social and regional bodies. </p>  <p>  The second Plenary&rsquo;s agenda covered reporting on both member states&rsquo; Conference events and the meetings of the four Citizens&rsquo; Panels held to date as well as a discussion on the Conference&rsquo;s multilingual Digital Platform.</p>  <p>  Meetings of the Plenary Working Groups, held 22 October, preceded the Plenary session. There are nine Working Groups, each one focusing on one of the nine Conference themes. The Groups provide Plenary representatives with a chance for discussion of ideas, which in turn feeds in to proceedings at the Plenary. </p>  <p>  At my request, I have been nominated to serve as a member of the Working Group on Digital Transformation while Minister Hackett, as Ireland&rsquo;s second Ministerial representative, participated in the European Democracy Working Group.  </p>  <p>  In my intervention at the Plenary session, I urged greater engagement with the Conference. I also highlighted the useful opportunity for discussion the digital platform provides while additionally noting the scope for further initiatives associated with the Platform such as greater live-streaming of events. </p>  <p>  The Plenaries play an important role in the Conference process as they provide representatives with the chance to consider the ideas emerging from the citizens&rsquo; discussions on Europe&rsquo;s future facilitated by the Conference. </p>  <p>  The next Conference Plenary session will be held 17-18 December. </p></reply>

My Department is fully committed to allocating additional resources over the coming weeks and months to assist with processing of the high volume of applications anticipated and the current level of applications on hand. There are currently 32,000 Foreign Birth Registration applications on hand with the Passport Service.</p>  <p>  Throughout the pandemic, the Foreign Birth Registration Service considered all urgent requests to expedite an application on a case by case basis, in cases such as expectant parents, or stateless persons. Over 5,000 emergency Foreign Birth Registration applications have been processed in 2021. </p>  <p>  Demand for Foreign Birth Registration services reached unprecedented levels following the Brexit referendum in 2016. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the processing time for Foreign Birth Registration applications stood at 18 months. </p>  <p>  This processing time is due to the unprecedented peak in applications as a result of Brexit and to the rigorous validation both of identity and citizenship status which experienced staff at the Passport Service apply to all citizenship applications. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the phased reopening of Foreign Birth Registration services will see improvements in the experience of applicants for citizenship and a return to pre-pandemic processing times. I want to express appreciation for the work of the Foreign Birth Registration teams in assisting in the provision of urgent passport and contact tracing services during the pandemic. So far this year, those teams have operated both an urgent Foreign Birth Registration service and assisted in the delivery of over 500,000 passports as part of our expanded essential passport services operation. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-18a.39.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111800063#WRA02900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 26, 30, 39, 50, 67, 68 and 69 together.</p>  <p>Passport Service operations were severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as were many Government Services. Notwithstanding that disruption and despite the fact that the processing of passports requires physical distance on site to deliver this service during Level 5 restrictions, the Passport Service maintained operations throughout the pandemic. Passport Service staff also maintained contact with citizens and provided emergency passport services at all times since the onset of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has issued over half a million passports to date in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issue within one business day. </p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:</p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult renewals</p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex renewals</p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p>  <p>  The passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and apply to passport applications that are fully complete, where all required supporting documentation has been correctly submitted to the Passport Service by the applicant.</p>  <p>  There are currently 98,000 online applications and 10,000 paper applications on hand with the Passport Service.  Applications can take longer than the average turnaround time if applicants have not provided all of the required documentation to correctly complete their application. Of the online applications, 34,000 or 35% of applications are incomplete and require the applicant to submit additional documents. The Passport Service engages with all applicants who have not submitted the required documentation to ensure that their application is completed correctly and can proceed through the processing system. </p>  <p>  Of the online applications that are currently with the Passport Service for processing, approximately 7% are past the estimated issue-by date. These applications are being prioritised by the Passport Service who are working very hard to eliminate these delays. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. A particular improvement that will be of interest to Deputies is a change to the documentary management process that will reduce the turnaround time when additional documents need to be submitted by the applicant. These improvements will be rolled out in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p>  <p>  Adequate staffing of the Passport Service to respond to demand remains a priority for my Department and is an issue that is kept under constant review. My Department is actively working with the Public Appointments Service on an ongoing basis to recruit and assign additional staff to meet the current and forecasted high demand for passports. Additional permanent and temporary officers will be assigned between now and the end of January 2022, bringing total staff numbers to 920 and effectively doubling the number of staff at the Passport Service since June of this year. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Passport Service is working with relevant divisions within my Department to ensure the health and safety of all staff and is finalising plans in co-operation with the OPW to ensure that additional staff will be accommodated to meet the anticipated increased demand for passports expected in 2022.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the dedicated passport phone line, as Deputies will be aware a temporary line has been established to respond to queries on urgent passports cases.  </p>  <p>  For operational reasons queries on this temporary line are restricted to fifteen per week, this was previously 5 per week. The Emergency Passport service remains available in cases of medical emergency or death of a family member abroad. In addition, the Passport Offices in Mount St, Dublin 2 and in Cork are now offering an Urgent Appointment Service for the renewal of passports. To avail of the Urgent Appointment Service for Passport Renewal, applicants can book an appointment through the Department of Foreign Affairs website (www.dfa.ie/passports). Over 800 urgent appointments have been facilitated since the Passport Service launched this service on 27th September 2021. </p>  <p>  My Department fully recognises that Passport Express, and Northern Ireland Passport Express, continue to be an important channel for applicants who do not wish to use the online system or who have limited digital skills. Demand for the Passport Express service has fallen significantly since 2019 as more applicants choose Passport Online and benefit from the faster turnaround times available through this efficient online service. </p>  <p>  Passport Online will continue to be the priority channel given the efficiencies that are in-built in the system for both the applicant and the Passport Service. The processing of an online application is consistently up to four times faster than the processing time of a paper application. </p>  <p>  Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age  both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.</p>  <p>  I urge citizens to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to ensure that they apply in plenty of time. In the case of people planning to travel in 2022, whose passports are already out of date or who have children who are first-time applicants, I would encourage them to apply now online.</p></reply>

I have engaged extensively with both the Government of Yemen and countries of the region this year to urge them to work urgently and constructively towards a sustainable peace. At the High Level Week in New York in September, I met with the Foreign Ministers of Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Iran, urging all to support efforts towards peace in Yemen. I also held discussions with the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg in Amman on 4 November where he updated me on the worsening security situation in the country.  </p>  <p>  The EU also continues its active diplomatic outreach to relevant actors in support of the efforts of the UN Special Envoy. During his visit to the Gulf from 30 September &ndash; 4 October, EU HRVP Josef Borrell reiterated European Union support to the UN-led peace efforts. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support all efforts towards peace in Yemen, including at the Security Council, where we have consistently called on all parties to engage urgently and seriously with the UN led process. </p></reply>

It was agreed by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it should be fully implemented &ndash; for the families and victims who have waited for too long. </p>  <p>  The framework of the Stormont House Agreement provided for a set of institutions to deal comprehensively and fairly with the legacy of the Troubles, and this framework included an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval (ICIR) for truth recovery, to be available to victims and survivors across the UK and Ireland. The objective of the ICIR will be to enable victims and survivors to seek and privately receive information about the Troubles-related deaths of their next of kin.</p>  <p>  The Irish and British Governments concluded an agreement on the establishment of the ICIR in October 2015. As set out in that agreement, the Commission will consist of five members; an Independent Chairperson of international standing, appointed by the two Governments, one Commissioner each appointed by the Irish and British Governments, and two Commissioners appointed jointly by Northern Ireland's First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>  <p>  The ICIR agreement was signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in October 2015 and laid before the Oireachtas in January 2016. The Independent Commission can only be formally established once the necessary legislation has been enacted in both jurisdictions and the two Governments have notified each other of completion of all other domestic legal procedures required to bring the agreement into force.</p>  <p>  I have engaged extensively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on these issues to urge him to move forward with the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy bodies, including the ICIR, and we remain in ongoing contact to support a way forward on these matters. </p>  <p>  It is crucial that we find a way forward with the two governments and the parties that meets the needs of victims, and is based on the principles of justice, reconciliation and the rule of law.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-18a.52.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111800063#WRA04700"><p>Every family bereaved in the conflict, including the family members of the victims of those shot dead in  Springhill Westrock in Belfast on 9 July 1972, must have access to an effective investigation and to a process of justice regardless of the perpetrator. All victims&rsquo; families deserve support in securing all the information possible about what happened to their loved ones.</p>  <p>  Last July marked the 49th anniversary of the Springhill Westrock massacre, which saw Margaret Gargan, John Dougal, David McCafferty, Patrick Butler and Fr Noel Fitzpatrick lose their lives. Their deaths at Springhill were part of the tragic legacy of the Troubles which saw the loss of over 3500 lives from all communities.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomed the announcement in 2014 of a new inquest into the deaths of the five Springhill victims by the then Northern Ireland Attorney General John Larkin. It is understood that earlier this year, the case was listed for a pre-inquest hearing, which is expected to take place in the next 12-18 months. It is a matter of disappointment and frustration that it has taken this long for the family's case to reach this stage.  The outcome of the Ballymurphy Inquest demonstrated what can still be achieved on these complex legacy cases all these years later, and the impact that it can have.</p>  <p>  As agreed at the BIIGC on 24 June, the Government joined the British Government and the Northern Irish parties in a process of intensive engagement on legacy issues, with discussions beginning in July. The intention is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland by the end of this Autumn.  </p>  <p>  As we have consistently stated, a statute of limitations and the discontinuation of inquests, as proposed by the UK Government in their Command Paper ,is not something that the Government can support. It is important to say that there has been a clear message from victims groups throughout this process that this cannot be the way forward. It has also been strongly and publicly opposed by all the parties.</p>  <p>  We have consistently said that we are ready to engage with concerns or issues to do with the implementation of the Stormont House agreement but any such changes must be discussed and agreed by the parties and both Governments. It is vital that any approach is collective if it is to work, and crucially, that it meets both the needs of victims and our shared international human rights obligations. </p></reply>

Accountability for violations of international law committed by all parties, including as described in the recent joint Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights/Ethiopian Human Rights Commission report, is essential.</p>  <p>  There has been a shocking rise in hate speech, arbitrary arrests and detentions, including of UN staff, and other acts likely to fuel tensions.  Human rights, democracy and fundamental freedoms are universal and inalienable values that States must uphold.  No individual should be deprived of their liberty without legal authority, or without necessary procedural protections. Reason for detention must be provided promptly to those affected, as well as access to legal counsel and the right to have the lawfulness of the detention reviewed by a court. If not, those detained should be released.</p>  <p>  It is clear there can be no military solution to this crisis.  I strongly support the efforts of African Union Envoy, the former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, to mediate a way forward, supported by key regional actors.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been to the fore of efforts to address the conflict at the Security Council.  On 5 November, we secured agreement on the first Council statement in six months on the situation, which called for a cessation of hostilities and ceasefire negotiations, alongside respect of international humanitarian law, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, the re-establishment of public services, and the scaling up of humanitarian assistance.</p>  <p>  Ireland continue to push for a strong and constructive EU response to the crisis. At the Foreign Affairs Council in October and again earlier this week, Minister Coveney emphasised the need to ensure humanitarian access, to halt the fighting, and to incentivise dialogue &mdash;including through possible use of restrictive measures if required. </p>  <p>  As the conflict extends further throughout the country, my Department has issued a travel advisory for citizens not to travel to Ethiopia.  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Addis Ababa is in regular ongoing contact with Ministers and officials, and continues to provide vital consular support for Irish citizens in the country.  </p>  <p>  To date, Ireland has provided over &euro;4.4 million in humanitarian aid to Tigray and Amhara and for refugees in neighbouring Sudan. We will continue to prioritise humanitarian need while this crisis persists.</p></reply>

An independent judiciary that can exercise its function without interference is a core tenet of the rule of law. </p><p>Ireland has expressed this position through active participation in the Article 7 hearings at the General Affairs Council regarding developments of concern in Poland&rsquo;s justice system. We will continue to engage in dialogue on this matter at EU level. </p><p>In July, the European Court of Justice determined that the Supreme Court Disciplinary Chamber in Poland, which substantially altered the country&rsquo;s disciplinary regime for judges, was not compatible with EU law and should be suspended. A subsequent decision by the Court in October required Poland to pay a daily penalty due to its failure to comply in full with the measures arising from the July judgment. Ireland has and will continue to urge Poland to comply in full with these rulings and orders.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s position is clear - access to EU funds should be contingent on upholding EU values, particularly rule of law. We view the <i>Regulation on a General Regime of Conditionality for the Protection of the Union Budget</i>as fair, proportionate, and serving an important purpose in addressing challenges of the kind associated with Poland&rsquo;s justice system. As such, Ireland recently intervened along with nine other Member States on the side of the Council and Parliament to oppose an action to annul the Conditionality Regulation brought by Poland and Hungary. Judgment on this case is now awaited.</p><p>Ireland also supports Commission President Von der Leyen&rsquo;s recent statement that Poland must comply with the decisions of the Court of Justice including the dismantling of the Supreme Court Disciplinary Chamber to access the EU&rsquo;s Recovery and Resilience Programme funds. </p></reply>

The coup is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar that has taken years to establish, and does nothing to tackle the public health, security or economic issues faced by the people of Myanmar. I have made three statements and called upon the Myanmar military to demonstrate restraint, respect human rights and the rule of law, immediately release political detainees and restore legitimate civilian government.</p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned by the escalation of armed conflict across Myanmar, significant deployment of the armed forces in rural areas, and an increase in clashes, causing civilian casualties and displacement. In recent weeks, tensions have increased, leading to concerns, especially in northern Rakhine, that the armed conflict will escalate in this region again. We are witnessing a daily deterioration in the humanitarian situation in Myanmar and the overwhelming impact of the military action is being felt by the civilian population.</p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned for the Rohingya people, especially those within IDP camps in Rakhine State. Ireland has provided direct funding of over &euro;7.1 million since 2017 to support the Rohingya crisis, supporting vulnerable communities living in conflict affected areas of Rakhine state and Rohingya refugee settlements in Bangladesh. Our support has focused on food, nutrition, shelter, water and sanitation. We have consistently voiced support for international efforts towards ensuring accountability and justice in Myanmar and we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to those most in need.</p>  <p>  Ireland is active in multilateral fora to highlight the situation in Myanmar, including in our role as an elected member of the  United Nations Security Council. The Council has considered the situation in Myanmar seven times since the coup, most recently on 8 November 2021, after which a Press Statement was issued. The European Union also issued a statement of 8 November calling for an immediate end to violence.</p></reply>

There is a specific emphasis across our work on addressing hunger and ensuring human rights are met. This is reflected in A Better World, Ireland's international development policy, which identifies food as a key area for intervention, and asserts our intention to reach those that are furthest behind first in all our work. </p>  <p>  Our ability to follow-through on these commitments in practice is evident in, for example, the high proportion of Irish Aid funding which targets least developed and low income countries. Where the average DAC member's bilateral allocation to these countries is just under one quarter, half of Irish ODA is bilateral aid to low income and least developed countries. Irish ODA also places a strong emphasis on fragile contexts, where the scourge of hunger is most prevalent. In 2020, Ireland spent more than &euro;193 million on projects that addressed hunger.</p>  <p>  Our commitment to, and ability to deliver on, a needs-based allocation of development assistance is also internationally recognised. In 2020, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) highlighted Ireland as "an excellent humanitarian partner", with its funding models a "useful inspiration for other DAC donors".</p>  <p>  Last year, the respected international think-tank ODI assessed the characteristics of ODA expenditure in leading donors and found Ireland to be the most principled donor, noting specifically Ireland's needs-based approach. </p>  <p>  Nearly one-tenth of the world&rsquo;s population, or over 800 million people, are undernourished. During September&rsquo;s Food Systems Summit, Ireland played a key role in championing action on hunger, and particularly the most severe form of malnutrition- wasting. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also championing a human-rights based approach to hunger, through our work at the UN Security Council on Resolution 2417 on hunger and conflict, as well as at the EU, UN and Council of Europe.</p></reply>

The figures cover the number of passport applications received from May to October 2021 that are currently with the Passport Service.  The table also sets out for comparative purposes the numbers of passports issued in the same months.</p><p>Over half a million passports have been issued in 2021 to date. </p><p>The Passport Service is currently experiencing high demand for first time passports with 64% of applications coming from first time applicants, the majority of which were received in October and late September and are still within the processing time of 40 working days. First time applications are complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. Accordingly, a rigorous process is in place to verify the identity of the applicant and their entitlement to Irish citizenship. In the case of first time applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. </p><p>Applications can take longer if applicants have not provided the required documentation to complete their application. Currently, 35% of all online applicants and 45% of first time applicants have not submitted the documents needed to issue their passport.  These applications cannot be moved forward and processed until the applicants have submitted the necessary documentation. </p><p>Adequate staffing of the Passport Service to respond to demand remains a priority for my Department and is an issue that is kept under constant review. My Department is actively working with the Public Appointments Service on an ongoing basis to recruit and assign additional staff to meet the current and forecasted high demand for passports. Additional permanent and temporary officers will be assigned between now and the end of January 2022, bringing total staff to 920 and effectively doubling the number of staff at the Passport Service since June of this year. <table>    <tr>       <th><div>Month</div></th>       <th><div>Passports issued</div></th>       <th><div>Applications on hand at 15/11/21</div></th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>September 2021</td>       <td>76,802</td>       <td>18,500</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>August 2021</td>       <td>76,519</td>       <td>12,400</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>July 2021</td>       <td>73,676</td>       <td>9,800</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>June 2021</td>       <td>63,953</td>       <td>6,900</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>May 2021</td>       <td>77,152</td>       <td>1,400</td>    </tr> </table> </p></reply>

The UN is playing a vital role in all these areas. </p><p>The absence of many non-governmental organisations, civil society networks, and diplomatic missions from Afghanistan following the Taliban takeover of Kabul has made the role of the UN in monitoring developments inside Afghanistan, including on human rights, is particularly important. Representatives of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) have met with high-ranking members of the Taliban administration in recent weeks to highlight Afghanistan&rsquo;s human rights obligations under international law.  UNAMA personnel have also engaged with key contacts at regional level on human rights.  </p><p>Upholding human rights and the protection of civilians within the maintenance of international peace and security are key priorities of Ireland&rsquo;s Security Council term.  Ireland has expressed its grave concerns at reports from Afghanistan on curtailments of human rights, at intimidation and violence against minorities, at repression of peaceful protests and self-censorship by Afghan journalists.  We have also underlined that Afghan women and girls must be treated as equal citizens, with full and equal access to education, to healthcare, to freedom of movement and participation in public life.  </p><p>The UN Human Rights Council met in special session last August and adopted a resolution on strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights in Afghanistan.  During its October session, the EU led a resolution on the &ldquo;Situation of human rights in Afghanistan&rdquo; that establishes a mandate for a Special Rapporteur, to be appointed at the March 2022 session.In an <i>oral update</i>during the  session, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, pledged her commitment to &ldquo;continu(ing) to work to the full extent of our capacity to monitor the rights of the Afghan people and assist, wherever possible, in protecting and advancing those rights&rdquo;.  </p><p>In its engagement in all international fora, and especially the UN Security Council, Ireland will continue to prioritise the rights of Afghans and will work to ensure the fullest access by UNAMA to continue its critical monitoring and reporting from Afghanistan to ensure that human rights are protected and defended.</p></reply>

The military leadership&rsquo;s violent crackdown on the country&rsquo;s civilian and civil society leadership, mass detention of protestors and methodical dismantling of transitional institutions are unacceptable. </p>  <p>  It is vital that the international community send a strong message: the democratic transition must be restored and all those unlawfully detained must be released. Ireland continues to stress this at the United Nations and within the European Union. Sudan&rsquo;s democratic transition is too important to fail, for the people of Sudan, and for the stability of the Horn of Africa region as a whole. </p>  <p>  Ireland supported a Security Council Press Statement on 28 October condemning the coup, and was unequivocal in denouncing the action by Sudan&rsquo;s military leaders at two Council meetings on Sudan, most recently on 11 November. We continue to keep further Council action under consideration, as we support the mediation efforts of the African Union, United Nations and EU envoys. </p>  <p>  We have also pushed for a strong EU response. High Representative Josep Borrell issued a statement on 26 October on behalf of the 27 EU member States warning of serious consequences if the move to dismantle the transitional government was not reversed. At the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 15 November Minister Coveney discussed the need to incentivise a return to the path to democracy, including exploring all tools at our disposal.</p>  <p>  Ireland is ready to consider further restrictive or financial measures, including under the EU&rsquo;s Global Human Rights sanctions regime, while keeping in mind the increasing humanitarian needs on the ground.</p>  <p>  We also remain concerned by the deteriorating human rights situation. At the Human Rights Council Special Session on Sudan on 5 November, Ireland urged the military authorities to respect the rights of peaceful assembly and return to the full implementation of the Constitutional Document and the Juba Peace Agreement.</p>  <p>  As the crisis evolves, my officials, including through our Embassy in Nairobi accredited to Sudan, will continue to closely monitor the situation and work with our partners for a cohesive collective response and restoration of the democratic transition.</p></reply>

The coup is a reversal of the progress made towards democracy and rule of law in Myanmar that has taken years to establish. Ireland is actively engaging in our role as an elected member of the Security Council to call on all sides to refrain from violence, and to fully respect human rights and comply with international law, including international humanitarian and human rights law.</p>  <p>  The situation in Myanmar has been considered seven times by the United Nations Security Council, most recently on 8 November 2021, after which a Press Statement was issued. The Council has expressed deep concern regarding developments in Myanmar, condemning the use of violence by the military, and called for the release of all those detained. It is welcome that the Security Council has taken a united position on this crisis, sending a strong message to the Myanmar military. Ireland was also a member of the core group of nations who proposed the June 2021 United Nations General Assembly resolution which called for a stop to the flow of arms to Myanmar. </p>  <p>  The situation remains on the agenda of the Security Council and we will continue to work with partners in search of a resolution. My officials also maintain regular contact with civil society organisations in Myanmar, and with those working to alleviate the humanitarian crisis there.</p>  <p>  Military rule opens scope for further human rights abuses in Myanmar and Ireland has voiced its concern at four sessions of the Human Rights Council since February 2021. Ireland has consistently voiced support for international efforts towards ensuring accountability and justice in Myanmar, including the ongoing processes at the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. </p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to work actively to use our influence with partners and through our position on the Security Council to promote the rule of law and protect the human rights of the people of Myanmar.</p></reply>

Settlement expansion, demolitions and evictions threaten the viability of a two-state solution.</p>  <p>  Ireland has expressed serious concern in relation to the recent announcements by Israeli authorities of plans for the construction of more than 3,000 settlement units in the West Bank. On 28 October, Ireland joined 11 other European states in issuing a statement urging the Israeli authorities to reverse the decision. </p>  <p>  I saw myself on my recent visit to the occupied Palestinian territory the impact that settlements are having on Palestinian communities and on the viability of a future Palestinian State.  I am particularly concerned about developments in strategically sensitive areas around East Jerusalem.</p>  <p>  During my recent visit to the region, I met with Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid. I conveyed in clear terms my concern at recent announcements and called on the Israeli authorities to cease all settlement activity, which is illegal under international law. Ireland will continue to raise the issue at the Security Council, as well as at EU level. Ireland supported a call for the Security Council to discuss the recent announcements and this meeting took place on 8 November. </p>  <p>  The UN Deputy Special Coordinator briefed the Council on the issue and Ireland underlined the illegality of the settlements at the meeting. Ireland joined EU Members of the Council in a Joint Press Statement together with Norway and incoming member Albania, following the meeting of the Security Council, which urged Israel to halt settlement activity.</p></reply>

Both Minister Coveney and I each attended in Glasgow for one day, participating in stakeholder events and also having bilateral meetings.</p>  <p>  Ahead of COP26, my Department worked closely with officials in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, which leads on climate issues, as well as with other relevant Departments and Agencies to prepare Ireland&rsquo;s priorities and position.</p>  <p>  Ireland is represented by the European Union at the UN Climate Conference.  My Department engaged in EU working groups and related negotiations at COP26 on issues on which the Department of Foreign Affairs leads for the Government, such as: climate change adaptation; Loss and Damage associated with climate change impact; and climate finance to support developing countries to address climate change. </p>  <p>  Ahead of and during COP26, my Department was particularly active in drawing attention to the urgent need to scale up financial support to climate adaptation in developing countries. This effort was most prominent through The Champions Group on Adaptation Finance which I officially launched at the UN General Assembly in September this year, together with the Governments of Denmark, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland. </p>  <p>  There was notable progress made at COP26 on adaptation financing, including through strong language in the Glasgow Climate Pact for developed countries to collectively at least double their adaptation finance by 2025.  Pledges to the Adaptation Fund at this COP were $356 million, exceeding all expectations. Similarly, the Least Developed Countries Fund raised $413 million. Ireland announced new pledges to both funds, with a record &euro;10 million for the Adaptation Fund (from DECC) and &euro;2.5 million for the Least Developed Countries Fund (from DFA). </p>  <p>  As with many previous UN Climate Conferences, the overall outcome from the Glasgow COP is mixed. This is partly due to the reality that the COP is a multilateral process that requires endorsement of 197 countries.  As a result, the Glasgow Climate Pact attempts to strike a balance between increasing climate ambition and sufficiently supporting developing countries to address the growing impacts of climate change. </p>  <p>  Some of the most notable features of the Glasgow Climate Pact include: </p>  <p>  - An ambitious work programme to cut emissions this decade;</p>  <p>  - Renewed commitments to increase climate finance to achieve the $100bn goal per annum, and a doubling of adaptation finance to support developing countries;</p>  <p>  - Finalising the governance of the Paris Agreement;</p>  <p>  - New provisions to address fossil fuel subsidies and unabated coal;</p>  <p>  - Establishing the Santiago Network to provide technical assistance to support developing countries on loss and damage caused through climate change; and</p>  <p>  - Providing for a future dialogue to discuss funding arrangements to avert, minimise and address loss and damage.</p></reply>

This Strategy is a whole of Government approach to our engagement with the Nordic region, which encompasses Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The Nordic region is one with which Ireland has long-standing ties and shares similar values in the areas of peace, security and in our joint attachment to a rules-based international order. This is currently well reflected in our close cooperation with Norway as non-permanent members of the UN Security Council for the period 2021-22.The Nordic Strategy reflects Ireland&rsquo;s goal of increasing our engagement with the Nordic states through deepening cooperation in trade, tourism, education, science and culture. </p><p>Following the launch of the Strategy, officials in my Department have been engaging with stakeholders in other Departments, State agencies, and our diplomatic missions in the Nordic region, as well as Nordic diplomatic missions accredited to Ireland to draft actions to fulfil the commitments of the Strategy. This work will be completed shortly.  The Nordic Strategy will require close collaboration with the five Nordic governments.  My officials are in close contact with relevant counterparts. The Nordic Strategy was welcomed by the Nordic Governments with great enthusiasm and senior Nordic Government representatives participated in the launch of the Strategy on 2 June. </p><p>My Department is already implementing commitments from the Strategy including jointly hosting the next Ireland/Nordic-Baltic 8 conference in December with the involvement of the Nordic and Baltic embassies based in Dublin. We have also initiated a programme of ministerial and official engagements with our Nordic counterparts<b>.  </b>I also wish to acknowledge the recent and very welcome decision by the Government of Sweden to re-open its resident Embassy in Dublin, which was closed in 2010.This will be an additional resource for engagement with a key Nordic partner and will assist us in driving forward the Nordic Strategy in the years ahead.</p></reply>

We are committed to keeping the situation in the country high on the international agenda. It is unacceptable that the current regime detains individuals without due cause or process. Freedom of expression is a core element of civil society space which is a leading foreign policy priority for Ireland. </p>  <p>  I know many members of the Oireachtas have 'adopted' political prisoners and I commend them for maintaining awareness of their plight. </p>  <p>  Ireland has raised this and related issues at multiple international fora, including at informal meetings of United Nations Security Council members, sponsoring &ldquo;Arria formula&rdquo; discussions on Belarus. These are important ways to put additional pressure on the Lukashenko regime to adhere to their international obligations and commitments.</p>  <p>  Ireland has also played a supporting role at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, where a successful EU-led resolution granted an investigative mandate to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to examine human rights violations. Along with our EU partners, we also secured a mandate renewal for the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Ireland is co-sponsoring a fifth package of sanctions against entities and individuals complicit in the Lukashenko regime&rsquo;s human rights violations. </p></reply>

The EU will now be able to target individuals and entities organising or contributing to activities by the Lukashenko regime that facilitate illegal crossing of the EU's external borders. Ireland had co-sponsored this package which shows our solidarity with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and with those trapped at the border. This follows the EU&rsquo;s progressive introduction of restrictions against the Lukashenko regime since November 2020.</p>  <p>  Ireland also supports the European institutions in their outreach to countries of origin to stem the flow of irregular migration at source. In August, following outreach from High Representative/Vice-President Josep Borrell Fontelles, Iraq agreed to suspend flights to Belarus. In recent days, some airlines have made commitments that will effectively ban access to their flights by potential irregular migrants. I am hopeful that in the coming weeks the EU's continuing engagement will result in a diminishing flow of migrants to Belarus.</p>  <p>  We have also engaged at the EU level to address the humanitarian situation at the Belarus-Poland border. Ireland has expressed its support for the deployment of experts from Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, to the border region. I also believe that international organisations and independent monitors and journalists should be allowed to access both sides of the border</p>  <p>  I am grateful to the Lithuanian government who facilitated Minister of State Byrne's recent visit to Lithuanian-Belarussian border. As part of that visit, Minister Byrne was able to view some migrant camps that have been established by the Lithuanian Government, to meet with the Lithuanian Border Guards and with the Lithuanian Red Cross, which this year has received a contribution of &euro;100,000 from Irish Aid. </p></reply>

For public health reasons, 1.6 billion young people were unable to attend school for long periods, and some are still not back in school.  These school closures exacerbated existing inequalities, with those children most marginalised before COVID-19 having highest risk of learning losses and permanently dropping out of education.  </p>  <p>  Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable. Early in the pandemic Ireland, together with Liberia and Trinidad and Tobago, brought together UN member states and thought leaders to discuss the specific impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent girls&rsquo; education. The outcome was a series of recommended actions to support adolescent girls in continuing their education and returning to schools after they reopened.  </p>  <p>  At a global level and in response to pressing educational needs, I have increased Ireland&rsquo;s financial contributions this year to the Global Partnership for Education (to &euro;10 million) and Education Cannot Wait (to &euro;4 million).   </p>  <p>  The Global Partnership for Education is helping governments sustain learning and mitigate the impacts of school closures for up to 355 million children in 66 countries.  Priority is given to reaching the most vulnerable children, including girls and children with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Education Cannot Wait is supporting continuous access to learning and actions to protect the health and wellbeing of girls and boys living in emergencies and protracted crises. Their work targets 32 million vulnerable children and youth in over 30 countries affected by armed conflict, forced displacement, climate-related disasters and other crises.</p>  <p>  At country level, Irish Embassies are supporting education ministries make key adjustments to education programmes, to allow for distance and blended learning as well as the safe reopening of schools.  This includes provision of home based learning supports, distance education innovations and improving hand-washing facilities in schools.  For example, in Mozambique, the Irish Aid supported EducaTV project provides audio-visual and digital science content, which were transmitted on TV and via an online platform reaching millions of teachers and students.  While in Uganda last month, I saw an Irish Aid supported UNICEF home based learning support programme in Karamoja province, helping ensure that vulnerable children maintain access to education notwithstanding the duration of school closures in Uganda.</p></reply>

Also on the agenda was a focus on addressing the medium and long-term challenges facing the global economy, with an emphasis on the green and digital transitions and gender equality.</p>  <p>  Three substantive developments emerged from the Ministerial Council Meeting &ndash; consideration of enlargement of the OECD, an Inclusive Framework on Implicit and Explicit Carbon Pricing and agreement of a new tax framework to address the tax challenges of digitalisation.</p>  <p>  Minister Byrne attended the Members only session, during which the importance of the shared values&rsquo; of the OECD were reaffirmed and a common vision for the future of the OECD were discussed, later being adopted as the New Vision Statement for the OECD. </p>  <p>  During these discussions, Minister Byrne hailed the important contribution of the OECD to multilateralism and the rules based system over its six decades. In pledging support for the New Vision Statement, he highlighted the platform the OECD provides Members to build the prosperity needed to tackle inequalities and meet the needs of our citizens.  He urged Members to accept the opportunities and challenges posed by climate and digital transitions in building a sustainable recovery from the pandemic. </p>  <p>  Minister Byrne also spoke of the importance of cultivating public trust in Government as a source of truth and authority and pointed to the high vaccine uptake in Ireland as a sign of such public trust. He noted the need to mainstream gender equality by removing social and economic barriers limiting women and girls and to accelerate global co-operation, in particular with developing countries who are more severely impacted by climate change. </p>  <p>  Minister Byrne also attended a discussion focused on innovation and inclusive pathways to net-zero.</p></reply>

The main objectives of the visit were to underline the importance of both the direct routes and the landbridge for Ireland&rsquo;s trade connectivity with the Single Market, to reinforce existing strong bilateral relations with France, Ireland&rsquo;s closest EU neighbour, building on our ambitious Joint Plan of Action, and to consolidate relationships with the regional authorities in the Hauts-de-France region </p>  <p>  The Dunkirk-Rosslare route opened on 2 January 2021 to cater for freight consignments moving directly from Ireland to mainland Europe and runs ten crossings a week. Dunkirk is a highly strategic location for Ireland&rsquo;s exports to the European continent as it is ideally situated in close proximity to Paris, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Ireland&rsquo;s freight capacity to continental EU ports has doubled in the past 18 months in response to significant market demand.  A number of new or additional direct ferry links with increased capacity have come on stream and are seeing high demand, including to Cherbourg, Dunkirk, Zeebrugge, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Roscoff and Santander. Figures from the Irish Maritime Development Office show that weekly roll-on / roll-off (RoRo) freight capacity to continental EU ports has doubled in the past 18 months and is at unprecedented levels.  Similarly, load-on / load-off (LoLo) volumes in the first half of 2021 increased by 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, and are at their highest level since 2007.  This increase in services demonstrates the commitment of the shipping companies to the Irish market</p>  <p>  During the visit, the Minister also visited a manufacturing plant owned by Ecocem, an Irish company situated in the port of Dunkirk that produces high performance cements. Ecocem is one of the leading Irish companies in France that has grown its business through investment in the Hauts-de-France region and the Port of Dunkirk.</p>  <p>  In parallel to supporting the development of direct maritime routes, the Minister and the Government continue to support the smooth flow of goods across the UK landbridge, including working closely with French counterparts. </p></reply>

Courses within the programme are aligned with Ireland&rsquo;s policy for International Development, A Better World. The Fellowship award covers course fees, accommodation, living costs, and flights. The programme promotes gender equality, equal opportunities, and welcomes diversity and alumni are encouraged to stay connected with Ireland, and with each other, after returning home. </p>  <p>  There are presently 158 Fellows in Ireland, studying at 18 Higher Education Institutions.

I used the occasion to address a number of key issues which are important for PDFORRA members.</p>  <p>  I raised the important issue of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.  I provided the delegates with an update on the most recent actions that I have undertaken and reiterated the point that inappropriate behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated in the Defence Forces. I briefed the Conference on the roll out of the Confidential Contact Person (CCP) who has been appointed to provide professional, safe and confidential support for any past or present member of the Defence Forces, who may wish to report alleged bullying, harassment, sexual harassment or discrimination.  </p>  <p>  I provided an update on the current status of the work of the Commission on Defence Forces. I advised the delegates to the Conference that I expect the recommendations arising out of the report of the Commission will be far reaching and challenging and their implementation will require positive and constructive engagement from PDFORRA and members.</p>  <p>  I informed delegates that I was delighted to note the Association's favourable ballot on the public service agreement 2021-2022 - "Building Momentum".

The pandemic resulted in the enactment of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 and the subsequent delays in Defence Forces applicant processing are now being addressed, including for RDF applicants.  </p>  <p>  The Military Authorities have advised that a revised Defence Forces framework for living with COVID -19 is in place and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. This revised framework, I understand, affords more scope for RDF training and induction within the parameters of Government guidelines.

Personnel leave the Permanent Defence Force for a number of reasons including on age grounds, at the end of contract and voluntary discharges.</p><p>As at 15<sup>th</sup>November, 577 personnel (including 455 General Service Recruits) have been inducted into the Defence Forces. This arises from the ongoing General Service recruitment campaign and the expanding scope of direct entry competitions, along with reviews of direct entry terms and conditions to improve intakes. The scope of direct entry competitions was expanded in 2021, from 10 competitions, to include a new Air Corps Aircraft Technician competition. Additionally, direct entry terms and conditions continue to be revised to improve intakes. The re-entry campaign for former members of the PDF continues.  </p><p>There has been significant progress on pay arising out of increases due from recent pay agreements, the most recent of which was a 1% increase on annualised salaries or &euro;500, whichever is greater, on the 1st October 2021, with further increases to follow. There are now Service Commitment schemes in both the Air Corps and the Naval Service, and a Special Naval Service tax credit for sea-going personnel.</p><p>Furthermore, in light of the particular challenges faced by the Defence Sector, the Government tasked the Public Service Pay Commission (PSPC) to undertake a comprehensive review and analysis of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces. I am confident that the pay benefits delivered by the Public Service pay agreements, in tandem with the implementation of the PSPC's recommendations will improve recruitment and retention challenges currently being experienced by the PDF. </p><p>Additionally, the Commission on the Defence Forces is due to submit their report by the end of the year and I look forward to receiving the report in due course. The recommendations will then be fully considered and will inform future decisions regarding the Defence Forces.</p><p>I remain committed to maximising recruitment and retention of personnel to maintain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and abroad. </p></reply>

For this reason compulsory retirement ages for ranks in the Permanent Defence Force are considerably lower than in other employments.</p>  <p>  The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force have been the subject of a number of reviews. A range of policies were introduced to ensure an appropriate age profile and levels of fitness. This included fixed term contracts for certain ranks enlisted from 1994 onwards.</p>  <p>  Arising from an adjudication in 2015, it was agreed that a further review of contracts of service for Line Corporals and Privates and Corporals in receipt of Technical Pay 1 and 2 would be conducted. It was subsequently agreed with PDFORRA that all Privates and Corporals recruited post 1994, would be allowed to continue in service to 31 December 2022 (or until they reach the age of 50), provided these personnel meet certain criteria during the interim period, including medical grades and fitness tests. </p>  <p>  This agreement was also extended to include post 1994 Sergeants, who also can continue to serve to the same date, subject to their meeting similar criteria in the interim period. These measures are in place to provide time for the review to be completed. </p>  <p>  A joint civil/military review of mandatory retirement ages of all ranks in the Permanent Defence Force has been conducted. The review has taken into account the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission on recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force, which included in their recommendations, the need to consider options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the Permanent Defence Force.  </p>  <p>  The recommendations in the  joint civil/military review requires consideration from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to implications on costs and pensions. Discussions with PDFORRA on the recommendations will take place following the consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  I have said previously that I want to provide clarity on this issue before the end of the year. This is not solely my nor my Department's decision. We have to work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well. Nonetheless that is a commitment I have given and I want to follow through on it.</p></reply>

A number of projects were identified with a view to ensuring that the Defence Organisation was reflective of Irish society and its changing nature. </p><p>Other measures which support the Defence Force&rsquo;s commitment to a workplace underpinned by diversity and inclusion include the following:</p><p>- Both the Department and the Defence Forces, are represented on a Committee, led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth established to oversee and monitor progress on the implementation of the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy 2019-2021. </p><p>- Additionally, the Defence Forces LGBTQI+ Network &ldquo;Defend with Pride&rdquo; was launched in October 2016 with the aim of providing support, information and guidance for LGBT personnel and allies who wish to support colleagues, family and friends.

The situation in Belarus was discussed earlier this week by EU Foreign and Defence Ministers and is clearly very serious.  Ministers expressed solidarity with Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian colleagues at the meeting.  </p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, EU Foreign Ministers, myself included, discussed the escalation in the crisis along the EU&rsquo;s borders with Belarus.  We took swift action and agreed to broaden the listings criteria for sanctions on the Belarusian regime.</p>  <p>  The EU is continuing to monitor developments in Belarus and at the border very closely.  It is likely that the Council will come back to the issue in due course and on the basis of the most up-to-date information available.  </p>  <p>  Ireland has repeatedly demonstrated our solidarity with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and with those trapped at the border. Just three weeks ago, Minister of State Byrne visited the Lithuanian-Belarussian border, accompanied by members of the Lithuanian Government. As part of that visit, he viewed some migrant camps that have been established by the Lithuanian Government, met with the Lithuanian Border Guards and also with the Lithuanian Red Cross, which, this year, has received a contribution of &euro;100,000 from Irish Aid to help provide relief to the migrants.  </p>  <p>  Threat assessments carried out by the Defence Forces relate primarily to those locations and theatres where Defence Forces personnel are deployed on operations.  Given the intelligence and security issues involved in such assessments, it would be inappropriate for  me to comment further on the matter at this time.   </p></reply>

This allocation represents an overall increase of &euro;35 million on 2021 and ensures that sufficient funding is available to the Defence Organisation to carry out all its assigned roles, both at home and overseas and to deliver on White Paper commitments. </p>  <p>  The Defence Vote provides for pay and non-pay current expenditure of some &euro;695 million. The pay allocation of &euro;545 million provides for the pay and allowances of over 10,400 public service employees within the Defence Sector, including a Permanent Defence Force of up to 9,500, along with civil servants and civilian employees employed by my Department. The non-pay allocation of &euro;150 million provides for expenditure on essential and ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs including utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training. </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence, updated in 2019, highlighted the importance of capability development and the necessity for continued renewal, upgrade and acquisition of military equipment and infrastructure. To this end, the capital allocation of &euro;141 million provided for 2022 will facilitate the ongoing programme of equipment replacement and infrastructural development, as set out in the Defence Equipment Development Plan and the Defence Forces Built Infrastructure Programme. </p>  <p>  Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society will also receive funding from the Defence Vote in 2022.</p>  <p>  The 2022 allocation for Vote 35 (Army Pensions) is some &euro;271 million, an increase of &euro;8 million on 2021. This allocation ensures that sufficient funding is available to meet the retirement benefits of some 12,750 former members of the Defence Forces and certain dependants.</p>  <p>  I welcome the outcome of Budget 2022 and the significant funding envelope of over one billion euro provided to the Defence Sector which will enable the Defence Organisation to continue implementing its organisational priorities into 2022.

The National Cyber Security Centre in his Department is the national response authority for cyber security incidents. But, of course, response to cyber threats is a whole-of-Government challenge with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  The primary responsibility of the Defence Forces relates to the defence and security of their own networks and systems. However, as in any emergency situation, once Defence systems are supported, the Department of Defence and Defence Forces provide support to the National Cyber Security Centre. For example, during the recent cyberattack on the HSE, the Defence Forces supported the response to it including provision of operational support to the HSE and, in particular, logistical and organisational support.</p>  <p>  The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the Cyber Security of the State. This is being done in line with the Programme for Government commitment to implement the National Cyber Security Strategy, recognizing the potential and important role of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  To this end, officials from the Department of Defence and members of the Defence Forces are actively involved in implementing the National Cyber Security Strategy such as through secondment of an officer to the Cyber Security Centre of Excellence in Estonia and departmental membership of the Inter-Departmental Committee overseeing implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy. </p>  <p>  This Inter-Departmental Committee has recently been charged with the additional work of overseeing the plan to significantly expand the National Cyber Security Centre so that it can further develop its competence and capacity to help defend and protect IT systems and key services into the future.  </p>  <p>  For operational security reasons, no public comment will be made regarding Defence Forces Cyber Capability but I would note that the establishment of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins the Government's commitment to ensuring that the Defence Forces are fit for purpose, both in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030. Amongst the issues that the Commission is examining are Defence Force capabilities, structures and staffing in a number of areas. The Commission is due to submit their report by the end of the year and I look forward to receiving the report in due course. The recommendations will then be fully considered and will inform future decisions regarding the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2021-11-18a.243.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111800067#WRE01200"><p>The White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve Defence Force (RDF). A key ongoing challenge for the RDF is to recruit and retain personnel and I am aware that there continues to be a shortfall between the current strength figures and those of the establishment.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the previous PQ referred to, the regulatory establishment of the Army Reserve (AR) and Naval Service Reserve (NSR) is 4,069 personnel, as provided for in Defence Force Regulation CS4. The current effective strength is 1,504 personnel, as of 31 October 2021. The strength of the First Line Reserve at that date is 263 personnel. </p>  <p>  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a very significant impact on Defence Forces recruitment, including to the RDF and has resulted in a reduction of most collective induction processing and training activities. The pandemic resulted in the enactment of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (COVID-19) Act 2020 and the subsequent delays in Defence Forces applicant processing are now being addressed, including for RDF applicants.  </p>  <p>  The Military Authorities have advised that a revised Defence Forces framework for living with COVID -19 is in place and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. This revised framework, I understand, affords more scope for RDF training and induction within the parameters of Government guidelines. This of course, will be subject to continued guidance from Government on easing of restrictions. </p>  <p>  While the Government remains committed to restoring the strength of the RDF, given the competing recruitment demands at present, where Permanent Defence Force (PDF) recruitment is and should remain a priority, it should be noted that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both PDF and RDF recruitment. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, RDF recruitment will also be progressed to the greatest extent possible and an additional 29 new RDF members have been inducted as at the end of October this year, with 17 inducted into the AR and 12 inducted into the NSR. </p>  <p>  I also had the pleasure this week of attending a Commissioning Ceremony where a cohort of 29 officers were newly commissioned into the Army Reserve. These 29 personnel, men and women, received their commissions following their successful graduation from a Potential Officers Course.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, I understand that measures are currently under consideration by the military authorities with a view to streamlining elements of the induction process. The outcome of a pilot initiative in this regard is awaited and will further inform next steps.</p>  <p>  The Independent Commission on the Defence Forces, which as the Deputy will be aware, is due to report at the end of the year and, in line with its Terms of Reference, is expected to include proposals on the role and contribution of the RDF. I very much look forward to the Report from the Commission.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that the Defence (Amendment) Act 2021 has now been signed into law and this will serve to update the Defence Legislation on the use of the RDF on a voluntary basis, on-island and overseas in support of the PDF.  The amendments contained in the Defence (Amendment) Act do not prejudge any possible recommendations from the Commission, but will facilitate the implementation of any recommendations the Commission may make, which would, of necessity, require legislative amendments.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government appreciates the service of the RDF and recognises its important contribution to Ireland's defence capability.</p></reply>

This scheme is aimed at retaining highly trained and experienced personnel, while also incentivising sea going duties.</p><p>The Government remains fully committed to addressing pay and conditions in the Defence Forces. The Programme for Government provided for the establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces, which was established in December 2020. The terms of reference for the Commission includes an examination of the evolution of all remuneration systems and structures currently in place in the Defence Forces </p><p>On completion of the Commission's work, I will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body for the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Economic Zone. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary.</p><p>Scheduled patrol days can be impacted by a range of factors including adverse weather conditions, unscheduled maintenance as well as staffing issues.  </p><p>The table below outlines the number of cancelled Naval Service patrol days for the full year of 2019 and also up to 31 October 2021.</p><p><b>Number of Naval Service cancelled Patrol days</b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Period covered</th>       <th>Number of cancelled patrol days </th>       <th>Average patrol days cancelled per month</th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01 Jan 2019 - 31 Dec 2019</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>7.8</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01 Jan 2020 &ndash; 31 Dec 2020</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>6.7</td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>01 Jan 2021 - 31 October 2021</td>       <td>223</td>       <td>22.3</td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>The increase in cancelled patrol days in 2021 is mainly due to issues relating to COVID 19 as one of the ships, L&Eacute; Ciara could not go to sea given its inability, due to its size, to implement safely the necessary Covid 19 precautions.  There were also some unforeseen mechanical issues. In particular 47 scheduled patrol days were cancelled in 2021 due to a fire which occurred on board L&Eacute; NIAMH in late 2020.  A shortage of suitably qualified and experienced personnel during the period in question was also a factor.</p><p>Notwithstanding the mechanical and staffing challenges being experienced, I am satisfied that the Naval Service continues to carry out the roles assigned by Government.</p></reply>

The most recent public service pay agreement &lsquo;<i>Building Momentum &ndash; A New Public Service Agreement 2021 &ndash; 2022&rsquo; </i>was voted on and has been accepted by members of the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, that is RACO and PDFORRA.

In accordance with commitments given in the Programme for Government, an independent Commission on the Defence Forces was established in December 2020.  The work of Commission includes examining the evolution of all remuneration systems and structures currently in place in the Defence Forces. The Commission on the Defence Forces is due to complete its work by the end of this year.

Defence Force Regulation (DFR) A9 sets out the qualifying criteria required to be awarded such Defence Forces Medals. </p>  <p>  This Regulation also delineates the procedures for the awarding of those medals to members of the Defence Forces and requires that any recommendations for possible awards must be made in accordance with the relevant procedures. Such awards are made on the recommendation of a Military Board appointed by the Chief of Staff for the purpose of examining and reporting on every recommendation for an award.</p>  <p>  The issue of awarding of military medals to personnel who served at Jadotville has been considered on a number of occasions and most recently by the Independent Review Group (IRG), established to examine the issue of the award of military medals to personnel who served at Jadotville.  The IRG&rsquo;s report was published in full on 15 July 2021.  </p>  <p>  I have publicly welcomed the report in response to its publication last July.  The report provides a comprehensive, multidimensional and contextualised account of the Battle of Jadotville and its aftermath.   The conclusions and recommendations are based on a rigorous and objective examination of all material and evidence available.  </p>  <p>  A critical factor is to ensure that the process of awarding medals is underpinned by oversight, objectivity, accountability, and transparency. With a view therefore to maintaining the credibility and integrity of the medals awarding system, the recommendations of the Independent Review Group are being considered in that context. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, a judicial review is under way at present regarding a recommendation of the IRG report relating to the convening of a Military Board to consider the award of medals. Given that the matter is now before the Courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.</p></reply>

Such collaboration takes place at all levels of the organisation. </p>  <p>  The central forum for the management and oversight of civil and military matters is provided by the joint civil-military Strategic Management Committee, which meets on a monthly basis and provides a means by which senior civil and military managers engage in policy development.  </p>  <p>  Such integrated civil and military groups are common place within the Organisation, examples of which  include are as follows:  </p>  <p>  - The White Paper on Defence established the policy framework out to 2025 and this was developed jointly by civil-military working groups and overseen by a joint Steering Group.  A joint civil-military White Paper Implementation Facilitation Team oversee the implementation of the White Paper and all projects are being, or were undertaken by civil-military teams.  </p>  <p>  - The Strategic Human Resource Group (SHRG), comprised of senior management, coordinates the HR plans and activities of the civil and military elements of the Defence Organisation to ensure delivery.  The initial priority of the SHRG was the oversight of the 15 projects undertaken to facilitate the implementation of the Public Service Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendations on recruitment and retention.  The projects were undertaken by civil-military teams and were facilitated by a joint Programme Management Office. </p>  <p>  - The High Level Planning and Procurement Group (HLPPG), comprised of senior civil-military management, is the sanctioning authority where significant levels of expenditure is proposed on the procurement of goods and services.  The HLPPG meets as required to progress equipment procurement and infrastructural development priorities. </p>  <p>  Public Service pay policy is outside the remit of my Department, as it is determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform having regard to Public Sector Pay Agreements.  Within the Defence Organisation, matters that come within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration (C&amp;A) Scheme, such as allowances, are considered by the civil and military Conciliation and Arbitration Branches in the first instance.   </p>  <p>  I meet regularly with senior civil and military management, both jointly and separately, to be appraised of all pertinent matters relating to my Department.  As the instances of interactions outlined above illustrate, the bilateral engagement and co-operation by Defence Organisation personnel is comprehensive.   However the above are just examples of the wide range of on-going engagement that is undertaken on a daily basis to successfully address any matters that may arise.  </p></reply>

Where there are allegations of offences having been committed, investigations will be initiated by the appropriate authorities. </p>  <p>  Arising from the 2002 publication of the External Advisory Committee on the Defence Forces and the three subsequent reports from the Independent Monitoring Group (IMG), a number of reforms were implemented in the intervening years for addressing allegations of inappropriate behaviour, including harassment, sexual harassment and bullying, which are contained in policy documents and in regulation.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Diversity and Inclusion Strategy Statement and Action Plan aims to ensure that a transparent culture exists, that encourages personnel to report inappropriate behaviour, discrimination, bullying, harassment and sexual harassment.</p>  <p>  Defence Force Regulation A7, additionally provides the regulatory framework for dealing with any allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace for serving members, in both a formal and informal way through a trained Designated Contact Person (DCP) network.</p>  <p>  Within this framework, Administrative Instruction A7, Chapter 1 sets out the Defence Forces policy and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces including bullying and harassment, in order to deter unacceptable behaviour and promote a service environment based on mutual respect, equality and professionalism. </p>  <p>  Chapter 2 of Administrative Instruction A7 provides another formal mechanism for members, under Section 114 (1) and 114 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954, to seek redress of wrongs or to make a complaint. Complaints may be submitted orally or in writing to the complainants Commanding Officer, or in the case where they feel themselves wronged by their Commanding Officer, may complain to the Chief of Staff. Notifications are sent to my office and the office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces formally when any Chapter 2 complaint is submitted and of its subsequent outcome. </p>  <p>  Under this mechanism there exists further recourse for the complaint to be referred to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces for review and recommendation if appropriate. As the Deputy will be aware, the Ombudsman is entirely independent in carrying out his functions in line with the provisions of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces Act, 2004, and his final report, which may include a recommendation on each complaint, is submitted to me for determination. </p>  <p>  I am further advised that in the event that a complaint of a potentially criminal nature is reported, the standard procedure is that the matter is investigated immediately by the Military Police. Where allegations of criminal incidents among serving members are brought to the attention of the Military Police, they are traditionally passed to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their consideration and investigation, who have the lawful authority, skills and resources to investigate such matters. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, I met recently with participants from the Women of Honour Group and with a number of serving female members of the Defence Forces, where I had the opportunity to listen carefully to their experiences, in what were very informative meetings.  In addition, participants from the Women of Honour Group have met with the Secretary General and senior officials from my Department. </p>  <p>  While I have noted that there has been progress in recent years in terms of policies, systems and procedures, it is clear that the culture that is pervading, and the application of those policies, systems and procedures for dealing with bullying, harassment, discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual assault, have not, and are not serving, all Defence Forces personnel well. </p>  <p>  On foot of those meetings, I have decided to proceed with the Independent Review, to examine the effectiveness of systems, policies and procedures to deal with workplace issues relating to bullying, discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct in the Defence Forces.   The draft Terms for the Independent Review have been shared with a range of stakeholders including the Representative Associations, serving members and the Women of Honour Group.  I look forward to receiving their observations which will inform the Terms of the Review which I intend to finalise within the coming weeks.  I wish to underline also that this Review will be undertaken by external and entirely independent and unbiased experts in this field. In this regard, potential members are also under consideration.</p>  <p>  Separately, I announced last month, interim support measures for members of the Defence Forces impacted by unacceptable behaviour in the workplace. </p>  <p>  The appointment of a Confidential Contact Person (CCP) within Raisecaconcern, which has been in place since the announcement, is available to assist both serving and former members of the Defence Forces and will provide a safe place to support the reporting of alleged wrongdoing in the workplace. The confidential contact person is independent and outside of the chain of command and their role is listen to the caller, assist them in documenting their allegations, and provide guidance on follow-on options. </p>  <p>  The INSPIRE confidential helpline, which is available on a 24/7 basis for all serving members of the Defence Forces, has also been made available to anyone who has contacted the Confidential Contact Person.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Personnel Support Service (PSS) in the Defence Forces assists members and their immediate family with the provision of information and advice on areas including stress management, counselling and referral options.  </p>  <p>  As I have stated in the past however,  those who may have suffered serious wrong or a criminal nature, whether recent or historic, are urged to report their concerns to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have lawful authority, skills and resources to investigate such matters.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to reiterate my commitment and that of the Secretary General and Chief of Staff, to ensure that every member of the Defence Forces, male and female, can carry out their duties in a safe and respectful workplace based on dignity, equality and zero-tolerance for any kind of unacceptable behaviour.  </p></reply>

For example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Revenue, Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and various other Government Departments in line with Memoranda of Understanding and Service Level Agreements.  </p>  <p>  As part of the development of the 2015 White Paper on Defence, the Department engaged in a broad-ranging consultation process, including with all other Departments. At that time the Department of the Communications, Energy and Natural Resources outlined that resilience is built into the system to mitigate against any damage to submarine cables. High capacity and multiple routes provide resilience in the event of route failure.  Business Continuity Planning is of interest to all major international corporations. Where damage has occurred to a cable in the past, the operators have shared a cable while repairs are made.  Under the National Cyber Security Strategy, an updated detailed risk assessment of the vulnerability of all Critical National Infrastructure and services to cyberattack is being performed.</p>  <p>  The Defence Forces are aware of active subsea fibre optic cables landing on the island of Ireland. While these may present strategic locations for marine counter terrorism, the locations and security of these telecommunication resources does not rest with the Defence Forces. As any threat to these installations would be considered an on-island domestic security matter, the responsibility rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

The commitment to introduce legislation to underpin employees' right to request remote work was made in the national Remote Work Strategy published last January. </p>  <p>  I carried out a public consultation in April and there was significant engagement. Informed by the public consultation, which included submissions from both employer and trade union representative groups and also a review of international best practice, the drafting of the General Scheme of the Bill is at an advanced stage. I will be seeking Cabinet approval for the drafting of Heads of a Bill in December and the Bill will be progressed through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible thereafter. The intention is to introduce a mechanism for employees to request remote working that is fair but does not place an undue burden on employers. </p>  <p>  In addition, Directive 2019/1158 of the European Parliament and of the Council on work-life balance for parents and carers contains provisions in relation to flexible working arrangements. As the right to request flexible working arrangements under the Directive extends only to parents and those with caring responsibilities, the required amendments will relate to the Parental Leave Act 1998 and the Carer&rsquo;s Leave Act 2001 which are not under my policy remit. Responsibility for transposition of the Directive rests with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Roderic O'Gorman TD.</p></reply>

It is important to acknowledge that the Registrar of Companies is a statutory role and the Registrar has administrative independence in the exercise of her statutory functions. The Registrar has shown considerable flexibility throughout the COVID-19 period in relation to the arrangements for filing annual returns in recognition of the additional challenges facing companies as well as their professional advisers in meeting filing obligations. These include extending the filing deadlines in respect of annual returns due during 2020 and also earlier this year at the end of February and May, and suspending prosecutions and involuntary strike-offs for failure to file annual returns. There is limited discretion however as the Registrar cannot apply flexibility on a case-by-case basis so, when an extension to a deadline is put in place, it applies broadly.</p>  <p>  Notably, the exceptional arrangements that were put in place by the Registrar previously were in light of the circumstances prevailing at points in time where many companies were obliged to pause activity. It is the case that the level of business activity has substantially increased since then. The necessity of having a transparent and up-to-date companies register continues notwithstanding the challenges being experienced by a small number of accountancy firms. There are over 250,000 companies on the register of which approximately 25% have an annual return filing deadline of the 25th of November. The filing of annual returns by this cohort is continuing and is currently in the region of 1,500 per day. Indeed, the CRO has implemented a queueing system on the CRO IT system to manage the heavy volumes of filing between now and the deadline.</p>  <p>  I am informed the Registrar is mindful of the particular problems being raised by some small accountancy firms as well as the limitations on the Registrar in taking a case by case approach; the broad desire among the profession to not unduly delay the filing; and the need for the CRO to introduce much sought after improvements to its customer facing IT systems which an extension could delay. Therefore, the Registrar continues to keep the situation under review and is engaging with accountancy representatives to assess the situation.</p></reply>

The system is, by design, vacancy led and managed through the operation of the critical skills and ineligible occupation lists.  These lists are subject to twice yearly evidence-based review, taking account of labour market research, a public consultation and contextual issues such as Brexit and Covid 19.</p>  <p>  The Critical Skills Employment Permit is the primary permit used by the State to attract highly skilled professionals in roles that are critical to the economy.  One of the benefits for Critical Skills Employment Permit holders is they can apply for a Support Letter from this Department to present to the Department of Justice in their application for a Stamp 4 immigration permission. If an individual is successful in securing a Stamp 4 they no longer require an employment permit to be employed in the State.  Non EEA nationals are eligible to apply for their Support Letters from this Department only when they have completed a minimum of 21 months continuous employment in the State on foot of their Critical Skills Employment Permit.  Applications can be submitted up to 12 weeks before the expiry date of their permit.  </p>  <p>  In light of the uncertainties caused by the Coronavirus pandemic, if an employee was in receipt of either the Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment or the Temporary Covid-10 Wage Subsidy Scheme, this will be taken into account when assessing a Stamp 4 Support Letter application.  Supporting documentation detailing this reduced payment must be provided with all applications.</p></reply>

NBI has also advised that the first premises are connected in Cavan, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Monaghan and over 30,000 premises are available to order and pre-order across 12 counties. </p><p>In addition to the challenges to the delivery of the NBP due to the Covid-19 pandemic, NBI has faced a range of other challenges due to the sheer scale and complexity of rolling out fibre to the home in a rural environment. These include significant tree trimming to ensure cable can be placed on overhead poles, remediation of ducting that has been in place for many decades, the co-ordination of hundreds of contracting crews and addressing the many issues arising week on week which could not have been foreseen until the build crews commenced work on the ground. The Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract. This plan addresses delays experienced by NBI, primarily arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and re-baselines milestones for 2021. Work is underway to re-baseline milestones for 2022 and beyond. This has resulted in some changes to timeframes for connection for end-users.  </p><p>Given the scale and complexity of delivery of the new high speed broadband network under the NBP, I am advised that any dates provided by NBI on its website are based on the best available information at the time and may be subject to change. NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, <i>www.nbi.ie</i>, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range. </p><p>The network rollout for the National Broadband Plan is divided into 227 Deployment Areas (DAs) across the country.  These are typically an area of approximately 25km in radius and in total they cover 96% of Ireland&rsquo;s landmass. Counties are generally made up of a number of DAs which means there are differing timescales for connection across county areas. My officials raised the specific issue referred to in the Question with NBI who confirmed that the associated date for anticipated service activation was published for the first time in September 2021 and no other date(s) had previously been published for this premises. There are nearby Deployment Areas in Ballinasloe and Galway City with different activation dates but this premises does not fall within these Deployment Areas.</p><p>I appreciate people's frustration when they are living so close to a fibre network but cannot get a connection to that network in the immediate term, particularly given the heightened importance of connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. The NBP will ensure that in all such cases a future proofed high speed broadband network will be built to serve these premises and work to deliver on this is underway. </p></reply>

NIFTI is currently being revised following public consultation and it is expected that the final version of the framework will be brought to Government for approval and published before the end of this year.</p><p>NIFTI has been developed to ensure that sectoral investment in transport is aligned with the National Planning Framework and supports the delivery of the ten National Strategic Outcomes. Transport investment is essential to realising our spatial and climate change objectives, and it is therefore crucial that we have developed this strategy which is aligned with and supports Government&rsquo;s overarching policy objectives. NIFTI sits alongside other Departmental and Government policy and strategies, such as the Climate Action Plan, National Development Plan and forthcoming Sustainable Mobility Policy.</p><p>The framework establishes four investment priorities to ensure that transport investment is aligned with these overarching policy aims, and delivered in a sustainable and proportionate manner. The four priorities are:</p> <blockquote> 	1.  Decarbonisation;<br /><br />2.  Protection and Renewal;<br /><br />3.  Mobility of People and Goods in Urban Areas; and<br /><br />4.  Enhanced Regional and Rural Connectivity. </blockquote>  <p>To ensure that NIFTI supports the National Planning Framework in the most sustainable and cost-effective manner possible, it establishes modal and intervention hierarchies to supplement the Investment Priorities. The modal hierarchy will ensure that the most environmentally sustainable feasible solution to a given transport need is deployed on a given project. Project sponsors will have to consider walking and cycling before public transport, and public transport before private transport. If a solution from further down the hierarchy is proposed, project sponsors will have to justify why a more environmentally sustainable solution is not suitable for the problem at hand.</p><p>Similarly, the intervention hierarchy will require project sponsors to first consider maintenance and then optimisation of existing assets. Only when these more conservative solutions have been demonstrated to be unsuitable will significant improvement of existing infrastructure or outright new infrastructure be considered.</p><p>The hierarchies are not rigid tools. Their role is to ensure that for a given transport need or problem the most appropriate solution is deployed, but investment will remain principles-based and objectives-led. Where project sponsors can demonstrate that solutions from higher on either hierarchy are infeasible solutions to meet the objectives of a given investment, it follows that solutions from further down the hierarchy will be considered.</p></reply>

This will set out a strategic framework for walking, cycling and public transport to support Ireland&rsquo;s overall requirement to achieve a 51% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of this decade.  The new framework will replace the existing sectoral policy documents from 2009 - <i>Smarter Travel, A Sustainable Transport Future 2009-2020 </i>and the <i>National Cycle Policy Framework.</i></p><p>A collaborative approach has been taken in developing the new framework.  A stakeholder engagement event was held at the end of 2019 alongside the publication of a comprehensive range of background papers for public consultation.  Over 250 submissions were received as part of the public consultation process from individuals and organisations.  Following a review of those submissions, a report of the public consultation was published on my Department's website and further bilateral stakeholder engagement has taken place.  </p><p>Transport trends such as those identified in the Central Statistics Office's <i>National Travel Survey (NTS) </i>have been considered in the development of the new framework including data relating to user demographics, journeys taken, reasons for travel and chosen transport mode.  The 2019 <i>NTS </i>also highlighted geographic variations in transport trends which shows that transport needs are not uniform across the country and tailored solutions will be needed for both urban and rural areas.</p><p>I hope to publish the <i>Sustainable Mobility Policy Framework </i>shortly.  It will set out a comprehensive set of actions to increase active travel provision and improve public transport capacity and services across the country in order to make sustainable modes the preferred choice for as many people as possible.  It is also important to consider the role that newer forms of mobility such as e-scooters can play in reducing reliance on the private car.  The Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021, which is currently at Second Stage in this House, contains measure to give the Minister the power to make regulations to legalise the use of e-scooters on public roads. The regulations will determine conditions for their use and technical standards.  </p></reply>

The annual rate of HICP inflation rose to 5.1 per cent in October &ndash; the highest rate since 2003. The emergence of inflationary pressures is not unique to Ireland however, with inflation rates of 6.2 and 4.1 per cent recorded in the US and euro area respectively in October. </p>  <p>  The recent rise in inflation is partly explained by temporary factors, which are expected to fade over time, including &lsquo;base effects&rsquo; associated with the &lsquo;normalisation&rsquo; of oil prices following their collapse last spring and the imbalance between supply and demand that emerged following re-opening. This has been compounded by global supply chain disruptions, including transport bottlenecks, input shortages (e.g. semi-conductors) and labour supply shortages in some sectors. More recently, increases in wholesale energy prices have put additional upward pressure on prices, with energy inflation of 24 per cent recorded in October. </p>  <p>  Looking ahead, the most likely scenario is that inflation will moderate over time as temporary factors fade, demand stabilises and supply pressures ease. The Department is forecasting inflation of 2&frac14; per cent this year and next. Notwithstanding the strong pick-up in the rate of inflation in recent months, the rate for 2021 as a whole is likely to be close to the Department&rsquo;s projection. However, the recent spike in wholesale energy prices means that there could already be some upside to the projection for next year. Indeed, the upside scenario published alongside the Budget, which incorporated these price rises and other factors, would suggest that an inflation rate between 2&frac12; to 3 per cent for 2022 is now increasingly likely. </p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of inflationary pressures and introduced a range of measures in Budget 2022 to protect households against increases in the cost of living, including a personal income tax package worth &euro;520m and a social welfare package of over &euro;550m. The fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 per week to compensate lower income households for the additional energy costs they are likely to incur due to an increase in the carbon tax. There were also increases in the allocation of Early Learning Care and School-Age Childcare to ensure childcare prices do not rise. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the Government is pursuing a broadly neutral budgetary policy in order to contain domestic inflationary pressures.  It is crucial that we do not have an inflation &lsquo;chain reaction&rsquo; which would damage our international cost competitiveness.</p></reply>

It is recognised that effective taxation of capital is an important tool for addressing income and wealth inequality. Therefore, gift and inheritance taxes, including the efficient use of relief thresholds, are fundamental elements of using our tax code to help create a fairer society.  </p>  <p>  There have been many increases to the CAT thresholds in recent years. The Group A threshold was raised from &euro;225,000 to &euro;280,000 in Budget 2016, to &euro;310,000 in 2017, to &euro;320,000 in Budget 2019 with a further rise to &euro;335,000 in Budget 2020. </p>  <p>  The Group B threshold rose from &euro;30,150 to &euro;32,500 in Budget 2017 and the Group C threshold rose from &euro;15,075 to &euro;16,250 in Budget 2017.</p>  <p>  You will appreciate that there would be a significant cost in making further substantial changes to the Group A, Group B and Group C thresholds. For example, recent Revenue estimates indicate that the cost of increasing the CAT A threshold from its current &euro;335,000 to &euro;400,000 would be &euro;35 million, the   estimated cost of increasing the CAT B threshold from its current &euro;32,500 to &euro;35,000 would be &euro;6 million, and the estimated cost of increasing the CAT C threshold from its current &euro;16,250 to &euro;19,000 would be &euro;3 million.  </p>  <p>  The options available for providing increases to CAT thresholds need to be considered in the context of available resources and must be balanced against competing demands. </p>  <p>  At the moment, I do not believe that a compelling case can be made for increases to the CAT thresholds. Therefore, I have no plans to increase the category A, B or C Group CAT thresholds.</p></reply>

This exemption shall be granted where it can be shown to the satisfaction of Revenue that such income is applied solely for those purposes. </p>  <p>  - Section 847A TCA provides for a scheme of tax relief for donations to certain sports bodies for the funding of capital projects to be approved by the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sports and Media. Bodies which apply for approval must submit both a valid tax clearance certificate and sports exemption certificate in support of this application. </p>  <p>  A sporting body which has been granted an exemption from Income Tax and Corporation Tax under section 235 TCA, may also be exempt from other duties and taxes:</p>  <p>  - Section 172C TCA provides that sporting bodies with an Income Tax or Corporation Tax exemption are exempt from Dividend Withholding Tax.</p>  <p>  - Section 610A(1) TCA provides that a capital gain accruing to an approved sporting body will be exempt from Capital Gains Tax to the extent that the disposal proceeds are used for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports. In the case of disposals on or after 1 January 2005, if the proceeds (or a portion thereof) are donated to a sporting body and the donation is approved by the Minister for Finance then the gain will be  exempt from Capital Gains Tax in proportion to the amount that has been so  donated (section 610A(2) TCA).  In general, the proceeds of the disposal must be spent within five years of their receipt.</p>  <p>  - Transfers (purchases and gifts) and leases of land to approved sporting bodies are also exempt from Stamp Duty under section 82(b) of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, provided the land is used solely for sports purposes.</p>  <p>  There is no general exemption from VAT for a sporting body.  For VAT purposes, member-owned sports clubs are not regarded as operating in the course of business in respect of their core sporting activities. However, they are liable to VAT on bar and restaurant sales if their turnover from those activities is over the registration threshold for the supply of services (currently &euro;37,500 per annum where the body supplies services only).</p>  <p>  The deposit income of a sporting body is also not exempt from Deposit Interest Retention Tax.</p>  <p>  A full list of bodies granted tax exemption under section 235 TCA is available on the Revenue website. </p>  <p>  Whilst the various exemptions and reliefs are kept under review by my department, I have no plans at present to expand them. </p>  <p>   </p></reply>

This particular scenario is used to inform my Department&rsquo;s projections as it identifies non-ETS (EU Emissions Trading System) emissions. These emissions are reflective of emissions subject to the carbon tax, while in general EU ETS emissions are not subject to the carbon tax.

The Expert Group includes medical personnel from a range of sporting organisations, and it is in this context that Sport Ireland receives expert medical opinion to ensure a safe return to Sport.</p><p>At its meeting on 19 October 2021, and following consideration of the public health advice, Government agreed that additional aspects of society could reopen only with the full range of protective measures in place. As such, current restrictions under the Government&rsquo;s plan state that organisers of indoor and outdoor group activities should ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place. For indoor sports, this means:  </p><p>- The use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (vaccine or recovery certificate) will be required for accessing indoor sporting activities and events. </p><p>- Where individuals have mixed immunity status, pods of up to 6 participants will be permitted (excluding adult coaches/instructors). </p><p>- Multiple pods will be permissible subject to protective measures. </p><p>- The overall number of pods will have regard to the size of venue and there should be substantial social distance between individual pods. </p><p>- For Vaccinated individuals no fixed capacity limits apply to these activities. </p><p>- Vaccinated spectators attending indoor sporting events should be fully seated.</p><p>The Government's decision on 5th November to widen the range of sporting opportunities for young people, so as to enable under 18 indoor sports games and competitions in sports such as basketball to go ahead, responds to the widely expressed viewpoint from parents in particular about the important physical and mental wellbeing benefits of such sport to young people. The decision also recognises that children under the age of 12 are not currently eligible for vaccination, in contrast to other age cohorts in the population.  </p><p>Updated guidance has been provided by Sport Ireland to sporting organisations to allow children under 18 years of age to participate in indoor games and competition activities according to the ordinary rules and limits of the sport concerned and subject to the implementation of various mitigation measures.  The full guidance can be accessed on the Sport Ireland website at:</p><p><i>www.sportireland.ie/covid19/return-to-sport-and-physical-activity</i></p></reply>

The making of valuations for rating purposes and decisions in relation to exemptions is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Acts 2001 to 2020 provide that all buildings used or developed for any purpose are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Acts. However, Paragraphs 4, 4A and 4B of Schedule 4 provide for certain exemptions for property directly occupied for sporting purposes.</p>  <p>  Land developed for sport, such as a playing pitch, has a long standing exemption from rateability. Paragraphs 4A and 4B of Schedule 4, added by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides for the exemption of property used exclusively for community sport and otherwise than for profit.</p>  <p>  As a result of the changes made by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, it is normally property registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904 and used for the sale and consumption of alcohol and property used to generate other commercial type income that is rateable. Income from membership fees and income from community organisations and participants in community sport using buildings does not result in a property occupied by a sports club and used for community sport purposes being deemed rateable.</p>  <p>  I recognise the positive contribution made by sport&rsquo;s clubs in their community and on the whole, much property occupied by sports clubs is exempt from commercial rates.</p>  <p>  The Valuation Acts are very specific about the range of exemptions that can be applied by the Commissioner.  Where a property occupier is unsure as to the position of their property being rateable or exempt, they should contact the Valuation Office by e-mail at valuationservices@valoff.ie.</p>  <p>  There are a number of avenues of redress for an occupier of rateable property who is dissatisfied with a determination of valuation made under the provisions of the Valuation Acts. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation.  Later in the process, if the occupier is still dissatisfied with the determination, there is a right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal which is an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office.  There is also a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.</p></reply>

All commercial events, including professional photography, wedding, promotional, fashion etc. is subject to a permit system. This has been the case for quite some time.</p>  <p>  A permit has long been required for both insurance and indemnification purposes.

The modernisation includes the introduction of rolling registration; the simplification of forms and processes; the gradual roll-out of an online option for registration; a single, national database within which Local Authorities would continue to maintain their own registers; and the use of PPSNs in the registration process. Together, these reforms will simplify and streamline the process of registration, making it easier for people to register to vote and update their details.  </p><p>The Electoral Reform Bill, which provides for the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission and the regulation of online political advertising also provides the legislative underpinning for the reform of the electoral registration process.  The Bill was the subject of thorough pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Committee's report was published in August. </p><p>My Department is working with the Office of the Attorney General on the drafting of the Bill and good progress is being made.  </p></reply>

With very limited exemptions, these apply to all private rented accommodation. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority.</p><p>If an inspection identifies that a property has been found to be non-compliant with the regulations, it is a matter for the Local Authority to determine what action is necessary and appropriate, including the issuing of an Improvement Letter, Improvement Notice, Prohibition Notice or further legal recourse.</p><p>To aid increased inspections of properties and ensure greater compliance with the Regulations, increased Exchequer funding has been made available to local authorities each year since 2018 to enable them to build inspection capacity incrementally, with payments based on the number of inspections undertaken. Significant progress was made across the sector. The number of inspections more than doubled from 19,645 in 2017 to 40,728 in 2019. A total of &euro;6 million in Exchequer funding was made available to local authorities in 2020 and this was increased to &euro;10 million this year.</p><p>However, given the need for inspectors to enter tenants&rsquo; homes, pandemic restrictions have greatly impacted on inspection activity since March 2020. The number of inspections undertaken last year fell to 25,703.</p><p>In response to the restrictions some local authorities, including Kildare County Council, have piloted virtual inspections. While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. I support these initiatives and my Department has provided Exchequer funding to local authorities participating in the pilot projects.</p><p>The lifting of pandemic restrictions has permitted the resumption of on-site inspections since 14 July 2021.</p><p>The number of private rental inspections undertaken by Kildare County Council in the years; 2019, 2020 and to Q3 2021 is set out in the table below: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year </th>       <th>Physicalon-site Rental Inspections Carried Out </th>       <th>VirtualRental Inspections Carried Out </th>       <th>TotalRental Inspections Carried Out</th>       <th>ImprovementLetters  Issued </th>       <th>Improvement Notices Served </th>       <th>Prohibition Notices Served </th>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 </td>       <td>1,261 </td>       <td>- </td>       <td>1,261  </td>       <td>1,125</td>       <td>38 </td>       <td>13 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 </td>       <td>638 </td>       <td>49 </td>       <td>687 </td>       <td>515</td>       <td>34 </td>       <td>9 </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 to Q3 </td>       <td>160 </td>       <td>68 </td>       <td>228 </td>       <td>136</td>       <td>13 </td>       <td>2 <br /><br /></td>    </tr> </table> </p><p>It should be noted that in terms of enforcement local authorities will typically try to work in partnership with landlords to ensure that any non-compliances are corrected. This is can be done outside of the more formal Improvement Letter/Notice system. </p><p>Annual data in respect of the level of inspections carried out by each local authority is available on my Department's website at:</p></reply>

Ireland formally wrote to the European Commission on 13th October 2021 requesting a renewal of the derogation. </p><p>The purpose of the derogation is to provide for higher stocking densities on certain farms, on application, subject to more stringent environmental requirements and enhanced enforcement and inspection programmes. Any derogation decision proposed by the Commission is based on measures that build on the protection levels provided in the national Nitrates Action Programme</p><p>As part of the preparation of the next Nitrates Action Programme my Department recently conducted a public consultation process. This followed on from an initial public consultation which was held in late 2020.</p><p>Officials from my Department, along with colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are still in discussions with the Commission on the review of Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme, and this process incorporates negotiations on the renewal of Ireland&rsquo;s derogation. Both the Nitrates Action Programme and the derogation are complementary control mechanisms and it is prudent to engage with the Commission on the derogation before the Nitrates Action Programme is finalised to ensure the measures in the derogation are robust and effective in providing enhanced environmental protection.</p><p>The letter of 13th October requesting a renewal of Ireland&rsquo;s derogation is attached for the Deputy's information. Due to the confidential nature of the ongoing negotiations with the European Commission, I am unable to make available the supporting documentation at this time. However, once the negotiation process has fully concluded I can again consider the Deputy&rsquo;s request.</p><p>/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2021-11-18_pq188-18-11_en.pdf>Derogation</p></reply>

The progression of these works will be a matter for Irish Water and its water quality regulator, the EPA.</p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2022, I secured funding of over &euro;1.57 billion to support water services.

It is a matter for each local authority to determine the most appropriate use of the legislation within their respective functional areas.</p><p>My Department has been in contact with Tipperary County Council in this regard. It has reported that it applies the Derelict Site levies on properties that are included on the Derelict Site Register and located in prescribed areas, which involves, inter alia, the following steps:</p><p>-  Each Financial year a levy demand is issued to registered property owners in January / February. </p><p>-  If payment is not received, a reminder letter is issued.</p><p>-  If levies still remain unpaid, interest is charged and recorded within the Council's financial management system, as allowed for in Section 23 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990. </p><p>-  Staff have ongoing engagement with property owners (including levied property owners) to try to recover levies and get properties remediated and removed from the Derelict Sites Register. </p><p>-  Difficulties in collecting levies can stem from ownership/probate issues, which can take time to resolve, and from hardship cases, for which a provision to suspend the levy is included in section 26 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990.</p><p>My Department intends to engage with local authorities in order to ensure more proactive and effective enforcement of the provisions of the legislation, and is keeping the legislative provisions under review.</p></reply>

Progress on its implementation is crucial, for families and victims and for society as a whole. It was agreed in 2014 by both Governments and the political parties after intensive negotiations, and it should be implemented.  </p>  <p>  Where the British Government propose significant changes to the Stormont House framework, these must be discussed and agreed by both Governments and the parties to the Northern Ireland Executive. Only through a collective approach can we hope to deal with these issues comprehensively and fairly and in a way that responds to the needs of victims, survivors and society.  </p>  <p>  Following a meeting of the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 24 June, we agreed to begin an intensive process of engagement with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties to find an agreed way forward. Discussions began in July and since then, officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs have met a broad range of stakeholders. Importantly, this process has engaged fully with victims&rsquo; representatives. The intention is to find an agreed way forward that will allow implementing legislation to be introduced in both the UK and Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The proposals published by the British Government on 14 July for a &lsquo;Statute of Limitations&rsquo;, ending criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to Troubles-related incidents, as well as inquests and civil litigation, have caused significant upset, shock and concern. They represent a very radical departure from the Stormont House Agreement and we do not accept them as the basis of a way forward. It is important to say that there has been a clear message from victims groups throughout this process that this cannot be the way forward. It has also been strongly and publicly opposed by all the parties.</p>  <p>  I have engaged regularly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Brandon Lewis, who is leading for the British Government on these proposals, including a meeting in person on 3 September in relation to the ongoing legacy engagement process. I also met with the Minister for Justice in Northern Ireland, Naomi Long, on 16 September during which legacy, amongst other issues, was discussed.</p>  <p>  It is the position of the Government that there should be effective investigations into all Troubles-related deaths, regardless of the perpetrator. The rule of law and the protections afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights must apply equally to everyone and must be upheld, and this principle is at the core of the Stormont House framework.</p>  <p>  We have strongly communicated our position on this issue to the British Government and will continue to do so, and to caution in the clearest terms against any unilateral action. The Government will continue to engage and work with the British Government and the parties represented on the Northern Ireland Executive on this very important issue in the period immediately ahead.</p></reply>

Currently, 75 officers are responding to customer queries by phone and webchat as well as with enquiries related to Emergency Passport cases. </p>  <p>  Since June, Customer Service officers have responded to 130,000 queries from customers. In October, the Customer Service Hub handled 27,000 enquiries from customers. The Passport Service very much regrets that on days of very high volume of passport queries, people have had difficulty contacting them. As a result, my Department is actively working to recruit and assign additional staff to improve our service and meet current and expected demand.</p>  <p>  The Emergency Passport service is available free of charge in cases of medical emergency or death of a family member abroad. Proof of emergency is required to avail of this service. In cases of genuine and documented emergency, every effort is made to assist the applicant. In October alone 4,600 Emergency Passport cases were handled by the Customer Service Team. </p>  <p>  Additionally, the Passport Offices in Mount St, Dublin 2 and in Cork now offer an Urgent Appointment Service for the renewal of passports. The Urgent Appointment Service ensures that, for those who unexpectedly require a very urgent turnaround of a passport renewal, there is an option available that is transparent, predictable and clear. It means that an applicant can book and pay for their appointment, safe in the knowledge that they will have their passport within a day, or a few days. To avail of the Urgent Appointment Service for Passport Renewal, applicants must first book an appointment to attend the public office in Dublin or Cork through the Department of Foreign Affairs website (www.dfa.ie/passports). Over 800 urgent appointments have been facilitated since the Passport Service launched this service on 27th September 2021.</p>  <p>  Passport Service operations were severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as were many Government services. Despite the consequences of the pandemic, the Passport Service has issued over half a million passports to date in 2021 and 45% of simple adult renewals issue within one business day. </p>  <p>  My Department attaches the highest priority to ensuring that the Passport Service is resourced to respond to current and anticipated high demand for passports. My Department is actively working with the Public Appointments Service to recruit and assign additional permanent and temporary staff between now and the end of January 2022, bringing total staff numbers to 920 and effectively doubling the number of staff at the Passport Service.  I am confident that these additional resources will help to improve customer experience and reduce turnaround times. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is working with relevant divisions within my Department to ensure the health and safety of all staff is prioritised alongside the business need to serve our citizens. Plans are at finalisation stage thanks to excellent co-operation from the Office of Public Works to ensure that additional staff will be accommodated to meet the anticipated unprecedented demand for passports in 2022.  </p>  <p>  The Passport Service continually examines how to improve processing times and engagement with applicants. Preparation is currently underway for several system and service improvements that will enhance the customer service experience and will improve processing times. These improvements will be rolled out in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  The current passport processing times are:</p>  <p>  - 10 working days for Simple Adult online renewals</p>  <p>  - 15 working days for Complex or child online renewals</p>  <p>  - 40 working days for First Time Applications on Passport Online</p>  <p>  - 8 weeks for An Post&rsquo;s mail-in &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service</p>  <p>  The aforementioned passport processing times are based on current average application turnaround times and relate to passport applications submitted to the Passport Service with required supporting documentation. When passport applicants do not provided all of the requisite documentation to the Passport Service, it takes much longer to process the application and issue a passport.</p>  <p>  Currently, there are 108,000 passport applications on hand at the Passport Service. Of the online applications on hand, 34,000 or 35% of applications are incomplete and the onus is on the applicant to submit the required documents to the Service. The Passport Service contacts applicants who have not submitted the requisite documentation. However, the Passport Service must wait in those 34,000 cases until the applicants submit the outstanding documentation that is required. While the Passport Service makes every effort to contact applicants in such circumstances, their experience is that many applicants take weeks and sometimes months to send in the necessary documents. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service is attaching particular priority to the nearly 7% of online applications which have not been issued on or before estimated issue date which was indicated to the applicant. Intensive work is underway to eliminate this problem and these delays are regretted very much by the Service.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service is currently experiencing a high demand for first time passports. Out of a total of 108,000 passport applications currently on hand with the Passport Service, 70,000 or 64% of these are first time applications.</p>  <p>  These first time applications are necessarily complex to process, since they are essentially applications for Irish citizenship. The Passport Service must validate the true identity of the applicant and take measures to confirm the applicant&rsquo;s entitlement to Irish citizenship. It is the statutory responsibility of the Passport Service to protect the integrity of the Irish passport. Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of applicants. </p>  <p>  In the case of first time passport applications for children, the consent of guardians must also be thoroughly validated. Due to the intensive analysis underpinning first time online passport applications processing time is 40 working days.</p>  <p>  In the context of the National Development Plan, my Department is making a major investment in the future of the Passport Service.  Over the next couple of years, we will replace the core technology underpinning the service, which will deliver efficiencies and a more resilient passport system.  Budget 2022 also included an investment of an additional &euro;10m in passport services in response to the increasing demand for passports both at home and abroad.</p>  <p>  I urge citizens to check the validity of their passports before booking travel and to ensure that they apply in plenty of time. In the case of people planning to travel in 2022, whose passports are already out of date or who have children who are first-time applicants, I would encourage them to apply now online.</p>  <p>  Passport Online can be accessed by all first time applicants, irrespective of age both children and adults, in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the USA. All Irish citizens, including children, can use the online system to renew their passports from anywhere in the world.</p></reply>

To recall, the Protocol is the joint EU-UK solution to mitigate against the disruption Brexit causes for citizens and businesses on the island of Ireland. It is an integral part of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement and the result of over four years of difficult negotiation. It was designed and agreed by the UK and the EU to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement and gains of the peace process, and to protect the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. </p><p>Discussions between the EU and the UK on the Protocol, including between UK Minister David Frost and Commission Vice President Maros &Scaron;efcovic, are ongoing. Our aim is to see a positive outcome to these discussions.</p><p>I am in regular and ongoing contact with political leaders and representatives of business and civil society in Northern Ireland in relation to the implementation of the Protocol. Last week, the Taoiseach also had a series of calls with the leaders of the Northern Ireland political parties, to discuss the current situation regarding talks on the Protocol. He highlighted the EU&rsquo;s commitment to addressing genuine implementation issues around the Protocol and emphasised that the ongoing talks between the EU and the UK should be given every chance to succeed. </p><p>Support for the Commission package and minimising disruption remains strong in Northern Ireland, particularly among the business community. Recent polling on attitudes to the Protocol in Northern Ireland show that a majority of people view the Protocol as a good thing for Northern Ireland and that people, across communities, support &ldquo;ongoing solution seeking&rdquo; and a pragmatic approach. I am also very aware of stakeholders&rsquo; views on opportunities that the Protocol offers for Northern Ireland, giving them access to both the UK as well as the EU internal markets. Realising the opportunities presented by the Protocol, as our economies build back from the impact of COVID-19, should be the focus of our energy at this time. </p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s recent proposals address concerns raised by unionists, including significantly reducing checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and giving Northern Ireland a greater say in how the Protocol is implemented. It is also important to reiterate that the Protocol recognises the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. </p><p>I have met with Minister Frost on a number of occasions in recent months, most recently in September, at the meeting of the British Irish Association in Oxford. I have also discussed the Protocol in meetings with other UK ministers, including with Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss on 13 October and the Minister for Europe and Americas at the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Development Office, Wendy Morton, on 1 October. Other Ministers have also regularly raised the Protocol with UK counterparts in recent contacts.</p><p>In all contacts with relevant stakeholders, I have emphasised the importance of using the EU-UK framework for issues related to the Protocol and of finding a solution that works for the people of Northern Ireland. We are impressing on them that invoking Article 16 would have far-reaching implications for the EU-UK relationship and for our bilateral relationship. The European Commission has acted in good faith. A good faith response is required from the British Government.</p><p>I am of course also in regular contact with Vice President &Scaron;efcovic, with our partners across the EU, and the US Administration and members of Congress, all of whom remain committed to protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process. The Protocol is the agreed way to do this and I believe strongly that the Protocol will work, if we allow it to with flexibility and pragmatism.</p></reply>

The Withdrawal Agreement, including the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland, and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement agreed by the EU and the UK mitigate many of the potential political and economic issues that might have arisen as a result of Brexit. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for tariff-free, quota-free trade in goods and for sectoral cooperation in a number of important areas.  </p>  <p>  The Protocol is the agreed solution to mitigate the disruption caused by Brexit for the island of Ireland. It safeguards the Good Friday Agreement, ensures there is no hard border on the island of Ireland and also protects the EU single market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. </p>  <p>  On 13 October, the Commission announced a package of far-reaching proposals aimed at addressing the practical, genuine issues raised by businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland. Discussions continue between the EU and the UK. Ireland wants these discussions to succeed and is fully supportive of the Commission&rsquo;s approach.</p>  <p>  The Government undertook an intensive effort across departments and agencies to mitigate the disruption caused by Brexit. This included the development of two Brexit Omnibus Acts; three Brexit Action Plans; substantial investment in the State&rsquo;s infrastructure and IT systems (including provision for 1,500 additional staff to support new checks and controls); and the provision of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses. Throughout the Brexit process, our readiness work was always underpinned by a strong communications and outreach programme.</p>  <p>  However, no Government mitigation programme can address all of the challenges of Brexit.  Even with the Withdrawal Agreement and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement in place, the seamless trade in goods with Great Britain has ceased due to the UK Government&rsquo;s decision to leave the Customs Union and Single Market.</p>  <p>  The Government keeps the outworking of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement under ongoing review and, as we have done throughout the Brexit process, we will remain fully engaged with stakeholders and support businesses as they continue to navigate the Brexit challenges. A range of financial, upskilling and advisory supports for impacted sectors and businesses remain available.  In particular, the Government is currently assisting traders in their preparations for the introduction of further UK import controls on 1 January and 1 July 2022.</p></reply>

We took swift action and agreed to broaden the listings criteria for sanctions on the Belarusian regime.</p>  <p>  This broader listing will target individuals and entities organising or contributing to activities by the Lukashenko regime that facilitate illegal crossing of the EU's external borders. </p>  <p>  Ireland also supports EU outreach to countries of origin to stem the flow of migrants to Belarus, by communicating the considerable risks and dangers associated with facilitating irregular migration. I am hopeful that in the coming weeks the EU's continuing engagement will result in a diminishing flow of migrants to Belarus.</p>  <p>  While the current humanitarian crisis has been orchestrated by the Belarusian regime, it is important that EU Member States respect and uphold the right to international protection in line with obligations under the Geneva Conventions. Ireland has expressed its support for the deployment of experts from Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, to the border region. International organisations, aid workers and independent monitors and journalists should be allowed to access both sides of the border, in our view.</p>  <p>  Ireland has repeatedly demonstrated our solidarity with Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, and with those trapped at the border. Just three weeks ago, Minister of State Byrne visited the Lithuanian-Belarussian border, accompanied by members of the Lithuanian Government. As part of that visit, he viewed some migrant camps that have been established by the Lithuanian Government, met with the Lithuanian Border Guards and also with the Lithuanian Red Cross, which, this year, has received a contribution of &euro;100,000 from Irish Aid to help provide relief to the migrants.</p>  <p>  At the request of Ireland, France and Estonia, the three EU members of the UN Security Council, the Council held an AOB discussion on Belarus on 11 November, focused on the ongoing migration issue there. Ireland expressed concern about the deteriorating situation at the EU-Belarus border, condemned the instrumentalisation of migrants for political purposes by the Belarusian authorities, and highlighted the need to prevent a humanitarian crisis unfolding. The EU members of the Council, joined by Norway, the UK, and the US, as well as incoming Council member Albania, held a press stakeout after the meeting, stressing that all actions must be guided by fundamental values, especially regarding the protection of migrants&rsquo; human rights.  </p></reply>

As well as bilaterally through our mission network, Ireland contributes strongly to United Nations and European Union efforts to eliminate human rights violations and abuses. The rights of women and children are central to our engagement, especially in conflict zones where risks of child recruitment or trafficking in persons are particularly prevalent. At the UN Security Council this month alone, Ireland highlighted human rights concerns in discussions on, inter alia, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen. </p>  <p>  Conflict remains the most significant driver of humanitarian crises, while the number and complexity of these crises globally continues to increase. Each conflict is unique in its character, scale and complexity, and as such cannot be ranked by any single set of criteria of severity.</p>  <p>  The particular human rights violations and abuses encountered by women and children, including sexual and gender-based violence, crosscuts all of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement on both conflict and human rights.  In addition to co-chairing the UN Security Council&rsquo;s Informal Expert Group on Women, Peace and Security, Ireland is an active member of the UN Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict. During our Presidency of the Security Council in September, we set a record in respect of the number of women civil society participants that we invited to brief the Council.  </p>  <p>Ireland is currently actively engaged in the Third Committee session of the 76th   session of the UN General Assembly, which is addressing a range of social, humanitarian affairs and human rights issues including gender equality and the rights of the child. We have delivered a series of statements, including on trafficking in persons, the rights of persons with disabilities, the right to freedom of expression and opinion, and the situation of human rights defenders; as well as in relation to specific country situations including Myanmar, Belarus and the occupied Palestinian Territories.  Ireland co-sponsored a significant number of resolutions, including in relation to the human rights situations in Syria, Iran, DPRK and Myanmar, and joined joint statements in relation to the human rights of LGBTI+ persons and the human rights situation in Xinjiang. We are active at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) and, at the most recent session, made national statements on a broad range of issues, including violence against women and children&rsquo;s rights.  Ireland also co-sponsored several resolutions including a resolution on child, early and forced marriage in times of crisis (including the COVID-19 pandemic). In the context of increased authoritarian restrictions globally, Ireland will also join a Joint Statement supporting the right to peaceful protest. </p>  <p>  At EU level, Ireland is an active participant and contributor to the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, which works globally to support the preservation of peace, the prevention of conflicts and the strengthening of international security. Human Rights issues are frequently discussed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  Most recently, on Monday, 15 November, in a discussion on Ethiopia at the FAC, I repeated my concerns in relation to the human rights situation, urging a strong EU response. Ireland strongly support the EU&rsquo;s Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime, which strengthens the EU&rsquo;s ability to take collective action against perpetrators of human rights violations. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is a priority for Ireland that there is accountability for human rights violations, including for the heinous crimes of genocide and ethnic cleansing. A strong international criminal justice system is central to fighting impunity. While states bear the primary responsibility to investigate the most serious international crimes, including war crimes and genocide, Ireland regards the International Criminal Court as the cornerstone of such a system. We are a consistent and strong supporter of the Court. </p>  <p>  In respect of peacekeeping, Ireland also has a long tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions and has more than 550 personnel in United Nations mandated missions overseas.  </p></reply>

Ireland is a regular contributor to the DREF and contributed &euro;1 million to this fund in 2021.</p>  <p>  The International Federation of the Red Cross is the world's largest humanitarian organisation, comprising 192 Red Cross and Red Crescent member societies, and reaches 150 million people annually through 17 million volunteers, members and staff. The Federation coordinates relief operations to assist victims of disasters, and combines this with development work to strengthen the capacities of its member National Societies. In 2020 Irish Aid provided &euro;3.4m in funding to the IFRC in core funding and in response to humanitarian crises and emergencies.</p></reply>

Ireland supports EU, UN and other international efforts to reduce their influence, and to prevent their attacks, especially against civilians, and humanitarian workers and facilities. </p><p>Through the Irish Aid programme and as an EU Member State, my Department is helping address the poverty, hunger and exclusion which can generate support for these groups, as well as responding to humanitarian need in regions affected by conflict.  This includes &euro;27 million in Irish Aid humanitarian funding to the Lake Chad region since 2015.  Irish Aid also supports those displaced by conflict in northeast Nigeria, where the numbers in need of humanitarian assistance and protection are at the highest levels recorded.</p><p>Through the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS) and the UN Peacebuilding Commission, the United Nations is helping stabilise the situation in the Lake Chad region. Ireland is penholder, together with Niger, on the UNOWAS file at the UN Security Council. In its Presidential Statement on the consolidation of peace in West Africa, of 17 August 2021, the UN Security Council strongly condemned continued attacks against civilians in the region, as well as attacks and the threats of attacks against schools, children, and educational personnel, including with regard to recent abductions in Nigeria.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the International Support Group for the Regional Stabilisation Strategy for the Lake Chad Basin<i>,</i>and observer status at the Sahel Alliance, allows us to work with others to coordinate our support to Boko Haram-affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin.  </p><p>Since 2012, Ireland has provided over &euro;56.6 million in humanitarian assistance to Somalia, including to communities displaced by conflict in Al Shabaab-held areas. The UN-mandated, African Union-led peacekeeping mission in Somalia, AMISOM, supports the Federal Government of Somalia in its efforts against Al-Shabaab. </p><p>Ireland is Chair of the Somalia Sanctions Committee at the UN Security Council. That Committee oversees an arms embargo and the use of other tools to encourage a more peaceful and secure Somalia. This complements Ireland&rsquo;s role as an EU Member State supporting Somalia, including the strengthening of its government institutions. </p><p>The EU has three missions in the Horn of Africa. A number of Irish nationals are deployed to the civilian mission EUCAP Somalia, including the current Head of Mission, and one expert is deployed to the civilian mission EUCAP Sahel Niger.  Twenty Irish Permanent Defence Forces personnel participate in EUTM Mali, and a further fourteen are deployed to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these missions allows us to contribute to peace and security, help protect human rights, and put in place conditions for sustainable development.</p></reply>

A Better World, Ireland's international development policy, emphasizes this approach throughout. The policy confirms Ireland's emphasis on the key sectors that affect the poorest most, such as education, health, and food, and a commitment to ensuring gender equality and climate action is addressed. A Better World also commits to the overarching objective of reaching those that are furthest behind first in all our work.</p>  <p>  Our ability to follow-through on these commitments in practice is evident in, for example, the high proportion of Irish Aid funding which targets least developed and low income countries. Where the average DAC member's bilateral allocation to these countries is just under one quarter, half of Irish ODA is bilateral aid to low income and least developed countries. Irish ODA also places a strong emphasis on fragile contexts. </p>  <p>  Our commitment to, and ability to deliver on, a needs-based allocation of development assistance is also internationally recognised. In 2020, the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) highlighted Ireland as "an excellent humanitarian partner", with its funding models a "useful inspiration for other DAC donors". On average, around 20% of the Irish Aid budget each year is spent on humanitarian response. </p>  <p>  Last year, the respected international think-tank ODI assessed the characteristics of ODA expenditure in leading donors and found Ireland to be the most principled donor, noting specifically Ireland's needs-based approach. </p></reply>

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries. It was welcome that the draft Declaration adopted at the EU-Western Balkans Summit this year contained a clear signal of the continuing priority afford by the EU to the Enlargement dossier and to achieving early progress in advancing the accession process. </p>  <p>  Serbia and Montenegro, which remain front-runners in terms of EU accession, both  need to increase the dynamism in their reform agenda. </p>  <p>  Both North Macedonia and Albania have clearly fulfilled the conditions necessary to commence accession negotiations. In our view, the negotiating frameworks for both countries should be agreed and Intergovernmental Conferences held as soon as possible to start the accession process. </p>  <p>  Kosovo is a potential candidate for Membership of the EU. The Commission&rsquo;s report on Kosovo in 2021 noted that the political situation there remains challenging. </p>  <p>  The EU has clearly set out the fourteen priority areas for reform which need to be progressed, if Bosnia and Herzegovina is to advance on its European path. The country's leaders now need to respond in pursuing the necessary reforms.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.</p></reply>

In this regard, the full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is made available for deployments, within current means and capabilities, as the need arises.</p><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a Joint Task Force (JTF) was established to coordinate the Defence Forces contribution to the whole-of-Government COVID-19 response. It has the authority to draw together, in a joint manner, the contribution of all of the elements of the Defence Forces &ndash; Army, Air Corps, Naval Service, Reserve, etc, under a single command structure. This was provided for in a Defence Forces Regulation signed by and under my authority as Minister for Defence.</p><p>The priority of the Defence Forces Joint Task Force from the beginning of the Covid 19 pandemic has been to provide support to the Health Service Executive (HSE), while retaining, at all times, a contingent capacity to provide Aid to the Civil Power support.</p><p>To date, the Defence Forces personnel have provided significant supports in response to the Covid-19 crisis, with in excess of 112,000 personnel days and there have 22,700 instances of Defence Forces vehicles being deployed in an extensive range of supports from the Defence Forces.  This has provided surge support to our health services through bolstering their capacity and providing them with the additional resiliency needed to respond to the Covid 19 pandemic. The wide range of supports that the Defence Forces have provided to the HSE, as coordinated by the Joint Task Force during the COVID-19 crisis included:</p><p>- operation of the COVID-19 testing centre at the Aviva stadium; </p><p>- support for contact tracing efforts;transportation by the Air Corps of COVID-19 tests to Germany;</p><p>- collection of PPE from more than 260 cargo flights and the ongoing storage and distribution of this PPE to various HSE sites;</p><p>- support for HSE testing efforts including through deployment of Naval Service vessels to Dublin, Cork and Galway; </p><p>- PPE training to workers at Cork and Waterford harbours by Naval service personnel;</p><p>- provision of tentage and marshalling support at various HSE testing sites around the country;</p><p>- transportation of patients for testing;</p><p>- a range of non clinical and administrative supports in a number of residential care home facilities; </p><p>- assistance with the fit out of temporary facilities for the HSE (for example, the HSE facilities at City West and the University of Limerick);</p><p>- production and assembly of PPE using 3D printing facilities; and</p><p>- the use of lands at Ballymullen Barracks as a COVID-19 testing facility and contact tracing hub.</p><p><b>Vaccination Programme</b></p><p>The Defence Forces provided logistical and operational planning advice for the national vaccination programme.  </p><p>Vaccinator support has been provided by the Defence Forces across a number of vaccination centres and Long Term Residential Care settings. </p><p>Through the Joint Task Force, the Defence Forces has also supported the rollout of the vaccination programme through:</p><p>- Marshalling, administration, logistical and security supports at a number of vaccination sites</p><p>- Secure storage supports</p><p>- Transportation of vaccinators in adverse weather conditions</p><p>- Transportation of vaccines by air at the request of the National Ambulance Service. </p><p><b>Mandatory Quarantine Scheme (MQS) </b></p><p>The Department of Health was the competent authority and had overall responsibility for implementation and operation of the system of MQS in accordance with the Health (Amendment) Act 2021 and associated regulations.</p><p>It had been agreed that the Defence Forces, acting in an Aid to Civil Authority role, would provide 24/7 assistance and support to the new mandatory quarantine requirements for passengers arriving from &lsquo;designated states&rsquo; in accordance with the Health (Amended) Act 2021 through fulfilling the role of the State Liaison Officer.  This role provided for the day to day oversight and quality assurance of the Mandatory Quarantine System. The Defence Forces role was confined to designated airports, ferry ports and at mandatory quarantine facilities.</p><p>A Service Level Agreement was put in place between the Department of Health and the Department of Defence for the provision of the Defence Forces support to the Covid 19 MQS.  </p><p>Under this SLA, the roles fulfilled by the Defence Forces under the State Liaison Official function were:</p><p>- Overarching State Liaison Official (SLO) role. The DF provided a senior officer to hold the appointment of the SLO who was the official representative of the State for the MHQS.

An independent Commission on the Defence Forces was subsequently established by Government in December 2020, with a mandate to report within 12 months.  The Government also approved the terms of reference, based on the Programme for Government, and the membership of the Commission.The Commission&rsquo;s overall approach is guided and informed by both the White Paper on Defence 2015 and the White Paper Update 2019.  The work of the Commission will inform the future development of the Defence Forces and encompasses the following matters;</p><p><i>- Structure and size of the Defence Forces encompassing consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing. </i></p><p><i>- Leveraging the capabilities of the Reserve Defence Force in their supports to the Permanent Defence Force and make service in the RDF more attractive.</i></p><p><i>- Governance and high level command and control structures in the Defence Forces. </i></p><p><i>- The evolution of remuneration systems and structures in the Defence Forces. </i></p><p><i>- A strategic perspective on HR policies and associated strategies, recruitment, retention and career progression.  </i></p><p>As part of a broad consultation process, the Commission invited submissions from individuals and organisations on matters  related to its terms of reference. The Commission received nearly 500 submissions, all of which have been published on their website, together with an initial report on the public consultation.</p><p>The Commission has been established as an independent body and, while it is a matter entirely for the  Commission, I understand that the Commission has met with a broad stakeholder group including the Defence Forces Representative Associations, commissioned and enlisted members of the Defence Forces, senior officials and personnel from my Department and the Defence Forces as well as other groups.  Site visits to military locations by members of the Commission have taken place at a number of barracks across the country.</p><p>The Chairman of the Commission Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll also met with members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in April to discuss the on-going work of the Commission.  The Commission also held two webinars, one in conjunction with the Royal Irish Academy (RIA) and one in conjunction with the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA). </p><p>The establishment of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces underpins the Government's commitment to ensuring that the  Defence Forces are fit for purpose, both in terms of meeting immediate requirements and also in terms of seeking to develop a longer term vision beyond 2030.</p><p>The Commission is mandated to submit its report by the end of the year and  I look forward to receiving it. The Commission has not submitted any interim reports.</p></reply>

From the 13th to the 17th September the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company endured almost continuous attack. At the end of the Siege, the men were taken into captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961. </p><p>The issue of awarding of Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) and Distinguished Service Medals (DSMs) to a number of personnel who served in Jadotville in September 1961 has been considered on a number of occasions over the years and a range of actions have taken place to give due recognition to the courage and bravery of all the members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35<sup>th</sup>Infantry Battalion who were stationed in Jadotville in 1961.  </p><p>Notwithstanding the actions that have been taken to date to recognise and honour the valiant actions and bravery of all of the men stationed at Jadotville sixty years ago, an Independent Review Group (IRG) was established to examine and report on matters relating to recommendations for military medals relating to events at Jadotville.The IRG completed its research in July and has submitted its report to the Chief of Staff, as the convening authority.  The Chief of Staff has submitted the report to my Office along with his advice.  The work of the Independent Review Group has now concluded.  </p><p>The IRG made a number of recommendations in their report including a recommendation that the 60th anniversary of Jadotville be commemorated.  Other recommendations relate to the awarding of medals, veterans affairs and honouring the role of families and the support they provided to veterans.  All recommendations have been considered at a high level.  </p><p>The deeply unsettling aftermath of Jadotville is detailed in the report as is the lack of personal welfare supports afforded to the men following events at Jadotville, their period in captivity and upon their return home. I have apologised to veterans and to their families on behalf of the State and the Government to the men of &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company, 35<sup>th</sup>Infantry Battalion and to their families for the lack of necessary supports or deserved recognition of their valiant service on their return from the Congo and for the many issues that arose as a result, some of which had tragic consequences.  I have also acknowledged that the lack of supports in place at that time is extremely regrettable.  There have been great steps in the intervening years to support Defence Forces personnel, their families and veterans through the work of the Defence Forces personnel support services.</p><p>As a<b></b>matter relating to the IRG recommendations is currently before the courts, it would not be appropriate for me to provide any further information in relation to the various recommendations made by the IRG at this time.</p></reply>

The maintenance is at 2,400 flight hour interval checks, commonly referred to as &lsquo;C&rsquo; checks which usually occur at intervals of 2.5 to 3 years and take place at the Airbus manufacturing facility in Spain. This has been the practice since the aircraft were introduced into operational service in 1994 and is not linked to technical staffing levels. As the fleet size is 2 aircraft it would be inefficient to provide resources to conduct this specific type of maintenance in Casement Aerodrome given the relevant infrequent interval. All other flight hour and calendar interval maintenance inputs are conducted at Casement Aerodrome by Air Corps technical personnel. Given the age of these aircraft, the cost of these maintenance inspections is around &euro;1M per maintenance visit, but largely depends on the work scope undertaken during inspection.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available so that they can fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

Leadership Training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensure that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations. Skills Training ensures that Defence Forces personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills. Career Training, and education, provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels. Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together, to develop integrated and coherent combat forces.</p><p>The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training required to meet operational output and capability development requirements. </p><p>The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms of the organisation against best military and academic practice. Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners. Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p><p>The Defence Forces deliver military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards and engage with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning.

Naval Service ships which are beyond their originally projected thirty (30) year asset life, are drydocked for inspection every year, in order to manage ageing hull risk.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the capital maintenance programme for drydocks detailed above, Naval Service ships are required to undertake planned routine and non-routine maintenance on plant and machinery every day, 365 days a year, regardless of whether the vessel is on patrol, or alongside the Naval Base off Sailing Order. </p>  <p>  The White Paper on Defence sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service, including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels. This programme of works has been completed on L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n and that ship has returned to operations, while works have commenced on L&Eacute; Niamh.</p>  <p>  The Defence Equipment Development Plan EDP provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment  acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas.</p>  <p>  The replacement of the flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi-role vessel, MRV, is an important element of the EDP and is provided for in the Government's National Development Plan as a major capital project. It is the intention that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks.</p>  <p>  Following a public tender competition, Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of the MRV. This work is now underway and will inform a public tender competition in due course.</p>  <p>  Projects for other vessel replacements are being considered over the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence in the context of overall capability development and funding along with the overall EDP process.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have a modern and effective range of equipment in order to fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government. </p></reply>

In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and to acquire two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in response to the Covid 19 situation. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was signed with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced air capabilities.  </p>  <p>  The Air Corps operate a wide variety of aircraft and equipment, which are selected on the basis of detailed in-depth and rigorous selection and evaluation process. Part of the acquisitions process looks at the operational reliability and performance of such equipment to meet the required performance. Aircraft possess relevant military or civilian type certification and as such, any equipment carried is in accordance with manufacturer&rsquo;s requirements and certain required standards.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the General Officer Commanding Air Corps publishes an annual audit plan which pertains to a number of different strands from flight safety, maintenance quality assurance and flight operations. Air Corps aircraft routinely operate in civilian airspace both, domestically and internationally and at all times conform to the prevailing international standards as it may pertain to aircraft equipment and navigation systems. Equipment and systems are checked and continuously approved by both the Air Corps technical staff and by commercial technical staff if aircraft are undergoing maintenance with the original equipment manufacturer. Similarly, Air Corps crews are trained in synthetic training devices (simulators) on a regular basis and this includes periodic checks by external third party approved training organisations to ensure ongoing competence and that international standards with respect to the operation of such equipment and systems are met. </p>  <p>  All Air Corps aircraft are equipped with the most up to date navigational equipment as appropriate. The CASA C235 aircraft have received midlife upgrades in relation to certain safety and navigation equipment that was not available at the time of manufacture in the early 1990s which included the installation of traffic awareness and collision avoidance systems, enhanced ground proximity warning systems and upgraded Flight Navigation System. These aircraft will be replaced by the new Airbus C295 aircraft which are scheduled for delivery in 2023. These new aircraft, when delivered, will be equipped with a contemporary and comprehensive navigational system. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them in order to ensure that they can fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

The equipment planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology, including communications equipment and technology and this is an ongoing process. When procuring all Defence Forces equipment, the process involves appropriately qualified Defence Forces personnel who ensure the relevant national and international standards for military equipment are taken into account and met, where applicable. </p>  <p>  I am advised by the military authorities that  General Routine Order (GRO) 05/2015 &lsquo;Health and Safety Management in the Defence Forces&rsquo; sets out the Defence Forces health and safety risk management system, which is designed to control risk and continually improve health and safety risk performance through proactive and effective health and safety risk management. The Defence Forces Policy on Work Equipment is one such policy, outlined in part 6 of the GRO. This policy itself describes the Defence Forces methodology for the assessment of risk arising from work equipment. It provides guidance for military personnel, civilian employees and other relevant persons on the risk assessment process and control measures to be implemented to reduce the risk of injury from work equipment to a level that is as low as is reasonably practicable.  Periodic equipment inspections are an intrinsic element of routine military unit activities; this includes user level, health and safety type checks and Ordnance technical type inspections to ensure that equipment is maintained to an operational state at all times.</p>  <p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Defence Forces have the necessary policies and procedures in place in line with best international practice in order to ensure the highest standards of health and safety in respect of the use of equipment to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government, and that such policies and procedures are kept under review.</p></reply>

In the 2020/21 school year over 114,100 children, including over 14,700 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country at a cost of over &euro;224.7m in 2020. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability.</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the Department&rsquo;s School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, children are eligible for school transport where they have special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability and are attending the nearest recognised school/class that is resourced to meet their special educational needs. Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers.</p>  <p>  In certain cases, the Department also provides funding to schools for the employment of escorts to accompany children whose care and safety needs require this level of support while they travel to and from school.</p>  <p>  The pupil referred to by the Deputy is eligible under the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs and has been accommodated on a service since the 2018/19 school year.

Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  </p>  <p>  NEPS understands dyslexia in the context the severity and persistence of an individual&rsquo;s needs over time and their response to intervention.  This approach aligns with the new Special Educational model in schools which focuses on the identification of need and the matching of specific interventions to that need.  Specific interventions are therefore tailored, by the school, to the individual&rsquo;s observed needs by the school, rather than being generic to a specific difficulty or disability. </p>  <p>  The Department also provides for special schools and special class placements where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.  Special classes attached to mainstream primary schools also support the needs of pupils with dyslexia.  Such classes have a reduced pupil/teacher ratio of 9:1 and an increased level of capitation grant.   </p>  <p>  Funding is available to schools under the assistive technology scheme for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. </p>  <p>  Schools apply to the NCSE, through their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) for such support.  SENOs make recommendations to the Department where assistive technology is required, in accordance with the criteria set out in the Department's Circular 0010/2013.  </p>  <p>  The Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally regarding pupils' education.  Should a parent be dissatisfied with the manner in which supports have been provided to support their child's education they should raise this matter directly with their school Principal or the Board of Management of the school.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's present or future educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

These include a major expansion of the Primary Schools Substitute Teacher Supply Panels, which now employ almost 380 teachers and provide substitute cover to over 2,500 primary schools across the country. A review of the supply panels has taken place and approximately 100 additional teachers are being added to existing/new areas where significant challenges have been demonstrated in sourcing substitution.  Posts have been allocated to the base schools to allow arrangements for the recruitment of additional staff immediately. </p><p>The Supply Panels work alongside the existing methods of sourcing substitute teachers, such as the national substitution portal service Sub Seeker, operated by the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network and developed in accordance with my Department's Teacher Supply Action Plan. Schools can also make local arrangements to have their own regular substitutes to call on if needed.</p><p>In addition to the expansion of the supply panels, schools have been asked to combine their allocation of principal release days into clusters so as to form a full-time fixed-term post to cover each school's principal release days  </p><p>For the current school year, changes have been made to the career break scheme to permit teachers on career break to carry out unlimited substitute work. Changes have also been made to the Job Sharing Scheme to permit job sharing teachers carry out substitute work on the days they are rostered off in their own or in other schools. </p><p>The Teaching Council have undertaken a communications campaign to contact the 111,700 teachers on its register to raise awareness to the current teacher substitute challenges and to ask those teachers where possible to make themselves available for substitution in schools and to register on SubSeeker.ie so that schools are aware of their availability when seeking to fill substitute vacancies.  </p><p>The Council and my Department have also engaged with higher education institutions, who have been requested to be flexible in programme delivery to enhance the availability of PME student teachers to undertake substitution work. PME students have also been advised to register with the Teaching Council and to register with Sub Seeker.  </p><p>My Department will continue to engage with the education stakeholders on the issues raised about the current difficulty in accessing substitutes for teacher absences.  </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits the Government to use this research into the cost of disability to individuals and families to properly inform the direction of future policy. </p>  <p>  This matter is significantly wider than the income support system which is why a whole-of-Government perspective is being taken. There is not a single typical &lsquo;cost of disability&rsquo;, rather there is a spectrum from low additional costs to extremely high extra costs of disability, depending on the individual circumstances of the person with a disability. Additional costs of disability go across a number of areas of expenditure including housing; equipment, aids and appliances; mobility, transport and communications; medicines; care and assistance services and additional living expenses.</p>  <p>  The report has been received and my Department has been considering it in detail. As part of this consideration, the Department briefed and sought the views of relevant Government departments which have a role to play in the delivery of disability services and supports. </p>  <p>  This process is now complete and I intend to submit the report to Government for consideration shortly. A decision regarding the appropriate date of publication will be made once Government has had an opportunity to consider the report fully.</p>  <p>  The supports and services for people with a disability are continually reviewed by my Department. As part of Budget 2022, I announced a number of improvements, including specific changes to Disability Allowance and the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS), as follows:</p>  <p>  -  &euro;5 increase in the maximum weekly rate of Disability Allowance, with proportionate increases for people receiving a reduced rate.</p>  <p>  -  An increase in the earnings threshold above which means is fully assessed by &euro;25 from &euro;350 to &euro;375 per week, for Disability Allowance (and Blind Pension), effective from June 2022. </p>  <p>  -  An increase in the general weekly means disregard entry point for Disability Allowance from &euro;2.50 to &euro;7.60. Increasing this to &euro;7.60 will bring the  weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance in line with Blind Pension, One Parent Family and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance. The effect of this measure will be to increase the weekly rate of payment by up to &euro;5 per week for Disability Allowance recipients who have means.</p>  <p>  -  The Wage Subsidy Scheme base subsidy paid to employers who employ people with a disability will increase from &euro;5.30 to &euro;6.30 per hour from January 2022. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Tusla assesses the information received and the child and family&rsquo;s situation, and provides appropriate social work intervention and family support services. Where necessary in the best interest of the child,  children are received into the care of Tusla.  </p>  <p>  Tusla has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team which produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services. The reports are published on Tusla's website and are scrutinised by my officials. Issues of note are brought to my attention. The reports provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlight challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers. Most recent reports indicate that 89% (5,233/5,851) of children in care nationally had an allocated social worker at the end of Q2 2021; down three percentage points from Q1 2021 (92%).  </p>  <p>  Additionally, Tusla child protection and welfare, and alternative care services are inspected against the relevant Standards and Regulations by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). These inspection reports are also published, and the findings used to inform the development and improvement of services within Tusla.  Most inspections are generally positive, and reflect both examples of good practice and dedicated staff. However, some reports identify challenges, within individual areas, to maintaining a consistently high standard of service, including the impact of staffing shortages, and difficulties in finding appropriate placements for children and young people.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement. The recruitment and retention of social workers is a priority for Tusla, and in that regard there is a significant amount of work being done, both by Tusla and my officials, to increase the recruitment of social workers.  </p></reply>

ODVSS has received an allocation of approximately &euro;247,000 in 2021 to support their important work. This amount is inclusive of additional funding to address service pressures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has allowed for this service to operate at weekends. In relation to a dedicated refuge, there is no purpose built refuge facility in County Offaly at present, but women can avail of emergency domestic violence accommodation in Counties Kildare and Westmeath, where there are two refuges supported by Tusla.

The guidance provides for larger numbers where all participants are fully vaccinated and also states a preference for outdoor provision or smaller group work where these are viable options.</p><p>The Department has worked with youth services throughout the duration of the ongoing pandemic to ensure that young people, especially those who are vulnerable, continue to receive necessary supports to the greatest degree possible. In recent weeks, many services had continued to be delivered in a variety of ways, some remotely, some outdoor when weather permitted, and some, with strict regard to public health guidance, through indoor work using multiple pods, be it that until recently, each pod was made up of a maximum of six young people. Larger pods will now assist services to reach young people and support their attendance.</p><p>The Department has worked closely with key youth sector representatives to provide sector-specific guidance in line with the <i>Government&rsquo;s Resilience &amp;amp; Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19 </i>and <i>Reframing the Challenge: Continuing our Recovery and Reconnecting</i>to ensure that young people continue to be supported in a manner consistent with evolving public health guidance and to address other issues arising in the sector as a result of Covid-19.  </p><p>As we move beyond the pandemic, I am committed to continuing to support this important sector, which has enormous value to the many young people involved and from a broader social and economic viewpoint.</p></reply>

Once this examination is concluded the report will be submitted to Government for consideration in advance of its publication (pending agreement with the European Commission as the contracting authority).</p>  <p>  I have also been engaging with Government colleagues in relation to future funding for this sector as we work towards Government consideration of the report and decision on the key issues.</p>  <p>  In terms of funding, in advance of and since the publication of the 2016 a significant programme of re-investment in higher education has been implemented.  Since 2015 annual expenditure allocated to higher education has increased by more than 40%.  In 2022 this allocation will be in excess of &euro;2billion</p>  <p>  This significant allocation of public resources is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to meeting the funding needs of the higher education sector.</p></reply>

Combatting it is, and will continue to be, a priority for this Government.</p><p>Significant efforts are being made by the Government at home and with our partners abroad to combat human trafficking.  Ireland and our partners are active on this issue in international fora including the UN, Council of Europe, OSCE and the European Union. </p><p>Over the past year we have introduced significant measures to combat trafficking, to create a more victim-centred approach to identifying and supporting victims, and to raise awareness and provide training, such as:</p><p>- The approval by Government last May to revise the National Referral Mechanism framework  to make it easier for victims of trafficking to come forward, to be identified and to access advice, accommodation and support;</p><p>- The drafting of a new National Action Plan on Human Trafficking;</p><p>- The development of training, through NGOs, targeting front line staff in industries such as hospitality, airline and shipping who may come into contact with trafficked persons;</p><p>- The improvements being made to the Criminal Justice System to support victims through the implementation of <i>Supporting a Victim's Journey</i>;</p><p>- The launch of a new awareness raising campaign last month in partnership with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to build on the success of previouscampaigns:</p><p>- An increase in funding for supporting victims of crime generally and increased funding dedicated specifically to supporting victims of trafficking.</p><p>In addition to highlighting the ongoing work underway to combat human trafficking and support those who are victims of it, it is also important to note the significance of the recent sentences for human trafficking handed down by the Courts and to acknowledge the dedication of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in investigating and tackling this hideous crime.</p><p>Human trafficking cases are complex and it can be challenging to secure convictions, for a range of reasons including difficulties in securing sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of coercion or deception of the victim.</p><p>The majority of victims of human trafficking are vulnerable and traumatised by their experience. Estimating the prevalence of human trafficking is difficult due to the clandestine nature of the crime, its overlap with other illegal activities and there can be a reluctance on the part of victims to report the crime, often due to the trauma they have suffered. In some instances, victims may also be concerned about potential repercussions that reporting human trafficking might have for their extended family.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, the changes we propose making to the National Referral Mechanism acknowledge that, in addition to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, other state bodies and NGOs have a role in identifying victims of human trafficking and linking them in with the various supports and services available.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is excellent in its role as our competent authority for identifying victims but we know some victims, because of interactions they may have had with law enforcement officials in other countries, have a perception that police cannot be trusted. We want to be sure that every victim of trafficking who ends up in Ireland is identified and helped. That&rsquo;s why we are proposing to provide a role for other State and non-state organisations in the identification of victims of trafficking.</p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has committed significant resources to the investigation and prosecution of human trafficking in Ireland. A specialised Garda Unit, the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit (HTICU), has been in place since 2009 to conduct investigations into human trafficking. It also provides advice, support and where necessary, operational assistance to investigations at district level. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also active in relation to trafficking gangs through work targeting organised crime - targeting their finances, their use of the internet and by working closely with other jurisdictions. </p><p>A High Level Group established in November 2019, which includes An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, my Department and the Office of the DPP, meets regularly and keeps the legislative and operational framework for investigation and prosecution of trafficking under review.</p><p>Between 2009 and 2020 there were 713 victims of human trafficking recognised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including 494 females. </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the decision about whether or not to prosecute a person, and for what crime, is entirely a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions and I, as Minister, have no role in such matters.</p></reply>

An international agreement between Ireland and the UK establishing the Independent Reporting Commission was signed in Dublin on 13 September 2016 and it was given effect to by legislation in both jurisdictions.</p>  <p>  In summary, the Commission&rsquo;s functions are to report annually on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland; report on the implementation of the relevant measures of the three administrations; and to consult with relevant stakeholders in this regard. </p>  <p>  The Commission submitted its first report to the Governments in 2018, the second in 2019, and the third last year. As the Deputy will be aware, the two Governments have published the Commission's first three reports and the fourth report is due in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland have welcomed the reports. They provide an opportune reminder of the continuing adverse impact of paramilitarism on society in Northern Ireland. The Reports set out a pathway to achieving progress both through the policing and criminal justice response and a response to the wider socio-economic factors that exist in the communities where paramilitaries continue to operate. The Commission refers to this as the twin track approach. This requires a whole of Government focus and the Commissioners are encouraged that that is reflected in the second phase of the Tackling Paramilitarism Programme in Northern Ireland which runs to 2024.  </p>  <p>  The Commission, in their Reports, note the extent and effectiveness of the co-operation between the Authorities in both jurisdictions to tackle paramilitary activity and associated criminality.</p>  <p>  As well as reminding us of what needs to be done to tackle paramilitarism, the reports also point to the steady progress on the 43 Actions set out in the Executive Action Plan for Tackling Paramilitary Activity. Reporting on the vast majority of the actions falls to the Tackling Paramilitarism Programme Team located at the Northern Ireland Department of Justice. A small number of the actions apply to actions and commitments made by the UK and Irish Governments as part of the Action Plan. Every year the Governments update the Commission on these actions. </p>  <p>  In each report, the Commission also makes a number of recommendations and these are reported on in the following years.   </p>  <p>  I, as Minister for Justice, and my predecessor have met with the Commission to hear about the progress the Commission has been making in carrying out its functions and to provide any assistance this Government can offer to achieve its task. These meetings with members of the Commission have always been very informative and constructive.  The Commission has been very active in pursuing its remit and has had a wide engagement with a range of relevant stakeholders, both North and South. Although it is evident that much productive work has taken place in the last few years, it is clear that more needs to be done. </p>  <p>  I look forward to receiving the Commission's fourth report.</p></reply>

This application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>  <p>  It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay. However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time. </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing.</p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times.</p>  <p>  This year, we are on track to deliver approximately 11,000 decisions, significantly exceeding the levels achieved in the last two years.

However, the nature of the naturalisation process is such that, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. In some instances, completing the necessary checks can take a considerable period of time.  </p>  <p>  In addition, the combined impact of the 2019 High Court judgment in the Jones case and the necessary health restrictions arising from the pandemic, has resulted in the processing time for standard applications increasing. </p>  <p>  However, my Department is taking a number of steps to speed up the processing of applications and a number of digitisation measures have also been introduced to increase efficiency in the process, including eTax clearance, eVetting and online payments. The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up more staff to focus on processing applications in a timely and efficient manner, to improve service to our customers and reduce waiting times. This year, we are on track to deliver approximately 11,000 decisions, significantly exceeding the levels achieved in the last two years. Additional staff have also been assigned to the citizenship team.  Based on these measures, my Department's objective is to achieve an improved timeframe of 6-9 months for decisions on a majority of applications during 2022.  </p></reply>

As certain members of the representative organisation and I are on opposing sides of the extant litigation, it is not appropriate for me to meet with the representatives, in these circumstances.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that following an Irish Government decision in January 1975, the Government granted an ex-gratia sum equivalent to 4 times the German lump-sum and an ex-gratia monthly allowance for life equal to the German monthly allowance, to each of the Irish children found to have thalidomide related injuries.  There are currently 29 Irish people in receipt of ex-gratia monthly payments from the Department of Health.  The annual figure for the Irish monthly payments ranges from &euro;6,175 to &euro;13,313 for each individual.  The rate of payment is related to each survivor&rsquo;s level of thalidomide related injury.</p>  <p>  The German monthly payments are made by the Contergan Foundation, which is established under German legislation.  From 1 August 2013, the Foundation substantially increased its monthly payments to thalidomide survivors, including Irish survivors.  Both the German payments and the Irish ex-gratia payments made to the survivors are exempt from tax, including DIRT and are not reckonable as means for the purpose of Social Welfare payments.  The rate of payment is related to the survivors' level of thalidomide related injury.</p>  <p>  In addition to the initial lump-sum and monthly payments for life, the supports provided by the Irish State to each Irish survivor include a medical card on an administrative basis regardless of means, provision of appliances, artificial limbs, equipment, housing adaptations and access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social services.  There is a designated senior manager in the Health Service Executive who liaises with Irish thalidomide survivors and assists them to access supports towards their ongoing health and personal social service needs.</p>  <p>  Work is underway in the Department to bring forward Heads of a Bill to provide these health and personal social supports on a statutory basis to Irish thalidomide survivors. While it is not possible at this stage to provide a timeframe for these legislative proposals, the Government is committed to the ongoing support of Irish thalidomide survivors.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the German Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013 it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide related injury.  It is open to any Irish person to apply to the Foundation for assessment of their disability as being attributable to thalidomide.  Any Irish person who establishes that their injury is attributable to thalidomide will be offered appropriate supports by the Irish Government, commensurate with those currently provided to Irish thalidomide survivors.</p></reply>

From the range of contracts that Ireland has entered into, some of the vaccines have yet to be granted regulatory approval, and final dose quantities and delivery schedules for these have yet to be confirmed. Ireland's existing contractual commitments for currently authorised vaccines are being used and will underpin the continued rollout of the booster programme over the coming months. </p></reply>

The establishment of such an Office requires primary legislation. </p>  <p>  I am happy to advise the Deputy that, in April this year, ahead of the deadline of 1st May 2021, I signed Statutory Instrument No. 198 of 2021 to transpose the UTP Directive directly into Irish law. This was done as an interim measure as it was not possible to enact the primary legislation establishing the Office of National Food Ombudsman, or equivalent, before the May transposition deadline. </p>  <p>  Also as an interim measure, I established the UTP Enforcement Authority in my Department pending the finalisation of the primary legislation being prepared to establish the new Office. </p>  <p>  This Enforcement Authority has been assigned all of the necessary legal powers to investigate complaints from suppliers, including primary producers, to carry out investigations on its own initiative and to initiate legal proceedings for breaches of the Unfair Trading Practices defined in the Directive. </p>  <p>  With regard to the establishment of the new Office of Food Ombudsman or equivalent, the General Scheme of the Bill for the primary legislation is currently being prepared. </p>  <p>  As part of those preparations, consideration is being given to the submissions made in response to the public consultation held by the Department earlier this year, as well as to whether the provisions of the UTP Directive need to be extended and to the price and market analysis function of the office. </p>  <p>  Once the primary legislation is finalised and the new Office is established, the process for appointing the Head of the Office will be commenced and the Enforcement Authority functions will transfer to the new Office in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government. In the meantime, it is open to suppliers to engage with the Enforcement Authority on any concerns they may have in relation to unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  I am fully committed to ensuring that the Programme for Government commitment is implemented as quickly as possible and I am pleased to say that, as announced in the details of Budget 2022, an indicative &euro;4 million has been provided in the estimates for the establishment of the new Office. </p>  <p>  I believe that the Regulations I introduced in April are a significant step in progressing towards a more even playing field for our agricultural and food suppliers, providing them with a service that they can avail of with regard to unfair trading practices.</p></reply>

Under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 2006, all operational issues of this nature are exclusively for the SFPA and the Naval Service.  As Minister, I am precluded from getting involved in operational control matters such as this.</p>  <p>  The standard position, under the Common Fisheries Policy, is that fish must be weighed on the pier. Member States can apply for a derogation to weigh the fish away from the pier and that application must be accompanied by a Control Plan providing necessary levels of assurance to the Commission if they are to decide to grant the derogation. It is at the discretion of the Commission whether or not they grant the derogation. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission decision to revoke Ireland&rsquo;s Control plan in respect of weighing states that operators did not have in place a &ldquo;weighing system fit for purpose&rdquo;, as provided for under point 5 of the control plan and the audit identified manipulation of weighing systems. Moreover, although aware of those shortcomings, Ireland did not take appropriate measures to address such non-compliance, in particular by withdrawing the permission to weigh after transport as foreseen in point 8 of the control plan. Consequently, the control plan does not minimise the risk of systematic manipulation of weighing pelagic catches in Ireland and the under-declaration of catches by operators.</p>  <p>  The SFPA submitted a revised draft Control Plan to the EU Commission for review and approval on 22nd September 2021. A new draft plan must be accepted by the Commission and formally adopted by it under its legislation &ndash; an EU Commission Decision. Subsequently, the SFPA have advised that it has had comprehensive engagement with DG Mare on the plan.  The SFPA advised that it has met industry representatives recently and updated them on the discussions with DG Mare.  </p>  <p>  During Commissioner Virginius Sinkevicius visit to Killybegs recently, representatives of the fishing industry set out the challenges facing the industry in the absence of a control plan that would allow weighing of fish in factories.  In my discussions with the Commissioner, during this visit, I asked him to give as much priority as possible to the Commission&rsquo;s examination of Ireland&rsquo;s draft control plan given the real challenges currently being faced by the industry. The Commissioner and his officials have been made fully aware of the considerations around the timing of any control plan approval, given the commencement of the pelagic fishing season in January 2022. </p>  <p>  I will keep the lines of communication open with Commissioner Sinkevicius over the coming weeks so that he understands the challenges that would practically arise if a new Control plan is not in place for the beginning of the 2022 pelagic season.</p></reply>

However, due to the Covid 19 pandemic, my Department was required to refocus its priorities in order to develop a number of support schemes for community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises, including the Stability Fund and the CSP Support Fund, to help organisations who required additional assistance during the crisis period.  On 15th November last, I was pleased to announce the approval of a further &euro;1m extension of the CSP Support Fund, to provide further assistance to those organisations most in need.</p><p>Pending the transition to the new restructured programme, the scheme is closed to new applications through the expression of interest process.  However, there are a number of organisations with plans currently under consideration, and if approved, they will be supported under the programme from January to April 2022 onwards. In addition, it is anticipated that the Programme will open calls to address identified gaps in service delivery in 2022.</p></reply>
